The Prentice judgment was a nullity as against the plaintiff, for the reason that the court never acquired jurisdiction of her, either by the service of process upon her or by authorized appearance. The complaint was never served upon her; she never appeared in the action by any person as her attorney ; she never authorized any person or attorney to appear for her ; she never authorized any person or persons to employ or authorize an attorney on her behalf to appear in said action. The suit was commenced without her knowledge ; she never had any knowledge of any proceedings therein or that any attorney had claimed to appear for her therein, and she had no knowledge of the entry of the judgment until on or about the 28th day of June, 1886. Assuming the facts to be true, as stated as to the plaintiff Cornelia Gilman, the Prentice judgment and all the subsequent proceedings based thereon, are utterly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>void. I submit that so far as this question is concerned, it is a matter of no consequence whether Mrs. Gilman' did or did not have a defence to the claim upon which Prentice brought the suit. This is a question to be settled when she is properly brought before the court, and it cannot be possible that any person can be deprived of their property or estate by legal proceedings as to which the party never had any notice, either actual or constructive.

Where the tenant from the peculiar circumstances of the case, is precluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>from setting up his defence before the justice, an injunction will be granted. Baker <em>v, </em>Hammersley, 16 <em>How. </em>461 ;.1 <em>Civil Pro., R. </em>(note), 429. As the Prentice judgment had been assigned to the defendant, Preble Tucker, who was not a party to the original Prentice suit, the plaintiff had no remedy open to her in that suit which would reach the defendant, Preble Tucker. Her only* remedy was in equity and by injunction in such an action as this to restrain the defendant, Preble Tucker, as well as tho plaintiff in the original suit. We submit that no injury can result to the defendant Preble Tucker, for continuing this injunction until the trial of this action. On the contrary, if the injunction should be vacated the summary proceedings in the District Court would be at once reinstated and an attempt made by the defendant Tucker to get possession of the .premises, basing his action upon the Prentice judgment, which, as is hereinbefore shown, was not taken by service of process upon her or by her appearance, and as to which she had no knowledge until about the 28th of June, 1886.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-5\">ITT. A court of equity has power to grant relief against a judgment procured by fraud. See decision of the Court of Appeals, rendered in 1854_ by Justice W. L. Allen, who says, at page 164, (Dobson <em>v. </em>Pearce, 12 <em>N. Y. </em>157.): \u201c The jurisdiction of the court in which a judgment has been recovered is, however, always open to inquiry, and if it has exceeded its jurisdiction, or has not acquired jurisdiction of the parties by the due service of process, as by a voluntary appearance, the proceedings are <em>coram nonjudice, </em>and the judgment void.\u201d Burton v. Sherman, 20 <em>Weekly Dig. </em>419, holds that there is no distinction between a forged notice of appearance and a notice really given by an attorney not authorized to give it, and that jurisdiction is not acquired in either case. The case was an appeal from an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>denying a motion to vacate a judgment of foreclosure and sale as to Antoinette W. Sherman, on the ground that the court never acquired jurisdiction. The court held that no jurisdiction was ever acquired over the defendant Sherman, and that the responsibility of the attorney does not help to make a case of jurisdiction over a person if the attorney has no power to confer it. This decision was appealed from, and the appeal was dismissed in the Court of Appeals on January 27th, 1885.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-5\">IV. The following authorities support the position of the plaintiff herein : A judgment rendered by a court which had neither jurisdiction of the person nor of the subject matter of the action is absolutely void, and may be treated as a nullity. 4 <em>Wait's Pr. </em>631; Harris <em>v. </em>Hardeman, 14 <em>How. (U. S.), </em>334; Borden <em>v. </em>Fitch, 15 <em>John. </em>121; Phelps <em>v. </em>Baker, 41 <em>How. </em>237 ; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Hoffman, 46 <em>N. Y. </em>30 ; Baldwin <em>v. </em>Kimball, 16 <em>Abb. </em>353 ; Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>253. This last decision was made in the year 1877 by the Court of Appeals of this state, per Rapallo, Justice, who refers with approval to the case of Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks, 6 <em>Rob. </em>198, in which Jones, Justice, uses the following language : \u201c That it is now conceded, at least in this state, that want of jurisdiction will render void the judgment of any court, whether it be of superior or inferior, of general or local jurisdiction, or of record or not, and that the bare recital of jurisdictional facts in the record of a judgment of any court, whether superior or inferior, of general or limited jurisdiction, is not conclusive, but only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the truth of the fact recited, and the party against whom a judgment is offered is not by the bare fact of such recitals estopped from showing by affirmative proof that they were untrue, and thus rendering the judgment void for want of jurisdiction.\u201d Rapallo, Justice, referring to this decision of Jones, Justice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>in Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks, uses the following language : \u201c It thus appears that the current of judicial opinion in this state is very strong and uniform in favor of the proposition stated by Jones, Justice, in 6 <em>Rob., </em>198, and, if adopted here, is decisive of the present case. It has not, as yet, however, been directly adjudicated ; and, if sustained, it must rest upon the local law of this state, as it finds no support in adjudications elsewhere. There are reasons, however, founded upon our system of practice, which would warrant us in so holding.\u201d In another part of his opinion, he uses the following language: \u201c That when the judgment has been obtained by fraud, or without bringing the defendant into court, and the want of jurisdiction does not appear upon the face of the record, relief may be obtained in equity.\u201d In deciding this case, the cases of Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols, 42 <em>N. Y. </em>26, and Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes, 6 <em>John. </em>296, were distinguished. White <em>v. </em>Coulter, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>629, holds that a party against whom a judgment by default regular on its face has been taken, but who was not served with the summons, has a legal right to have the judgment vacated. The decision in Ormsby <em>v. </em>Jacques, 12 <em>Hun, </em>443, was made in the year 1877, by the general term, of the second department, per Dykman, Justice. The action was brought to set aside a judgment entered in an action t'o foreclose a mortgage in which the present plaintiffs were defendants. From the judgment roll it appeared that the plaintiffs had appeared therein by an attorney. The plaintiffs claimed that he appeared fraudulently and corruptly and without any authority from them, ' and that they did not know that he had done so until after a sale had been had under the judgment; that neither a summons nor any other paper in the action had been served on them. Dykman. Justice, in deciding the case, cites with approval Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>253, and states that the decis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ion of the court of appeals in Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford is placed on grounds which are inconsistent with the case of Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols. He then cites with approval the decision of the Court of Appeals in Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford, which refers with approval to the decision of the court in Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks. At page 445 the court uses the following language : \u201cWhether the appearance is forged or unauthorized, che court obtains no jurisdiction of the person, and in all such cases relief may be obtained in equity according to the decision of the Court of Appeals in the case of Ferguson.\u201d This case is precisely like the case at bar. It was an equitable action brought to set aside a judgment on the ground that the appearance was unauthorized, and is brought precisely as this case is brought.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b350-5\"><em>Kelly, Tucker &amp; Henderson, </em>attorneys, and <em>Charles J, Hardy, </em>of counsel, for respondent, argued:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-6\">I. This court has no jurisdiction to entertain the cause of action set forth in the complaint, (a) This is an action brought in the superior court to set aside a judgment of the supreme court. No fraud or collusion in procuring the judgment sought to be set aside is alleged, and no reason is given why the action is not brought in the court wherein the judgment was obtained. The jurisdiction of one court to vacate in an independent action the judgment of another court, is in its nature so extraordinary as to demand close adherence to principles and precedents in exercising it. Smith <em>v. </em>Nelson, 62 <em>N. Y. </em>286 ; Helburn <em>v. </em>Rosenson, 2 <em>N. Y. State Rep. </em>618 <em>(Gen\u2019l Term), 1st Dep't. </em>The \u201cprinciples and precedents \u201d upon which the courts have acted in vacating judgments of other courts of competent jurisdictions are, that they will undertake to set aside such judgments only where it can be shown that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>was fraud or collusion in their procurement, and that, upon failure to show such fraud or collusion, they will refuse to interfere. \u201c The power of the supreme court to annul a judgment for fraud in procuring it is undoubted, although the jurisdiction is carefully limited and guarded, and will only be exercised in clear cases.\u201d Andrews, J., in Smith <em>v. </em>Nelson <em>(supra). (b.) </em>Plaintiff\u2019s proper proceeding was by an application in the original action in the supreme court, to have the judgment recovered against her therein by Prentice, set aside for want of service of process upon her. No action in equity will lie to restrain the enforcement of a judgment rendered by a court of record, on the ground that the defendant in the action in which the judgment was obtained was not served with process. The plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law by motion in the original action. Fullan <em>v. </em>Hooper, 18 <em>How. </em>75. A judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be impeached collaterally for error or irregularity, but is conclusive until set aside or reversed by the same court. Dobson <em>v. </em>Pearce, 12 N. <em>Y. </em>156. If a suit has not been regularly commenced defendant must relieve himself from such irregularity by motion. Nones <em>v. </em>Ins. Co., 8 <em>Barb. </em>541. The defendant\u2019s remedy by motion to vacate a judgment without authority, seems to be proper. It has been held in various cases that where a judgment is void, or voidable, the proper way is to move to set it aside or vacate it. Grant <em>v. </em>Vandercook, 57 <em>Barb. </em>175. The remedy of the party is by application for re-trial or other relief in the action wherein the judgment was rendered. Krekler <em>v. </em>Ritter, 62 <em>N. Y. </em>372. This has also been held to be the proper practice in an action similar to the present in Burton <em>v. </em>Sherwood, 20 <em>N. Y. ,W. Dig. </em>419, and the same is held inferentially in Hunter <em>v. </em>Lester, 18 <em>How. </em>347. Also held direct in Runburg <em>v. </em>Johnson, 11 <em>C. P. Repts., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>283 <em>(City Court of Brooklyn, General Term), </em>a ease on all fours with this present case, where it is held explicitly that the remedy is by a direct motion for the interposition of the court rendering the judgment. The question is settled by the decision in Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols, 42 <em>N. Y. </em>26, where the court holds that a judgment against a defendant who was not served with process, and has no knowledge of the suit, but for whom an attorney appeared without authority, cannot be attacked for want of jurisdiction in any collateral proceeding. And holds, also, that the defendant may seek relief from such unauthorized appearance by direct application to the court, Earl, C. J., saying : \u201c I think a party should always seek relief to an unauthorized appearance in the suit in which it has been put in.\u201d And it is submitted that it is so well-settled a rule of law as to require no citation of cases in its support, that a judgment of a court of record having jurisdiction cannot be attacked or impeached in any collateral proceeding. If there really was the error plaintiff complains of, and the facts are as she says they are, why does she not seek to have it remedied by a motion in the supreme court in tho action wherein the judgment was rendered? Section 724 of the Code gives the supreme court the power to correct such error. What right has the plaintiff to ask the superior court to set aside a judgment in an action of which the supreme court had jurisdiction, an action in which all the proceedings were had in the supreme court, and in which, confessedly, there was no fraud practiced upon her by the person recovering the judgment ? The judgment of a court, procured without fraud or collusion, stands until it is vacated either by a court to which an appeal has been taken from it, or by the court which rendered it when that court had jurisdiction to render it. As the learned referee herein says, in his opinion dismissing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>complaint: \u201cThe court has an inherent power over its own records to correct them in furtherance of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-5\">II. Plaintiff shows no cause of action. There is hardly any question that has received such careful consideration from the courts of this state as that involved in the present controversy, viz. : What is the effect of a judgment rendered in an action in which there has been an appearance by an attorney for a party not served with process, and who has not authorized an appearance to be entered for him ; and how far the courts will protect the rights of innocent third parties acquired from a judgment so entered, and without notice of any defect therein. And so frequent have been the adjudications on this subject that the law cannot be regarded as otherwise than established in favor of the innocent third party as against the one immediately harmed by reason of the unauthorized appearance. The rule of the English cases on this point is this : \u201c Where a suit has been regularly commenced, and an attorney appears for defendant, or agrees to appear, without warrant, the plaintiff may proceed to take judgment, and the court will support such judgment, whether it be for a bona fide debt due the plaintiff or not ;r and whether the defendant has a defence or not; and the only remedy the defendant has is an action against the attorney.\u201d And this is substantially the rule of the New York courts. The leading case on this case is Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes, 6 <em>Johns, </em>296, decided by Chancellor Kent in 1810. In that case an attorney of the court appeared for a defendant against whom a writ had been issued, but not served, and, without authority from defendant, confessed a judgment, which was entered up. And it was held that this judgment was regular ; that an appearance by an attorney of the court, without warrant, is good as to the court ; and the party has an action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>the attorney who so wrongfully appeared for him. <em>Aliter </em>if there be any fraud or collusion between the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the defendant\u2019s. The-broad principles of equity, justice and public policy, upon which this decision rests, have been so well recognized that this case of Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes, though often criticised, has never been overruled, and must be regarded as the law on this subject to-day in this state. The adjudications on this subject, in accor-' dance with the rule as stated in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes, are numerous. (The counsel cites and reviews many cases). This doctrine as laid down in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes, is again reasserted and re-affirmed in Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>253. This case is one turning upon the question of a forged notice of appearance, and the court carefully distinguishes it from Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes. The case turns on a totally different point than that on which Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes turned, and this difference between a bona fide and a forged notice of appearance was noted in the old English cases, and commented upon by Van Ness, J., in his dissenting opinion in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes. In Ferguson <em>v. </em>Crawford, Rapallo, J., says : \u201cOn the trial of the present action, the defendants, in support of this defence, put in evidence the judgment roll, in the last-mentioned action, which roll contained a notice of appearance for the present plaintiff, and a consent that judgment be entered, purporting to be signed by Mills (the attorney). The judgment was entered by default, for want of an answer, and on this consent, and recited that the summons had been served on the defendants therein, and that none of them had appeared except the present plaintiff by Mills, his attorney, and some others, etc. Thereupon plaintiff offered to prove : (1) That the signature to the notice of appearance was a forgery. (2) That Mills was never authorized to appear for the plaintiff. (3) That he never did appear. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>fendants rely wholly upon the effect of the recital in the judgment, and the notice of appearance contained in the judgment roll, and claim that in a collateral action these import verity, and cannot be contradicted by extrinsic evidence. None of the principles upon which the decision in Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes and Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols rest can be applied to such a case as this.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b355-5\">By the Court.\u2014Sedgwick, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABd\">The case of Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes, 6 <em>Johns. </em>296, has been approved by the highest court in this state, in particular by Brown <em>v. </em>Nichols, 42 <em>N. Y. </em>26. Against such an approval the dissenting opinion in the latter case cited Robson <em>v. </em>Eaton, 1 <em>Term. </em>62. This last case was an instance of a forged warrant of attorney; and Ferguson v. Crawford, 70 <em>N. Y. </em>253, held that in such a case, no process having been served, the judgment was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In the present case, following Denton <em>v. </em>Noyes, the judgment was not void and was regular when entered; and the appropriate relief for the unauthorized appearance, is by an application to the court by which judgment was given, and the relief given by the court in its discretion, when the attorney appearing is insolvent, would be to allow the defendant to come in and plead. My opinion is that,in this action, the plaintiff could not be relieved of the judgment, as it was in the power alone of the court giving judgment to set aside the judgment. But if this proposition is not correct, the relief that should be given in the action, should be no greater than could be obtained in the court that gave the judgment,\u2014that is, the defendant in the judgment, to entitle herself to relief, should show that she has a defence on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In my opinion there should be an affirmance of the judgment appealed from, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Freedman, J.

On the 7th day of August, 1884, a judgment was entered in the office of the clerk of the city and county of New York in an action in the supreme court of the state of New York, wherein one of the defendants herein, Augustus Prentice, was plaintiff, and the above named Cornelia Oilman, and one Andrew E. Smyth were defendants, for the sum of $1,800.78. The plaintiff herein alleges, that neither the summons nor complaint in said action was ever served upon her ; that she never authorized any attorney to appear for her in said action, and never authorized any person nor persons to employ or authorize any attorney to appear on her behalf. That she never had any knowledge of any proceedings in said action, or that any attorney had claimed to appear for her, until on or about the 28th day of June, 1886 ; that an attorney, without her knowledge and consent, did appear in said action ; that judgment was entered therein as on a default to answer ; that execution was issued on this judgment in favor of the said Prentice; and that, on the 10th day of March, 1885, the premises hereinbefore mentioned were sold under said execution, and at such sale Prentice became the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The plaintiff further alleges, that on the first day of March, 1886, one Mary A. P. Tucker, obtained a judgment against her for the sum of upwards of $10,000. That the above-named defendant Preble Tucker took an assignment of the said judgment, and redeemed the premises hereinbefore mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>from said Prentice, and paid said Prentice the amount of the first-mentioned judgment, and received a deed of said premises from the sheriff. That thereafter said Preble Tucker instituted summary proceedings in the district court for the sixth judicial district of New York, and that thereupon the plaintiff brought this action to restrain the enforcement of such summary proceedings, and to set aside the said first-mentioned judgment and the execution issued thereon, and all the proceedings thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">This action was referred, and on the trial the complaint was dismissed by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">I think that the referee erred in dismissing the complaint on the grounds stated by him, namely : that the plaintiff had a perfect remedy by motion in the original action to set aside the judgment in that action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">It may be that the plaintiff could have moved in the action in which the judgment was obtained to set aside the judgment; but she also has the right to bring an action to set aside the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">That a remedy at law exists is not a valid objection to an action in equity if the equitable remedy is concurrent with the remedy at law.

Y. </em>266-7. Judge Rapadlo, after referring to many cases on this subject, in this state and in other states, says that it thus appears that the current of judicial opinion in this state is very strong and uniform in favor of the proposition stated by Jones, J., in Bolton <em>v. </em>Jacks. It has not as yet, however, been directly adjudicated, and, if sustained, it must rest upon the local law of this state as it finds no support in the adjudications elsewhere. There are reasons, however, founded upon our system of practice, which would warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>us in so holding, the powers of a court of equity-being vested in our. courts of law, and equitable defences being allowable ; there is no reason why to an action upon a judgment the defendant should not be permitted to set up by way of defence any matter which would be ground of relief in equity against the judgment ; and, it is conceded in those states where the record is held conclusive, that when judgment has been obtained by fraud, or without bringing the defendant into court, and the want of jurisdiction does not appear upon the face of the record, relief may be obtained in equity. The techcnical difficulty arising from the conclusiveness of the record is thus obviated.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In Howard <em>v. </em>Smith, 33 <em>Super. Ct. </em>124, this court held, that \u201c whenever it appears by the record of a judgment of a sister state that the defendant appeared by attorney, it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the fact; but in such case the defendant may rebut this presumption by proof that the attorney, named in the record was not his attorney in fact, and never had any authority to appear for him in the action.\u201d In other words, notwithstanding the recital of the record, he may disprove the authority of the attorney to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">And the court of appeals, in Ferguson <em>v </em>Crawford, (s<em>upra) </em>said, in effect, that there is no distinction in this respect between domestic and foreign judgments, and for this reason this case of Howard <em>v. </em>Smith is an authority for reversing this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">There is no distinction between a forged notice of appearance and a notice really given by an attorney not authorized to give it, and jurisdiction is not acquired in either case. Burton <em>v. </em>Sherman, 20 <em>N. Y. Weekly Digest, </em>419. On the trial of the action the court may and will determine on what terms relief will be granted to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>The judgment should be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
