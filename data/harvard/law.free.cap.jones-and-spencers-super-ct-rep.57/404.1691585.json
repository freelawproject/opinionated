The demurrer was sustained on both grounds, and interlocutory judgment was entered accordingly. From that judgment an appeal was taken to the general term, where it was affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-10\">The court held, in substance, among other things, that it had no jurisdiction as against the New York Iron Mine to decree it to declare and pay such dividends as might appear on an accounting to be proper, and that the complaint did not state a cause of action as against the New York Iron Mine. (See 56 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. Rep. </em>236).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-11\">After this the plaintiff moved as against the New York Iron Mine only for leave to file an amended and supplemental complaint setting forth in substance, that the New York Iron Mine had since the commencement of the action declared dividends on its capital stock from May 31,1877, to April 1, 1882, (a period anterior to the commencement of the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>tion), and that of the dividends so declared there was a sum applicable to the payment of the notes held by plaintiff, sufficient to pay the same with interest, which sum was held by the New York Iron Mine in the city of New York, and praying, among other things, that he be decreed to have alien on the dividends declared upon the stock of said Wetmore, prior to the title of certain parties named, to the amount of said notes and interest thereon, and that the New York Iron Mine be decreed to pay such amount to him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-5\"><em>Frank E. Smith, </em>attorney and of counsel, for defendant, the New York Iron Mine, on the ques-. tions considered in the opinion, argued:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-6\">I. The judgment on the demurrers being still in full force establishes conclusively that the facts existing when the suit was begun constituted no cause of action against this defendant. An interlocutory judgment is the law of the case until it is reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-7\">II. The plaintiff, being entitled to no relief whatever upon his original complaint, cannot avail himself by supplemental complaint of matters happening subsequent to the beginning of the action. It is well settled that a plaintiff who has no cause of action at the time he brings his suit cannot, by a supplemental pleading, bolster up that suit with new matter occurring since it was begun. Candler <em>v. </em>Pettit, 1 <em>Paige, </em>168; McCullough <em>v. </em>Colby, 4 <em>Bosw. </em>603; Muller v. Earle, 37 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. </em>(J. &amp; S.), 388; Bostwick <em>v. </em>Menck, 4 <em>Daly, </em>70; Holly <em>v. </em>Graf, 29 <em>Hun, </em>443; Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Co. <em>v. </em>Telegraph Company, 47 <em>Ib. </em>315; Continental Construction Co. <em>v. </em>Vinal, 15 <em>N. Y. St. Rep. </em>968; Bull <em>v. </em>Rothschild, 16 <em>Civ. Pro. Rep. </em>356.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-8\"><em>Roger M. Sherman, </em>attorney and of counsel, for plaintiff, on the questions considered in the opinion, argued:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>I. The allowance of a supplemental complaint is almost a matter of course. <em>Code Civ. Pro., </em>\u00a7 544; Lathan <em>v. </em>Richards, 15 <em>Hun, </em>129.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-5\">II. Plaintiff had a status in a court having jurisdiction, to maintain an action to protect his rights against the conspiracy charged in the original complaint. Haddow <em>v. </em>Lundy, 59 <em>N. Y. </em>326; Hagan <em>v. </em>Walker, 14 <em>How. U. S. </em>34; McBurney <em>v. </em>Carson, 99 <em>U. S. </em>570; Cases <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">III. The declaration of the dividends <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>as of dates prior to the commencement of this suit, shows in connection with the charges of the original complaint, not only that the cause of action for dividends really existed then, but that the dividends were improperly withheld by the wrongful act of the defendant. McBurney <em>v. </em>Carson, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-7\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1O\">The judgment on the demurrer which is still in force, determined that the facts set forth in the complaint and existing at that time, constitute no ' cause of action against the defendant. That being so, the plaintiff will not be permitted to file and serve a supplemental complaint setting up facts which did not exist at the time of the commencement of the action. Farmers\u2019 Loan and Trust Co. <em>v. </em>United Lines Tel. Co., 47 <em>Hun, </em>315.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Neither by amendment of the original complaint nor by supplemental complaint can facts which occurred after suit brought, be made a part of plaintiff\u2019s case so as to turn what is no cause of action at all, into a good cause of action. McCullough <em>v. </em>Colby, 4 <em>Bosw. </em>603; Muller <em>v. </em>Earle, 37 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. </em>388.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The cause of action now sought to be maintained by means of a change of the original complaint, only arose when the dividends were declared, and such declaration occurred long after the commencement of the action. The fact that the declaration, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>time it was made, is alleged to have been made \u201c <em>nunc pro tunc </em>as of the years 1877 to 1882,\u201d can make no difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The reason already given being decisive, it is unnecessary to discuss any other question.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The order should be affirmed with ten dollars costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Sedgwick, Oh.. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
