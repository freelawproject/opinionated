No duty was imposed upon defendants, of taking any precaution to avert the accident, which they could not have expected or foreseen, and under such circumstances there was no negligence on their part. The accident was wholly caused by the negligence of plaintiffs\u2019 servant.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b80-7\">\u2022Before Sedgwick, Ch.

If that custom had been adhered to on the night of the overflow on defendants\u2019 floor, no overflow there could have taken place. No duty was imposed on them of taking any precaution to avert an accident, which they could not have expected or foreseen. Under such circumstances, there was no negligence on their part, and it was wholly caused by the negligence of the servant of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The case did not present a question of conflict of evidence. The great preponderance of evidence was clearly in favor of the defendants, and if the case had been sent to the jury, and they had found a verdict for the plaintiffs, an appellate court would doubtless have directed a new trial. Dwight <em>v. </em>Germania Ins. Co., 103 <em>N. Y. </em>358.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The judgment rendered in the case should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Sedgwick\u00cd Oh. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
