Winegarden, did not provide her a \u201cchemical free or safe environment\u201d (a filtered environment) on two different occasions when she appeared <em>pro se </em>to prosecute a suit she brought in the Superior Court of Gwinnett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>County, Georgia. In this appeal, appellant asks us to vacate the district court\u2019s final judgment and to remand the case for further proceedings against appellees Winegarden, Gwinnett County, and the State of Georgia on her claims for money damages and for an injunction enjoining appellees \u201cpermanently on any further violations of the ADA.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 46. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s request and, therefore, affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">The district court dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint on the basis of the following ADA regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">This part does not require a public entity to provide to individuals with disabilities personal devices, such as wheelchairs; individually prescribed devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids; readers for personal use or study; or services of a personal nature including assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.135 (1993). We quote from the district court\u2019s dispositive order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsN\">[pjlaintiff wanted Defendants to provide her with a \u201cfiltered environment.\u201d The [second amended] complaint reveals that Defendants would have had to provide' Plaintiff with personal devices in order to give here the accommodation she desired: \u2018life support systems,\u2019 <em>(id, </em>\u00b6 IV); \u2018life-support bubble,\u2019 <em>(id); </em>\u2018required medical aids,\u2019 <em>(id); </em>\u2018additional medical aids,\u2019 <em>(id) </em>Even absent the admissions in Plaintiffs complaint, the conclusion is inescapable that providing Plaintiff a filtered environment would have required Defendants to provide her with personal devices. Indeed, in this context, a filtered environment, viewed as a whole, may itself be a personal device. Therefore, in view of \u00a7 35.135, the court finds that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim under the ADA against Defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of the merits of appellant\u2019s ADA claim, and therefore affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-10\">. Appellant also sought relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). The district court rejected this claim; we do so likewise, finding it to be frivolous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
