SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b328-30\">Glenn Carter and Melvin Tribbit appeal an adverse judgment in their state prisoners\u2019 civil rights suit brought pursuant to 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. For the reasons hereinafter stated, we affirm the district court\u2019s order as to Tribbit, and dismiss Carter\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Tribbit and Carter, inmates in the Louisiana Department of Corrections at the Dixon Correctional Institute (\u201cDCI\u201d), filed a civil rights complaint in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas against Richard Stalder, secretary of the Department of Corrections; N. Burl Cain, warden at the DCI; Reggie Felker, a major at the DCI; and B.C. Rogers, an employee of Poultry, Inc. The suit alleges that the plaintiffs were forced to work as slave labor because they were required to debone chicken thighs at the processing plant located at DCI.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The magistrate judge recommended that Tribbit not be allowed to file this action because he had not paid earlier sanctions imposed by this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The magistrate judge recommended that Carter\u2019s claim be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406 because the Eastern District of Louisiana, not the Eastern District of Texas, was the proper venue for that action. The magistrate judge found that because Carter\u2019s claims were frivolous, it was not in the interest of justice to transfer the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Tribbit and Carter objected to this recommendation and urged the district court to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Louisiana. In those objections, Tribbit did not address the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that he not be allowed to file the suit because he was under sanction from this court. The district court overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. The court denied Tribbit leave to file the action and dismissed Carter\u2019s complaint without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406. Final judgment was entered on April 22, 1994, and Tribbit filed a <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal on August 29, 1994. Carter did not sign the notice,</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">This court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion if necessary. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987) (per curiam). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction over Carter\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Whether Carter has filed a valid notice of appeal presents the same situation this court addressed in <em>Mikeska v. Collins, </em>928 F.2d 126 (5th Cir.1991) (per curiam). There, we held that a multiparty <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal was not effective as to any of the <em>pro se </em>parties that did not sign the appeal. <em>Id. </em>We directed that thenceforth, the clerk should notify the non-signers of their right to appeal within fourteen days of the signer\u2019s appeal, as permitted by Fed. R.App.P. 4(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">Carter was not so notified, as the clerk\u2019s office was not sure that Tribbit\u2019s notice of appeal was timely. Following remand, Carter did not submit any signed pleading until appellants\u2019 joint brief, signed by both of them, was filed on May 24,1995.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Mikes-ka, </em>we ensured that every reasonable effort be made to notify non-signing <em>pro se </em>appellants of how to effect an appeal. We did not enlarge \u2014 indeed, we have no authority to enlarge \u2014 the time permitted for appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 26(b). Accordingly, after the fourteen days had expired, Carter could not appeal, despite the lack of <em>Mikeska </em>notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">On appeal, Tribbit urges the merits of the claim he filed below, but does not allege or argue any error in the district court\u2019s order dismissing his case for failure to pay earlier sanctions imposed by this Court. Because we find no error in that order, it must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">In summary, the district court\u2019s order dismissing Tribbit\u2019s appeal is AFFIRMED. Carter\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\">. In <em>Shakir v. Lee, </em>928 F.2d 401 (5th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (unpublished), this court ordered the clerk of the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Louisiana \"not to accept any future filing from [Tribbit] until the $100 fine is paid, unless ... directed to do so by\u201d a district judge of that district. In that case, Tribbit was proceeding under the name of Melvin Hassan Shak-ir.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-16\">. Subsequent to the filing of the first notice of appeal by Tribbit and prior to the remand, Carter signed a motion for IFF status that was filed on October 24, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
