The sole claim argued is that the verdict should have been set aside because the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as matter of law. The argument is to a considerable extent based upon the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony as to the speed of the defendants\u2019 car, but there was other evidence as to this fact and the jury were not bound to accept that of the plaintiff as conclusive upon him. <em>Kanopka </em>v. <em>Kanopka, </em>113 Conn. 30, 154 Atl. 144. The plaintiff approached the intersection upon the right of the defendants\u2019 car and therefore had the right of way, but this would not justify him in failing to exercise proper care commensurate with his situation. However, upon all the evidence, the question whether or not he did exercise that care was one for the jury. <em>Lose </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>105 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Conn. 247, 248, 135 Atl. 42; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>106 Conn. 143, 146, 137 Atl. 725; <em>Whipple v. Fardig, </em>112 Conn. 402, 403, 152 Atl. 397. The trial court did not err in refusing to set the verdict aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
