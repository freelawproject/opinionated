The appellant was an assignee of a conditional bill of sale of the truck, without knowledge of the illegal use to which it was put. In <em>Pickett, Pros. Atty., </em>v. <em>Marcucci\u2019s Liquors, </em>112 Conn. 169, 151 Atl. 526, we considered the statute under which this proceeding was brought and held it constitutional. In <em>Alcorn, State\u2019s Attorney, </em>v. <em>Alexahdrovicz, </em>112 Conn. 618, 153 Atl. 786, the statute was again before us and a copy of it will be found in the footnote to our opinion; we then held that it was no defense to the proceeding that legal title to an automobile seized under the statute was in a party other than the person convicted of a breach of the law concerning intoxicating liquors, under a conditional bill of sale, and that such party had no knowledge of its illegal use. These decisions go far to answer the contentions of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">It is true there is a certain lack of particularity in the application, but nothing so substantial as to justify a failure to order the disposition of the truck after the case had gone to trial without' objection to the pleadings, had been fully heard and all the essential facts proven, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Shuford, </em>91 Conn. 1, 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>98 Atl. 333; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>United States Rubber Co., </em>78 Conn. 48, 52, 60 Atl. 1057. The appellant is right in its contention that, as the proceeding originated in a Town Court, the Court of Common Pleas was without power to order the disposition of the truck unless there was a conviction of the person using it of a violation of the liquor law, from which no appeal was taken; but the trial court found this to be so and no motion to correct the finding was made; we cannot therefore go back of the finding to consider the sufficiency of the evidence upon which it was based. The finding shows that the information against the accused charged that he did \u201cunlawfully manufacture, aid and abet in the manufacture of\u201d intoxicating liquors. The manufacture of such liquors for sale or exchange was when the conviction was had and still is a crime under our law. Public Acts of 1921, Chap. 291, \u00a7 2; General Statutes, \u00a7 2725. The charge in the information that the accused \u201cdid unlawfully manufacture\u201d intoxicating liquors was sufficient. Insert, Connecticut Practice Book, p. 302, 4. The inclusion of the words \u201caid and abet\u201d in such manufacture did not constitute a duplicity which would be open to direct attack, much less to collateral attack as here. One who aids and abets in the commission of a crime may be \u201cprosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender\u201d; General Statutes, \u00a7 6562; an accessory may be charged with having actually committed the offense as principal or he may be charged as an accessory as for a substantive offense, but \u201cthe latter course would be but to state fully the facts which constitute him, under the statute, a principal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>82 Conn. 213, 219, 72 Atl. 1083. The effect of the information was to allege one offense, the words \u201caid and abet\u201d merely serving to particularize the charge. There was no such defect in the information as to render nugatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the conviction of the accused, within the purview of the statute under which the proceeding was brought. There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
