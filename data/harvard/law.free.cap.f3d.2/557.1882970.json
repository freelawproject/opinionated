Pursuant to the plea agreement, the government moved for a downward departure at sentencing, recommending a sentence reduction of \u201cup to 50 per cent\u201d less than the applicable sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">The probation officer determined that Vallejo\u2019s sentencing range was 151 to 188 months of imprisonment. At sentencing, the district court accepted the government\u2019s recommendation for sentence reduction, and sentenced Vallejo to a term of eighty-four months. The court stated that it had not departed to fifty percent of the lowest end of the sentencing range because Vallejo had not been \u201cas straightforward as he could have been with the Court\u201d when he pled guilty. Record on Appeal vol. 3, at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-17\">After sentencing, Vallejo moved for a new trial, \u201conly as it related to sentencing.\u201d Brief for Vallejo at 10; <em>see </em>Record on Appeal vol. 1 tab 64. He alleged that the court should have conducted a psychological examination at sentencing so that the court could understand that \u201cwhat seemed to the Court to be a lack of veracity was instead primarily a deficit in socialization and interpersonal skills\u201d caused by a \u201cpuerile personality.\u201d <em>See </em>Record on Appeal vol. 1 tab 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-18\">The district court, construing the motion for new trial as a motion for reconsideration of Vallejo\u2019s sentence, denied the motion. Vallejo then filed a motion for a \u201cfull hearing\u201d on the denial of his motion for reconsideration. By its order dated August 11, 1992, the court denied that motion as well. Vallejo appeals only the court\u2019s order denying his motion for a hearing on his motion for reconsideration; he neither appeals the denial of his motion for reconsideration, nor the sentence imposed by the court. <em>See id. </em>tab. 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-19\">We have previously held that \u201c[departures from the guidelines are within the broad discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Adams, </em>996 F.2d 75, 78 (5th Cir.1993) (citing <em>United States v. Roberson, </em>872 F.2d 597, 601 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 861, 110 S.Ct. 175, 107 L.Ed.2d 131 (1989)). We therefore apply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the district court\u2019s refusal to hold a hearing on its denial of Vallejo\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-20\">There is no authority directly on point regarding whether a district court must grant a hearing on a motion to reconsider the extent of a legal downward departure from the sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Several factors, however, support the court\u2019s decision not to hold a hearing. First, Vallejo did not object to the court\u2019s stated rationale for its sentence at the sentencing hearing. <em>See </em>Record on Appeal vol. 3 (sentencing transcript). Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ond, Vallejo did not object to the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which failed to mention any psychological problems which Vallejo may have been suffering from at the time of sentencing. <em>See </em>PSR \u00b6 47. Moreover, because of the great deference we give district courts in deciding whether even to depart downward from the guidelines,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> much less the extent of such a departure, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to hold a hearing on Vallejo\u2019s motion to reconsider the extent of the court\u2019s downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\">. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(Nov. 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-14\">. Vallejo does not contest the legality of the court\u2019s downward departure. <em>See </em>Brief for Vallejo; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (stating that a court may depart downward from the guidelines \u201d[u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b629-17\">. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>964 F.2d 454, 462 (5th Cir.1992) (reiterating the well-established rule that we \"will not review a district court's refusal to depart from the Guidelines, unless the refusal was in violation of the law\u201d (attribution omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
