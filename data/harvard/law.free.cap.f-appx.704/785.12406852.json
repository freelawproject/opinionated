He appeals that sentence even though his plea agreement included a broad waiver of his appellate rights. The government has moved to enforce the appeal waiver under United States v. Hahn, 359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (per curiam). Through his counsel, Mr. Cisneros-Guerrero concedes that the waiver bars his appeal. Based on this concession and our independent review of the record, we grant the government\u2019s motion and dismiss the appeal.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b808-17\" pgmap=\"808\">This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. Sea Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
