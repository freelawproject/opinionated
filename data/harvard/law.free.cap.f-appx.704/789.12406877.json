Mr. Berry was indicted on charges of \u201cperpetrating false information and hoaxes\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1038 in the Eastern District of Michigan. Order of Commitment to Att\u2019y Gen. (Doc. No. 45) at 2, United States v. Berry, No. 2:15-cr-20743 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 30, 2016). That district court found that Mr. Berry suffered from a \u201cmental disease\u201d which made him unable to \u201cassist properly - in his defense\u201d and ordered him committed to the custody of the Attorney General and hospitalized to determine whether he might attain capacity to permit further proceedings. Id. at 3-4. While he was temporarily confined at the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, he filed this habeas petition challenging his commitment. Berry v. Fox, No. CIV-17-202-R, 2017 WL 3203706, at *1 (W.D. Okla. June 30, 2017), report and recommendation adopted, No. CIV-17-202-R, 2017 WL 3197239 (W.D. Okla. July 27, 2017).</p> <p id=\"b811-20\" pgmap=\"811(71) 812(23)\">Before the district court could rule on that petition, however, Mr. Berry was transferred to a Michigan county jail. Id. The district court referred the petition to a magistrate judge who recommended that the petition be dismissed without prejudice as moot because Mr. Berry was no longer in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and, therefore, it could not order any \u201ceffectual relief.\u201d Id. at *2 (quoting Griffin v. Kastner, 507 Fed.Appx. 801, 802 (10th Cir. 2013)); see Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 442, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004).</p> <p id=\"b812-4\" pgmap=\"812\">As we understand it, Mr. Berry contends that he is only being detained temporarily by Michigan and that he should be returned to federal custody so he may challenge his detention. So construed, he does not need a certificate of appealability. Montez v. McKinna, 208 F.3d 862, 867 (10th Cir. 2000). He argues that he was unlawfully removed, that his removal violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process, and that the district court had jurisdiction. Although jurisdiction attaches under \u00a7 2241 where the inmate is confined when the petition is filed, the district court\u2019s order was undoubtedly correct that Mr. Berry\u2019s transfer to state custody in Michigan rendered the court incapable of ordering effectual relief vis-a-vis the FTC warden; accordingly, the petition was moot. See Griffin, 507 Fed.Appx. at 802-03. We affirm the dismissal without prejudice for substantially the same reasons as the district court.</p> <p id=\"b812-6\" pgmap=\"812\">AFFIRMED. All pending requests for the court to take judicial notice are DENIED.</p> <footnote label=\"**\"> <p id=\"ak2-dedup-0\" pgmap=\"811\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, it may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> </opinion> </casebody> ",
