We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b798-4\" pgmap=\"798\">I.BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"b798-5\" pgmap=\"798\">Ms. White and a vocational expert (VE) testified at her administrative hearing on February 23, 2015. In his March 25, 2015 decision, the ALJ found</p> <blockquote id=\"b798-6\" pgmap=\"798\">(1) Ms. White suffered from the severe impairments of degenerative disc disease; status post fusion at C3-4, C4-5, and C-5; bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome; status post right carpal tunnel release; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; diabetes; obesity; adjustment disorder with depressed mood; posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and panic disorder.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b798-7\" pgmap=\"798\">(2) These impairments did not meet or equal the listings for presumptive disability.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b798-8\" pgmap=\"798\">(3) Ms. White could not perform her past work as a sales and service representative, rehabilitation training specialist, or office worker, but she had the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform a limited range of light work.</blockquote> <p id=\"b798-10\" pgmap=\"798\">The VE identified jobs a person with Ms. White\u2019s RFC could do that existed in significant numbers in the national economy. Consequently, the ALJ determined at step five of the controlling five-step sequential evaluation process, see Wall v. Astrue, 561 F.3d 1048, 1052 (10th Cir. 2009) (explaining the five-step framework for determining disability), that Ms. White was not disabled under the Social Security Act.</p> <p id=\"b798-14\" pgmap=\"798\">The Appeals Council denied review. Ms. White appealed to the district court, which affirmed the agency\u2019s denial of benefits.</p> <p id=\"b798-15\" pgmap=\"798\">II.LEGAL STANDARDS</p> <p id=\"b798-16\" pgmap=\"798\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s decision de novo and independently determine whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is free fi\u2019om legal error and supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Fischer-Ross v. Barnhart, 431 F.3d 729, 731 (10th Cir. 2005). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Flaherty v. Astrue, 515 F.3d 1067, 1070 (10th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b798-17\" pgmap=\"798\">We examine the record as a whole, do not reweigh the evidence, id., and do not \u201csubstitute our judgment for that of the agency,\u201d Bowman v. Astrue, 511 F.3d 1270, 1272 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[Disability\u201d requires both an \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity\u201d and a \u201cphysical or mental impairment, which provides reason for the inability.\u201d Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 217, 122 S.Ct. 1265, 152 L.Ed.2d 330 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b798-18\" pgmap=\"798\">III.DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"AKoI\" pgmap=\"798\">On appeal, Ms, White presents three challenges to the ALJ\u2019s finding that she is not disabled:</p> <blockquote id=\"b798-20\" pgmap=\"798\">(1) The ALJ did not properly evaluate and weigh the mental limitations evidence.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b798-21\" pgmap=\"798\">(2) The ALJ\u2019s credibility finding was flawed.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b799-4\" pgmap=\"799\">(3) The RFC assessment did not adequately account for her neck restrictions.</blockquote> <p id=\"b799-5\" pgmap=\"799\">A. Mental Limitations</p> <p id=\"b799-6\" pgmap=\"799\"> Ms. White contends the RFC, which states she can perform simple, repetitive tasks, does not account for her mental limitations. In particular, she argues the ALJ did not properly consider the physicians\u2019 opinions in formulating her RFC.</p> <p id=\"b799-7\" pgmap=\"799\">1.Dr. Paris</p> <p id=\"b799-8\" pgmap=\"799\">Dr. Paris performed a mental consultative examination on September 15, 2010. He reported that Ms. White\u2019s \u201cability to perform adequately in most job situations, handle the stress of a work setting and deal with supervisors or co-workers is estimated to be below average.\u201d Aplt. App. Vol. 4, at 655. The ALJ erroneously stated that Ms. White \u201ccould perform adequately in most job situations and handle the stress of a work setting.\u201d Id. Vol. 2, at 21 (emphasis added). Ms. White contends that restricting her in the RFC to simple and repetitive tasks did not cure this error because the ALJ did not account for her below-average ability to perform adequately and handle job stress.</p> <p id=\"b799-9\" pgmap=\"799\">Although the ALJ said that Ms. White could perform \u201cadequately\u201d rather than \u201cbelow average,\u201d Ms. White does not explain why \u201cadequately\u201d does not include \u201cbelow average.\u201d Moreover, other record evidence supports the RFC assessment\u2014 two psychological medical experts with the state agency stated that Ms. White could perform simple tasks with routine supervision and adapt to a work situation. Aplt. App. Vol. 2, at 24; id. Vol. 4, at 715, 809. Their opinions correctly recited and accounted for Dr. Paris\u2019 statement about Ms. White\u2019s below-average ability.</p> <p id=\"b799-10\" pgmap=\"799\">2. Dr. Kent</p> <p id=\"b799-11\" pgmap=\"799\"> Ms. White also contends the ALJ improperly discounted Dr. Kent\u2019s opinion. Dr. Kent performed a mental consultative examination on July 13, 2009, and reported that Ms. White\u2019s PTSD and panic attacks would prevent her from concentrating and persisting on even simple tasks. See id. Vol. 3, at 446. But the ALJ explained that Dr. Kent\u2019s opinion regarding concentration and persistence was \u201cinconsistent with [Dr. Kent\u2019s] mental status evaluation\u201d and inconsistent with Ms. White\u2019s babysitting her two young grandchildren daily. Id. Vol. 2, at 21. The ALJ also contrasted Dr. Kent\u2019s statement that Ms. White \u201cwas not able to concentrate and persist on even simple tasks\u201d with Dr. Kent\u2019s earlier statement that Ms. White \u201cshowed no significant attention or concentration difficulties on mental status evaluation.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the ALJ gave legitimate reasons for giving limited weight to Dr. Kent\u2019s opinion. Cf. Chapo v. Astrue, 682 F.3d 1285, 1291 (10th Cir. 2012) (stating \u201cALJ must pro vide specific, legitimate reasons for rejecting [examining physician\u2019s opinion]\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We cannot substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. See Lax v. Astrue, 489 F.3d 1080, 1084 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding reviewing court may not \u201cdisplace the agency\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views\u201d (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p> <p id=\"b799-12\" pgmap=\"799\">3. RFC Limitation and VE Jobs</p> <p id=\"b799-13\" pgmap=\"799(64) 800(75)\">Ms. White contends the record contains no evidence that the jobs identified by the VE can be performed with a below-average ability to perform adequately and handle work stress. The ALJ included his RFC assessment in his hypothetical questions to the VE, who then identified suitable jobs. Ms. White offers no reason to question the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the VE\u2019s expertise in identifying jobs someone with Ms, White\u2019s abilities and limitations could perform. See Jensen v. Barnhart, 436 F.3d 1163, 1166 (10th Cir. 2005) (finding no error in the ALJ\u2019s reliance on the VE\u2019s opinion concerning the claimant\u2019s need for adjustment to perform the identified jobs); Doyal v. Barnhart, 331 F.3d 758, 761 (10th Cir. 2003) (finding no error at step four for the ALJ\u2019s use of the VE\u2019s testimony to support his own findings).</p> <p id=\"b800-4\" pgmap=\"800\">Ms. White also says simple work does not account for her below-average abilities. But we have held that an RFC limitation to performing simple tasks and work requiring only routine or superficial supervision can be appropriate to accommodate a claimant\u2019s moderate limitation in ability to maintain attention and concentration, accept instructions, respond appropriately to supervisors\u2019 criticism, and get along appropriately with peers. Smith v. Colvin, 821 F.3d 1264, 1269 (10th Cir. 2016). Ms. White\u2019s RFC limitation appropriately accounted for her below-average ability to perform adequately in most job situations and handle the stress of a work setting.</p> <p id=\"APTE\" pgmap=\"800\">* * * *</p> <p id=\"b800-5\" pgmap=\"800\">For the foregoing reasons, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment and his determination that Ms. White could perform a range of light work limited to simple, repetitive tasks.</p> <p id=\"b800-6\" pgmap=\"800\">B. Credibility</p> <p id=\"b800-7\" pgmap=\"800\"> Ms. White challenges the ALJ\u2019s finding that her claim of disabling stress and pain was not fully credible. \u201cCredibility determinations are peculiarly the province of the finder of fact, and we will not upset such determinations when supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Wilson v. Astrue, 602 F.3d 1136, 1144 (10th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Those findings \u201cshould be closely and affirmatively linked to substantial evidence and not just a conclusion in the guise of findings;\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b800-11\" pgmap=\"800\">A claimant\u2019s failure to seek medical treatment is a proper factor in assessing the credibility of a claim of severe impairment. See SSR 96-7p, 1996 WL 374186, at *7 (July 2, 1996);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Keyes-Zachary v. Astrue, 695 F.3d 1156, 1167 (10th Cir. 2012) (stating that when evaluating credibility, the ALJ should consider, among other items, the claimant\u2019s regular contact with a physician and her willingness to try any prescribed treatment).</p> <p id=\"b800-12\" pgmap=\"800\">The ALJ did not reject all of Ms. White\u2019s complaints about her conditions, but instead relied on evidence discounting her assertion that her complaints were disabling. For his adverse credibility finding, the ALJ noted that:</p> <blockquote id=\"b800-13\" pgmap=\"800\">(1) Even though Ms. White alleged PTSD since 2007, she did not seek mental-health treatment until October 2010.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b800-14\" pgmap=\"800\">(2) There was no evidence of pain treatment between January 2011 and December 2011, though she sought medical treatment for cough and congestion.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b800-15\" pgmap=\"800\">(3) A medical note dated February 24, 2009, said she was not taking her diabetes medication or exercising and was not complying with a diet.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b800-16\" pgmap=\"800\">(4) Dr. Gourd, who conducted a consultative physical examination in September 2010, reported that the exam was less than fully reliable because Ms. White gave less than optimal effort,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b801-4\" pgmap=\"801\">(5) Ms. White\u2019s counselor stated in November 2010 that Ms. White tended to exaggerate her behaviors and symptoms.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b801-5\" pgmap=\"801\">(6) Although she claimed she had disabling depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, she did not see her mental-health provider from November 2011 to October 2012.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b801-6\" pgmap=\"801\">(7) Her daily activities included caring for her three-year-old and six-month-old grandchildren five days a week with help from her husband and son, sitting in a recliner most of the day, and some household tasks.</blockquote> <p id=\"b801-7\" pgmap=\"801\">In response to these points, Ms. White makes five arguments.</p> <p id=\"b801-8\" pgmap=\"801\">First, Ms. White contends the ALJ bolstered his adverse credibility finding by disregarding evidence. To refute the ALJ\u2019s statement that she did not seek treatment for PTSD until October 2010, she points to clinic treatment notes referring to her PTSD dated March 2009, June 2009, and March 2010. And she asserts that she was prescribed pain medication throughout 2011. Ms. White fails, however, to show how the treatment notes conflict with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that she sought only minimal treatment.</p> <p id=\"b801-9\" pgmap=\"801\">Second, Ms. White relatedly complains that the ALJ improperly emphasized her counselor\u2019s statements that she tended to exaggerate her behaviors and symptoms over the mental-health records documenting her depression, paranoia, and anxiety. But she does not dispute that the counsel- or made the statements. Rather, she asks us to reweigh the evidence, which we cannot do.</p> <p id=\"b801-10\" pgmap=\"801\">Third, Ms. White claims the ALJ overlooked the opinion of consultative physician Dr. Wiegman and relied on the less-complete opinion provided by Dr. Gourd. But the ALJ did consider Dr. Wiegman\u2019s opinion, noting that he found slightly decreased arm strength, decreased grip strength, and decreased range of motion in the neck.</p> <p id=\"b801-12\" pgmap=\"801\">Fourth, as for the ALJ\u2019s reference to her lack of mental-health treatment from November 2011 to October 2012, Ms. White contends that her medical records after her date last insured of December 31, 2011, are irrelevant. On the contrary, evidence documenting a claimant\u2019s condition after her date last insured may be considered if it relates to the insured period. See Blea v. Barnhart, 466 F.3d 903, 913 (10th Cir. 2006) (remanding for further proceedings in light of medical evidence generated one year after claimant\u2019s last-insured date indicating he had significant pain-producing arthritis); Hardman v. Barnhart, 362 F.3d 676, 678, 681 (10th Cir. 2004) (directing ALJ to consider results of MRI performed after the claimant\u2019s date last insured, which was relevant to the period before the date last insured).</p> <p id=\"b801-13\" pgmap=\"801\">Fifth, Ms. White contends that her daily activities do not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that she is capable of a limited range of light work, arguing she needed help with almost all of those activities. But the ALJ did not rely on her activities of daily living as the sole basis for finding her not fully credible. Rather, the ALJ identified this evidence as one of several bases. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(f); Wilson, 602 F.3d at 1146 (considering ALJ\u2019s reliance on daily activities as a permissible part of substantial evidence supporting credibility determination).</p> <p id=\"b801-14\" pgmap=\"801\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is \u201cclosely and affirmatively linked to substantial evidence\u201d in the record. See Wilson, 602 F.3d at 1144 (internal quotation marks omitted). To the extent Ms. White seeks a reweighing of the evidence, we cannot do so.</p> <p id=\"b802-3\" pgmap=\"802\">C. Neck Restrictions in RFC Assessment</p> <p id=\"b802-4\" pgmap=\"802\"> Ms. White contends the RFC assessment did not adequately account for her neck restrictions. The ALJ found -that she should avoid working above shoulder level to avoid excessive strain on her neck. Ms. White asserts this finding does not consider her limited ability to look down or around. She also asserts that repeated movement will exacerbate her pain. She invokes Dr. Wiegman\u2019s opinion that her neck\u2019s range of motion was reduced to 30 degrees flexion and 40 degrees rotation. She criticizes the ALJ\u2019s reliance on Dr. Gourd\u2019s report, which she says did not record any limitation with flexion or rotation, complaining that Dr. Gourd\u2019s findings are contradicted by Dr. Mayoza, who found limitation of motion in flexion and extension.</p> <p id=\"b802-5\" pgmap=\"802\">The ALJ considered Dr. Wiegman\u2019s report as well as Dr. Mayoza\u2019s final report dated June 25, 2009, both of which disclosed decreased range of motion in the neck. Ms. White does not claim that either of those reports stated that she was unable to look down or around or that repeated movement would exacerbate her pain. As the ALJ recognized, Dr. Mayoza stated that Ms. White\u2019s neck condition \u201ccould interfere with activities of daily living \u2018to a certain degree.\u2019 \u201d Aplt. App. Vol. 2, at 21 (quoting id. Vol. 3, at 439). And contrary to Ms. White\u2019s claim, Dr. Gourd\u2019s evaluation included evaluation for neck flexion, as well as extension. Although he found no limitation, he noted that Ms. White \u201cwould not attempt\u201d this maneuver during the examination. Id. Vol. 4, at 661. In addition, the ALJ relied on the opinion of a State Agency medical expert, Dr. Wainner, that Ms. White could perform light work activity. Ms. White again asks that the evidence be reweighed, which we again must decline to do. Rather, we hold that the ALJ\u2019s RFC assessment is supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p> <p id=\"b802-7\" pgmap=\"802\">We also reject Ms. White\u2019s related argument that the hypothetical questions posed to the VE did not relate all of her impairments because they did not include her claimed neck limitations. See Krauser v. Astrue, 638 F.3d 1324, 1333 (10th Cir. 2011) (\u201cAt step five ... an ALJ may relate the claimant\u2019s impairments to a VE and then ask the VE whether, in his opinion, there are any jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). The ALJ properly included in the hypothetical questions the neck limitations that are supported by the evidentiary record. See Smith, 821 F.3d at 1270 (holding ALJ\u2019s questions to VE had to include only the limitations ultimately assessed).</p> <p id=\"b802-8\" pgmap=\"802\">IV. CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b802-9\" pgmap=\"802\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p> <footnote label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b797-9\" pgmap=\"797\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b798-11\" pgmap=\"798\">.
