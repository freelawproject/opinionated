Johnson then sued the officer who fired the shot, Sergeant Daniel Scott Peay of the Morgan County Sheriffs Department. She claims Sergeant Peay violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of Sergeant Peay, finding that he acted reasonably in the situation and the contours of Johnson\u2019s Fourth Amendment right were not clearly established at the time of the incident. The court therefore found that Sergeant Peay was entitled to qualified immunity and dismissed Johnson\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-15\">To succeed on appeal, Johnson must prove that the constitutional right at issue was \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of Sergeant Peay\u2019s alleged misconduct. We conclude the contours of Johnson\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force at the conclusion of the confrontation were not sufficiently definite to place Sergeant Peay\u2019s conduct \u201cbeyond debate\u201d at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-16\">We therefore conclude that Sergeant Peay is entitled to qualified immunity and affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-17\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b761-18\">Johnson initiated the underlying car chase when Deputy Christian Peay of the Morgan County Sheriffs Department, Sergeant Peay\u2019s brother, attempted to initiate a traffic stop due to the fact that Johnson was driving late at night without her head<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>lights on. Johnson failed to yield to Deputy Peay, even after he activated his overhead emergency lights and siren, and led Deputy Peay on a high-speed chase lasting over half an hour. Law enforcement deployed spike strips, which flattened three of Johnson\u2019s tires. Nevertheless, she persisted in her attempt to evade arrest. Johnson did not stop even after several tires came off her truck\u2019s wheel rims altogether. Instead, Johnson continued to flee and drive erratically; she drove off the right shoulder of the interstate, went back across both lanes, and struck the cement barrier in the middle of the divided highway. Johnson eventually exited the interstate and turned onto a rural road, but still refused to yield to Deputy Peay or any of the other law enforcement vehicles that had joined the pursuit by that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">After she exited the interstate, Johnson stopped and began to turn her truck around to face the officers. Several law enforcement vehicles, including both Sergeant Peay\u2019s and Deputy Peay\u2019s vehicles, lined up across the road to block Johnson\u2019s westbound path. Cameras located on the dashboards of these law enforcement vehicles recorded the rest of the encounter. Sergeant Peay exited his vehicle and verbally ordered Johnson to stop and get out of her truck. Instead of stopping, Johnson began to pull forward toward Sergeant Peay\u2019s vehicle and bumped into it with her truck. She then backed up and began to pull forward again, turning and bumping into Deputy Peay\u2019s stationary vehicle with even greater force than the first collision and breaking the grill guard at the front of the vehicle. By then, Deputy Peay had also exited his vehicle but dropped out of Sergeant Peay\u2019s view. Sergeant Peay therefore did not know whether Deputy Peay was under Johnson\u2019s truck, had been struck by Johnson\u2019s truck, or if he had been pinned between the two vehicles. As Johnson\u2019s truck collided with Deputy Peay\u2019s vehicle, Sergeant Peay fired a single shot at Johnson\u2019s truck. The bullet passed through Johnson\u2019s windshield and struck her in the head. After securing the scene, officers called for and provided immediate medical attention for Johnson. Johnson survived the gunshot but suffered serious injuries and lost the vision in her left eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Officers recovered a half-empty bottle of vodka at the scene, which Johnson indicated she purchased from a gas station a few hours before the incident. It was later determined that Johnson had a blood alcohol level of 0.358 at the time of the incident, more than four times the legal limit in Utah. And Johnson stated that she \u201chad every intention of trying to kill [herself],\u201d \u201cwant[ed] to die,\u201d and was attempting \u201cdeath by cop.\u201d Supp. App. at 98, 110. In the aftermath of the incident, Johnson was cited for a variety of violations and eventually pleaded guilty to failure to respond to an officer\u2019s signal to stop (a third degree felony) and driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (a class B misdemeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Meanwhile, the Davis County Attorney\u2019s Office investigated Sergeant Peay\u2019s use of force under state law governing a \u201cpeace officer\u2019s use of deadly force.\u201d <em>See </em>Utah Code. Ann. \u00a7 76-2-404. The office determined that Sergeant Peay\u2019s \u201cuse of potentially lethal force ... was not <em>necessitated </em>by the facts\u201d and the shooting did \u201cnot squarely fit with the letter, scope and intent of\u2019 state and related federal law, but ultimately declined to prosecute Sergeant Peay because \u201ca unanimous jury would not convict Sergeant Peay of a crime when presented with all of the evidence.\u201d App. at 63-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Following the conclusion of the office\u2019s investigation, Johnson filed suit against Sergeant Peay in federal district court. As relevant to this appeal, Johnson claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Sergeant Peay\u2019s use of deadly force violated her clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Clark v. Wilson, </em>625 F.3d 686, 690 (10th Cir. 2010) (quoting <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009)). The plaintiff opposing a defendant\u2019s assertion of qualified immunity must prove both that: (1) a constitutional violation occurred; and (2) the violated right was clearly established at the time of the violation. <em>See id. </em>We have discretion to decide which of the two prongs of the qualified immunity analysis should be addressed first. <em>Id. </em>Because we conclude that Sergeant Peay did not violate a clearly established constitutional right, we \u201ctake the advice of <em>Pearson </em>and address that issue first.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\u201cThe relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation.\u201d <em>Cortez v. McCauley, </em>478 F.3d 1108, 1114 (10th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (quoting <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001)). In other words, \u201c[a] right is clearly established when it is \u2018sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Reat v. Rodriguez, </em>824 F.3d 960, 964 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting <em>Reichle v. Howards, </em>566 U.S. 658, 664, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012)). \u201cAn officer \u2018cannot be said to have violated a clearly established right unless the right\u2019s contours were sufficiently definite that any reasonable official in his shoes would have understood that he was violating it,\u2019 meaning that \u2018existing precedent placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\u2019\u201d <em>City of San Francisco v. Sheehan, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1765, 1774, 191 L.Ed.2d 856 (2015) (quoting <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>563 U.S. 731, 741, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011)) (alterations incorporated). This standard is relatively deferential to government officials and, in any gray area, the officer prevails: \u201c[Qualified immunity protects actions in the \u2018hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mullenix v. Luna, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 305, 312, 193 L.Ed.2d 255 (2015) (per curiam) (citations omitted; alterations incorporated).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-13\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that \u201c \u2018clearly established lav/ should not be defined \u2018at a high level of generality5 \u201d and \u201cmust be \u2018particularized\u2019 to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>White v. Pauly, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 548, 552, 196 L.Ed.2d 463 (2017) (per curiam) (citations omitted). \u201cSuch specificity is especially important in the Fourth Amendment context,\u201d where the Supreme Court has recognized it may be \u201cdifficult for an officer to determine- how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts.\u201d <em>Mullenix, </em>136 S.Ct. at 308 (quoting <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151). When a case \u201cpresents a unique set of facts and circumstances,\u201d this quality \u201calone [is] an important indication ... that [the officer\u2019s] conduct did not violate a \u2018clearly established\u2019 right.\u201d <em>See Pauly, </em>137 S.Ct. at 552 (citations omitted). That is, when there is no case \u201cwhere an officer acting under similar circumstances ... was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment,\u201d it is unlikely that the officer\u2019s conduct violated \u201cclearly established\u201d law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>In general, it is not \u201cconstitutionally unreasonable\u201d for an officer to prevent a suspect\u2019s escape by using deadly force when the officer \u201chas probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others.\u201d <em>Brosseau v. Haugen, </em>543 U.S. 194, 197-98, 125 S.Ct. 596, 160 L.Ed.2d 583 (2004) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Tennessee v. Garner, </em>471 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1694, 85 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)). Within this broad framework, however, a series of excessive force cases involving car chases reveals the \u201chazy legal backdrop,\u201d Mulle<em>nix, </em>136 S.Ct. at 309, against which Sergeant Peay acted. In <em>Brosseau, </em>for example, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision to withhold qualified immunity from officer Brosseau, who shot Haugen in the back as he \u201cattempted to flee from law enforcement authorities in his vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, 125 S.Ct. 596. Brosseau explained that \u201cshe shot Haugen because she was \u2018fearful for the other officers on foot who she believed were in the immediate area, and for. the occupied vehicles in Haugen\u2019s path and for any other citizens who might be in the area.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted; alterations incorporated). By the time of Brosseau\u2019s use of deadly force, Haugen \u201chad proven he would do almost anything to avoid capture\u201d, and \u201cposed a major threat to, among others, the officers at the end of the street.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 200, 125 S.Ct. 596. After summarizing the existing case law, the Court concluded it \u201cby no means \u2018clearly established]\u2019 that Brosseau\u2019s conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 125 S.Ct. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Likewise, the Supreme Court held in <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>550 U.S. 372, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007) that \u201can officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment by ramming the car of a fugitive whose reckless driving \u2018posed an actual and imminent threat to the lives of any pedestrians who might have been present, to other civilian motorists, and to the officers involved in the case,\u2019 \u201d and in <em>Plumhoff v. Rickard, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2012, 188 L.Ed.2d 1056 (2014), that \u201can officer acted reasonably when he fatally shot a fugitive who was \u2018intent on resuming\u2019 a chase that \u2018posed a deadly threat for others on the road.\u2019\u201d <em>See Mullenix, </em>136 S.Ct. at 310 (alteration incorporated) (first citing <em>Scott, </em>550 U.S. at 384, 127 S.Ct. 1769; then citing <em>Plumhoff, </em>134 S.Ct. at 2022).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">And in <em>Mullenix </em>itself, the Court held that officer Mullenix, who shot fleeing suspect Leija six times from a bridge overpass, deserved qualified immunity for his actions in confronting \u201ca reportedly intoxicated fugitive, set on avoiding capture through high-speed vehicular flight, who twice during his flight had threatened to shoot police officers, and who was moments away from encountering an officer.\u201d 136 S.Ct. at 309. No cases \u201cclearly established that deadly foree [was] inappropriate in response to conduct like Leija\u2019s.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 307, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">These cases require us to take a close look at the unique set of facts and circumstances facing Sergeant Peay. Johnson\u2019s injuries are undeniably tragic. And it is quite possible that Sergeant Peay overreacted. It is not our job, however, to evaluate the incident \u201cwith the 20/20 vision of hindsight\u201d from \u201cthe peace of a judge\u2019s chambers\u201d while leisurely watching the end of the encounter by video. <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (citations omitted). Rather, we must judge the reasonableness of a particular use of force \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene\u201d and our calculus \u201cmust embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>uncertain, and rapidly evolving \u2014 about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865 (citations omitted). As the district court noted, in the sequence of events leading up to the shooting, Johnson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQGn\">showed no signs of yielding to the officers\u2019 lights and sirens during the chase, even when she had to drive on tire rims after three of her tires disintegrated from damage caused by tire spikes. And after she slowed to a stop, Ms. Johnson immediately backed' up and drove straight toward the officers and the patrol cars that blocked her path. Her truck was only feet away from the officers and their cars. She deliberately ran into Sergeant Peay\u2019s car, even as he was pointing a gun at her through the windshield and ordering her to stop. ... Then she revved her engine, backed up again, turned her steering wheel, and aimed for other cars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">App. at 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In other words, at the time of Sergeant Peay\u2019s use of force, the officers \u201cwere no longer dealing with a traffic stop,\u201d but \u201cwith an unknown driver who disobeyed officers\u2019 commands to pull over and who led the officers on a thirty-minute chase\u201d before \u201cmaneuvering ... a big pickup truck in an aggressive way in close proximity to officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. According to the undisputed record, Sergeant Peay was unaware of the precise location of Deputy Peay, not knowing whether he was \u201cunder [Johnson\u2019s] vehicle, if she had hit him, or if she was pinning him between the vehicles.\u201d Supp. App. at 79. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Mullenix, </em>it has \u201cnever found the use of deadly force in connection with a dangerous car chase to violate the Fourth Amendment, let alone to be a basis for denying qualified immunity\u201d where an officer reasonably believed he or others were in danger. 136 S.Ct. at 310. Johnson cannot cite, and our independent review does not reveal, any case indicating that an officer\u2019s use of deadly force is constitutionally impermissible in a situation roughly analogous to the one Sergeant Peay faced here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Despite this, Johnson argues the district court erred in crediting Sergeant Peay\u2019s testimony and characterization of the facts, which Johnson claims were made \u201cobjectively unbelievable\u201d by the \u201cclear and unambiguous dashcam video\u201d evidence. Aplt. Br. at viii, 1-4. In doing so, Johnson maintains the district court \u201cimproperly weighted] the facts and [made] credibility assessments that should properly have been decided by the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at ix, 26-30. Indeed, Johnson seems to contend the dashcam video evidence fully supports her view of the events and definitively rules out Sergeant Peay\u2019s characterization of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">But the district court\u2019s and our review of the videos depict a lengthy saga replete with evidence of Johnson\u2019s aggressive and persistent attempts to evade arrest. This is evident even if we do not credit any of Sergeant Peay\u2019s testimony regarding Johnson\u2019s alleged expressions of rage, screams, and physical aggressiveness. Immediately prior to the shooting, the videos clearly demonstrate Johnson\u2019s willingness and ability to use her truck to hit, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>thereby move, law enforcement vehicles in close proximity to several police officers. It is well-settled that vehicles may be used as weapons and that such use \u201cmay allow for the use of deadly force,\u201d because \u201cit goes without saying that an officer in close quarters is no match for a two-ton vehicle.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Durastanti, </em>607 F.3d 655, 665, 671 (10th Cir. 2010). While Johnson seems to suggest the undisputed video evidence condemns Sergeant Peay\u2019s actions, we conclude the videos instead depict a sequence of events corroborating the undisputed testimony of the officers and entitling Sergeant Peay to qualified immunity. Sergeant Peay employed deadly force that, in retrospect, may have been unnecessary. But Sergeant Peay reacted to a high-intensity situation after Johnson had: (1) led law enforcement on a lengthy car chase; (2) repeatedly failed to heed officers\u2019 warnings and commands; and (8) maneuvered her truck in a way that a reasonable police officer could have concluded she was using it as a weapon and was intent on resuming her flight, even if it meant putting officers\u2019 lives in danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Johnson cannot demonstrate a clearly established constitutional right to be free from the use of deadly force after leading law enforcement on a lengthy; high-speed chase and using her truck as a weapon in close proximity to police officers. We therefore agree with the district court that Sergeant Peay is entitled to qualified immunity and AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b761-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b765-7\">. In support of her argument that Sergeant Peay violated her clearly established Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force, Johnson cites <em>Woodcock v. City of Bowling Green, </em>165 F.Supp.3d 563 (W.D. Ky. 2016). We are of course not bound by an out-of-circuit district court case and, in any event, the case is easily distinguishable. The victim in <em>Woodcock </em>was not physically resisting arrest at a close range; he was more than seventy feet away from the officers, on foot, obviously intoxicated, and \"simply passively noncompliant.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 582-83.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
