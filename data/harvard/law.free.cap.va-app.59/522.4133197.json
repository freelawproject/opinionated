ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283, the trial court terminated the parental rights of Katrina Bagley concerning her infant child. On appeal, Bagley does not contest the factual grounds supporting the court\u2019s termination decision. Instead, she argues the termination order should be vacated because the Richmond Department of Social Services (DSS) failed to consider granting custody of the child to Ralph and Patricia Davis\u2014a couple Bagley claims to be the child\u2019s relatives. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A) states that a termination order should be \u201caccompanied\u201d by an order granting custody of the child to either DSS or some specific individual. When entering the custody order, however, \u201cthe court shall give a consideration to granting custody to relatives of the child, including grandparents.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A). We have interpreted this provision to require DSS to consider all \u201creasonable options for placement with immediate relatives\u201d as a prerequisite to a parental termination decision. <em>Hawthorne v. Smyth Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>33 Va.App. 130, 136, 531 S.E.2d 639, 642 (2000) (quoting <em>Sauer v. Franklin Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>18 Va.App. 769, 771, 446 S.E.2d 640, 641 (1994) (clarifying that DSS does not have a \u201cduty in every case to investigate the home of every relative of the children, however remote, as a potential placement\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">On appeal, Bagley argues the trial court erred by terminating her parental rights because DSS failed to consider granting custody of her child to the Davises. In response, DSS argues the Davises are not relatives and, in any event, DSS did consider placing the child with them and concluded it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>would be ill-advised to do so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We need not address the adequacy of DSS\u2019s investigation because we hold the Davises are not relatives of the child as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">When a statute uses words having an established common law meaning, courts presume the legislature intended that meaning unless the statute clearly suggests otherwise. <em>Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2238, 2245, 180 L.Ed.2d 131 (2011). When a Virginia statute \u201cemploys a word or phrase which has already been used in the common law or in another statute, and has there acquired by construction an established meaning, it is to be understood in the meaning previously determined.\u201d <em>Houston v. Commonwealth, </em>87 Va. 257, 262, 12 S.E. 385, 386 (1890). This canon of construction presumes the legislature \u201cknows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.\u201d <em>Beck v. Prupis, </em>529 U.S. 494, 501, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 1613, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000) (quoting <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 250, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Under common law, a <em>relative </em>means someone related by consanguinity or affinity. Consanguinity is a \u201crelation by blood,\u201d <em>Doyle v. Commonwealth, </em>100 Va. 808, 811, 40 S.E. 925, 926 (1902) (citation omitted), between those sharing \u201ca common ancestor,\u201d <em>Surles v. Mayer, </em>48 Va.App. 146, 163 n. 5, 628 S.E.2d 563, 571 n. 5 (2006) (citation omitted). Affinity, on the other hand, \u201cis the relation of one spouse to the other spouse\u2019s kindred.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 454, 460, 585 S.E.2d 852, 855 (2003). To this common law definition of relative, Virginia statutes add children legally adopted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In the trial court, Bagley claimed that her brother was the boyfriend of the Davises\u2019 daughter. Whether true or not, this tenuous connection does not make the Davises <em>relatives </em>of Bagley\u2019s child. They share no common ancestor and, thus, are not related by blood\u2014a point Bagley conceded at trial. <em>See </em>App. at 108. Nor are they related by marriage or adoption. Lacking any relationship by consanguinity, affinity, or adoption with Bagley\u2019s child, the Davises cannot be the child\u2019s \u201crelatives\u201d under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A) and, all the more, cannot qualify as \u201cimmediate relatives\u201d under our interpretation of the statute in <em>Hawthorne </em>and <em>Sauer.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The trial court, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>fore, did not err in rejecting DSS\u2019s petition for termination on the ground that DSS failed to comply with Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 283(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-7\">. During closing arguments, the trial court commented, \"they\u2019re not related, as I understood it.\u201d App. at 109. After hearing additional argument, the trial court ruled: \"I find that Katrina Bagley\u2019s parental rights should be terminated, that that\u2019s in the best interest of the child. The Department has made its case by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113. The court's final order does not expressly address the question whether the Davises are relatives of the child. This omission does not affect our analysis. Under settled principles, \"[a]bsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a circuit court comes to an appellate court with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Damon v. York, </em>54 Va.App. 544, 555, 680 S.E.2d 354, 360 (2009) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\">. \"The interpretation of well-defined words and phrases in the common law carries over to statutes dealing with the same or similar subject matter.\u201d 2B Sutherland, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 50:3, at 176 (Norman J. Singer ed., 7th ed.2008). \"Although a statute may define the way in which a particular word is used, the common-law background and origin of the word may be useful to a proper understanding of the statute in cases of reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-6\">. An adopted child shall be, \"to all intents and purposes, the child of the person or persons so adopting him,\u201d and \"shall be entitled to all the rights and privileges, and subject to all the obligations, of a child of such person or persons born in lawful wedlock.\u201d Code \u00a7 63.2-1215. Virginia statutes regularly use this statutorily enhanced common law definition of relative. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-53 (\"For purposes of this section, a relative is any person related to the decedent by blood, marriage, or adoption ....\"); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.2-2291; 15.2-2292; 15.2- 2292.1; 16.1-336; 16.1-350; 16.1-355; 32.1-102.3:2; 38.2-3544; 63.2- 2200 (all referencing persons related \"by blood, marriage, or adoption\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"ALq\">. At oral argument on appeal, Bagley pointed out that her brother and the Davises' daughter share a child in common. <em>See </em>Oral Argument Audio 3:15-3:50, 5:40, 25:26. This fact, however, has no logical or legal relevance to the question whether Bagley\u2019s child is legally related to the Davises. \"We must be careful to remember,\u201d the essential characteristic of blood relatives, direct or collateral, \"consists in this descent from one and the same common ancestor.\u201d 2 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries </em>*644. This case would be no different, even if the Davises' daughter and Bagley's brother were legally married.
