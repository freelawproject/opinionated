On appeal, Duggins claims his convictions should be overturned because the trial court\u2014in a prior proceeding\u2014erroneously allowed the Commonwealth to <em>nolle prosequi </em>indictments alleging identical charges. Because these charges should not have been dismissed without prejudice in the prior proceeding, Duggins reasons, the new indictments alleging the same charges in the later proceeding should have been dismissed with prejudice. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">In September 2009, a grand jury indicted Duggins alleging two counts of credit card fraud. Shortly before trial, the prosecutor requested a continuance. He explained a cooperating witness with relevant documents had agreed to appear at trial and was willing to accept a subpoena served by telefax. The prosecutor said he telefaxed the subpoena, but the witness later claimed she never received it and stated she would not appear at trial or produce the documents absent a properly served subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>The trial court denied the continuance motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Because of the witness\u2019s last-minute retraction, the prosecutor moved the court to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the charges and release Duggins from the process of the court. Finding good cause to do so, the trial court agreed and dismissed the charges without prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The final order stated: \u201cAll proceedings in this case were terminated and the Defendant was released and discharged of record in this case.\u201d Amended Final Order, No. FE-2009-1387 (Jan. 28, 2010).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">When Duggins appealed the dismissal of his charges to this Court, we declined to hear the appeal because Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A) permits appellate jurisdiction over \u201cany final conviction\u201d in a circuit court but not over a final order terminating a prosecution and releasing the defendant. <em>See </em>Order, No. 0275-10-4 (Va.App.Ct. June 16, 2010); <em>accord Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 576, 583 n. 4, 520 S.E.2d 825, 829 n. 4 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In January 2010, a different grand jury indicted Duggins alleging two counts of credit card fraud based upon the same factual circumstances. Prior to trial, Duggins moved to dismiss the charges with prejudice. Supporting his motion with copies of the 2009 indictments and a hearing transcript from the prior proceeding, Duggins claimed the trial court (in the earlier proceeding) should have denied the prosecutor\u2019s request for a <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the same grounds that it denied the motion for a continuance. Because the prior court found no good cause to grant a continuance, Duggins contended, it necessarily follows the court improperly found good cause for the <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>The trial court presiding over the January 2010 indictments denied Duggins\u2019s motion to dismiss. The case proceeded to trial, and a jury found Duggins guilty on both counts charged in the 2010 indictments. On appeal, Duggins contends the trial court should have dismissed with prejudice the January 2010 indictments prior to trial. Having failed to do so, Duggins argues, the trial court lacked the authority to enter a final conviction order confirming the jury verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">A. HISTORY OF THE <em>NOLLE PROSEQUI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">A concept dating from the late 1600s, <em>nolle prosequi </em>means \u201cunwilling to prosecute\u201d in Latin. Under English common law, the public prosecutor could generally \u201center a <em>nolle prosequi </em>in his discretion\u201d without obtaining the trial court\u2019s permission. Advisory Committee Notes to Fed.R.Crim.P. 48(a); <em>see generally </em>4 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 13.3(c), at 159 n. 36 (3d ed.2007). Some common law jurists, however, including Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, reserved the power to overrule a <em>nolle prosequi </em>when wielded as a weapon of \u201cmischief or oppression\u201d against an accused. <em>King v. Webb, </em>1 Black. Rep\u2019s 460, 461, 96 Eng. Rep. 265, 266 (K.B.1764) (cited in 2 William Hawkins, <em>Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown </em>355 n. 1 (1824) (\u201cthe court will see that no mischief or oppression ensues\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">Following Lord Mansfield\u2019s approach, Virginia jurists as early as 1803 likewise conditioned the <em>nolle prosequi </em>power upon receiving \u201cthe consent\u201d of the trial court. <em>Anonymous, </em>3 Va. (1 Va. Cas.) 139, 139 (1803). In 1979, the General Assembly codified this tradition in Code \u00a7 19.2-265.3. <em>See </em>1979 Va. Acts ch. 641. Under this statute, a trial court has the discretion to refuse a <em>nolle prosequi </em>if the prosecutor fails to show \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consistent with the common law background of Code \u00a7 19.2-265.3, Virginia trial courts properly refuse a <em>nolle prosequi </em>when the circumstances \u201cmanifest a vindictive intent,\u201d <em>Battle v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 624, 630, 406 S.E.2d 195, 198 (1991), resulting in \u201coppressive and unfair trial tactics\u201d or other prosecutorial misconduct, <em>Harris, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>258 Va. at 584, 520 S.E.2d at 829. Absent such mischief, however, courts defer to the public prosecutor given his constitutionally recognized prerogatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">The Executive remains the absolute judge of whether a prosecution should be initiated and the first and presumptively the best judge of whether a pending prosecution should be terminated. The exercise of its discretion with respect to the termination of pending prosecutions should not be judicially disturbed unless clearly contrary to manifest public interest. In this way, the essential function of each branch is synchronized to achieve a balance that serves both practical and constitutional values.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">LaFave, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 13.3(c), at 162-63 (quoting, as the \u201cleading case\u201d on the subject, <em>United States v. Cowan, </em>524 F.2d 504, 513 (5th Cir.1975)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Such deference remains due even in cases where the prosecution seeks a <em>nolle prosequi </em>because of an \u201coversight\u201d in its pretrial preparations, <em>Battle, </em>12 Va.App. at 630, 406 S.E.2d at 198, or \u201ca lack of adequate foresight and preparation on the part of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney,\u201d <em>Harris, </em>258 Va. at 584, 520 S.E.2d at 829-30. In such circumstances, the interests of justice favor a trial with both sides\u2014prosecution and defense\u2014adequately prepared to address the merits of the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">B. EFFECT ON SUBSEQUENT PROSECUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">A <em>nolle prosequi </em>\u201cdischarges the accused from liability on the indictment to which the <em>nolle prosequi </em>is entered.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number><em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 929, 935, 234 S.E.2d 269, 273 (1977); <em>see also Lindsay v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) 345, 347 (1823) (stating a <em>nolle prosequi </em>causes \u201ca consequent discharge from custody by the Court\u201d). But it does not constitute \u201can acquittal or discharge from further prosecution.\u201d <em>Lindsay, </em>4 Va. (2 Va. Cas.) at 347; <em>see also Commonwealth v. Garrett, </em>276 Va. 590, 606, 667 S.E.2d 739, 748 (2008) <em>(\u201cnolle prosequi </em>generally does not act as an acquittal\u201d). \u201cFor the prosecution to proceed thereafter for the same offense, a new indictment is required.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>217 Va. at 935, 234 S.E.2d at 273. This \u201cnew indictment is a <em>new </em>charge, distinct from the original charge or indictment.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>258 Va. at 585, 520 S.E.2d at 830 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Under limited circumstances, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>could implicate a bar to subsequent prosecution. For example, the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy might be triggered if a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is granted after jeopardy attaches. <em>See Rosser v. Commonwealth, </em>159 Va. 1028, 1032, 167 S.E. 257, 258 (1933). In addition, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>could contribute toward a prejudicial delay in violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional speedy trial protections extended by the Sixth Amendment. <em>See generally Harris, </em>258 Va. at 585-86, 520 S.E.2d at 830-31. Finally, when a <em>nolle prosequi </em>is used as an unconstitutional weapon of prosecutorial misconduct, subsequent \u201cenhanced charges\u201d could be dismissed as a remedy for the constitutional violation. <em>See Battle, </em>12 Va.App. at 631-32, 406 S.E.2d at 199.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">What we have never said\u2014and, as far as we know, no court has ever said\u2014is that a reprosecution following a <em>nolle prosequi </em>should be barred merely because the trial judge in the later proceeding disagrees with the trial judge\u2019s finding of good cause in the earlier proceeding. Several reasons explain why. To begin with, the earlier <em>nolle prosequi </em>decision was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>made in an entirely different proceeding. It cannot be revisited after the initial proceeding becomes final and incapable of reconsideration under Rule 1:1. All the more, it cannot be collaterally attacked in a subsequent proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Equally importantly, the trial court in the subsequent proceeding can impose no effective remedy as to the earlier terminated prosecution even if the earlier <em>nolle prosequi </em>was arguably entered in error. Had the alleged mistake not occurred\u2014that is, had the defendant not been discharged from the then-pending charge and returned to his liberty\u2014he would have proceeded to a criminal trial. The court cannot dismiss <em>with prejudice </em>an indictment in the subsequent proceeding merely because the same charge (asserted earlier in a different indictment by a different grand jury) had been dismissed <em>without prejudice </em>in the earlier proceeding. Such an exaggerated remedy would be disproportionate to the alleged error. <em>See United States v. Goodson, </em>204 F.3d 508, 514 (4th Cir.2000) (observing that dismissing an indictment with prejudice should not impermissibly allow the trial court\u2019s \u201cinterest in the orderly administration of justice to override the interests of victims and the public interest in the enforcement of the criminal law\u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">C. DENYING CONTINUANCE AND GRANTING <em>NOLLE PROSEQUI</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Duggins contends these principles, even if generally applicable, do not apply to him because the trial court in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>prior proceeding approved the prosecutor\u2019s <em>nolle prosequi </em>only after disapproving his request for a continuance. Because the same grounds were asserted for both requests, Duggins reasons, the lack of good cause for the continuance necessarily disproves any good cause existed for the <em>nolle prosequi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">For the reasons we have already discussed, the presence or absence of good cause in the earlier proceeding cannot be collaterally reviewed by the trial court in a subsequent proceeding. It changes nothing that, in the earlier proceeding, an unsuccessful continuance motion preceded the motion for <em>nolle prosequi. </em>The Virginia Supreme Court faced the same argument in <em>Harris, </em>where the defendant \u201casserted that because the trial court had denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a continuance, there was no good cause for sustaining the motion for <em>nolle prosequi </em>as well.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>258 Va. at 581, 520 S.E.2d at 828. <em>Harris </em>rejected the argument because the attempt to link the two concepts was flawed. <em>Id. </em>at 581-82, 520 S.E.2d at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Whether or not to continue a case involves a \u201cdifferent calculus\u201d than the one governing the decision to grant or deny a <em>nolle prosequi </em>motion. <em>Id. </em>at 583, 520 S.E.2d at 829. A <em>nolle prosequi </em>serves merely \u201cto discontinue the prosecution relative to the charges.\u201d <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 111, 114, 597 S.E.2d 84, 86 (2004). The consequences of <em>discontinuing </em>a case are quite different from <em>continuing </em>it. \u201cOnce the <em>[nolle prosequi </em>] motion is granted, the defendant is released from custody or the terms of his bond and is at liberty.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>258 Va. at 585, 520 S.E.2d at 830. \u201cWhile this may provide the Commonwealth with an opportunity to gather more evidence, it does not amount to an \u2018unlimited continuance\u2019 because the defendant no longer suffers the consequences of being under indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, a trial court in its discretion could find reasons insufficient for continuing a case to nonetheless be sufficient for discontinuing it. We thus reject Duggins\u2019s assertion that longstanding principles authorizing reprosecution do not apply to him be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>cause, in his earlier proceeding, an unsuccessful continuance motion preceded the <em>nolle prosequi </em>motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">In this case, a jury found Duggins guilty of two counts of fraudulent use of a credit card. The jury\u2019s verdict cannot be overturned on the allegation, even if true, that the trial court in the prior proceeding mistakenly believed the Commonwealth had good cause to <em>nolle prosequi </em>indictments alleging identical charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-6\">.
