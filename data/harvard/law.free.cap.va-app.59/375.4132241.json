Father assigns nineteen errors to the trial court\u2019s judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we find no merit in father\u2019s assignments of error and affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">I. OVERVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Because this case involves multiple hearings and decisions, we begin with an overview of the process that led to the ultimate result in the trial court. Code \u00a7 16.1-251 allows a juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR) to enter an emergency order allowing the Department of Social Services (Department) to remove a child from his custodian\u2019s or parent\u2019s custody. The JDR court may issue this order <em>ex parte </em>so long as it is accompanied by a petition alleging that the child is abused or neglected and an affidavit or sworn testimony in person before a judge or intake officer. Code \u00a7 16.1-251. That affidavit or sworn testimony must establish that the child \u201cwould be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irremediable injury would be likely to result\u201d without the removal and that the Department has made reasonable efforts to prevent the removal but there are no less drastic alternatives that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>\u201creasonably protect the child\u2019s life or health pending a final hearing on the petition.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-251(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The JDR court must then hold a preliminary removal hearing within five business days of the child\u2019s removal. Code \u00a7 16.1-251(B). At the preliminary hearing, the Department must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the same elements required to obtain the emergency removal order, specifically 1) imminent threat of injury or irremediable harm; 2) reasonable efforts to prevent removal from the home; and 8) no less drastic alternative than removal exists, for the JDR court to continue the child\u2019s removal from the home. Code \u00a7 16.1-252(E). Additionally, the JDR court \u201cshall determine whether the allegations of abuse or neglect have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence,\u201d unless the parents or custodian, guardian <em>ad litem </em>or petitioning department objects. Code \u00a7 16.1-252(G). If a party to the proceeding objects, then the JDR court must schedule an adjudicatory hearing on a date within thirty days of the preliminary hearing. <em>Id. </em>If no party objects, and the JDR court finds that the child at issue was abused or neglected, the JDR court must schedule a dispositional hearing for a date within seventy-five days of the preliminary hearing. Code \u00a7 16.1-252(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Regardless of whether the JDR court requires the Department to prove the abuse or neglect at the preliminary removal hearing or the adjudicatory hearing, the Department will have to establish that the child is abused or neglected under one of the definitions listed in Code \u00a7 16.1-228. For ease of reference, throughout this opinion we will refer to the JDR court\u2019s and trial court\u2019s decision on this issue as the \u201cabused or neglected determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">As noted above, once the JDR court finds a child to be abused or neglected, it may proceed to the dispositional hearing and take evidence on one of the dispositions listed in Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2. Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A)(7) allows, <em>inter alia, </em>the JDR court to \u201c[tjerminate the rights of the parent pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 16.1-283.\u201d Because this case involves a termination of parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283, we will refer to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>final stage as either the \u201cdispositional hearing\u201d or the \u201ctermination decision.\u201d It is critical to understand that regardless of what subsection of Code \u00a7 16.1-283 the Department proceeds under, it must prove each of its allegations by clear and convincing evidence before the JDR court may terminate a parent\u2019s parental rights to his or her child. <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 747-48, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1391-92, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). Moreover, a dispositional order entered pursuant to this statutory scheme is a final order from which a party may appeal in accordance with Code \u00a7 16.1-296. Finally, when an appeal is taken to the circuit court in a case involving termination of parental rights brought under Code \u00a7 16.1-283, the circuit court is obligated to hold a <em>de novo </em>hearing on the merits of the case within ninety days of the perfecting of the appeal. Code \u00a7 16.1-296(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">II. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">On appeal, \u201cwe view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, in this case the Department.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Winchester Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>12 Va.App. 1178, 1180, 409 S.E.2d 16, 18 (1991) (citing <em>Martin v. Pittsylvania Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>3 Va.App. 15, 20, 348 S.E.2d 13, 16 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">A. The First Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">So viewed, the evidence indicated that mother has been married to father at all relevant times in this case, and father is the biological father of all the children involved in this case. Their daughter, E., was born on November 17, 2005. On the same day mother tested positive for cannabinoid, an illegal drug. On November 12, 2006, mother gave birth to premature twins, A. and W., and the twins tested positive for cocaine at birth. Just two days later, on November 14, 2006, mother tested positive for cocaine and tetrahydrocannabinol (\u201cTHC\u201d). Mother did not obtain prenatal care prior to the births of the children and did not know she was having twins until shortly before they were born.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">On November 17, 2006, the Warren County Department of Social Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d) summarily removed all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>three children from mother and father\u2019s home. Following a hearing, the juvenile and domestic relations district court (\u201cJDR court\u201d) found that all three children were abused or neglected as defined in Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1), each of them being a child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-4\">Whose parents or other person responsible for his care creates or inflicts, threatens to create or inflict, or allows to be created or inflicted upon such child a physical or mental injury by other than accidental means, or creates a substantial risk of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In January 2007, the JDR court entered a dispositional order, vesting custody of all three children with the Department. The JDR court also approved foster care plans for the children, requiring both mother and father to: maintain adequate housing, maintain income, provide household bills to the Department, maintain contact with the children, complete parental capacity evaluations, complete substance abuse evaluations and treatment, submit to drug screens, and execute releases so the Department could monitor the situation. In July 2007, the Department returned the three children to mother\u2019s and father\u2019s physical custody. In October 2007, mother and father completed their obligations under the foster care plans, and the JDR court restored full legal custody to them for all three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">B. A.\u2019s Medical Problems and the Second Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">On November 16, 2007, mother and father brought A. to a medical appointment with his pediatrician, Dr. Deborah Dunn. Dr. Dunn expressed concerns to mother and father about A.\u2019s low weight and malnourishment. A. was suffering from what Dr. Dunn later discovered was a milk allergy. Dr. Dunn scheduled a follow-up appointment for December 17, 2007, but neither parent brought A. to see Dr. Dunn on that date, nor did they reschedule the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">On March 17, 2008, mother took A. to the emergency room at Warren County Memorial Hospital (\u2018Warren County\u201d) be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>cause he was vomiting uncontrollably.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 2, 2008, Dr. Dunn saw A. again for the first time since the November 2007 appointment, when A. was referred to her after mother brought him to the emergency room for vomiting. Dr. Dunn testified that, at this point, A. was extremely thin and very sick, vomiting, and listless. Dr. Dunn admitted A. to Warren County, where he spent a week recovering from his malnourishment. At trial, Dr. Dunn testified that she had never seen another child so malnourished from a milk allergy. Dr. Dunn also noted that A.\u2019s condition would not have become so severe if mother or father had brought A. for his scheduled follow-up visit in December 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">On April 30, 2008, father allegedly returned from speaking with someone outside the home and found A. draped over a chair with one side of his body rigid, appearing as if he were having a seizure. Father administered rescue breathing and called for an ambulance. Mother was not present at the home when this incident occurred but drove to the emergency room after hearing of the incident while father stayed at home with the other two children. After Dr. Dunn stabilized A. in the emergency room at Warren County, she transferred him to University of Virginia Children\u2019s Hospital (\u201cUVA\u201d). A.\u2019s treating physician and specialists at UVA diagnosed him with subdural hematomas of varying ages along with bilateral retinal hemorrhaging. Dr. Patricia Scherrer, a pediatric critical care specialist who examined A. and oversaw his treatment at UVA, concluded that A.\u2019s head injuries were most consistent with non-accidental trauma. Dr. Scherrer based this conclusion on the lack of history to explain A.\u2019s injuries and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>further testified that none of the parents\u2019 proposed explanations\u2014A.\u2019s allegedly hitting his head on the coffee table or being hit on the head with a toy truck\u2014could have caused the type of injuries A. had sustained. Dr. Scherrer testified, contrary to mother\u2019s explanations at trial, that she knew nothing about a fall down the stairs but that she believed it could not have caused A.\u2019s injuries. Mother admitted at trial that she did not tell Dr. Scherrer about the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Dr. Dunn reviewed the reports from UVA and testified at trial that she also believed A.\u2019s injuries were consistent with non-accidental trauma. Dr. Charles Richards, an ophthalmologist who examined A. at UVA, testified that he took retinal photos of A.\u2019s eyes and concluded that he had bilateral retinal hemorrhaging. When asked about the cause of the hemorrhaging, Dr. Richards stated that he did not have enough information about A.\u2019s history and tests other treating specialists conducted to form an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. Similarly, Dr. John Jane, Jr., the pediatric neurosurgeon tending to A. at UVA, also could not form an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the cause of A.\u2019s injuries. Dr. Jane stated that he examined A. only one time and reviewed brain scans to determine whether A. would need surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">On May 1, 2008, the Department filed a petition for emergency removal of the three children and removed them from the parents\u2019 custody a second time. The following day, May 2, 2008, the Warren County Sheriffs Office started an investigation regarding the circumstances of A.\u2019s injuries. Investigator Raymond Fogle interviewed mother and father about A.\u2019s injuries. During this interview, father told Investigator Fogle that A. had fallen down some stairs in the family home in early March 2008. Investigator Fogle was unable to conduct any further interviews with mother and father because their attorneys advised the sheriffs office that neither parent would make any additional statements to the police while the civil case proceeded through the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">At trial father testified consistent with his discussion with Investigator Fogle about the fall. Father stated that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>put a gate up at the top of the stairs and went down to the basement. He guessed that A. and E. struggled at the gate and A. somehow fell down the stairs into the basement. Father testified that he found A. unconscious at the bottom of the stairs and had succeeded in reviving him through infant CPR. After A. regained consciousness, father stated that A. began running and playing with his siblings and, as a result, father did not seek medical attention for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">C. Proceedings in the JDR court</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">After the Department removed the children from the parents a second time, the JDR court held a preliminary hearing on May 9, 2008. The parents objected to the JDR court\u2019s determination of abuse or neglect at this hearing, and the JDR court set an adjudicatory hearing for June 6, 2008. At that hearing\u2014which actually occurred on July 8, 2008\u2014the JDR court found that A. was abused or neglected and that E. and W. were at risk of being abused or neglected due to the parents\u2019 treatment of A. The JDR court then scheduled the dispositional hearing for September 19, 2008, noting that the parties waived the requirement for a hearing within seventy-five days. On September 11, 2008, the Department filed petitions for termination and petitions requesting a foster care review hearing with the stated goal of adoption for each child.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">After the dispositional hearing, the JDR court entered an order on January 12, 2009, terminating both parents\u2019 parental rights to the three children pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). Both parents appealed to the circuit court. The circuit court (hereinafter \u201ctrial court\u201d) held evidentiary hearings <em>de novo </em>on November 5, 6, and 30, 2009, to determine the merits of the abuse or neglect allegations. After determining that the children were abused or neglected, the trial court set a dispositional hearing for December 8, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">D. The Abused or Neglected Determination in the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">At the hearing on the abuse or neglect petition, Jennifer Mundy testified that she had been the children\u2019s foster mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>during the first removal from November 2006 through July 2007. She asserted that father had called her in early April 2008, looking for work. Mundy stated that when she asked about the children, father admitted that A. had fallen down the stairs but said he and mother brought him to the hospital because A. started uncontrollably vomiting a few days later. Additionally, Mundy testified that during the same conversation, father said that mother told the Department that A. had hit his head on a coffee table because they were worried about the Department taking the children again. According to Mundy, father gave her the room number for A. at the hospital, and Mundy called the room to talk with mother. Mundy testified that when she told mother she knew about the fall down the stairs, mother said, \u201c[Father] shouldn\u2019t have told you that,\u201d and that \u201cthe doctors know enough already.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The parties presented testimony and physical exhibits over the course of the three-day hearing on the abused or neglected determination as summarized above. At the end of the second day of the hearing, the Department concluded its evidence, and mother made a motion to strike. Mother argued in her motion that there was no evidence that E. and W. had actually been abused or neglected and that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to find E. and W. abused or neglected solely by reason of A.\u2019s abuse or neglect. After argument on mother\u2019s motion, father made a motion to strike on similar grounds. The trial court denied both motions, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">I find, first, that the Court has jurisdiction of these cases under [Code \u00a7 ] 16.1-241. With respect to [A.], keeping in mind the standard here is a prima facie case, and ... whether the [Department has made a prima facie case that\u2019s shown that he\u2019s been abused or neglected by his parents and also, of course we know that the evidence [is viewed] in the light most favorable to the [D]epartment at a motion to strike stage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">But applying that standard, there\u2019s ample evidence to show that [A.] has been abused and neglected by his father and neglected by his mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Now, as far as the other children are concerned, this is a more difficult analysis. Again, at this stage, I find that the [Department has shown a prima facie case that the other two are at risk because of the abuse and neglect of [A.], and I\u2019m looking at [Code \u00a7 ] 16.1-278.2 ... when I say that, but also, I find that there\u2019s a prima facie that they, too, are abused or neglected under the definition contained in [Code \u00a7 ] 16.1-228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Following the court\u2019s denial of the motions to strike, mother presented her case-in-chief. Mother testified that she had another child in June 2009, F., and that she had not obtained prenatal care during her pregnancy with F. Mother explained that she did not have medical insurance during her pregnancy but was receiving Medicaid for F., and F.\u2019s drug test at birth came back negative. Mother also asserted that F. was a healthy baby, and the Department had not initiated any investigation into mother\u2019s and father\u2019s treatment of F. Mother admitted on more than one occasion during the trial that she and father had gotten into a physical altercation during an argument in January 2007. Although it was unclear who called the police, officers came to the home and arrested father. Mother testified that the case against father related to that incident was eventually dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In his case-in-chief, father testified that the January 2007 argument and physical altercation occurred when he was reviewing bills and confronted mother about approximately $8,000 that was missing. When asked whether mother had used that money to purchase drugs, father was unwilling to concede that he believed she had. He testified that he never found out what happened to the money and that it was still missing. Father did state, however, that he found mother\u2019s cocaine source and firmly told the person that mother was pregnant (with the twins W. and A.) and to stop selling drugs to her. When asked about the children\u2019s interactions with one another, father described A. as \u201cselfish, spoiled,\u201d and needing \u201cto be the center of attention.\u201d Father also testified that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the children were returned he would have to \u201cwork on [A.\u2019s] attitude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Following closing arguments, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">All right. Well, it\u2019s clear to me that [A.] was abused and neglected. The types of injuries that he sustained are not injuries that you get in routine play, falls around the house. It takes a great violence to inflict that type of injury, bilateral subdural hematoma, bilateral retinal hemorrhages, which were diffuse. These are a result of, again, great violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">Of course, the additional disturbing thing with respect to the subdural hematomas is that they were of various ages, which would indicate that he perhaps suffered the same type of abuse in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">No explanation has been offered by the person in whose care he was at the time as to how this happened. I have no hesitation in finding [father] abused [A.] and inflicted these injuries, given the evidence that I have heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">[Father\u2019s] credibility has suffered in this courtroom because of the contradictions and inconsistencies in his testimony and the contradictions between the testimony of the two parents. I also find from his testimony that there is some animus towards [A.]; he\u2019s selfish; he\u2019s an attention-getter; he\u2019s difficult; he throws temper tantrums, and all this stuff, almost as if shifting the blame to [A.] for this whole episode.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">As far as neglect, I think both parents are guilty of neglect. It went far too long between doctor visits when [A.] was a malnourished child, I mean, 16 pounds at 18 months of age. So there\u2019s no question that [A.] is abused and neglected, abused and neglected by [father] and neglected by [mother].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">Now, the more difficult question remains with respect to [W] and [E.], and quite frankly, I need some time to think about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">The following day, December 1, 2009, the trial court issued a memorandum opinion to counsel reiterating its findings that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>father abused and neglected A. and mother neglected A. The memorandum opinion also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">I find that [E.] and [W.] are in danger of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions at the hands of their parents by reason of the abuse and neglect of their sibling, [A.] This latter form of abuse or neglect is recognized by statute. I refer to ... Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A). Hence, I find that they are abused and/or neglected under the definition set forth in ... Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1). In making this determination, I also have in mind the history of these parents which includes a previous removal of these children from their home....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">E. The Dispositional Hearing in the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">On December 8, 2009, the trial court held a dispositional hearing to determine whether to grant the Department\u2019s petitions to terminate the parents\u2019 parental rights to all three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The Department commenced its case with the testimony of Dr. Bernard Lewis, a clinical psychologist and expert in parental capacity examinations. Dr. Lewis testified that he had evaluated both mother and father in 2007 at the Department\u2019s request and then again in 2009 to update the 2007 evaluations. Specific to mother, Dr. Lewis testified that she suffered from major depressive disorder, engaged in episodic cannabis abuse, had a history of cocaine abuse in apparent full remission, and had negative, paranoid, and dependent personality features. Dr. Lewis testified that during his interviews with mother, she admitted she had lied to him during the 2007 evaluation about her substance abuse issues. Dr. Lewis also noted that mother was affected by a dysfunctional marital relationship, financial problems, and difficulty accessing mental health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Specific to mother\u2019s parenting abilities, Dr. Lewis testified that mother\u2019s parenting skills were basically good, indicating her potential to adequately parent the children if she could resolve certain issues including depression, substance abuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>and her relationship with father. Dr. Lewis emphasized that if mother were unable to acknowledge that someone abused A., she would be likely to allow A. to be in a similar situation again and thus, put at risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">In response to further questioning, Dr. Lewis made several recommendations under the hypothetical assumption that the trial court would return the children to mother. He stated that she would need a prescription medication for depression along with individual counseling for her relationship problems with father and for substance abuse. Dr. Lewis admitted that some people with drug abuse problems need to go through counseling four or five times before they are able to remain completely abstinent and that there was no way to predict whether a second round of substance abuse counseling would be successful for mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Dr. Lewis testified that his evaluation of father led him to conclude that father suffered from alcohol dependence, a history of polysubstance abuse\u2014most recently marijuana, narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial traits, and back pain and cognitive impairment. Dr. Lewis also testified that father thought that he was the victim of a conspiracy in which others were out to harm him. Dr. Lewis further stated that father\u2019s occupational and financial problems were affecting him negatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Specific to father\u2019s parenting abilities, Dr. Lewis found considerable problems with father\u2019s approach. First, Dr. Lewis stated that father lacked understanding about children\u2019s developmental stages and had a poor understanding of his own strengths and weaknesses. When reviewing father\u2019s disciplinary approach, Dr. Lewis noted that father would remove the children from the situation and yell at them and that father believed \u201cgrowling\u201d worked well. Second, Dr. Lewis testified that father was unable to simply have a few drinks but regularly consumed alcohol to the point that he engaged in behaviors that were dangerous and inappropriate related to his parenting abilities. Dr. Lewis further emphasized that father could not think of anything he could have done differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ently prior to the children\u2019s recent removal except that he would have taken the children to the doctor instead of letting mother do it, and would have told the Department, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not taking my kids.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Lewis noted father\u2019s admission that he found dealing with A. \u201ctrying\u201d and that he needed a \u201crefresher course\u201d on how to handle A. Dr. Lewis explained that he felt father was a danger to the children for a number of reasons: his history with substance abuse and inability to control it; the history of physical violence between father and mother; the personality disorder that caused him to not be able to see his own faults and weaknesses but blame others; his limited parenting ability, especially with special needs children<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and that A. suffered injuries while in father\u2019s care, and the court\u2019s determination that he was at fault for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">When asked for his recommendations regarding father, Dr. Lewis stated that father had \u201ca great deal of work to do\u201d before he could be considered a minimally adequate parent. Dr. Lewis also testified that he had serious concerns about father\u2019s parenting ability should father and mother remain together and get the children back. Dr. Lewis recommended that before the trial court or Department returned the children to father, father attend a sobriety maintenance support program to help him remain free of alcohol and drug usage and engage in individual counseling. Most relevant to the children, Dr. Lewis recommended that the trial court require father to attend and complete an individualized parenting skills program that included specific education about A.\u2019s developmental and emotional issues and provided techniques for addressing the issues in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The Department then presented the testimony of one of its representatives, Melanie Trabosh. Ms. Trabosh testified about the Department\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to find a family member willing to take custody of the three children. She noted that the children\u2019s current foster family was willing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>adopt them. Ms. Trabosh admitted that the Department\u2019s initial pleading included a goal of adoption following the most recent removal, not returning the children to the parents, because the parents refused to discuss A.\u2019s injuries with them. Without any discussions, Ms. Trabosh testified, she was unable to generate a list of services to provide to mother and father.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Estelle Wilson, the children\u2019s current foster mother, corroborated Ms. Trabosh\u2019s testimony that Ms. Wilson and her husband were willing to adopt the children. She testified about the positive behavioral changes in each child and their attitudes toward one another since they began living with her. Ms. Wilson also mentioned that she and her husband received training for children with special needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Following Ms. Wilson\u2019s testimony, and at the conclusion of the Department\u2019s case, mother and father both made motions to strike the Department\u2019s, evidence supporting the petitions for termination. Father\u2019s motion to strike raised three issues. First, father argued that the petitions for termination were premature because the trial court had not entered a final order adjudicating the children to be abused or neglected and the Department had not filed a foster care plan. Second, father contended that the record contained no evidence of how A. was injured aside from the parents\u2019 testimony about the fall down the stairs, the coffee table incident, and the toy truck incident. Therefore, according to father, even accepting the trial court\u2019s finding about A.\u2019s abuse and neglect, the record contained no evidence that E. and W. were ever in severe danger to justify termination under the statute. Third, father asserted that the Department failed to produce sufficient evidence for the trial court to find that the parents could not remedy the conditions resulting in the removal in a reasonable period of time. The trial court denied father\u2019s motion and noted that the Department had a stronger case for termination against father than it had against mother. The trial court also denied mother\u2019s motion to strike based on similar rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Following the motions to strike, Ms. Trabosh testified again; this time as part of mother\u2019s case-in-chief. Ms. Trabosh testified that she felt mother\u2019s contact with the Department was insufficient because an unknown abuser inflicted a severe injury on A. and mother continued to deny that someone intentionally harmed A. Ms. Trabosh mentioned that mother told Ms. Trabosh that mother looked on the Internet for other potential causes for A.\u2019s brain injuries even after discussing the medical diagnosis with Dr. Dunn and Dr. Scherrer. In support of her case, mother testified that she benefited from the Department\u2019s services when the Department removed the children the first time and believed she could benefit from further services. Mother also asserted that she would do whatever the Department asked, including leaving father and preventing him from having any contact with the children. Mother again denied any medical neglect of A. other than \u201cmissing one doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d Mother admitted that she smoked marijuana after the Department removed the children the second time, in May 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Father\u2019s mother, Irene Farrell, testified on father\u2019s behalf. She stated that she wanted to adopt only one of the children, E., because she did not think her health problems and age would permit her to take care of all three children. Ms. Farrell admitted that father threatened father\u2019s sister, Ms. Farrell\u2019s daughter, when the sister had custody of the children during the first removal. Additionally, Ms. Farrell stated that the parents told her that the Department removed the children because A. had fallen down the steps or hit his head on a coffee table.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">At the close of the evidence, both parties renewed their motions to strike. The trial court denied both motions, and the parties presented closing arguments. The trial court took the matter under advisement and eventually entered orders terminating both mother\u2019s and father\u2019s parental rights to all three children. As to A., the trial court found that father abused him and mother neglected him. Further, the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that it was in A.\u2019s best interest to terminate both parents\u2019 rights to him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>that the neglect or abuse A. suffered presented a serious and substantial threat to his life, health, and development. Specifically, the trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">The abuse of [A.] by [father] constitutes \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d as defined by Code [\u00a7 ] 16.1-283. It is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow [A.\u2019s] safe return to his parents within a reasonable period of time. In making this determination, the court takes into consideration the efforts made to rehabilitate the parents by public and private social, medical, mental health and other rehabilitative agencies prior to [A.\u2019s] initial placement in foster care. [A.] suffered grievous injuries and the Court rejects the parents\u2019 explanation for same. The Court considers the entire case in the context of this being the second removal of [A.] by the courts. The Court further notes that substance abuse was a significant factor in the first removal, and substance abuse continued to be a problem following the return of the children....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The trial court also terminated both parents\u2019 rights to E. and W. In separate orders, the trial court made identical findings that both E. and W. were abused or neglected children whose best interest was served by terminating both parents\u2019 rights to them. Particularly, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aeg\">The Court ... further does find, by clear and convincing evidence, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">3. The neglect or abuse suffered by [E./W.] presented a serious and substantial threat to [her/his] life, health and development. It is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow [E.\u2019s/W.\u2019s] safe return to [her/his] parents within a reasonable period of time. In making this determination, the court takes into consideration the efforts made to rehabilitate the parents by public and private social, medical, mental health and other rehabilitative agencies prior to [E.\u2019s/W.\u2019s] initial placement in foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>care. [E.\u2019s/W.\u2019s] brother [A.] suffered grievous injuries, and the Court rejects the parents\u2019 explanation for same. I find that [E./W.] is in danger of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions at the hands of [her/his] parents by reason of the abuse and neglect of [her/his] sibling, [A.]. This latter form of abuse or neglect is recognized by statute. I refer to Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A). Hence, I find that [she/he] is abused and/or neglected under the definition set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1). In making this determination, I also have in mind the history of these parents which includes a previous removal of [E./W.] from [her/his] home. Substance abuse was a significant factor in the first removal, and substance abuse continued to be a problem following the return of the children....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">For all three children, the trial court further found that the Department investigated all reasonable options for placement with relatives, and no reasonable alternatives existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Both parents timely noted their appeals. During the pendency of the appeal, father and mother filed identical motions to vacate the judgments for fraud on the court. The Department filed a written response, and the trial court concluded that it did not have jurisdiction because the cases were on appeal to this Court. Neither party noted any subsequent appeals following that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">When reviewing a termination of a parent\u2019s residual parental rights, it would be unfitting to not acknowledge that \u201c \u2018[t]he termination of parental rights is a grave, drastic and irreversible action.\u2019\u201d <em>Helen W. v. Fairfax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>12 Va.App. 877, 883, 407 S.E.2d 25, 28-29 (1991) (quoting <em>Lowe v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, </em>231 Va. 277, 280, 343 S.E.2d 70, 72 (1986)). While recognizing the seriousness of such a determination, we must presume that the trial court \u201c \u2018thoroughly weighed all the evidence, considered the statutory requirements, and made its determination based on the child\u2019s [or children\u2019s] best interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fields v. Dinwiddie Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>46 Va.App. 1, 7, 614 S.E.2d 656, 659 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>(2005) (quoting <em>Farley v. Farley, </em>9 Va.App. 326, 329, 387 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1990)). Moreover, in a parental rights termination case, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s judgment, \u2018when based on evidence heard <em>ore terms, </em>will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Toms v. Hanover Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>46 Va.App. 257, 266, 616 S.E.2d 765, 769 (2005) (quoting <em>Fields, </em>46 Va.App. at 7, 614 S.E.2d at 659). \u201cIn its capacity as a factfinder ... the [trial] court retains \u2018broad discretion in making the decisions necessary to guard and to foster a child\u2019s best interests.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Farley, </em>9 Va.App. at 328, 387 S.E.2d at 795). The trial court\u2019s paramount consideration in a termination case is the best interests of the children. <em>See Logan v. Fairfax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Human Dev., </em>13 Va.App. 123, 128, 409 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">A. Assignments of Error 1 and 2: Constitutional due process and termination of parental rights</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Father argues that the trial court deprived father of his constitutional due process rights on two grounds. First, father asserts that the trial court erred in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard to its determination about father\u2019s abuse and neglect of the three children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Second, father argues that the trial court erred in upholding the constitutionality of the relevant Virginia statutes, claiming that the statutes allow termination of parental rights based on a trial court\u2019s finding of abuse or neglect by the preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>Because both challenges require us to interpret a statute and the Due Process Clause, we approach them as questions of law and apply a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, 58 </em>Va.App. 513, 519, 711 S.E.2d 251, 254 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Father\u2019s first assignment of error assumes that the trial court determined that father abused or neglected all three children under a preponderance of the evidence standard, and he argues that doing so violated his due process rights. Father\u2019s assumption ignores the plain language of the trial court\u2019s final termination orders for each child. In the final termination order for A., the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">The Court further finds <em>... by dear and convincing evidence, </em>that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">The neglect or abuse suffered by [A.] presented a serious and substantial threat to his life, health and development. The abuse of [A.] by [father] constitutes \u201caggravated circumstances\u201d as defined by Code [\u00a7 ] 16.1-283.... [A.] suffered grievous injuries and the Court rejects the parents\u2019 explanation for same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">The trial court made identical findings in its final termination orders for E. and W., stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">The Court further finds <em>... by clear and convincing evidence, </em>that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-13\">I find that [E. and W. are] in danger of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions at the hands of her [/his] parents by reason of the abuse and neglect of her [/his] sibling, [A.]. This latter form of abuse or neglect is recognized by statute. I refer to Virginia Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014278.2(A). Hence, I find that she [/he] is abused and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>neglected under the definition set forth in Virginia Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Father is correct in his primary position that, consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 747-48, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1391-92, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982), the Department needed to prove each of its allegations supporting termination of parental rights by clear and convincing evidence. Consistent with this standard, the trial court\u2019s final orders did indeed indicate that it held the Department to that higher standard; and the Department satisfied that burden. Accordingly, we find no merit in father\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Father\u2019s second assignment of error charges that the trial court erred in finding that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) passes constitutional muster because it allows termination based on a finding of abuse or neglect by a preponderance of the evidence. We have previously evaluated Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) based on a procedural due process challenge. In <em>Wright v. Alexandria Div. of Soc. Servs., </em>16 Va.App. 821, 829, 433 S.E.2d 500, 505 (1993) (citing <em>Santosky, </em>455 U.S. at 753-54, 102 S.Ct. at 1394-95), we recognized that \u201c[w]hen a state infringes upon a parent\u2019s constitutional right to the companionship of his or her child in order to protect the child from abuse and neglect, it must satisfy the mandates of procedural due process.\u201d In the context of terminating a parent\u2019s rights, the Due Process Clause requires that the Department prove each of the necessary allegations of parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Santosky, </em>455 U.S. at 768-69, 102 S.Ct. at 1402-03). In <em>Wright, </em>we confirmed that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) complies with the Due Process Clause because it requires the Department to prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">[B]ased upon <em>clear and convincing evidence, </em>that ... [termination] is in the best interests of the child and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Auf\">1. The neglect or abuse suffered by such child presented a serious and substantial threat to his life, health or development; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>2. It is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the child\u2019s safe return to his parent or parents within a reasonable period of time....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><em>See Wright, </em>16 Va.App. at 829-30, 433 S.E.2d at 505 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Father does not challenge these elements of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) directly; rather, father argues that under this statutory scheme a trial court can evaluate a case for termination having found that a child was abused or neglected by only a preponderance of the evidence in a prior hearing. This argument ignores the plain language of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(1), which requires the trial court to find by clear and convincing evidence that: \u201cThe neglect or abuse suffered by such child presented a serious and substantial threat to his life, health or development.\u201d By requiring the trial court to make this finding, the statute\u2019s plain language mandates that the trial court not only find that the child was abused or neglected, but also that the child was abused or neglected to a heightened degree, i.e., to such an extent that there is a serious threat to his life, health, or development. Stated succinctly, a trial court cannot terminate a parent\u2019s rights to his child based solely upon a finding in a prior hearing that the child was abused or neglected. The trial court must find that the abuse or neglect rose to a level that presented a substantial threat to the child\u2019s life, health, or development, and Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(1) requires that this finding be made <em>upon a showing of dear and convincing evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Moreover, father\u2019s argument assumes that once a trial court makes the initial abused or neglected finding by the preponderance of the evidence standard and then proceeds to a dispositional hearing where termination is a possibility, that termination will occur without the Department having to prove anything beyond that initial finding. This suggestion could not be more incorrect. Code \u00a7 16.1-283 requires much more before a trial court may terminate a parent\u2019s rights to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>child. Not only must the Department prove that the child was abused or neglected to the degree that his life, health, or development is substantially threatened, but it must also prove that it is not reasonably likely that a parent could substantially remedy the conditions that resulted in the neglect or abuse. Thus, a trial court cannot base its decision to terminate parental rights on a previous preliminary finding, (by the preponderance of the evidence), that a child is abused or neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">The severity of permanently separating children from their parents is a significant and compelling circumstance, but we reconfirm herein that Virginia\u2019s statutes provide parents with \u201c \u2018fundamentally fair\u2019 \u201d procedures under the Due Process Clause. <em>Wright, </em>16 Va.App. at 829, 483 S.E.2d at 505 (quoting <em>Lassiter v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>452 U.S. 18, 33, 101 S.Ct. 2153, 2163, 68 L.Ed.2d 640 (1981)). Accordingly, we find no merit in father\u2019s second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">B. Assignment of Error 3: Father\u2019s motion to dismiss the termination petitions as premature</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Father argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the Department\u2019s petitions for termination as premature because the trial court had not previously adjudicated the children as abused or neglected before the Department filed the petitions. Additionally, father contends that trying the abused or neglected petitions simultaneously with the termination petitions violated Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281 through -283 in that it deprived him of the opportunity to argue in a separate foster care review and termination proceeding that the Department should have started with a goal of returning the children home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because father challenges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant code sections and the procedures they dictate, we review this assignment of error as a question of law and therefore apply a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>See Syed v. ZH Techs., Inc., </em>280 Va. 58, 69, 694 S.E.2d 625, 631 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The record indicates that the JDR court entered adjudicatory orders regarding abuse or neglect for all three children on July 8, 2008. The Department then filed petitions for a foster care review hearing with a goal of adoption on August 22, 2008. On September 11, 2008, the Department filed the petitions for termination with the JDR court. The JDR court entered final orders terminating both parents\u2019 rights to the three children on January 12, 2009. Both parents timely noted their appeals to the trial court. The trial court concluded the abused or neglected hearings on November 30, 2009, and entered its memorandum opinion finding all three children abused or neglected on December 1, 2009. The trial court then held a dispositional hearing on December 8, 2009, to determine whether to grant the Department\u2019s petitions to terminate the parents\u2019 rights to all three children. It is unclear from the record on what date the Department filed the petitions for the foster care review hearing and the petitions for termination made in the JDR court with the trial court. However, an appeal from the JDR court to the trial court transfers the records from the JDR court to the trial court as though the case had originally been brought there. <em>See Mahoney v. Mahoney, </em>34 Va.App. 63, 66, 537 S.E.2d 626, 628 (2000) (citing Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-106 and -113; <em>Addison v. Salyer, </em>185 Va. 644, 650, 40 S.E.2d 260, 263 (1946)). Moreover, the trial court affirmed on the record at the December 8, 2009 dispositional hearing that both the petitions for foster care review with a goal of adoption and the termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>petitions filed in JDR court were filed in the trial court and made part of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Father concedes that a trial court may hold one hearing to simultaneously evaluate a foster care plan and make a termination decision, but argues that, when read together, Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281 through -288 require a separate proceeding to make the abused or neglected determination and the termination decision. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(A) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">The residual parental rights of a parent or parents may be terminated by the court as hereinafter provided in <em>a separate proceeding </em>if the petition specifically requests such relief. No petition seeking termination of residual parental rights shall be accepted by the court prior to the filing of a foster care plan, pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 16.1-281, which documents termination of residual parental rights as being in the best interests of the child. The court may hear and adjudicate a petition for termination of parental rights in the same proceeding in which the court has approved a foster care plan which documents that termination is in the best interests of the child....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Father\u2019s argument ignores our decision in <em>Stanley v. Fairfax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 596, 395 S.E.2d 199 (1990). In <em>Stanley, </em>we directly addressed the meaning of \u201cseparate proceeding\u201d in this statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-8\">We construe the term \u201cseparate proceeding\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 16.1-283 to mean a hearing separate and distinct from an abuse and neglect adjudication, entrustment disposition, or foster care placement and review. <em>This does not mean, however, that a totally separate case must be initiated in the juvenile court. </em>Rather, the statute requires that initially, a petition must be filed specifically requesting termination of parental rights so that proper notice is given. Because of the potentially drastic consequences of a termination proceeding, <em>a separate hearing must be conducted to ensure that the termination issue is not confused with other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>issues which may have been before the court previously. </em>This interpretation of the term \u201cseparate proceeding\u201d is consistent with the juvenile court statutory framework. We find that the legislature intended that this framework, rather than general rules of civil procedure, govern the manner in which cases are filed and proceed within the juvenile courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 601-02, 395 S.E.2d at 202 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Therefore, because the term, \u201cseparate proceeding\u201d only requires the trial court to hold a separate hearing to ensure that the termination issue was not confused with other issues to be resolved under the statutory scheme, and the trial court did hold separate hearings for the abused and neglected determination and the termination decision, we find no merit in father\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">C. Assignment of Error 4: Refusal of services to parents prior to termination</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Father assigns as error the trial court\u2019s refusal to require the Department to provide him and mother with further rehabilitative services prior to terminating their parental rights. Father claims that this denial is in violation of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2) and our decision in <em>Todd v. Copeland, </em>55 Va.App. 773, 689 S.E.2d 784 (2010), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, </em>282 Va. 183, 715 S.E.2d 11 (2011).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither of these authorities, however, requires a trial court to order the Department or another entity to provide rehabilitative services prior to terminating a parent\u2019s rights. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2) merely requires the trial court to \u201ctake into consideration the efforts made to rehabilitate the parent or parents by any public or private social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies prior to the child\u2019s initial placement in foster care.\u201d We have previously confirmed that this provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>sion does not require that the Department or other entity offer any services to a parent before requesting termination of the parent\u2019s rights. <em>Toms, </em>46 Va.App. at 268, 616 S.E.2d at 771 (stating that \u201c[n]othing in Code \u00a7 16.1-283 or the larger statutory scheme requires that such services be provided in all cases as a prerequisite to termination under subsection B\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The trial court explicitly stated in each of its final termination orders, \u201cIn making this determination, the court takes into consideration the efforts made to rehabilitate the parents by public and private social, medical, mental health and other rehabilitative agencies prior to [E., W., and A.\u2019s] initial placement in foster care.\u201d It therefore made the requisite finding under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2). In declining to order more services for father to remedy the conditions, the trial court had ample evidence in the record to rely on, including Ms. Trabosh\u2019s testimony as to why the Department did not create a plan for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Father cites to statements from our decision in <em>Todd </em>in support of his argument, but, even putting aside the effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s partial reversal of that decision, father\u2019s argument takes the analysis in <em>Todd </em>out of context. On brief, father quotes from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Todd, </em>arguing: \u201cCourts resort to the termination of parental rights in these situations only when the parents have exhibited, in the face of assistance from social services over an extended period of time ... a complete inability to successfully parent one\u2019s child.\u201d <em>Todd, 55 </em>Va.App. at 795, 689 S.E.2d at 795. This language in <em>Todd </em>refers to terminations proceeding under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C), not Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B). As we have previously held, there is an important distinction between these two subsections. Subsection (C) cases require provision of rehabilitative services before termination because they do not begin with a prior finding of abuse or neglect; whereas subsection (B) cases start with the abused or neglected finding and require the trial court to make a judgment about a child\u2019s best interest based on that finding. <em>See Toms, </em>46 Va.App. at 269, 616 S.E.2d at 771 (explaining the difference between subsections (B) and (C) and concluding, \u201c[sjubsection B does not create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>specific time frames, nor does it mandate that a public or private agency provide any services to a parent after the child enters foster care\u201d (internal quotations and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Because the trial court took the rehabilitative services into consideration and did not err in refusing to order the Department to provide any additional services, we find no merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">D. Assignments of Error 5 and 6: Detriment to the child and irremediable defects</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Father argues in his fifth and sixth assignments of error that the trial court could not legally terminate his rights to his children without making two particular findings by clear and convincing evidence. In his fifth assignment of error, father contends that the trial court needed to find that the maintenance of any relationship between father and the child would be a detriment to that child.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Similarly, in his sixth assignment of error, father argues that the trial court needed to find that father\u2019s defects as a parent were irremediable before terminating his parental rights to the children.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Father again cites to our decision in <em>Todd </em>for these propositions. Since once again, these assignments of error both raise questions of law, we review them under a <em>de novo </em>standard. <em>See Wilson, </em>58 Va.App. at 519, 711 S.E.2d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Copeland </em>particularly addresses father\u2019s arguments regarding the need to prove detri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ment to the child in a termination case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAI\">Inclusion of the precise language of \u201cdetriment\u201d is not necessary for these [adoption] statutes to pass constitutional muster. <em>The phrase \u201cdetriment to the child </em>\u201d <em>is no term of art or requisite mantra. </em>Rather for these [adoption] statutes to pass constitutional due process scrutiny, <em>they must provide for consideration of parental fitness and detriment to the child. </em>The Virginia statutory scheme does so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAS\"><em>Copeland, </em>282 Va. at 199, 715 S.E.2d at 20 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Thus under <em>Copeland, </em>the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause simply requires that a statute allowing a court to permanently sever the relationship between a biological parent and his child must \u201cprovide for <em>consideration </em>of parental fitness and detriment to the child\u201d but need not explicitly use those terms. <em>See id. </em>(emphasis added). Code \u00a7 16.1-28S(B) meets this standard by requiring the trial court to consider implicitly both parental fitness and detriment to the child. Before a trial court may terminate residual parental rights under subsection (B), the trial court must find that the abuse or neglect the child suffered \u201cpresents a serious and substantial threat to the child\u2019s health, life or development,\u201d thereby considering the detriment to the child. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(1). The trial court must also conclude that the parent is unlikely to be able to substantially remedy or eliminate the conditions that led to the neglect or abuse within a reasonable period of time to allow the child\u2019s safe return to his care. Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2). Consequently, the trial court must consider the parent\u2019s ability and thereby, the parent\u2019s fitness, but also must consider the detriment to the child in waiting for the parent to be able to remedy the conditions that resulted in the neglect or abuse. <em>See Kaywood v. Halifax Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 535, 540, 394 S.E.2d 492, 495 (1990) (holding that it is not in a child\u2019s best interest to wait a significant period of time to \u201cfind out when, or even if, a parent will be capable of resuming his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>responsibilities\u201d). Accordingly, we find that Code \u00a7 16.1-288(B) comports with the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent enunciation of constitutional requirements even though it does not require the trial court to make an explicit finding regarding detriment to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Father further argues that the trial court erred in not finding that his defects as a parent were irremediable. He asserts that our decision in <em>Todd </em>requires the trial court to make this finding. However, again, father takes certain language from that decision out of context. He points to the following statement from <em>Todd: </em>\u201cInstead, the <em>unfitness must be so severe and so incapable of remedy </em>that \u2018the continuance of the relationship\u2019 between the biological parent and the child would be \u2018detrimental to the child\u2019s welfare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Todd, </em>55 Va.App. at 787, 689 S.E.2d at 791 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Hickman v. Futty, </em>25 Va.App. 420, 428, 489 S.E.2d 232, 236 (1997)). We advanced this statement in describing the detriment to the child requirement and did not conclude that a trial court needed to make a finding of \u201cirremediable defects\u201d prior to allowing adoption over a biological parent\u2019s consent. Furthermore, that statement was included in the portion of our opinion that the Supreme Court later reversed, thereby eliminating any precedential effect it may have otherwise had. <em>Copeland, </em>282 Va. at 202, 715 S.E.2d at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">It is well settled that it is not in a child\u2019s best interest to wait a significant period of time to \u201cfind out when, or even if, a parent will be capable of resuming his responsibilities.\u201d <em>Kaywood, </em>10 Va.App. at 540, 394 S.E.2d at 495. Consistent with <em>Kaywood, </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) requires the trial court to find only that father was unlikely to substantially remedy or eliminate the conditions that led to the abuse or neglect within a reasonable period of time. The statute recognizes that a child is already in danger by virtue of the abused or neglected finding and requires the trial court to make a prospective determination about a parent\u2019s ability to rehabilitate himself in a reasonable period of time so as to allow the child to return to a safe environment. <em>See Newport News Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Winslow, </em>40 Va.App. 556, 562-63, 580 S.E.2d 463, 466 (2003). The trial court made the requisite findings, and we decline father\u2019s invitation to add requirements to the statute that the Supreme Court has indicated are not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">E. Assignment of Error 7: Motion to vacate for fraud on the court</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Father contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to vacate its final termination orders for fraud on the court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Yet, father did not note an appeal to the trial court\u2019s order denying his motion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Rule 5A:6 makes the timely filing of a notice of appeal to this Court mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>See Woody v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 188, 196, 670 S.E.2d 39, 43 (2008). This Court has interpreted these timeliness provisions strictly, finding compliance with them \u201c \u2018necessary for the orderly, fair and expeditious administration of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayo v. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 4 </em>Va.App. 520, 522, 358 S.E.2d 759, 761 (1987) (quoting <em>Condrey v. Childress, </em>203 Va. 755, 757, 127 S.E.2d 150, 152 (1962)). Because the record indicates that father failed to timely note an appeal of the trial court\u2019s order denying the motion to vacate, we have no jurisdiction to consider this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">F. Assignment of Error 8: Violation of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E)</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In his eighth assignment of error, father argues that the trial court violated Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) to the extent that it relied on the alleged abuse of A. to justify terminating father\u2019s rights to E. and W. Father argues that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) allows reliance only upon a prior termination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>parent\u2019s rights to a sibling, and not upon a simultaneous termination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">In his objections to the final termination order for A., father states: \u201cThis case was tried, correctly or erroneously as the case may be, under ... Code \u00a7 16.1-28S(B), rather than \u00a7 16.1-283(E).\u201d \u201cA litigant is estopped from taking a position which is inconsistent with one previously assumed, either in the course of litigation for the same cause of action....\u201d <em>Burch v. Grace St. Bldg. Corp., </em>168 Va. 329, 340, 191 S.E. 672, 677 (1937). <em>See also Hurley v. Bennett, </em>163 Va. 241, 252, 176 S.E. 171, 175 (1934) (holding that a litigant may not \u201capprobate\u201d and \u201creprobate\u201d). Based on his assertion at trial that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) was not the basis for termination of his parental rights, father is estopped from now claiming on appeal that the trial court erroneously terminated his parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E). Consequently, we decline to consider the merits of this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">G. Assignments of Error 9 and 10: Abuse or neglect of E. and W.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">In assignments of error nine and ten, father challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate his parental rights to E. and W. on multiple grounds. In assignment of error nine, he contends that the trial court erred in terminating his rights to E. and W. because it only found them to be \u201cat risk\u201d of abuse or neglect and Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) requires a finding that they were actually abused or neglected. In assignment of error ten, father challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate his rights to E. and W.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Father\u2019s first argument seems to conjoin the trial court\u2019s determination at the end of the abused or neglected trial and its findings in the final termination orders. Assignment of error nine states: \u201cThe trial court erred in terminating parental rights with respect to [W.] and [E.] because they were only at risk of abuse and neglect, whereas Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) requires that a child actually be abused before parental rights can be terminated.\u201d It cannot be determined with certainty where the \u201cat risk\u201d language that father advances emanates from, but in the event that he is identifying error in the trial court\u2019s abused or neglected determination that E. and W. were \u201cin danger of death, disfigurement, or impairment of bodily or mental functions,\u201d we will first analyze that determination and then examine the final termination orders for error.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In its December 1, 2009 memorandum opinion, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">I find that [E.] and [W.] <em>are in danger of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions at the hands of their parents </em>by reason of the abuse and neglect of their sibling, [A.] This latter form of abuse or neglect is recognized by statute. I refer to ... Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A). <em>Hence, I find that they are abused and/or neglected under the definition set forth in </em>... <em>Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1). </em>In making this determination, I also have in mind the history of these parents which includes a previous removal of these children from their home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Code \u00a7 16.1-228 defines the terms used in the juvenile and domestic relations district courts. In pertinent part, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>When used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><em>\u201cAbused or neglected child </em>\u201d means any child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">Whose parents or other person responsible for his care creates or inflicts, threatens to create or inflict, or allows to be created or inflicted upon such child a physical or mental injury by other than accidental means, or creates a substantial risk of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The trial court found E. and W. to be \u201cin danger of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions at the hands of their parents\u201d and thereby adjudicated them as abused or neglected. This Court has previously upheld an adjudication of a newborn child abused or neglected, before the child ever left the hospital with her biological mother, based, in part, on previous findings of abuse or neglect of the mother\u2019s three other children. <em>See Jenkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 1183, 409 S.E.2d at 19 (affirming the trial court\u2019s abused or neglected finding based on previous findings of abuse or neglect of mother\u2019s three other children and history with the court).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Jenkins, </em>we discussed the language of Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1) and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">[T]he statutory definitions of an abused or neglected child do not require proof of actual harm or impairment having been experienced by the child. The term \u201csubstantial risk\u201d speaks <em>in futuro </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">Accordingly, we hold that the Code contemplates intervention in such circumstances by allowing for the emergency removal of children before placement into an environment where \u201cthe child would be subjected to an imminent threat to life or health to the extent that severe or irrevers<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ible injury would be likely to result if the child were returned to or left in the custody of his parent....\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-251(A)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><em>Jenkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 1183, 409 S.E.2d at 19. As in <em>Jenkins, </em>the trial court based its decision in this case not only on the parents\u2019 treatment of A. but also on the parents\u2019 history, including a prior removal of the children from their home. The trial court adjudicated E. and W. to be \u201cneglected or abused\u201d as Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1) defines that term and proceeded to termination as permissible under the portion of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) that father cites, for \u201ca child found by the court to be neglected or abused.... \u201d Thus we find no error in the trial court\u2019s determination about the abuse or neglect of E. and W. nor its decision to proceed to termination on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Specific to termination, father\u2019s argument also ignores the plain language of the trial court\u2019s final termination orders for E. and W., which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">The Court further finds ... by clear and convincing evidence, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">[E. and W. are] in danger of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions at the hands of her parents by reason of the abuse and neglect of [her/his] sibling, [A.]. This latter form of abuse or neglect is recognized by statute. I refer to ... Code \u00a7 16.1-278.2(A). Hence, I find that [she/he] is abused and/or neglected under the definition set forth in ... Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Again, contrary to father\u2019s argument, the trial court did not find E. and W. merely \u201cat risk\u201d of abuse or neglect. The trial court found the children abused and/or neglected as that term is defined in Code \u00a7 16.1-228(1), even tracking the precise language of the statutory definition, finding that the children were \u201cin danger of death, disfigurement or impairment of bodily or mental functions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Father implicitly argues that the trial court erred because Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(1) requires a showing that \u201cThe neglect or abuse <em>suffered by </em>such child presented a serious and substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>tial threat to his life, health or development.\u201d (Emphasis added). We address this contention as merely a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence and accordingly are duty-bound to affirm the trial court\u2019s determination unless it was plainly wrong or without supporting evidence. <em>See Toms, </em>46 Va.App. at 266, 616 S.E.2d at 769. Moreover, in the analytical process, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Department because it was the prevailing party below. <em>Jenkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 1180, 409 S.E.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Father characterizes the sum of the evidence about his neglect or abuse of E. and W. as \u201ca missed medical appointment.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> He also concedes that even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that A. was abused, the record contains no evidence of any animus between father and E. and W.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The trial court cited substance abuse and the history of the prior removal in its final order. That evidence, in addition to other evidence in the record, supports the conclusion that father neglected E. and W. For example, father admitted at trial that he knew mother was using marijuana during her pregnancy with E. yet did nothing to stop her. Father also testified that he did not know mother was using cocaine during her pregnancy with W. and A., but then stated that he removed her from the person who sold her the cocaine by telling the person that she was pregnant. Father also admitted that he smoked marijuana in May 2008, after the Department removed the children the second time. Thus, father used illegal drugs again despite the Department\u2019s provision of substance abuse counseling during the first removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Dr. Lewis testified extensively about father\u2019s history with the Department starting with the first removal in 2007. He testified that father\u2019s problems with alcohol abuse began when he was a teenager. Dr. Lewis noted that father suffered from alcohol dependence, a history of polysubstance abuse, along with a narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial traits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Dr. Lewis found considerable problems with father\u2019s parenting skills, specifically because he did not adequately understand children\u2019s developmental stages nor his own strengths and weaknesses. By way of example, Dr. Lewis noted that father thought \u201cgrowling\u201d at the children was an appropriate disciplinary tool.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">When comparing father\u2019s evaluation from 2007 to the most recent evaluation in 2009, Dr. Lewis testified that father\u2019s parenting capacity had increased but that he still had significant work to do before he could be considered a minimally adequate parent. When Dr. Lewis asked father about whether he would go back and do anything differently prior to the most recent removal, father could not think of anything except that he would have taken the children to the doctor instead of letting mother do it and would have told the Department, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not taking my kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Most relevant to E. and W., however, Dr. Lewis testified that father\u2019s presence was harmful to the children and placed them at risk. When pressed about why exactly father posed a danger, Dr. Lewis stated that father was unable to simply have a few drinks but regularly consumed alcohol to the point that he engaged in behaviors that were dangerous and inappropriate related to his parenting abilities. Additionally, Dr. Lewis testified that the combination of the following makes father a danger to the children:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">1. The longstanding pattern and history of his substance abuse and his inability to control it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">2. The pattern and history of physical violence between father and mother;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">3. The personality disorder that causes him to not be able to see his own faults, weaknesses and problems, but to blame them on others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">4. His limited parenting ability, particularly with emotionally and behaviorally disturbed children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">5. The fact that A. was injured, or something happened to A., while in father\u2019s care; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>6. That the trial court later determined father was at fault for A\u2019s injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Dr. Lewis further testified that returning the children to the home with both parents living together would be dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The trial court based its finding that E. and W. were actually neglected on father\u2019s continued substance abuse and history with the Department and the court, and we cannot say that this approach was plainly wrong. <em>See Butler v. Culpeper Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>48 Va.App. 537, 550, 633 S.E.2d 196, 202 (2006) (relying on a mother\u2019s continued drug use to support terminating her parental rights under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)). Because evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s decision and it is not plainly wrong, we affirm the trial court\u2019s finding that father abused or neglected E. and W. and that the abuse or neglect presented a serious and substantial threat to their lives, health, and development.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">H. Assignments of Error 11, 12, and 13: Sufficiency of the evidence\u2014abuse and neglect of A.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Father\u2019s assignments of error eleven through thirteen challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting certain findings that the trial court made regarding A. First, in assignment of error eleven, father argues that the trial court had insufficient evidence to find that father, or mother with father\u2019s knowledge and consent, abused A. Second, father contends in assignment of error twelve that the trial court had insufficient evidence to find that any human being intentionally inflicted A.\u2019s injuries. Third, to the extent that the evidence proved father neglected A., he claims that evidence was insufficient to justify terminating father\u2019s parental rights, let alone even removing A. from the home.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">On review of a trial court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>prevailing party, in this case, the Department, and grant to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from the evidence. <em>See Toms, </em>46 Va.App. at 262, 616 S.E.2d at 767.

We do not hesitate to reiterate that a trial court\u2019s paramount consideration in a termination case is the best interests of the children. <em>See Logan, </em>13 Va.App. at 128, 409 S.E.2d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">1.

The types of injuries that he sustained are not injuries that you get in routine play, falls around the house. <em>It takes a great violence to inflict that type of injury, bilateral subdural hematoma, bilateral retinal hemorrhages, which were diffuse. These are a result of, again, great violence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">Of course, the additional disturbing thing with respect to the subdural hematomas is that <em>they were of various ages, </em>which would indicate that he perhaps suffered the same type of abuse in the past. <em>No explanation has been offered by the person in whose care he was at the time as to how this happened.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\"><em>I have no hesitation in finding [father] abused [A.] and inflicted these injuries, </em>given the evidence that I have heard. <em>His credibility has suffered in this courtroom </em>because of the contradictions and inconsistencies in his testimony and the contradictions between the testimony of the two parents. I also find from his testimony that <em>there is </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>some animus towards [A.]; he\u2019s selfish; he\u2019s an attention-getter; he\u2019s difficult; he throws temper tantrums, and all this stuff, almost as if shifting the blame to [A] for this whole episode.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The trial court, therefore, based its finding that father abused A. on the medical evidence, father\u2019s own conflicting testimony and demeanor, and the contradictions between father\u2019s and mother\u2019s testimony. Specific to the medical evidence, Dr. Scherrer testified that A.\u2019s brain injuries\u2014bilateral subdural hematomas of differing ages and bilateral retinal hemorrhages\u2014were most consistent with \u201cnon-accidental trauma.\u201d Dr. Scherrer based this determination on the lack of history to explain the injuries and ruled out the possibility that the parents\u2019 explanations\u2014blow to the head with a toy truck or hitting head on coffee table\u2014could have caused the injuries. Dr. Dunn also came to the same conclusion about the cause of A.\u2019s injuries based on the same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Father misconstrues the testimony of Drs. Jane and Richards by stating that they refused to opine that A.\u2019s injuries resulted from abuse. Dr. Richards, A.\u2019s treating ophthalmologist, stated that he did not have enough information about A.\u2019s history and other medical information to make a determination about the cause of the bilateral retinal hemorrhages. Similarly, Dr. Jane, A.\u2019s treating neurosurgeon, stated that he did not have an opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty about the cause of A.\u2019s subdural hematomas because he was consulted only to determine whether A. needed surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The evidence was undisputed that father was A.\u2019s caretaker each time he had a \u201cseizure\u201d and needed medical attention. The trial court was in the unique position to observe father\u2019s demeanor on the witness stand and ultimately determined that he lacked credibility. <em>See King v. Int\u2019l Harvester Co., </em>212 Va. 78, 84, 181 S.E.2d 656, 660 (1971) (according great weight to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact because it is in a better position than an appellate court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>observe a witness\u2019 \u201cdemeanor, appearance, candor and behavior on the witness stand\u201d). We are not permitted to conduct a trial <em>de novo </em>on appeal to second guess a trial court\u2019s credibility determination. Both parents offered various explanations for A.\u2019s injuries during their testimony, and the trial court explicitly rejected these explanations in its final termination orders for each child. The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion about father\u2019s attitude toward A., and the statements the trial court quoted came directly from father\u2019s testimony. The record further supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion about conflicts between father\u2019s testimony and mother\u2019s testimony. Consequently, we find that the evidence was sufficient for the trial court to conclude that father abused A. and intentionally inflicted A.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">2. Father\u2019s neglect of A.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Father asserts that to the extent the Department proved he neglected A., that neglect was insufficient as a matter of law to justify terminating his parental rights to A. or even to justify removing A. from the home. Particular to the neglect inquiry, as opposed to abuse, the trial court stated on the record at the conclusion of the abuse and neglect trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqr\">As far as neglect, I think both parents are guilty of neglect. It went far too long between doctor visits when [A.] was a malnourished child, I mean, 16 pounds at 18 months of age. So there\u2019s no question that [A.] is abused and neglected, abused and neglected by his father and neglected by his mother.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In both the December 1, 2009 memorandum opinion and the final termination order for A., the trial court noted that it considered the case in the context of it being the second removal of the children. In the final termination order for A., the trial court further intimated that it also based its decision on the parents\u2019 continued problems with substance abuse. As discussed above, the trial court had ample evidence about father\u2019s substance abuse and lack of progress between the first and second removal to determine that father neglected A.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>We find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to rely on the same evidence for all three children. The record indicates that father was regularly the sole caretaker of all three children, and it was during these times when A. suffered grievous injuries. Even if we assume father\u2019s explanations about A.\u2019s injuries were true, the trial court could have concluded that father neglected A. in failing to seek medical attention for him after he allegedly fell down the stairs and was unconscious. Additionally, father is equally as culpable as mother for failing to ensure that A.\u2019s malnourishment issues were addressed in a reasonable period of time instead of waiting until A. was violently ill. Accordingly, we find no merit in these assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">I. Assignment of Error 14: Returning E. and W. home</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Father\u2019s fourteenth assignment of error states: \u201cThe trial court erred in finding under any standard of proof that there were no circumstances under which any one or more of the children could within a reasonable time be returned to [father\u2019s] home.\u201d Under this assignment of error, father challenges both the legal standard the trial court applied and the evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate his rights to E. and W. under the second prong of Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014283(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Initially, we recognize that the appropriate legal standard for addressing a question of law is <em>de novo. Wilson, </em>58 Va.App. at 519, 711 S.E.2d at 254. Next, when addressing the sufficiency argument, we are compelled to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Department as the prevailing party below. <em>Jenkins, </em>12 Va.App. at 1180, 409 S.E.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Father contends that our decision in <em>Todd </em>required the trial court to find that there were no circumstances under which one or more of the children could be returned to father\u2019s home before terminating his parental rights. While recognizing the Supreme Court\u2019s partial reversal of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Todd </em>on other grounds, we find that this did not effect any change to the termination statutes analyzed in <em>Todd. </em>Thus, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>reconfirm our holding in <em>Todd </em>in this regard where we explicitly affirmed the constitutionality of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">Finally, we note that this conclusion [that the detriment to the child standard exists independent of the Code] is consistent with the Code\u2019s treatment of children who are in the care of social services.... Code \u00a7 16.1-283, which governs the termination of residual parental rights of parents whose children have been placed in foster care, requires more than a finding that the termination will be in the best interest of the child. Instead, the statute sets forth several other required findings <em>in addition </em>to a determination that the termination would be in the child\u2019s best interests in order to justify a termination of parental rights. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-6\"><em>Todd, 55 </em>Va.App. at 790 n. 8, 689 S.E.2d at 792 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We again decline father\u2019s invitation to fault the trial court for failing to make findings that our statutes do not require. The trial court was required to find under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2) that father was not reasonably likely to substantially remedy or eliminate the conditions resulting in the neglect or abuse within a reasonable period of time so as to allow the children to safely return to his care, and nothing more. In addition to the evidence we have already reviewed about father\u2019s relationship with the children, Virginia\u2019s jurisprudence recognizes that \u201cpast actions and relationships over a meaningful period serve as good indicators of what the future may be expected to hold.\u201d <em>Winfield v. Urquhart, 25 </em>Va.App. 688, 695-96, 492 S.E.2d 464, 467 (1997). The record indicates that the court removed the children the first time because of the parents\u2019 substance abuse, and, despite the parents\u2019 receiving substance abuse and individual counseling over the course of six months, the court had to remove the children again for arguably more severe issues, including A.\u2019s brain injuries. The trial court specifically noted the severity of these injuries, finding in its final termination order for A. that the injuries father inflicted constituted \u201c \u2018aggravated circumstances\u2019 as defined by Code [\u00a7 ]16.1-283.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Moreover, Dr. Lewis\u2019s evaluation following the removal indicated that father had not resolved his substance abuse issues and had serious deficiencies as a parent, despite the services he received after the first removal. As noted above, Dr. Lewis was clear about why father is a danger to the children and how his presence is harmful and puts the children at risk. Hence, we find that the record contained sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion under Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Father again raises arguments about Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E) under this assignment of error, and consistent with our analysis above, we conclude that he is estopped from raising them. Therefore, we find no merit in this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">J. Assignment of Error 16: Evidence of mother\u2019s failure to obtain prenatal care</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Father contends that the trial court erred in permitting the Department to introduce evidence that mother failed to obtain prenatal care.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He challenges this decision on two grounds: first, that <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), gives mother a privacy right in her decision to not obtain prenatal care, and second, that res judicata barred the introduction of this evidence. Because both issues raise a question of law, we review them <em>de novo. See Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 127-28, 510 S.E.2d 255, 259 (1999) (holding that res judicata is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal); <em>see also Hancock-Underwood v. Knight, </em>277 Va. 127, 131, 670 S.E.2d 720, 722 (2009) (confirming that whether a privilege applies is a question of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Father contends that the United State Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roe </em>recognizes a woman\u2019s right to privacy in her decision to terminate her pregnancy and can also be interpreted to bar the introduction of evidence of a woman\u2019s failure to obtain prenatal care under any circumstances. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>disagree. As <em>Roe </em>itself demonstrates, and the trial court correctly concluded, the holding in <em>Roe </em>does not extend to that degree. Incidentally, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit applied <em>Roe </em>in a case involving interpretation of Virginia law, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">[I]n <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), and <em>Doe v. Bolton, </em>410 U.S. 179, 93 S.Ct. 739, 35 L.Ed.2d 201 (1973), the Court recognized a related right of privacy\u2014the right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy by an abortion, unqualified to the end of the first trimester of pregnancy and <em>qualified thereafter by proper state regulation to preserve the state\u2019s interest in the preservation and protection of maternal health and preservation of the life of a viable fetus.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><em>Lovisi v. Slayton, </em>539 F.2d 349, 353-54 (4th Cir.1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Court continued: \u201cThe \u2018right of privacy,\u2019 apt in some cases, is a misleading misnomer in others including this one. This freedom may be termed more accurately \u2018the right to be let alone,\u2019 or personal autonomy, or simply \u2018personhood.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356. Implicit in this construction is the conclusion that while <em>Roe </em>may protect a woman from certain state regulations regarding abortion and prenatal care, it has nothing to do with the admissibility of evidence. It is inapplicable in cases such as this one when the state is simply preserving and protecting \u201cmaternal health and preservation of the life of\u2019 children who have moved past the \u201cviable fetus\u201d stage and are now living and growing. Simply put, nothing in the holding of <em>Roe </em>prohibits a trial court from considering a mother\u2019s refusal to seek prenatal care in determining whether that child, once born, is at risk of abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Father also claims that res judicata bars the evidence of mother\u2019s failure to obtain prenatal care for the three children in the case at bar because the same issue was before the trial court in the prior removal action, and a final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>ment was entered in favor of the parents.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In actions commenced after July 1, 2006, Rule 1:6 governs claims of res judicata, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">A party whose claim for relief <em>arising from identified conduct, a transaction, or an occurrence, </em>is decided on the merits by a final judgment, shall be forever barred from prosecuting any second or subsequent civil action against the same opposing party or parties on any claim or cause of action <em>that arises from that same conduct, transaction or occurrence </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The claim for relief in the case at bar does not arise from the \u201csame conduct, transaction or occurrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the first case, the Department removed the children after W. and A.\u2019s birth because they were born with cocaine in their systems, and E. was born exposed to marijuana one year earlier. Whereas, in the second case, the Department removed the children and petitioned for termination after A. suffered from severe brain injuries that the trial court determined father inflicted. Because the doctrine of res judicata does not apply, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to consider evidence of mother\u2019s failure to obtain prenatal care.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Therefore, we find no merit in either of father\u2019s arguments under this assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">K. Assignment of Error 17: Evidence of mother\u2019s illegal drug use during her pregnancy with W. and A.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Under this assignment of error, father raises the same argument regarding res judicata as he raised in the previous assignment of error about mother\u2019s failure to obtain prenatal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>care.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We find no merit in this assignment of error for the same reasons as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">L. Assignment of Error 18: Dr. Scherrer\u2019s opinion about the cause of A.\u2019s injuries</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Father argues that the trial court erred in admitting Dr. Scherrer\u2019s opinion because it was not expressed to \u201csufficient medical certainty\u201d to qualify for admission as an expert opinion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The decision whether to admit expert testimony rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and therefore we will not reverse unless the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Riverside Owner, L.L.C. v. Richmond, </em>282 Va. 62, 73, 711 S.E.2d 533, 539 (2011). Expert testimony \u201cis admissible in civil cases to assist the trier of fact, if the testimony meets certain fundamental requirements, including the requirement that it be based on an adequate factual foundation.\u201d <em>Countryside Corp. v. Taylor, </em>263 Va. 549, 553, 561 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2002); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-401.1 and -401.3. Expert testimony is thus \u201cinadmissible if it is speculative or founded on assumptions that have an insufficient factual basis.\u201d <em>John v. Im, </em>263 Va. 315, 320, 559 S.E.2d 694, 696 (2002). Additionally, \u201cexpert testimony is inadmissible if the expert fails to consider all the variables that bear upon the inferences to be deduced from the facts observed.\u201d <em>Vasquez v. Mabini, </em>269 Va. 155, 160, 606 S.E.2d 809, 811 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">When the physical condition of a patient is at issue in a civil action, the diagnoses of medical experts about that condition must be expressed to a reasonable degree of medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>probability or they are inadmissible. Code \u00a7 8.01-399(B). Any testimony about a diagnosis that a medical expert admits is not competent to a reasonable degree of medical certainty is inadmissible and speculative. <em>See Pettus v. Gottfried, </em>269 Va. 69, 78, 606 S.E.2d 819, 825 (2005). Virginia law draws a critical distinction between statements by experts that are opinions in the form of medical diagnoses and mere factual impressions based on treating the patient at issue. <em>Graham v. Cook, </em>278 Va. 233, 244, 682 S.E.2d 535, 541 (2009). Expert testimony that communicates a medical diagnosis must be stated to a reasonable degree of medical probability. <em>Id. </em>(citing Code \u00a7 8.01-399(13)). Expert testimony conveying impressions that are \u201cfactual in nature,\u201d however, need not be stated to that same degree. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">During the Department\u2019s questioning of Dr. Scherrer during her <em>de bene esse </em>deposition, the following exchanges took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">Q: What was to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, what was [A.\u2019s] medical condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">A: He had extensive bilateral retinal and pre-retinal hemorrhages, and old and new subdural hematomas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">Q: And what else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">A: The clinical diagnosis based on those findings, as well as the lack of history to explain it, again, were most consistent with non-accidental trauma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">Q: You\u2019ve stated that the history provided to you as to the injuries would not have been sufficient to cause this degree of damage. Is this your opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">A: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">Q: Would you please explain this opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-13\">A: The history that we were provided, which included a previous fall that [A.] experienced, I believe, in the middle of March where he hit his head upon the coffee table, and then he had been hit in the head three days prior to being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>admitted this time by a toy truck, were not sufficient to cause bilateral significant retinal hemorrhages, nor the old and new subdural hematomas in the absence of a significant bleeding disorder, or the absence of some other very significant trauma.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">Q: Subject to the objection, in your opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, could a fall down the stairs have caused the retinal hemorrhages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">A: No, it could not have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">Q: Are the medical opinions which you offered during this deposition true to a medical degree of\u2014or true to a reasonable degree of medical certainty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Regardless of whether we hold that Dr. Scherrer\u2019s statement about the cause of A.\u2019s injuries was a medical diagnosis or a factual impression based on her treatment of him, she stated that it was her opinion to a reasonable degree of medical certainty. In coming to this conclusion Dr. Scherrer asserted that she relied on facts, data, and opinions commonly relied upon by experts in her field, and specifically identified those items in her deposition. She stated, in not so many words, that because she had no other explanation from A.\u2019s history about the injuries and no outward signs of trauma, she could not come to any conclusion other than that they were caused by non-accidental trauma. Despite mother\u2019s concealment of A.\u2019s fall down the stairs, Dr. Scherrer addressed it and stated that it could not have caused the retinal hemorrhages.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">Dr. Scherrer\u2019s opinion about the cause of A.\u2019s injuries was based on the history provided to her and the treating teams\u2019 findings from their examination of A., not speculation. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in accepting her expert opinion about the cause of A.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>M. Assignment of Error 19: Dr. Dunn\u2019s expert opinion about A.\u2019s abuse</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Father assigns error to the trial court\u2019s admission of Dr. Dunn\u2019s expert opinion about the cause of A.\u2019s injuries on two grounds.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> First, father argues that permitting her to give an expert opinion approximately a month after she gave a deposition disclaiming any expert opinion was an unfair surprise to him. Second, father contends that Dr. Dunn was not qualified to give an expert opinion on whether A. had been abused or not. Again we review these arguments for an abuse of discretion. <em>Riverside, </em>282 Va. at 73, 711 S.E.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Rule 4:1(b) includes the requirements for expert designations and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-6\">(4) <em>Trial Preparation: Experts; Costs\u2014Special Provisions for Eminent Domain </em>Proceedings.\u2014Discovery of facts known and opinions held by experts, otherwise discoverable under the provisions of subdivision (b)(1) of this Rule and acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for trial, may be obtained only as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">(A) (i) <em>A party may through interrogatories require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert </em>witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Father did not propound an interrogatory asking for expert designations, and the Department brought this fact to the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>court\u2019s attention when father objected to Dr. Dunn\u2019s qualification as an expert witness. The Department also noted that despite not receiving this interrogatory, it produced hundreds of pages of Dr. Dunn\u2019s records and notes about A. Moreover, Dr. Dunn gave several other expert opinions during the same discovery deposition when she stated she was not testifying as an expert. The trial court noted father\u2019s concerns about the timing but stated that Dr. Dunn\u2019s records had been made available to defense counsel and that she was present in court and subject to cross-examination. Because the Department did not fail to comply with an interrogatory requesting expert designations or pre-trial disclosure of expert opinions and father was aware of the information Dr. Dunn was using to form her opinions, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Dunn to qualify as an expert. <em>See Norfolk &amp; Portsmouth Belt Line R.R. Co. v. Wilson, </em>276 Va. 739, 745, 667 S.E.2d 735, 738 (2008) (holding appellant\u2019s claim of error relating to failure to fully comply with Rule 4:1\u2019s expert disclosure requirements was moot because appellant was now fully aware of the substance of the expert\u2019s testimony if the case were retried on remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The second half of father\u2019s argument under this assignment of error is that Dr. Dunn, as a pediatrician, was not qualified to give an opinion as to the cause of A.\u2019s injuries. The trial court addressed this issue squarely, noting: \u201cI\u2019ll certainly deem her to be an expert in pediatrics.... To the extent that her experience with the types of injuries that we\u2019re dealing -with in this case is limited, that\u2019ll go to the weight that I give that testimony as opposed to the qualification.\u201d In concluding that father abused A., the trial court did not state that it relied solely on Dr. Dunn\u2019s conclusion about the cause of A.\u2019s injuries. The trial court could have completely ignored Dr. Dunn\u2019s opinion on this issue and relied solely on Dr. Scherrer\u2019s testimony because Dr. Scherrer also concluded that someone intentionally inflicted A.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Even assuming that the trial court accepted Dr. Dunn\u2019s conclusion on the issue of abuse, we cannot say that doing so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>was an abuse of discretion. Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-401.1 and -401.3 provide applicable guidance for expert witnesses. Code \u00a7 8.01-401.1 allows an expert witness to \u201crender an opinion or draw inferences from facts, circumstances or data\u201d she knew or perceived before the hearing, and they need not be admissible in and of themselves if they are \u201cof a type normally relied upon by others in the particular field of expertise....\u201d More pertinent to this case, Code \u00a7 8.01-401.3 allows an expert witness to testify to the ultimate issue if she qualifies by \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d Dr. Dunn concluded that A.\u2019s injuries were consistent with non-accidental trauma based on her knowledge of A.\u2019s medical history, her experience with trauma injuries in children, and her medical education. She testified that these resources indicated to her that a child with both diffuse, bilateral subdural hematomas and bilateral retinal hemorrhages and no outward signs of physical injury did not incur these injuries accidentally. Dr. Dunn was also A.\u2019s pediatrician from birth, examined him when he came into the hospital on April 30, 2008, and reviewed the reports of the various doctors who treated A. at UVA. These bases comport with our statutes and case law related to expert opinions and do not indicate that Dr. Dunn based her opinion on speculation. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Dunn to testify to the cause of A.\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit in any of father\u2019s assignments of error. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\">. Father withdrew his fifteenth assignment of error on brief, so we will not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\">. At trial, mother provided various conflicting accounts of how A. sustained a head injury shortly before the vomiting began. She testified that although father told her that A. had fallen down the stairs prior to this visit, she did not tell the doctors about it. Mother also testified that a few days prior A. had hit his head on a coffee table, but she did not seek any treatment for A. at that time because he did not cry or seem hurt. She did acknowledge that the blow left a mark. Additionally, mother asserted that W. hit A. on the head with a toy truck later in March.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">. Although the parties disagree as to the timing, they agreed that, at some point, doctors identified A. as a special needs child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b447-6\">. Assignment of Error 1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">The trial court erred in applying the preponderance of the evidence standard for a finding of abuse and neglect on the part of [father] against each of the three children in this case when the standard under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution to terminate a fundamental right such as the right of a parent to parent a child and the right of a child to his or her parents' care must be clear and convincing evidence rather than preponderance of the evidence.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\">. Assignment of Error 2 states: \"The trial court erred in upholding the Virginia statutes against Federal Constitutional attack to the extent that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>they permit removal of a child or termination of parental rights to a child based on a finding of abuse or neglect by the preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\">. Assignment of Error 3 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">The trial court erred in overruling [father's] motion to dismiss the petitions for termination of parental rights as premature because there had been no finding of abuse/neglect at the time these petitions were brought; trying the abuse/neglect petitions simultaneously with the termination petitions violated Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-281 through -283 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>inclusive by depriving [father] of the right to participate in a separate foster care review and termination proceeding and to argue in that proceeding that the goal should have started as returning the children home to their parents.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">. Assignment of Error 4 states: \"The trial court erred in permitting the Department to proceed to termination of parental rights while simultaneously refusing all services to the parents, in violation of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2) and of <em>Todd v.

Assignment of Error 5 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">The trial court erred in not requiring in the case of each child proof by clear and convincing evidence with respect to termination of parental rights that the maintenance of any relationship between [father] and that child would be a detriment to that child, independent of the best interests test.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b456-10\">. Assignment of Error 6 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">The trial court erred in not requiring that the Department prove that the defects of [father] as a parent are irremediable, as required in <em>Todd v.

Although decided in the context of the Commonwealth\u2019s adoption statutes, the principle is equally applicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\">.

The trial court denied the motion because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction as the case was on appeal to this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b460-8\">. Assignment of Error 8 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">To the extent that the trial court relied on the alleged abuse of [A.] as evidence for the termination of [father\u2019s] rights to [W.] and [E.], the trial court violated Code \u00a7 16.1-283(E), in that the statute only allows reliance on a prior termination as to a sibling, not a simultaneous termination as attempted in this case.

Therefore, it was error both as to fact and law to remove [E.] and [W.] or either of them from their parents where the claimed abusive acts by [father] were directed exclusively at [A.] to the extent that they occurred at all.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">. We note that the portion of <em>Jenkins </em>mentioned is especially applicable to this assignment of error because it addresses only the trial court\u2019s abused or neglected determination. Similarly, we limit this portion of our opinion to the trial court\u2019s abused or neglected determination before moving to its subsequent termination decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. We note for the record that the evidence about a missed medical appointment related to A., not E. or W.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b466-9\">. Assignment of Error 13 states: \"Regardless of the standard applied, to the extent that there was proved any neglect of [A.] by [father], such neglect was insufficient as a matter of law to justify terminating his parental rights or even to justify removing [A.] from the home.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b472-8\">.

Father additionally contends that this evidence was inadmissible because the Department\u2019s case had to rest on actions or omissions after the date of the first final judgment returning the children to the parents' custody on October 12, 2007.
