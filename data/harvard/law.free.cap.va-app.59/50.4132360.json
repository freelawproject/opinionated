BEALES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Donald C. Burriesci (appellant) pled guilty to one count of obtaining by false pretenses currency with a value of more than $200, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-178. On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion at sentencing when it ordered appellant to pay $180,082 in restitution to the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (DMAS), the victim in this case. Appellant contends that the Commonwealth failed to establish the amount of \u201cactual loss\u201d that resulted from his criminal conduct. Finding no abuse of discretion by the trial court, we affirm the trial court\u2019s order of restitution for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">At all times relevant to this appeal, appellant owned and operated Alliance for Seniors, a company that provided personal and respite care services to Medicaid-eligible clients in the Richmond area. Appellant (as owner and operator of the company) entered into a Medicaid provider agreement with DMAS, which administers the Medicaid program in Virginia. As a condition of the Medicaid provider agreement, appellant agreed to abide by Medicaid\u2019s regulations for the providing of care to Medicaid recipients and to abide by Medicaid\u2019s regulations concerning the billing and payment for services rendered to Medicaid recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Appellant\u2019s company employed personal care aides (PCAs). The responsibilities of a PCA include assisting a Medicaid-eligible client with household services essential to the client\u2019s health inside the home and reporting changes in the client\u2019s condition or needs. Medicaid\u2019s regulations require that personal care services are rendered by fully trained PCAs, who have received a minimum of 40 hours of training relevant to the responsibilities of a PCA. Furthermore, Medicaid\u2019s regulations forbid prospective PCAs from \u201ctesting-out\u201d in lieu of the required training or being \u201cgrandfathered-in\u201d based on past experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>In disregard of Medicaid\u2019s regulations, appellant employed persons as PCAs who had not completed the required training\u2014and many who had received no relevant training at all. Appellant then sought and received reimbursement from DMAS after representing that these persons were fully qualified PCAs with the required training.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In a stipulated statement of facts that was submitted to the trial court, appellant admitted to devising the following \u201cscheme\u201d to defraud the Medicaid program:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">[Appellant] allowed PCAs he employed at Alliance to \u201ctest out\u201d or be \u201cgrandfathered in\u201d rather than take the 40 hours of DMAS approved training as required by Medicaid. The untrained PCAs were then assigned to Medicaid recipients to provide personal and/or respite care. [Appellant] subsequently billed Medicaid, and received payment from Medicaid, for \u201cservices\u201d provided by the untrained and unqualified PCAs. Further, false training certificates were created to cover up the lack of training. The false certificates were signed by a registered nurse that purportedly taught the training, provided a date that training took place, and represented that the full 40 hours of approved training had been provided to the PCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Appellant further stipulated that he \u201cextracted] money from Alliance PCAs, to which he was not entitled, by charging and receiving payment from Alliance employees for false PCA training certificates that were worthless and invalid according to DMAS regulations, and therefore non-transferable to other personal care provider agencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Upon accepting appellant\u2019s guilty plea for one count of obtaining money by false pretenses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial court sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>appellant to a 20-year sentence (suspending the entire sentence) and continued the matter for a hearing to determine restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">At the restitution hearing, the Commonwealth presented a 12-page exhibit indicating that appellant had received reimbursements from DMAS totaling $180,082 for the services of purportedly fully trained PCAs who had actually received no relevant PCA training.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth asserted that the amount of this \u201coverpayment\u201d\u2014money DMAS never would have paid, if it had known that these employees had received no PCA training\u2014represented an amount of restitution that was appropriately attributable to appellant\u2019s criminal offense. In response, appellant claimed that the services of these admittedly untrained and unqualified persons must have provided some (unknown) amount of value to DMAS, and he argued that the Commonwealth failed to establish the amount of \u201cactual loss\u201d suffered by DMAS in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The trial court ultimately rejected appellant\u2019s argument, explaining, \u201c[I]f they did not have the training that DMAS requires[, then] there is no value received from their services.\u201d Thus, the trial court ordered appellant to pay restitution to DMAS in the amount of $180,082 (the amount of money DMAS reimbursed appellant for the services of his employees who had actually received no PCA training)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>appellant on probation for the purpose of monitoring appellant\u2019s compliance with this restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered him to pay $180,082 in restitution to DMAS. He contends that the trial court\u2019s restitution order erroneously reflects the amount of appellant\u2019s profit from his fraudulent reimbursement claims to DMAS, rather than DMAS\u2019s \u201cactual loss,\u201d which he claims was never proven at the restitution hearing. We disagree with appellant\u2019s argument in light of Virginia\u2019s well-established principles governing restitution orders in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">A. THE DISCRETION OF A TRIAL COURT TO ORDER RESTITUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In Virginia, when a trial court suspends a defendant\u2019s sentence or orders probation, the trial court has authority to order that the defendant \u201cmake at least partial restitution\u201d to an \u201caggrieved party or parties for damages or loss caused by\u201d the offense or offenses for which the defendant was convicted. Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-303 and 19.2-305(B); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(A). \u201cThe statutes dealing with probation and suspension are remedial and intended to give the trial court valuable tools to help rehabilitate an offender through the use of probation, suspension of all or part of a sentence, and/or restitution payments.\u201d <em>Howell v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 737, 740, 652 S.E.2d 107, 108 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">A trial court has \u201cwide latitude\u201d to make sentencing decisions, such as the ordering of restitution, <em>Deal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 157, 160, 421 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1992), because \u201c[t]he determination of sentencing lies within the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 733, 735, 652 S.E.2d 109, 111 (2007). \u201cA sentencing decision will not be reversed unless the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOn appeal, where the restitutionary amount is supported by a preponderance of the evidence and is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u2018reasonable in relation to the nature of the offense,\u2019 the determination of the trial court will not be reversed.\u201d <em>McCullough v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 811, 817, 568 S.E.2d 449, 451-52 (2002) (quoting <em>Deal, </em>15 Va.App. at 160-61, 421 S.E.2d at 899); <em>see Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 26, 30 n. 2, 660 S.E.2d 691, 693 n. 2 (2008) (noting the well-established preponderance of the evidence standard that is to be used when determining the amount of restitution). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[o]nly when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u2019\u201d <em>Grattan v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 602, 620, 685 S.E.2d 634, 644 (2009) (quoting <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">B. INAPPLICABILITY OF THE DECISION IN <em>HOWELL V. COMMONWEALTH</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">In <em>Howell, </em>274 Va. at 739, 652 S.E.2d at 107, the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered the defendant in that case to pay restitution to the victims for the cost of a security system that was installed after the defendant burglarized their business. In reversing the order of restitution in <em>Howell, </em>the Supreme Court explained that a restitution order may include only those damages or losses \u201cwhich were directly caused by the offense\u201d committed by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 741, 652 S.E.2d at 108 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe installation of a security system, while related to [the defendant\u2019s] burglary, was not <em>caused </em>by the offense as required by Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-303, -305(B), -305.1(A).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 741, 652 S.E.2d at 109 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Therefore, in <em>Howell, </em>the trial court\u2019s restitution order in that ease had been premised on an erroneous legal conclusion\u2014that damages or losses to the victim that \u201cresult only indirectly from the offense\u201d may be included in an order of restitution. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As both the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court of Virginia have explained, a trial court \u201c \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>law.... The abuse-of-discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Porter v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 203, 260, 661 S.E.2d 415, 445 (2008) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047-48, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In this ease, however, unlike in <em>Howell, </em>no such abuse of discretion occurred. The issue before the trial court here was not whether appellant\u2019s criminal offense constituted the direct cause or simply an indirect cause of DMAS\u2019s loss\u2014appellant\u2019s offense of obtaining money from DMAS by false pretenses certainly was the <em>direct </em>cause of the loss claimed by the Commonwealth. Appellant\u2019s own trial counsel acknowledged at the restitution hearing that the decision in <em>Howell </em>was not controlling on the facts of this case, noting that <em>Howell </em>was \u201cnot factually an analogous case.\u201d Therefore, contrary to appellant\u2019s position on appeal, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Howell </em>actually provides no indication that the trial court in this case abused its discretion when it ordered appellant to pay $180,082 in restitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">C. NO ABUSE OF DISCRETION BY THE TRIAL COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Here, the trial court considered all of the circumstances relevant to restitution and found that the loss to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>DMAS caused by appellant\u2019s offense was $180,082. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-303, 19.2-305(B), 19.2-305.1(A). Nothing in the record on appeal establishes that this finding by the trial court was arbitrary or otherwise constituted an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion at sentencing. <em>See Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 357, 367, 38 S.E.2d 479, 484 (1946) (explaining that the exercise of a judicial discretion \u201c \u2018implies conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Burns v. United States, </em>287 U.S. 216, 222-23, 53 S.Ct. 154, 156, 77 L.Ed. 266 (1932))); <em>see also Rhodes v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 645, 650, 613 S.E.2d 466, 469 (2005). Indeed, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant owed DMAS restitution in the amount of $180,082 was supported by a preponderance of the evidence and was reasonable in relation to the offense. <em>See McCullough, </em>38 Va.App. at 817, 568 S.E.2d at 451-52; <em>Deal, </em>15 Va.App. at 160-61, 421 S.E.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The following evidence supported the trial court\u2019s restitution order in this case. Appellant stipulated in the signed statement of facts that he was aware that \u201cMedicaid requires that personal care services be rendered by a fully trained PCA.\u201d Appellant also stipulated that he \u201cextract[ed] monies from Medicaid to which he was not entitled\u201d when he \u201cbilled Medicaid, and received payment from Medicaid, for \u2018services\u2019 provided by the <em>untrained and unqualified </em>PCAs.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellant further stipulated in this signed statement of facts that these \u201cservices\u201d were provided by employees of appellant\u2019s company who held falsified certifications that \u201cwere <em>worthless and invalid </em>\u201d under the requirements established by Medicaid and DMAS. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In light of this evidence, the trial court found that DMAS received \u201cno value\u201d from the services of these employees who actually had no PCA training at all. This finding by the trial court was not plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 26, 39, 639 S.E.2d 217, 224 (2007) (\u201cOn review, we will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence.\u201d). According to the stipulated statement of facts, those employees of appellant\u2019s company were wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u201cunqualified\u201d to work as PCAs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> They did not, <em>by definition, </em>provide personal care services\u2014given appellant\u2019s stipulation that personal care services can only be \u201crendered by a fully trained PCA.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at the restitution hearing established that DMAS paid appellant $180,082 for what appellant <em>claimed </em>were personal care services but were actually provided by persons who had received no PCA training at all. Consistent with the explanation by the Supreme Court of the United States that a trial court may consider at sentencing \u201cresponsible unsworn or \u2018out-of-court\u2019 information relative to the circumstances of the crime,\u201d <em>Williams v. Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 584, 79 S.Ct. 421, 426, 3 L.Ed.2d 516 (1959), this evidence certainly informed the trial court\u2019s calculation of the amount of loss to DMAS that was caused by appellant\u2019s offense. <em>See Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>252, 259 n. 2, 450 S.E.2d 765, 769 n. 2 (1994) (holding that trial courts may properly consider victim impact statements when determining the appropriate amount of restitution owed by a defendant). The trial court was under no obligation to accept appellant\u2019s wholly speculative assertion that his untrained and unqualified employees provided some unknown amount of value to DMAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">After consideration of all the evidence, the trial court found that the loss to DMAS that was caused by appellant\u2019s criminal offense amounted to $180,082. The trial court, accordingly, ordered appellant to pay $180,082 to DMAS as restitution for his offense. This amount of money represented \u201ca reasonable amount of restitution\u201d in this case. <em>Smith, </em>52 Va.App. at 34, 660 S.E.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In <em>Howell, </em>the Supreme Court defined \u201crestitution\u201d as \u201c \u2018a restoration of something to its rightful owner: the making good of or giving an equivalent for some injury (as a loss of or damage to property).\u2019 \u201d <em>Howell, </em>274 Va. at 740, 652 S.E.2d at 108 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1936 (1993)). Similarly, this Court has noted that, in ancient societies, restitution was \u201ca means by which the offender could buy back the peace he had broken,\u201d <em>McCullough, </em>38 Va.App. at 815 n. 2, 568 S.E.2d at 451 n. 2 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and this Court has also held that it is reasonable to prevent a defendant \u201cfrom profiting from the crime he committed,\u201d <em>Waiters v. Commonwealth, 33 </em>Va.App. 739, 743, 536 S.E.2d 923, 925 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Here, DMAS reimbursed appellant for what appellant <em>claimed </em>were personal care services. However, the trial court record establishes that personal care services can only be \u201crendered by a fully trained PCA.\u201d As the Commonwealth argued in the trial court, appellant received $180,082 from DMAS <em>only </em>because he \u201cdeceived\u201d DMAS into paying these funds. Otherwise, DMAS <em>never would have </em>authorized these payments to appellant totaling $180,082.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">In light of these circumstances, the trial court ordered appellant to pay restitution in the amount of $180,082 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>DMAS\u2014the victim in this case. This decision was \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>Martin, </em>274 Va. at 735, 652 S.E.2d at 111, and we find no basis to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The trial court did not err when it determined that the \u201cdamages or loss caused by\u201d appellant\u2019s offense totaled $180,082. Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-303 and 19.2-305(B); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-305.1(A). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered appellant to pay $180,082 to the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services\u2014the victim here\u2014as restitution in this case. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm this order of restitution by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\">. Appellant was initially charged with four felony counts of obtaining money by false pretenses (under Code \u00a7 18.2-178) and one felony count of making false statements or representations in applications for payment (under Code \u00a7 32.1-314). Appellant entered into a plea agreement with the Commonwealth, in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of obtaining money by false pretenses and the Commonwealth agreed to move the trial court to dispose of the remaining three charges by <em>nolle prosequi. </em>Pursuant to this plea agreement, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>agreed that \"the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid will be determined by\u201d the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\">. The Commonwealth did not challenge reimbursements to appellant\u2019s business for the services of numerous PCAs who were properly trained and certified according to DMAS requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-9\">. The Commonwealth actually prepared <em>two </em>exhibits\u2014one detailing the amount of money DMAS reimbursed appellant for the services of his employees who had \"nonadequate or incomplete training,\u201d and the other detailing the amount of money DMAS reimbursed appellant for the services of a smaller subset of appellant\u2019s employees who had \"no training\u201d as PCAs. The Commonwealth chose to introduce only the latter exhibit at the restitution hearing. Thus, the trial court\u2019s restitution order reflects the amount of money DMAS reimbursed appellant for the services of his employees who received no PCA training at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\">. Narrowly focusing on a portion of the <em>Howell </em>opinion in which the Supreme Court relied on opinions from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit as persuasive authority, appellant claims that this Court should follow the Fourth Circuit\u2019s analysis in <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>532 F.3d 326 (4th Cir.2008), where that court adopted the federal \"actual loss\u201d method of analysis for restitution cases. However, in <em>Howell, </em>the Supreme Court applied existing Fourth Circuit case law concerning <em>the appropriate causation standard </em>for determining if a cost to the victim is even properly the subject of restitution. <em>Howell, </em>274 Va. at 740-41, 652 S.E.2d at 108-09. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 decision in <em>Howell </em>actually <em>predates </em>the Fourth Circuit's 2008 decision in <em>Harvey, </em>and the Supreme Court certainly gave no indication in <em>Howell </em>that the type of analysis later adopted by the Fourth Circuit in <em>Harvey </em>is applicable for the purpose of determining <em>the amount </em>of loss directly caused by the offense under Virginia's restitution statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\">. We note that appellant\u2019s stipulation that his employees were \"unqualified\u2019\u2019 to work as PCAs renders the facts in <em>Harvey </em>readily distinguishable from the facts of this case. In <em>Harvey, </em>while the co-defendants fraudulently manipulated the award of a government contract, the government officials overseeing the performance of this contract testified at the co-defendants' trial that they had \"no complaints\" about the actual performance of the contract. <em>Harvey, </em>532 F.3d at 340. The same cannot be said in this case\u2014where appellant stipulated that personal care services can <em>only </em>be rendered by \"fully trained\u201d PCAs and that the employees at issue here were \"untrained and unqualified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\">. Appellant contends that Medicaid offers a \"consumer directed care\u201d program where Medicaid recipients may select family members or friends to provide their care. DMAS apparently does not require such caretakers to receive the same training as PCAs, as the Commonwealth acknowledged at the restitution hearing. However, the trial court was not required to accept appellant\u2019s unsupported claim that his admittedly unqualified PCAs provided value to DMAS. A trial court\u2019s determination of the amount of restitution owed by the defendant may be \"based on facts proved either at the trial of the offense or at the sentencing hearing, <em>where both the defendant and the Commonwealth have an opportunity to present relevant evidence on the issue.\u201d McCullough, </em>38 Va.App. at 815, 568 S.E.2d at 450-51 (emphasis added). Here, the Commonwealth presented evidence establishing its amount of loss, and appellant presented no evidence to the contrary. Although appellant certainly was not <em>required </em>to present evidence at the restitution hearing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it chose to accept the Commonwealth's evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
