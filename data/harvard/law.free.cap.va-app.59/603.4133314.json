We disagree. For the following reasons, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">On appeal, we consider \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party\u201d in the trial court. <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004). On June 1, 2010 at about 4:00 p.m., City of Richmond police officer Jon Bridges observed appellant sitting with three other persons on a retaining wall at a city park. The police had ongoing problems with crime in the park, which was known to the police as an area where narcotics and alcohol offenses commonly occurred. Officer Bridges saw a beer can in a plastic bag near the defendant. Officer Bridges approached the group and asked them for identification. Appellant told Officer Bridges that his name was \u201cKeith Christian\u201d (even though his name is Edward Christian) and gave him a social security number. Another officer then checked the information and told Officer Bridges that an outstanding warrant was on file for \u201cKeith Christian.\u201d Accordingly, Officer Bridges arrested appellant, who had given the name \u201cKeith Christian.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">During a search incident to arrest, Officer Bridges recovered from appellant\u2019s front pants pocket \u201ca prescription pill\u201d wrapped in tinfoil.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also found \u201can off-white rock\u201d individually wrapped in a knotted baggie corner inside a clear plastic bag that was inside a white opaque plastic bag. Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Bridges believed the substance was crack cocaine. Laboratory analysis confirmed it was 0.062 gram of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">After Officer Bridges advised appellant of his Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> rights, appellant told him that \u201cKeith Christian\u201d\u2014the name he gave Officer Bridges as his own\u2014was actually his brother\u2019s name. Appellant explained that he used his brother\u2019s name because he thought there might be an outstanding warrant for arrest for himself, which in fact there was. Officer Bridges testified that appellant told him that he \u201cfound the crack cocaine on the ground\u201d and that appellant acknowledged that he \u201cthought it was drugs, but he thought he might be able to get four or five dollars for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Appellant argued in his motion to strike that the Commonwealth had not proved that he knowingly possessed the cocaine and was aware of its nature and character. The trial court denied the motion. Appellant presented no evidence and renewed his motion to strike. The trial court found him guilty as charged under Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, \u201ca reviewing court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crowder v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 658, 663, 588 S.E.2d 384, 387 (2003) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party in the trial court,\u201d <em>Riner, </em>268 Va. at 330, 601 S.E.2d at 574, \u201c[w]e must instead ask whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 \u201d <em>Crowder, </em>41 Va.App. at 663, 588 S.E.2d at 387 (quoting <em>Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 250, 257, 584 S.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) <em>(en banc)). See also Maxwell v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>Commonwealth, 275 </em>Va. 437, 442, 657 S.E.2d 499, 502 (2008). A trial court\u2019s judgment will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Preston v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 52, 57, 704 S.E.2d 127, 129 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A)(a) reads in relevant part: \u201cIt is unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance ... Any person who violates this section with respect to any controlled substance classified in Schedule I or II of the Drug Control Act shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.\u201d To sustain a conviction for possession of a controlled substance, \u201c[t]he Commonwealth must also establish that the defendant intentionally and consciously possessed [the drug] <em>with knowledge of its nature and character. </em>That knowledge is an essential element of the crime.\u201d <em>Young v. Commonwealth, 275 </em>Va. 587, 591, 659 S.E.2d 308, 310 (2008) (citations omitted) (emphasis in original). In other words, \u201cthe Commonwealth must prove the accused was aware of the character of the particular substance at issue.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 626, 627-28, 432 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">A. <em>Appellant had \u201cknowledge\u201d of the \u201cnature and character\u201d of the cocaine as required under Young v. Commonwealth as Officer Bridges testified that appellant \u201cacknowledged that he thought it was drugs, but he thought he might be able to get four or five dollars for it. </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Appellant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew he possessed the cocaine that was found in his pants pocket, as is required under <em>Young, 275 </em>Va. at 591, 659 S.E.2d at 310. Specifically, appellant argues that although he thought the bag contained drugs, his hope or suspicion does not prove that he <em>knew </em>the bag contained cocaine. Appellant cites two unpublished opinions from this Court in support of his contention that mere hope that the item is a drug does not rise to the required level of knowledge under Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A)(a) and <em>Young. See Whitehead v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 0908-93-1, 1995 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>WL 79894, 1995 Va.App. LEXIS 191 (Va.Ct.App. Feb. 28, 1995). <em>See also Gaither v. Commonwealth, </em>Record No. 0610-96-2, 1997 WL 342965, 1997 Va.App. LEXIS 424 (Va. Ct.App. June 24, 1997); Rule 5A:1(f) (stating that unpublished opinions can be \u201cinformative, but shall not be received as binding authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">It is well settled that \u201cunpublished opinions are merely persuasive authority and not binding precedent.\u201d <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 146, 153 n. 3, 717 S.E.2d 442, 445 n. 3 (2011); <em>see also Grajales v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 1, 2 n. 1, 353 S.E.2d 789, 790 n. 1 (1987). This Court\u2019s unpublished decisions in <em>Whitehead </em>and <em>Gaither </em>are simply not persuasive here, given the very different circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">In <em>Whitehead </em>a police officer \u201csaw Whitehead toss a small [pill] bottle in the air, place it on a church windowsill, and abandon it.\u201d <em>Whitehead, </em>1995 WL 79894, at *1, 1995 Va.App. LEXIS 191, at *2. Whitehead said he thought the bottle might contain cocaine, but when he determined that it did not, he discarded it. The bottle contained cocaine residue, however. This Court held the evidence was not sufficient to prove Whitehead knowingly and intentionally possessed cocaine because his <em>\u201cpromptly discarding]\u201d </em>the bottle supported the conclusion that he did not know it held cocaine. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Here, even if appellant \u201cfound the crack cocaine on the ground,\u201d as he claimed to Officer Bridges, he kept it in his pants pocket because he \u201cthought it was drugs\u201d he could sell. Unlike in <em>Whitehead, </em>appellant here attached value to the item and did not discard it. The fact that appellant attached value to the item and did not discard it reinforces the conclusion that appellant knew the \u201cnature and character\u201d of the cocaine. <em>Young, </em>275 Va. at 591, 659 S.E.2d at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Similarly, <em>Gaither </em>also involved very different facts than the facts of this case. <em>Gaither, </em>1997 WL 342965, 1997 Va.App. LEXIS 424. There, Gaither claimed a package, which was addressed to him, at a local bus station and then gave the package to a man outside the station. The package contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>men\u2019s clothing and 71 grams of cocaine. After he was arrested and given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Gaither told the police he had picked up two previous packages before he \u201csuspected\u201d drugs might be inside, but there was no evidence he had opened any of the three packages. <em>Id. </em>1997 WL 342965, at *2, 1997 Va.App. LEXIS 424, at *3. This Court reversed Gaither\u2019s convictions for conspiracy to distribute cocaine and attempted possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, holding that the evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was aware of the presence and character of the cocaine and \u201cintentionally and consciously\u201d possessed it. <em>Id. </em>1997 WL 342965, at *2, 1997 Va.App. LEXIS 424, at *6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In this case, even though the evidence does not indicate definitively whether appellant actually opened the bag, it clearly shows that appellant intended to profit from finding the cocaine. In fact, appellant specifically told Officer Bridges that he \u201cthought it was drugs\u201d and that he thought he \u201cmight be able to get four or five dollars\u201d for it. These circumstances were not part of the evidence before this Court in <em>Gaither.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Furthermore, no part of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Young </em>would compel reversal here. At oral argument before this Court, counsel for appellant argued that the holding in <em>Young </em>means that a person cannot be convicted of possession of a drug when that person is found possessing a drug that most people could look at and determine to be contraband\u2014 unless there is additional evidence of knowledge. However, this interpretation is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s actual holding in <em>Young.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The facts of <em>Young </em>were that the defendant, Angela Young, was pulled over \u201cfor failing to stop at an intersection,\u201d and consented to a search of her boyfriend\u2019s car, which she was driving. 275 Va. at 589, 659 S.E.2d at 309. The officer arrested Young upon finding a prescription bottle labeled \u201cOxyContin\u201d (a controlled drug) in her purse inside of the car. <em>Id. </em>However, the arresting officer \u201ccould not determine the nature of the pills\u201d\u2014beyond what was printed on the bottle\u2019s label. <em>Id. </em>The pills inside the prescription bottle were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>found to be OxyContin (or its generic equivalent, oxycodone), but instead were later \u201cidentified as morphine, a Schedule II substance\u201d and \u201cTrazodone, a Schedule VI substance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s express holding in <em>Young </em>was that \u201cpossession alone, <em>without more, </em>is insufficient to support an inference of guilty knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 659 S.E.2d at 310 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court in <em>Young did not </em>hold that possession of <em>drugs\u2014when the nature of the illegal substance is </em>apparent\u2014is insufficient to support an inference of guilty knowledge. On the contrary, the Supreme Court reemphasized that to sustain a conviction for possession of a controlled substance, \u201c[t]he Commonwealth must ... establish that the defendant intentionally and consciously possessed [the drug] <em>with knowledge of its nature and character. </em>That knowledge is an essential element of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 659 S.E.2d at 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Given these principles, the Supreme Court in <em>Young </em>found that where the illegal nature of the substance the defendant was found possessing was <em>not identifiable </em>to the officer or defendant and no other evidence in the record could support an inference of guilty knowledge, there was insufficient evidence \u201cto support a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant possessed morphine with knowledge of its nature and character.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592-93, 659 S.E.2d at 311. When the illegal nature of the substance is apparent\u2014as it is here\u2014that circumstance supports a finding of the defendant\u2019s guilty knowledge of the contraband he possesses. The facts of this case simply do not fall within the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Young, </em>and, therefore, the result in <em>Young </em>is not controlling here, given those very different facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>In making its ruling in <em>Young, </em>the Supreme Court emphasized that \u201cthe contents of the pill bottle ... gave no indication of their character\u201d and that the officer, \u201cafter examining the pills, could not determine their nature without submitting them for laboratory analysis, and there is no reason to infer that the defendant was any better informed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 659 S.E.2d at 311. Unlike in <em>Young, </em>the contents of the bag here gave an indication of their character because after examining the bag, Officer Bridges found \u201can off-white rock\u201d individually wrapped in a knotted baggie corner inside a clear plastic bag that was inside a white opaque plastic bag. This examination led Officer Bridges to determine the nature of the substance, which he believed to be crack cocaine. Upon this determination, Officer Bridges arrested appellant for possession of cocaine, and laboratory analysis ultimately confirmed that his determination was correct (the bag contained 0.062 gram of cocaine). Moreover, appellant here admitted to Officer Bridges that he \u201cthought it was drugs\u201d and that he \u201cthought he might be able to get four or five dollars for it\u201d\u2014clearly showing that appellant was aware of the nature of the substance, unlike in <em>Young. </em>When the strong evidence in this case indicating not just appellant\u2019s possession but also his knowledge of the nature and character of the contraband is compared with the insufficient evidence in <em>Young, </em>it is obvious that the trial court here was not \u201cplainly wrong[,]\u201d <em>Preston, </em>281 Va. at 57, 704 S.E.2d at 129, when it found that appellant had the requisite knowledge that he possessed cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">B. <em>There is sufficient evidence that supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant had the requisite knowledge of the cocaine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In support of his argument that there was insufficient evidence of his knowledge of the cocaine, appellant emphasizes the following facts: Officer Bridges testified that the outermost bag was opaque and white\u2014rather than clear, and that Officer Bridges testified that he was unable to see through the white bag. Appellant also points out that cocaine does not have a distinctive odor, which would have alerted appellant as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>to its nature. However, the trial court (acting as factfinder) clearly found that these facts were substantially outweighed by several other compelling pieces of evidence, which clearly prove that appellant had the requisite knowledge of the cocaine beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s knowledge of the presence and character of a drug may be shown by evidence of the acts, statements, or conduct of the accused, as well as by \u2018other facts or circumstances\u2019 tending to demonstrate the accused\u2019s guilty knowledge of the drug.\u201d <em>Ervin v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 495, 506-07, 704 S.E.2d 135, 140-41 (2011) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted). Here, a number of \u201cacts, statements, or conduct of the accused\u201d reveal appellant\u2019s \u201cknowledge of the presence and character\u201d of the cocaine. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">When Officer Bridges asked appellant for his identification, appellant gave his brother\u2019s name, \u201cKeith Christian\u201d\u2014instead of his own (Edward Christian). In addition, the trial judge, sitting as the factfinder without a jury, could have determined that appellant was untruthful when he told Officer Bridges that he \u201cfound the crack cocaine on the ground.\u201d The judge then could infer appellant\u2019s consciousness of guilt from his two false statements\u2014about his identification and about finding the \u201ccrack cocaine on the ground.\u201d <em>See Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 535, 548, 399 S.E.2d 823, 831 (1991) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s false statements are probative to show he is trying to conceal his guilt, and thus is evidence of his guilt.\u201d); <em>see also Emmett v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 364, 372, 569 S.E.2d 39, 45 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Furthermore, after Officer Bridges observed appellant in a city park, which is known to police as one where narcotics and alcohol offenses occur, and searched him incident to a lawful arrest, appellant admitted to Officer Bridges that he \u201cthought it was drugs\u201d and that he \u201cthought he might be able to get four or five dollars for it.\u201d Upon hearing all of this testimony, the trial judge could have reasonably inferred that appellant knowingly possessed the cocaine and did not err in rejecting appellant\u2019s hypothesis of innocence. <em>See Archer v. Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>wealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 12-13, 492 S.E.2d 826, 832 (1997) (\u201cWhether an alternate hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact, and, therefore, is binding on appeal unless plainly wrong.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In summary, the trial court was not \u201cplainly wrong,\u201d <em>Preston, </em>281 Va. at 57, 704 S.E.2d at 129, when it found that appellant had the requisite knowledge of the cocaine he possessed, Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A)(a), because a \u201c \u2018rational trier of fact could have found th[is] essential [element] of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 \u201d <em>Crowder, </em>41 Va.App. at 663, 588 S.E.2d at 387 (quoting <em>Kelly, </em>41 Va.App. at 257, 584 S.E.2d at 447). Specifically, a rational trier of fact could have found that the evidence sufficiently proves that appellant \u201cpossessed [the cocaine] <em>with knowledge of its nature and character.\u201d Young, </em>275 Va. at 591, 659 S.E.2d at 310 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In this case, ample evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that appellant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of possession of a controlled substance in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250(A)(a).
