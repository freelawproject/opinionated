INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">James Samuel Williams (hereinafter, \u201cdefendant\u201d) maintains the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty to a felony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">On May 18, 2009, the grand jury in Fairfax County indicted defendant for abduction with intent to defile, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-48. On June 14, 2010, in an unrelated case, a jury in Fairfax County found defendant guilty of rape, forcible sodomy, and attempted forcible sodomy. The jury recommended two life sentences and nine years in the penitentiary. Defendant was scheduled to have a jury trial in the instant case on June 28, 2010. A plea offer was extended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>defendant on Friday, June 18, 2010. Defense counsel discussed the plea with defendant over the weekend and again on Monday, June 21. On June 21, defense counsel emailed the Commonwealth to indicate that defendant would make an <em>Alford </em>guilty plea to the charge and would accept a sentence of <em>15 years active imprisonment to run concurrent </em>with the sentence imposed in the rape case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Thus, defendant knew he would receive no further period of incarceration. </em>On June 22, defendant signed a written plea agreement entitled, \u201cAlford Plea of Guilty to a Felony.\u201d The plea agreement states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-5\">My attorney has discussed with me the nature and elements of the offense and has advised me as to any possible defenses I might have in this case. I have had ample time to discuss the case and all possible defenses with my attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">My attorney has advised me that the punishment which the law provides is as follows: <em>A maximum of life imprisonment and a minimum of 20 years imprisonment and afine of not more than $100,000. ...</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">^ \u00edH \u00ed\u00a1* :\u00a1? <em>i\u2019fi</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">I understand that by pleading guilty I waive my right to an appeal and that, while I am not admitting guilt, I do admit that the evidence against me is overwhelming and substantially negates any claim of innocence I may have and that the only issue to be decided by the Court is punishment. The following plea agreement is submitted: <em>Commonwealth and Defendant agree to a period of active incarceration of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number><em>15 years, to run concurrent with the active incarceration from FE-2009-10I6.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">After having discussed the matter with my attorney, I do freely and voluntarily enter a plea of guilty pursuant to <em>Alford v. North Carolina </em>to the offense of <em>Abduction with Intent to Defile, (VA Code \u00a7 18.2-48), FE-2009-905, </em>and waive my right to a trial by jury and request the Court to hear all matters of law and fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In light of the foregoing, the parties agreed that the matter would be advanced on the docket to June 23, 2010, from the original trial date of June 28, 2010. On June 23, defendant entered the <em>Alford </em>plea in open court. At that time, the trial court conducted a colloquy with defendant in which the following statements were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">THE COURT: Do you understand the charge against you? THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">THE COURT: Have you discussed the charge with your attorney and do you understand what the Commonwealth must prove to have you found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-10\">THE COURT: Have you discussed with your attorney any possible defenses that you might have to this charge? THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-11\">THE COURT: Are you entering this plea of guilty freely and voluntarily?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">The prosecutor then proffered the evidence which follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">The victim worked at a bakery. She would ride the bus part-way to work and then walk or get a ride with a co-worker for the remainder of the way. On January 15, 2009, the victim got off the bus and tried to use the pay phone at the 7-Eleven nearby to call her boyfriend to see if her co-worker would be driving to work that day. The pay phone did not work so she crossed the street to Walgreens to wait and see if her co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>worker would show up. Eventually, the victim decided to walk to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">As the victim was walking, defendant approached her driving a red SUV. Defendant stated that he had noticed her earlier using the phone at the 7-Eleven, but the victim ignored him and kept walking. Defendant then asked the victim if she wanted to use his cell phone. The victim accepted and called her boyfriend using defendant\u2019s phone. The boyfriend informed the victim that he was unable to reach the victim\u2019s co-worker regarding the ride to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">After the phone call, the victim returned defendant\u2019s phone and he then asked her if she needed a ride. The victim accepted and got into the front passenger seat of the car. The victim told defendant where she worked, but on the way defendant turned into a residential neighborhood. The victim told defendant to let her out and tried to open her door, but it was locked. She began to cry, and defendant held her arm and kept driving for an additional two or three minutes. Defendant then stopped the car on a residential street and proceeded to touch the victim\u2019s upper thigh near her hip over her clothing. Next, defendant touched the victim\u2019s vaginal area over her clothing, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got there.\u201d The victim yelled and tried to hit defendant. He restrained her forearms and proceeded to move into the seat on top of her. She again asked him to let her go and exclaimed that she was pregnant. At that point, the passenger door came open and the victim was able to break free and run away from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Fairfax County police were notified about this incident, and they obtained surveillance footage from the Walgreens, which showed the victim walking through the parking lot and being followed by the red SUV. The victim\u2019s boyfriend showed the police the phone number that came up on his phone when the victim had called him earlier. The police were able to run this number through various databases and identified the number as belonging to defendant. The police contacted defendant via phone that same day, and defendant returned the call. Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>dant said he figured the police were contacting him because of the incident that morning with the victim. Defendant agreed to come down to'the station to meet with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Defendant claimed that the lady approached him to ask to use his cell phone since the pay phone did not work. He said that he allowed her to use his cell phone but defendant did not admit that any sexual touching had occurred. A few days later, defendant contacted the police and said that he wanted to talk some more about the matter. Defendant then interviewed at the station and eventually admitted to touching the victim in the crotch area over her clothing. Defendant said he had backed off when he learned that she was pregnant and told her that he was not trying to hurt her. Defendant also wrote a letter apologizing to the victim for his behavior that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">When the trial court questioned defendant about the <em>Alford </em>plea at his change of plea hearing, defendant agreed that the evidence of his guilt was substantial and overwhelming and he wished to avoid a trial. The trial court accepted the <em>Alford </em>plea, agreeing that \u201cthe evidence [presented by the prosecutor] is substantial and overwhelming.\u201d The trial court entered a conviction order, ordered a presentence report, and scheduled a sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Three weeks later, on July 14, 2010, defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In support of his motion, defendant argued that at the time of his plea he was in \u201cshock, dismay, even hopelessness of the fact that he had just been sentenced by a jury to such harsh sentences.\u201d Notwithstanding this argument, defendant does not maintain that his plea was constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">With respect to his defense to the charges, defendant stated, through his attorney, that while he was driving the victim to work, she requested to use his phone. However, the phone had a bad signal and the victim requested that defendant pull off into a residential neighborhood in an attempt to get better reception. \"While in this neighborhood, the victim continued to use defendant\u2019s phone. Defendant grew tired of the victim\u2019s use of his phone because he needed to get to work. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>He decided to get her attention, and she became frustrated and annoyed. Consequently, the victim damaged his property by throwing his cell phone and she then exited the car. In sum, defendant\u2019s proffered defense was that he did not detain the victim, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-47, and that the victim\u2019s statement to the contrary was false. The challenge, thus, was one of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and sentenced defendant to 40 years imprisonment, with 25 years suspended, to run concurrent with the active incarceration from case number FE-2009-1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">On appeal, defendant claims the trial court erred in not allowing him to withdraw his guilty plea. We hold the trial court did not err in refusing defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\n<em>Overview</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The Virginia Supreme Court in <em>Parris v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 321, 52 S.E.2d 872 (1949), made the \u201cseminal statement\u201d of Virginia law governing \u201cthe denial by a trial court of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Justus v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 143, 152, 645 S.E.2d 284, 288 (2007). <em>Parris </em>held that a timely motion should not be denied \u201cif it appears from the surrounding circumstances that the plea of guilty was submitted in good faith under an honest mistake of material fact or facts, or if it was induced by fraud, coercion or undue influence and would not otherwise have been made\u201d so long as \u201cany reasonable ground is offered for going to the jury.\u201d <em>Parris, </em>189 Va. at 324-25, 52 S.E.2d at 873-74. To warrant withdrawal of the guilty plea, therefore, the motion must be \u201c\u2018made in good faith and sustained by proofs\u2019\u201d justifying a trial on the merits. <em>Justus, </em>274 Va. at 153-54, 645 S.E.2d at 288 (quoting <em>Parris, </em>189 Va. at 325-26, 52 S.E.2d at 874).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The <em>Parris </em>standard thus requires the defendant (i) to establish a good-faith basis for making the guilty plea and later seeking to withdraw it, and (ii) to proffer evidence of a reasonable basis for contesting guilt. <em>Justus, </em>274 Va. at 155-56, 645 S.E.2d at 289-90. \u201cThe first requirement protects the integrity of the judicial process by precluding defendants from using a guilty plea as a subterfuge to manipulate the court. The second requirement defeats motions to withdraw which would result in an essentially futile trial.\u201d <em>Cobbins v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 28, 34, 668 S.E.2d 816, 819 (2008). As <em>Parris </em>explained, a trial court\u2019s discretion to grant the motion \u201c\u2018will rarely, if ever, be exercised in aid of an attempt to rely upon a merely dilatory or formal defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Justus, </em>274 Va. at 153, 645 S.E.2d at 288 (quoting <em>Parris, </em>189 Va. at 324-25, 52 S.E.2d at 873-74).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The decision to allow a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea rests \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the trial court and is to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Parris, </em>189 Va. at 324, 52 S.E.2d at 873. \u201c \u2018As in other cases of discretionary power, no general rule can be laid down as to when a defendant will be permitted to withdraw his plea.\u2019\u201d <em>Zigta v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 149, 153, 562 S.E.2d 347, 349 (2002) (quoting <em>Parris, </em>189 Va. at 325, 52 S.E.2d at 874). Appellate review under an abuse-of-discretion standard, \u201cif nothing else, means that the trial judge\u2019s ruling will not be reversed simply because an appellate court disagrees.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743, <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005) (citation omitted). \u201cOnly when reasonable jurists could not differ can we say an abuse of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>has occurred.\u201d <em>Tynes v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 17, 21, 635 S.E.2d 688, 689 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\n<em>Did the Trial Court Abuse its Discretion in Denying Defendant\u2019s Motion to Withdraw his Plea?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Defendant argues that he should have been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea on the ground that it was ill-advised because he was in fear at the time it was made. In support of his position, defendant seizes upon the following language from <em>Parris:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">The least surprise or influence causing a defendant to plead guilty when he has any defense at all should be sufficient grounds for permitting a change of plea from guilty to not guilty. Leave should ordinarily be given to withdraw a plea of guilty if it was entered by mistake or under a misconception of the nature of the charge; through a misunderstanding as to its effect; through fear, fraud, or official misrepresentation; was made involuntarily for any reason; or even where it was entered inadvisedly, if any reasonable ground is offered for going to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\"><em>Parris, </em>189 Va. at 325, 52 S.E.2d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">To address defendant\u2019s contention, the Court finds instructive the case of <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 284, 657 S.E.2d 164 (2008). In <em>Coleman, </em>the defendant was charged with a number of felony and misdemeanor counts. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 657 S.E.2d at 165. Eventually, the defendant and the prosecutor filed a \u201cwritten agreed disposition\u201d with the court, which the court accepted. <em>Id. </em>at 287, 657 S.E.2d at 166. Pursuant to that agreement, the defendant entered guilty pleas to some of the charges, and the remaining charges were <em>nolle prosequied. Id. </em>However, a few days prior to his sentencing date, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty pleas. <em>Id. </em>The reason given by the defendant was that he had pled \u201cout of fear\u201d because he was afraid of receiving a life sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 288, 657 S.E.2d at 166. The trial court denied the motion, and the defendant appealed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">We affirmed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Obviously, every guilty plea is the product of some influence on a defendant. Every defendant faces the fear of sentencing. Each defendant considers the \u201cpros\u201d and \u201ccons\u201d of his or her plea and makes a decision based on the factors, or \u201cinfluences,\u201d that are important to that person. Therefore, \u201cthe least influence\u201d and \u201cfear\u201d cannot include fear of sentencing alone. Otherwise, courts would always have to grant motions to withdraw guilty pleas. Such a result would run contrary to the historic discretion of trial courts discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>Parris.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 290-91, 657 S.E.2d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">As support for this proposition, we cited <em>Alford, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">[A] plea of guilty which would not have been entered except for the defendant\u2019s desire to avoid a possible death penalty and to limit the maximum penalty to life imprisonment or a term of years was not for that reason compelled within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.... The standard was and remains whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-8\"><em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 164, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">In light of the foregoing, we held, \u201c[therefore, in the context of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, proof that a defendant has the natural fear of a life sentence certainly is not sufficient by itself to require that a trial court grant that motion.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>51 Va.App. at 291, 657 S.E.2d at 168. Applying <em>Coleman </em>to the facts of this case, it is clear that defendant\u2019s argument that he should be permitted to withdraw his plea because he was fearful of receiving a life sentence must fail. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that defendant knew, prior to entering his plea, exactly what his sentence was going to be and that it would run concurrent to his sentence in the earlier case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, defendant\u2019s argument also fails because he has not proffered evidence of a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>basis for contesting guilt, as required by <em>Parris </em>and its progeny. As mentioned, <em>supra, </em>to warrant withdrawal of a guilty plea, the motion must be \u201c \u2018made in good faith <em>and sustained by proofs.\u2019 \u201d Justus, </em>274 Va. at 153-54, 645 S.E.2d at 288 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Parris, </em>189 Va. at 325-26, 52 S.E.2d at 874). \u201cTh[is] second requirement defeats motions to withdraw which would result in an essentially futile trial.\u201d <em>Cobbins, </em>53 Va.App. at 35, 668 S.E.2d at 819. Here, the only \u201cproof\u2019 offered by defendant to establish his basis for contesting guilt is his challenge to the victim\u2019s statement concerning her detention within the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">We note that the defense proffer fails to mention anything about defendant touching the victim\u2019s clothing over her vagina\u2014an act which defendant admitted to during police questioning. Defendant argues on brief that his failure to mention the unlawful touching in his proffer should be construed as an \u201cimplicit[ ] disavowal] [of] his statement to the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">We decline to accept defendant\u2019s invitation to hold that his proffer constitutes a reasonable defense. A \u201creasonable defense,\u201d one sufficient to withdraw a guilty plea, is one based upon a proposition of law, <em>see Justus, </em>274 Va. at 155, 645 S.E.2d at 289 (defendant \u201ccould not be guilty of breaking and entering her own home\u201d), or one supported by credible testimony, supported by affidavit, <em>see Parris, </em>189 Va. at 324, 52 S.E.2d at 873 (\u201c[A]ffidavits disclose that when the plea was made, accused had reason to believe, and did believe, that ... [an event would subsequently occur] and the prosecution be terminated.\u201d). It is a defense which reasonably supports the defendant\u2019s proffer: it is not a defense that is based solely upon a challenge to the credibility of a victim\u2019s testimony, especially when a defendant has admitted to the substance of such testimony. To hold otherwise would raise a bare challenge to the credibility of a victim or witness to that standard, one \u201csustained by proofs,\u201d necessary to permit the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. Such a challenge does not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">In light of the foregoing, defendant\u2019s argument fails under both prongs of <em>Parris. </em>Namely, defendant has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>establish a good faith basis for seeking to withdraw his plea and, further, he has failed to proffer evidence of a reasonable basis for contesting guilt. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly exercised its discretion when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-9\">. When offering an <em>Alford </em>plea, a defendant asserts his innocence but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict him of the offense. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37-38, 91 S.Ct. 160, 167-68, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); <em>see also Parson </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>272 Va. 560, 565, 636 S.E.2d 452, 454-55 (2006) (describing effect <em>o\u00ed Alford </em>plea in Virginia). Virginia courts \"treat <em>Alford </em>pleas as having the same preclusive effect as a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Perry v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 410, 412, 533 S.E.2d 651, 652 (2000) (citation omitted). As a result, they are often termed <em>\"Alford </em>pleas of guilty.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 168, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b291-10\">. <em>Parris </em>does not require a showing that the guilty plea was involuntary in any constitutional sense or the result of ineffective assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>counsel. As a result, the \"presumptions that would favor the Commonwealth in a habeas proceeding\u201d do not apply \"when the case remains within the jurisdiction of the trial court to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Justus, </em>274 Va. at 154, 645 S.E.2d at 289. For this reason, a good-faith guilty plea could be entered ill-advisedly (but nevertheless voluntarily) and still be a permissible candidate for a motion to withdraw so long as the <em>Parris </em>criteria are satisfied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
