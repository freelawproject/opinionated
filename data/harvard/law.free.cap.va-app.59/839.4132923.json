Mayfield was convicted of first-degree murder and the use of a firearm in commission of the murder. On appeal, Mayfield raises three assignments of error. First, he argues the trial court erred when it declined to strike a prospective juror for cause because the juror was related to two witnesses for the Commonwealth. Second, Mayfield argues the trial court erred when it allowed the admission of evidence relating to a prior incident involving Mayfield\u2019s half-brother and the victim. Finally, Mayfield argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of these crimes. For the following reasons, we conclude that no error occurred, and therefore we affirm Mayfield\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">\u201cOn appeal, Ve review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). So viewed, the evidence shows that on March 3, 2009, a fatal shooting occurred at the Oak Trail Apartments in Southampton County, Virginia. After an investigation, May-field was charged with first-degree murder and the use of a firearm in commission of murder in connection with the shooting. Mayfield pled not guilty and requested a trial by jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">During jury <em>voir dire, </em>and in response to questioning from Mayfield\u2019s attorney, a prospective juror explained that she was related to two prosecution witnesses: Rodney H., her nephew, and Charquena G., the daughter of her cousin. After discovering this information, Mayfield\u2019s attorney asked the juror whether her familial relationship with these two witnesses would be \u201ca problem in deciding the case, which may be based on the testimony of your blood relatives.\u201d In response, the juror answered, \u201cNo.\u201d In response to further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>questioning from the prosecutor, the juror confirmed that she could put aside her relationship with the witnesses and impartially evaluate their testimony, that she had no preconceived notions regarding the witnesses\u2019 truthfulness, and that she could be fair to both Mayfield and the Commonwealth. Moreover, the juror verified that she had never spoken to either witness regarding what they saw at the Oak Trail Apartments.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Mayfield\u2019s attorney then objected to empaneling the juror, stating</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\">Your Honor, I would move to strike [the juror] for cause. This is a situation where she has told [the prosecutor] that she would remain impartial, but the fact remains that these two witnesses, one of whom is her nephew, the other is a cousin, second or third cousin, this is an entirely different situation than mere acquaintanceship or something like that. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a per se disqualifier that someone cannot sit on a jury when a witness is related to them by a certain degree of affinity the way it is with a party. But in a case like this I submit -with the seriousness of the matter, and with the fact that we have more than an ample supply of other jurors to use, I would ask the Court to strike her for cause. I just would submit to the Court that we\u2019re\u2014if we put her\u2014if we leave her on the jury we\u2019re putting a problem into the case that does not need to be there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The trial court denied the motion and declined to strike the juror for cause. In response, Mayfield\u2019s attorney used a peremptory strike on the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Mayfield also made a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude any evidence relating to a prior incident where Mayfield\u2019s half-brother, Eric Parker, shot the victim. Mayfield anticipated that the Commonwealth would produce evidence that tended to show that Mayfield wanted to kill the victim to prevent the victim from testifying against Parker. The trial court denied the motion <em>in limine </em>in a written order. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth agreed that certain in-court testimony from Parker\u2019s trial was inadmissible. It also agreed that Parker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>convictions related to the prior incident were also inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced Parker\u2019s indictments related to the prior incident. The indictments included relevant dates, which served as key evidence to establish that Mayfield shot and killed the victim to prevent the victim from testifying against Parker. Further, the Commonwealth elicited testimony from multiple witnesses that established that Mayfield was present at the Oak Trail Apartments the night the victim was killed, that Mayfield made multiple statements both after and before the shooting that suggested that he killed or intended to kill the victim to prevent the victim from testifying against Parker, and that Mayfield actually shot and killed the victim. Specifically, Herbert B. testified that he saw Mayfield walk past him outside the apartments just after he heard two gunshots. Tony S. testified that he heard Mayfield say that he \u201chad to get\u201d the victim because the victim was going to testify against Parker. He further testified that he saw Mayfield shoot the victim \u201ctwo or three times.\u201d Henifa B. also testified that he saw Mayfield shoot the victim several times at point-blank range and that as a result he saw the victim fall to the ground. According to Henifa B., he heard Mayfield say just after the shooting that he had \u201chandled [his] business\u201d and that \u201csnitches get stitches and a dead man can\u2019t talk.\u201d Another witness, Rodney H., also confirmed that Mayfield had told him before the shooting that \u201che couldn\u2019t let [the victim] testify against his brother.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Mayfield moved to strike the evidence, arguing that the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses should not be believed based on either their past criminal convictions or pending criminal charges. The trial court denied the motion to strike. In his defense, Mayfield took the stand and testified that he was not at the Oak Trail Apartments when the victim was shot. He then renewed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>motion at the close of his defense, which the court again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Thereafter, the jury found Mayfield guilty of first-degree murder and the use of a firearm in commission of the murder. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">A. Motion To Strike Prospective Juror for Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Mayfield first argues that the trial court should have struck the prospective juror for cause because the juror was related to two witnesses for the Commonwealth. Specifically, he argues that the trial court should have struck the juror for cause to protect public confidence in the jury system, because of the juror\u2019s bias, or because the juror had a contemporaneous and continuing relationship with a prosecution witness. Under the facts of this case, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">\u201cIt is prejudicial error for the trial court to force a defendant to use peremptory strikes to exclude a venireman from the jury panel if that person is not free from exception.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 325, 329, 619 S.E.2d 71, 73 (2005). \u201cThe striking of any juror for cause, however, is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">Generally, a juror is free from exception so long as he \u201cstand[s] indifferent in the cause.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-358; <em>Townsend, </em>270 Va. at 330, 619 S.E.2d at 74. In other words, if the juror \u201c \u2018has any interest in the cause, or is related to either party, or has expressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or prejudice,\u2019 \u201d he should be struck for cause. <em>Townsend, </em>270 Va. at 330-31, 619 S.E.2d at 74 (quoting <em>Spangler v. Ashwell, </em>116 Va. 992, 996-97, 83 S.E. 930, 931 (1914)). In Virginia, there is no <em>per se </em>rule disqualifying a prospective juror who is related to a prosecution witness on the grounds that he is presumed to be biased, or not indifferent in the cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 826, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>553 S.E.2d 731, 733 (2001); <em>see Townsend, </em>270 Va. at 331, 619 S.E.2d at 74-75 (further explaining <em>Barrett </em>and this principle). Likewise, there is no <em>per se </em>rule that other relationships between a juror and a prosecution witness, e.g., a current or past acquaintance with a prosecution witness, standing alone, renders the juror biased. <em>Perez v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 648, 656, 580 S.E.2d 507, 511 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Despite this general rule, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that there is a separate and distinct rule that \u201chas effectively established <em>per se </em>disqualification [of a juror] by [other] limited categories.\u201d <em>Townsend, </em>270 Va. at 331, 619 S.E.2d at 74. This includes the <em>per se </em>disqualification of certain jurors in order to maintain <em>public confidence </em>in the judicial system. <em>Id. </em>at 331, 619 S.E.2d at 74-75 (disqualifying a juror with a close blood relationship to a prosecution witness in order to maintain public confidence in the judicial system); <em>see also Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 824-27, 553 S.E.2d at 731-33. This categorical rule does not stem from the mandate set forth in Code \u00a7 8.01-358, which disqualifies any juror that is biased or not otherwise \u201cindifferent in the cause\u201d; rather, it stems from a separate public policy concern that \u201coverride[s] an otherwise legitimately]\u201d empaneled juror. <em>Townsend, </em>270 Va. at 333, 619 S.E.2d at 76. Accordingly, the issue of striking a juror for bias is distinct from the issue of striking a juror to maintain public confidence in the judicial system. Thus, raising the former issue at trial does not preserve the latter issue for appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 333-34, 619 S.E.2d at 75-76 (referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s Rule 5:25 for this proposition, the equivalent to this Court\u2019s Rule 5A:18); <em>see </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>In light of this distinction, we must first examine to what extent Mayfield has preserved his arguments on appeal with respect to the prospective juror. In this case, Mayfield asked the trial court to strike the juror for cause based only on the juror\u2019s inability to remain \u201cimpartial,\u201d or unbiased, due to her family relationship with two prosecution witnesses. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Townsend, </em>this argument is insufficient to preserve the separate argument that Mayfield now makes on appeal: that the trial court should have struck the juror to protect the public\u2019s confidence in the judicial system.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-4\">Public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system, as a ground for excluding a juror for cause, must be raised in the trial court or that issue is waived. Any \u201cimplication\u201d arising from this Court\u2019s prior decision in <em>Medici [v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000) ] that the question of public confidence may be raised in any appeal when a motion to strike a juror for cause has been denied, regardless of whether it was properly raised below, is expressly rejected. The trial court must be apprised of the basis upon which a public confidence objection to a juror is made and the other litigants given an opportunity to address the trial court on that matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-5\"><em>Townsend, </em>270 Va. at 333, 619 S.E.2d at 76 (citations omitted). Because Mayfield only challenged the juror based on alleged bias, we cannot evaluate the merits of his public confidence argument on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Mayfield\u2019s remaining arguments are merely variants on a common theme: that the juror was in some way not \u201cindifferent in the cause,\u201d either because of bias in favor of a family member or bias in favor of someone with whom the juror had a \u201ccontemporaneous and continuing relationship.\u201d In response to questioning from Mayfield\u2019s attorney, the juror explained she was related to two prosecution witnesses. However, the juror gave no indication of bias in favor of these witnesses or the prosecution. The juror confirmed that she could put aside her relationship with the witnesses and impartially evaluate their testimony, that she had no preconceived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>notions regarding the witnesses\u2019 truthfulness, and that she could be fair to both Mayfield and the Commonwealth. These facts do not demonstrate that the juror was biased. Moreover, none of the evidence actually established any \u201ccontemporaneous and continuing relationship\u201d between the juror and the witnesses beyond the fact that the juror and the witnesses were related.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That status alone does not warrant the exclusion of an otherwise competent juror for bias. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to strike the juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">B. Admission of Evidence Relating to Mayfield\u2019s Half-Brother</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Mayfield next argues that the trial court erred when it allowed the admission of evidence relating to the prior incident involving Mayfield\u2019s half-brother and the victim. Specifically, Mayfield sought to keep out all evidence relating to an incident where Mayfield\u2019s half-brother, Eric Parker, shot the victim. Mayfield contends before us that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting the admission of this evidence at trial because its prejudicial effect outweighed its probative value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Whether evidence should not be admitted because its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value is a question whose answer \u201crests [with] the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 78, 90, 393 S.E.2d 609, 617 (1990). \u201cThe exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis standard, if nothing else, means that the trial judge\u2019s ruling will not be reversed simply because an appellate court disagrees. Only when reasonable jurists could not differ [does this Court] say an abuse of discretion has occurred.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 753, 607 S.E.2d 738, 743, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005) (adopting the opinion of the panel).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Evidence of motive, although not an element of first-degree murder, \u201c \u2018is relevant and often most persuasive upon the question of the actor\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archie v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 684, 690, 420 S.E.2d 718, 722 (1992) (quoting <em>Epperly v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 232, 294 S.E.2d 882, 892-93 (1982)). Relevant evidence should be excluded if the prejudicial effect of admitting it outweighs its probative value. <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 196, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987). \u201cThe fact that some prejudice may result does not justify automatic exclusion.\u201d Id. Indeed, \u201c[a]ll evidence tending to prove guilt is prejudicial to an accused.\u201d <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 107, 141, 590 S.E.2d 537, 558 (2004). \u201cVirginia law ... intervenes only when the alleged prejudice tends to inflame irrational emotions or leads to illegitimate inferences.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>44 Va.App. at 758, 607 S.E.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Here, the trial court reasonably concluded that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any inappropriate prejudicial effect. The indictments and witness statements plainly established Mayfield\u2019s motive for murdering the victim\u2014to prevent the victim from testifying against Parker. Moreover, they did so in a way to avoid introducing any significant inflammatory information regarding the prior incident. The indictments admitted into evidence established only the bare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>charges and their timing for the purpose of establishing that Mayfield had an apparent motive to kill the victim when he did. The. witness testimony then established that right before and right after the murder, Mayfield was indeed motivated to act in order to prevent the victim from testifying. Accordingly, the trial court reasonably concluded that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any inappropriate prejudicial effect, and thus no error occurred when the trial court admitted this evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">C. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Mayfield finally argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of first-degree murder and the use of a firearm in the commission of the murder. He argues that his testimony should have been believed over the testimony of competing witnesses with criminal histories that could have benefited from testifying for the Commonwealth. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">\u201cWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, [this] Court will affirm the judgment unless the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008). Hence, an \u201cappellate court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 569, 573-74, 667 S.E.2d 763, 765 (2008) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jack</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number><em>son, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). \u201c\u2018This familiar standard gives fall play to the responsibility of the trier of fact ... to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u2019\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 178, 185, 692 S.E.2d 271, 274 (2010) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). Thus, the fact-finder has the sole responsibility of determining the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Commonwealth v. McNeal, </em>282 Va. 16, 22, 710 S.E.2d 733, 736 (2011). \u201cThat responsibility lies with the fact finder because\u201d this Court, \u201c \u2018sitting as an appellate court, and knowing nothing of the evidence or of the witness, except as it appears on the paper, feels itself very incompetent to decide on the credibility of the testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va. (2 Leigh) 769, 777 (1830)).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">Here, Mayfield encourages us to do precisely what we cannot do\u2014to replace the judgment of the jury with our own. The jury was free to disbelieve Mayfield\u2019s testimony that he was not at Oak Trail Apartments when the victim was shot and to believe the testimony of other witnesses that he was at the Oak Trail Apartments and that he shot and killed the victim. Whether the witnesses\u2019 past criminal convictions and pending charges made any of their testimony not credible was an issue for the jury to decide. The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, establishes that Mayfield shot and killed the victim. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to convict Mayfield of first-degree murder and the use of a firearm in the commission of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that no error occurred. The trial court did not err when it declined to strike a prospective juror for cause, when it permitted the admission of evidence regarding Mayfield\u2019s half-brother, or when it concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove that May-field shot and killed the victim. Therefore, we affirm May-field\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-5\">. Rodney H. also saw Mayfield at the Oak Trail Apartments not long before the victim was murdered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b891-10\">. According to Mayfield, \u201cVirginia has yet to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule in regard to jurors who are related to witnesses.\u201d Mayfield urges us to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>adopt a <em>per se </em>rule, noting that other states have adopted such a rule on the basis of implied bias. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v. Kentucky, </em>864 S.W.2d 252 (Ky.1993); <em>Wisconsin </em>v. <em>Gesch, </em>167 Wis.2d 660, 482 N.W.2d 99 (1992). The problem with this argument is that not only has the Supreme Court not \u201cyet\" adopted a <em>perse </em>rule, it has <em>expressly rejected </em>such a rule. <em>See Townsend, </em>270 Va. at 331, 619 S.E.2d at 74-75; <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 826, 553 S.E.2d 731, 733 (2001). Hence, we cannot adopt the rule that Mayfield urges us to adopt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b894-7\">. Mayfield raises the issue of a \"contemporaneous and continuing relationship\u201d in a further erroneous attempt to argue for the <em>per se </em>exclusion of the juror in this case. Citing <em>Perez, </em>Mayfield argues that \"this Court suggested that a juror who has a contemporaneous and continuing relationship with either legal counsel or a witness in the case should be excused for cause.\u201d <em>Perez </em>makes no such holding. In <em>Perez, </em>this Court held that a past acquaintanceship between a juror and a testifying police officer alone was not grounds to strike the juror for cause. <em>Perez, </em>40 Va.App. at 656-57, 580 S.E.2d at 511. In so holding, <em>Perez </em>noted that no \u201ccontemporaneous and continuing relationship\u201d existed between the juror and the officer that would implicate the issue of bias, <em>id., </em>or the issue of protecting the public's confidence in the judicial system, <em>id. </em>at 657-59, 580 S.E.2d at 511. Thus, <em>Perez </em>does not support the consideration of a \"contemporaneous and continuing relationship\u201d between a juror and a witness apart from the issues of bias and public confidence. As we have already explained, Mayfield has waived the public confidence issue on appeal. Thus, we do not evaluate the issue of a \"contemporaneous and continuing relationship\u201d separate from Mayfield's allegation of bias.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b896-8\">. Mayfield also argues in his brief that \u201d[i]t was not necessary for the Commonwealth to establish that Eric Parker shot that particular witness to argue motive.\u201d Mayfield goes on to argue various lesser measures the court could have taken to reduce what Mayfield perceives as the prejudicial effect of the evidence. However, the record before us does not establish that these alternatives were ever proposed to the trial court, either as a part of the motion <em>in limine </em>or at trial. Accordingly, Mayfield has waived this argument on appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
