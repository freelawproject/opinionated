Downey (\u201cDowney\u201d) appeals the revocation and re-suspension of her previously suspended sentences on six felony convictions in the Circuit Court of the County of Chesterfield (\u201ccircuit court\u201d). Downey alleges the circuit court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to prove Downey violated the conditions of her probation \u201cwhen the only evidence of any violation was her own uncorroborated statement.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">On December 15, 2008, the circuit court sentenced Downey to a total of thirteen years in the penitentiary for her convictions on one count of possessing cocaine and five counts of passing a worthless check. The circuit court suspended all thirteen years and placed Downey on supervised probation, indefinitely. On March 17, 2009, the circuit court granted a show cause request and issued a capias ordering Downey\u2019s arrest for violating her probation. By order dated May 14, 2009, the circuit court revoked and re-suspended Downey\u2019s thirteen-year sentence and again placed her on probation for an indeterminate period.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">On June 2, 2009, Downey\u2019s probation officer, James G. Brown (\u201cBrown\u201d), sent a letter to the circuit court requesting the issuance of a show cause against Downey for making \u201ca poor adjustment to supervision.\u201d Brown specifically explained that Downey \u201cis a severe alcoholic and to date, cannot refrain from using alcohol on her own.\u201d Brown\u2019s letter stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>whereas Downey was told to refrain from using alcohol during her initial interview with Brown, she \u201cadmitted to consuming alcohol on numerous occasions during a [subsequent] interview with Brown on June 1, 2009.\u201d Brown requested that Downey be removed from active probation and placed on unsupervised probation with instructions to appear back before the court in one year, because Downey planned to attend an inpatient substance abuse center in Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">In response to Brown\u2019s letter, the circuit court held a show cause hearing on June 29, 2009.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown conceded at the hearing that Downey did not test positive \u201cfor any alcohol screens\u201d on June 1, 2009, and that he did not detect any odor of alcohol about Downey\u2019s person at that time. When Brown met with Downey on June 1, 2009, she \u201cwas clean and sober.\u201d Brown, thus, admitted that the only basis for his request for a show cause was Downey\u2019s admission that she had consumed alcohol. The Commonwealth presented no further evidence in support of its contention that Downey had violated her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Upon the conclusion of the evidence, Downey argued \u201cthis, of course, is a new criminal charge.\u201d Downey explained that \u201cwhenever a criminal defendant admits to something that\u2019s the basis of the crime itself, the Commonwealth needs to, on top of that, have some slight corroboration that she has committed the offense and there is no evidence of that.\u201d Downey asked the judge to find her \u201cnot guilty\u201d of the show cause and to follow along with Brown\u2019s recommendation that she be placed on unsupervised probation for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The circuit court found that Downey violated the terms of her probation and suspended the imposition of sentencing for twelve months on the condition that Downey is \u201cto go and successfully complete\u201d her inpatient program.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">On September 2, 2010, Downey appeared before the circuit court for sentencing. At that time, Downey renewed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>objection to the circuit court\u2019s finding that she violated the terms of her probation, again arguing that the evidence was insufficient for a finding of guilt solely upon Downey\u2019s uncorroborated statement that she used alcohol. Downey submitted a letter from the Wayside Christian Mission in Kentucky affirming the fact that Downey was admitted to their inpatient program on July 1, 2009, and that she completed the 12-step part of the program. The letter from Wayside also stated, however, that while in her after-care program, Downey \u201cwas abusing medications\u201d and she \u201cwas asking other clients for their medications as well.\u201d Downey was allowed to start the program over, but then \u201cdecided not to continue after it was discovered that she was displaying the same behavior as before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The Commonwealth argued Downey\u2019s concession that she consumed alcohol on June 1, 2009, was \u201cclearly a sufficient basis for a violation of probation.\u201d The only question, according to the Commonwealth, was \u201cwhat to do about it.\u201d The circuit court agreed, and reiterated that Downey was in violation of the terms of her probation. The court, thus, revoked each of Downey\u2019s previously suspended sentences and then re-suspended each sentence \u201cunder the same terms and conditions the Court has previously directed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Downey noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Downey argues on appeal that the circuit court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that Downey violated the terms of her probation \u201cwhen the only evidence of any violation\u201d was Downey\u2019s \u201cown uncorroborated statement.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">Whether the evidence is sufficient \u201c\u2018to sustain an order of revocation\u2019 \u201d of a prior criminal conviction is a matter that rests \u201c \u2018within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitehead v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 105, 116, 677 S.E.2d 265, 271 (2009) (quoting <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 325, 327, 228 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1976)). The court\u2019s \u201c \u2018finding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>fact and judgment thereon are reversible only upon a clear showing of abuse of such discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 116, 677 S.E.2d at 271. \u201c \u2018The discretion required is a judicial discretion, the exercise of which implies conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>In such cases, the court \u201cis given a wide discretion in the determination of the sufficiency of the cause for revoking the suspension,\u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 357, 365, 38 S.E.2d 479, 483 (1946), taking into account \u201cthe law and the particular circumstances of the case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 367, 38 S.E.2d at 484 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">At oral argument, Downey conceded that to prevail in her assignment of error, she would have to persuade us on two points: first, that a revocation proceeding is the equivalent of a criminal trial such that the common law rule\u2014that the <em>corpus delicti </em>of a crime must be based upon more than a defendant\u2019s uncorroborated statement\u2014applies, and second, that the common law has not been superseded by the action of the General Assembly in enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-306(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">To resolve this issue, we need only decide the first point. As Downey correctly notes, a revocation hearing is a \u201ccriminal proceeding,\u201d <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 191, 196, 557 S.E.2d 230, 233 (2002), for which a criminal defendant \u201cis entitled to a judicial hearing,\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>185 Va. at 365, 38 S.E.2d at 483. Downey also correctly notes that \u201cin every criminal prosecution,\u201d the Commonwealth must prove by its evidence \u201cthe element of <em>corpus </em>delicti\u2014that is, the fact that the crime charged has been actually perpetrated.\u201d <em>Morning v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 679, 685, 561 S.E.2d 23, 25 (2002). To that end, we have held \u201c \u201cwhere the commission of the crime has been fully confessed by the accused only slight corroborative evidence is necessary to establish the <em>corpus delicti.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hamm v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 150, 157, 428 S.E.2d 517, 522 (1993)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">A conviction cannot be based solely on the uncorroborated statement of a person that a crime has occurred and that he committed it. The <em>corpus delicti </em>cannot be established by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>confession of the accused uncorroborated by any other evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><em>Hamm, </em>16 Va.App. at 157, 428 S.E.2d at 522. Downey reasons that, because Downey\u2019s admission to Brown that she consumed alcohol was uncorroborated by any additional evidence, the circuit court erred as a matter of law in finding the evidence sufficient to convict her of what she asserts is the criminal charge of violating the terms of her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Downey\u2019s argument is interesting, but unavailing. Indeed, it is well settled that \u201c[probation revocation hearings are not a stage of criminal <em>prosecution </em>and therefore a probationer is not entitled to the same due process protections afforded a defendant in a criminal\u201d trial. <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 81, 84, 402 S.E.2d 684, 686 (1991) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 1759-60, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973)). In fact, \u201cprobation statutes are highly remedial and should be liberally construed to provide trial courts a valuable tool for rehabilitation of criminals.\u201d <em>Grant v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 684, 292 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1982). While a probation revocation hearing is a criminal proceeding, it is not a criminal trial, and, therefore, \u201c \u2018formal procedures and rules of evidence are not employed.\u2019\u201d <em>Davis, </em>12 Va.App. at 84, 402 S.E.2d at 686 (quoting <em>Scarpelli </em>411 U.S. at 789, 93 S.Ct. at 1763). Rather, \u201cthe process of revocation hearings \u2018should be flexible enough to consider evidence ... that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2604, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972)). It follows,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201cWhen a defendant fails to comply with the terms and conditions of a suspended sentence, the trial court has the power to revoke the suspension of the sentence in whole or in part. \u2018A trial court has broad discretion to revoke a suspended sentence ... based on Code \u00a7 19.2-306, which allows a court to do so for <em>any cause </em>deemed by it sufficient.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number><em>Word v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 496, 504, 586 S.E.2d 282, 286 (2003) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Alsberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 314, 320, 572 S.E.2d 522, 525 (2002)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, while evidence of a new criminal offense may be relevant and admissible in a probation revocation hearing, the hearing itself is \u201cnot a trial for the commission of a new criminal offense,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe alleged violation by the probationer of the conditions of the suspension of sentence need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>185 Va. at 366, 38 S.E.2d at 483. For this reason, Downey\u2019s reliance on the rule requiring the Commonwealth to prove the <em>corpus delicti </em>in a criminal prosecution is misplaced. That particular rule would apply only to the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of Downey\u2019s underlying felonies or for new criminal activity that may result in a new judgment of conviction and sentence. It is not applicable to the probation revocation process, which deals solely with the possible modification of a judgment already rendered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>At the probation revocation hearings held on June 29, 2009 and September 2, 2010, the Commonwealth proved by Downey\u2019s own statement that she used alcohol on numerous occasions during her probationary period and, thus, that Downey violated the terms of her probation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although uncorroborated, if credited by the trial court, Downey\u2019s statement was sufficient, standing alone, to prove that Downey was \u201cmaking a poor adjustment to supervision.\u201d The circuit court did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in revoking Downey\u2019s previously suspended sentences and re-suspending them under the terms and conditions previously directed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Because the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in finding the evidence sufficient to prove Downey violated the conditions and terms of her probation, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-8\">.
