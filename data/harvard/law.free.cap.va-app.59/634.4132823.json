On appeal, appellant alleges that the trial court lacked the authority to revoke his previously suspended sentence because the period of suspension had been improperly extended at a previous sentencing for a probation violation in 1998. Because we find that appellant cannot collaterally attack the 1998 sentencing order in the instant case, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Appellant was convicted of two charges in 1996 relating to his production of child pornography. On December 20, 1996, appellant was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for these convictions, with fourteen years suspended. Regarding appellant\u2019s suspended sentence, the sentencing order stated that appellant was to be of good behavior and not violate any penal laws of the Commonwealth \u201cfor the term of ten years\u201d and placed appellant under the supervision of a probation officer for the term of two years, among other conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In December 1997 the trial court found that appellant was in violation of the conditions of his suspended sentence. Subsequently, on May 27, 1998, the trial court revoked appellant\u2019s previously suspended sentence and resuspended all but the time he had served to that date. As a condition of this newly resuspended sentence, the trial court ordered appellant to be of good behavior and not violate any penal laws of the Commonwealth \u201cfor the term of fourteen years from the date of release from incarceration.\u201d The trial court also placed appellant under supervised probation for the term of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In July 2010, appellant was convicted in the Richmond City Circuit Court of failing to register as a sex offender in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-472.1. As a result of this separate conviction, on October 22, 2010, the trial court found appellant in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ordered that thirteen years and six months of appellant\u2019s previously resuspended sentence be revoked and that all but ninety days of this sentence be resuspended. As a condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>of the suspension, the trial court ordered appellant to be of good behavior and not violate any penal laws of the Commonwealth \u201cfor the term of fourteen years from this date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The imposition and revocation of a suspended sentence is governed by statute. Regarding the imposition of a suspended sentence, Code \u00a7 19.2-303 grants a trial court the authority to suspend a sentence in whole or in part and \u201cplace the defendant on probation under such conditions as the court shall determine.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-303.1 authorizes a trial court to \u201cfix the period of suspension for a reasonable time, having due regard to the gravity of the offense, without regard to the maximum period for which the defendant might have been sentenced.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-306 governs a trial court\u2019s revocation of a suspended sentence. It provides that a trial court may revoke a previously suspended sentence \u201cfor any cause the court deems sufficient that occurred at any time within the probation period, or within the period of suspension fixed by the court.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-306(A). Alternatively, if the trial court did not originally fix a period of suspension under Code \u00a7 19.2-303.1, Code \u00a7 19.2-306(A) provides that a trial court \u201cmay revoke the suspension for any cause the court deems sufficient that occurred within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced to be imprisoned.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-306(C) provides that upon revocation of the suspension, a trial court \u201cmay again suspend all or any part of [the new sentence imposed] and may place the defendant upon terms and conditions or probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-303, -303.1, and -306 \u201cobviously confer upon trial courts Vide latitude\u2019 and much \u2018discretion in matters of suspension and probation ... to provide a remedial tool ... in the rehabilitation of criminals\u2019 and, to that end, \u2018should be liberally construed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 157, 160, 421 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1992) (quoting <em>Nuckoles v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1083, 1085-86, 407 S.E.2d 355, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>356 (1991); <em>Dyke v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 478, 484, 69 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1952)). \u201c Tn addition, the power of the courts to revoke suspensions and probation for breach of conditions must not be restricted beyond the statutory limitations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 148, 151, 526 S.E.2d 784, 786 (2000) (quoting <em>Grant v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 684, 292 S.E.2d 348, 350 (1982)). Therefore, this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision regarding suspension and probation under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Alsberry v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 314, 320, 572 S.E.2d 522, 525 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">In the instant case, appellant argues that the trial court lacked the authority to revoke his suspended sentence because the trial court impermissibly extended the period of suspension when it revoked appellant\u2019s suspended sentence in 1998. Appellant alleges that his original sentencing order in 1996 imposed a ten-year period of suspension. Appellant argues that the trial court impermissibly extended the period of suspension to fourteen years in 1998. According to appellant, the trial court lost jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s first resuspended sentence in 2006, ten years after the 1996 imposition of suspension, and thus the trial court\u2019s action in 2010 revoking appellant\u2019s previously suspended sentence was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Appellant concedes that he did not preserve his assignment of error under Rule 5A:18 and invokes the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A:18. We need not determine whether Rule 5A:18 bars consideration of appellant\u2019s assignment of error because, even assuming Rule 5A:18 does not bar appellant\u2019s claim, appellant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Here, the trial court extended the period of suspension in the 1998 sentencing order. <em>See Hartless v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 172, 175, 510 S.E.2d 738, 740 (1999) (holding that the good behavior requirement of a suspended sentence defined the period of suspension). Essentially, appellant\u2019s claim in this appeal is a collateral attack on the 1998 sentencing order. Because we find that appellant cannot collaterally attack the 1998 sentencing order through his appeal in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>instant ease, it is not necessary to determine whether the trial court erred by extending the period of suspension in the 1998 sentencing order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant did not appeal the 1998 sentencing order. Unless the 1998 sentencing order was void, appellant may not collaterally attack that sentencing order. <em>See Simmers v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 375, 379, 398 S.E.2d 693, 695 (1990) (holding that the judgment of the trial court revoking the appellant\u2019s suspended sentence was not void and thus could not be collaterally attacked). A sentencing order revoking a suspended sentence is not void when the trial court \u201chad jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Here, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s 1998 revocation hearing at the time it extended the period of suspension. Significantly, the Supreme Court of Virginia \u201chas distinguished subject matter jurisdiction as a unique form of jurisdiction and has defined it as a type of jurisdiction (1) that is granted to courts by constitution or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>statute and (2) that delineates a court\u2019s ability to adjudicate a defined class of cases or controversies.\u201d <em>Mohamed v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 95, 99, 691 S.E.2d 513, 515 (2010). Proceedings for revocation of suspended sentences are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit courts. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 691 S.E.2d at 515. Because the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s 1998 revocation hearing when it decided to extend the period of suspension, the 1998 sentencing order is not void. As a result, appellant cannot collaterally attack the 1998 sentencing order in this case. <em>See </em>Rule 1:1; <em>Simmers, </em>11 Va.App. at 379, 398 S.E.2d at 695 (\u201cWhen the trial court rendered judgment, Simmers had two options available to him. He had twenty-one days from the date of the order to attack it in the trial court, or he could have timely petitioned this Court for an appeal. He did neither, but instead accepted the benefit of the court\u2019s suspension of sentence. Since the judgment of the trial court was not void, Simmers may not sustain a collateral attack at this date.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">It follows then that under the terms of the 1998 sentencing order, the trial court did not err in revoking appellant\u2019s suspended sentence in 2010. The 1998 sentencing order required that appellant be of good behavior and not violate the penal laws of the Commonwealth for a period of fourteen years. Thus, consistent with the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-306(A), the 2010 suspension took place within the fourteen-year period established in the 1998 sentencing order. Therefore, the trial court did not err in revoking appellant\u2019s suspended sentence in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\">. The trial court apparently mistakenly used the term \"probation\u201d interchangeably with the term \"suspension.\u201d This ostensibly imprecise terminology is of no legal significance in the context of this analysis. <em>See Hunter v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 582, 585 n. 1, 695 S.E.2d 567, 569 n. 1 (2010) (stating that the terms \"probation\u201d and \"suspended sentence\u201d are \"often used interchangeably,\u201d even though \"the terms refer to different sentencing matters\u201d). Here, the trial court revoked appellant\u2019s suspended sentence based on its finding that appellant had failed to be of good behavior, a condition of his suspended sentence. Appellant was no longer on probation at the time his suspended sentenced was revoked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b685-6\">. While not required to reach this question, we note this Court's precedents have recognized that a trial court does not err by increasing the period of suspension subsequent to an original sentencing order, upon revocation and resuspension of the sentence. As this Court stated in <em>Wright, </em>32 Va.App. at 151, 526 S.E.2d at 786 (citing <em>Briggs v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 338, 464 S.E.2d 512 (1995)), \"We have previously recognized a trial court's authority to extend a defendant\u2019s suspension period after entering a sentencing order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">Moreover, although this Court subsequently stated in <em>Reinke v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 357, 367-68, 657 S.E.2d 805, 811 (2008), that a trial court does not have the authority to extend the length of the period of suspension upon the resuspension of some or all of a previously suspended sentence, this statement is <em>dictum; Reinke </em>involved the <em>modification of a restitution requirement </em>upon resuspension, not an increase in the period of suspension. Moreover, in support of the sentence containing this statement, <em>Reinke </em>cited authority that both was decided prior to <em>Wright </em>and does not contradict the proposition from <em>Wright </em>cited above. <em>See Nuckoles, </em>12 Va.App. at 1086, 407 S.E.2d at 356 (stating that \"[t]he <em>only </em>limitation placed upon the discretion of the trial court in its determination of what conditions are to be imposed is that a condition be 'reasonable' \" (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Dyke, </em>193 Va. at 484, 69 S.E.2d at 486)); <em>Robertson v. Superintendent of the Wise Corr. Unit, </em>248 Va. 232, 236, 445 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1994) (stating that upon revocation a trial court may not lengthen the period of <em>incarceration, </em>while, significantly, not discussing lengthening the period of suspension).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
