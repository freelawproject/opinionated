She argues on appeal that the trial court erred in imposing a ten-year sentence for the use of a firearm conviction because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 sets the maximum sentence at three years. Appellant further contends the trial court erred in imposing a thirteen-year active sentence for all three crimes despite the \u201csubstantial mitigating evidence\u201d presented at the sentencing hearing. We hold, and the Commonwealth concedes, <em>see </em>Commonwealth\u2019s Br. at 18, that the maximum sentence allowed under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is the mandatory term of either three years or five years,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the trial court therefore abused its discretion in imposing the ten-year sentence. We further hold that the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>err in imposing five years active incarceration for each of the robbery charges. We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the trial court with instructions for entry of a sentencing order consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">On August 2, 2010, appellant pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery and one count of use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery. The trial court accepted appellant\u2019s pleas and continued the matter for sentencing. At the sentencing hearing on December 21, 2010, appellant asked for leniency in sentencing in light of her respectable work history, full cooperation with the authorities upon her arrest, and efforts to improve her life since her incarceration. In response, the Commonwealth stated it did not have an objection to the trial court sentencing appellant below the guidelines.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court considered appellant\u2019s exhibits, \u201cletters from [her] coworkers,\u201d the testimony of her former employer, and appellant\u2019s lack of a significant prior criminal history as mitigating factors in favor of deviating downward from the sentencing guidelines. However, the trial court noted that appellant committed a string of robberies and threatened the victims with a weapon. The trial court accordingly sentenced appellant to twenty years on each of the robbery convictions and ten years on the use of a firearm conviction. The trial court further suspended fifteen years on each of the robbery convictions and seven years on the firearm conviction for a total active sentence of thirteen years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Appellant did not object to the trial court\u2019s reliance on the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing or to the ten-year sentence imposed for the use of a firearm conviction. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCE UNDER CODE \u00a7 18.2-53.1</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Appellant acknowledges that she did not contemporaneously object to the trial court\u2019s imposition of her ten-year incarceration for the use of a firearm conviction. Appellant invokes the \u201cends of justice\u201d exception to Rule 5A:18 to request our consideration of her argument. Under Rule 5A:18, \u201c[n]o ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal unless an objection was stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling.\u201d However, this Court may consider an alleged error to which no timely and specific objection was made when \u201cgood cause [is] shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cDetermining whether the ends of justice exception should be applied requires the appellate court first to determine whether there was error as [appellant] contends and then \u2018whether the failure to apply the ends of justice provision would result in a grave injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 455, 462, 706 S.E.2d 885, 888-89 (2011) (quoting <em>Gheorghiu v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 678, 689, 701 S.E.2d 407, 413-14 (2010)). In other words, the ends of justice analysis is a two-step process: determining whether the alleged error occurred, and, if so, whether justice requires application of the ends of justice provision. \u201cThe record \u2018must affirmatively show that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not that a miscarriage might have occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Akers v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 521, 527 n. 2, 525 S.E.2d 13, 16 n. 2 (2000) (quoting <em>Redman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 215, 221, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in sentencing her to ten years incarceration for the use of a firearm conviction because the maximum allowable incarceration under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 in her case is three years. Specifically, appellant argues the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d language contained within Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 also operates as a maximum because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 neither specifies the class of the offense nor contains a maximum punishment. Appellant concludes that the only option for the trial court was to sentence appellant to three years\u2019 incarceration, none of which could be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The Commonwealth agrees with appellant\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and concedes \u201cthat the <em>only </em>sentence available for a first conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is three years in prison, which cannot be suspended or run concurrently with any other sentence.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Br. at 15 (emphasis in original). However, the Commonwealth points out that in 2004, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to include the phrase \u201cmandatory minimum.\u201d The Commonwealth posits that accepting appellant\u2019s argument would effectively rewrite Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and render the 2004 amendment superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Because appellant asks this Court to interpret the language of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 proscribing punishment, we rely on the familiar principles of statutory construction, and review this issue <em>de novo. See Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 409, 413, 650 S.E.2d 89, 91 (2007). \u201cThe primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998). Thus, we construe a statute \u201cwith reference to its subject matter, the object sought to be attained, and the legislative purpose in enacting it; the provisions should receive a construction that will render it harmonious with that purpose rather than one which will defeat it.\u201d <em>Esteban v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 605, 609, 587 S.E.2d 523, 526 (2003).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>When the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Furthermore, we must give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention as expressed by the language used unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity. If a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Additionally, \u201c[t]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is to be preferred over any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u201d <em>Meeks v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 798, 802, 651 S.E.2d 637, 639 (2007) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-5\"><em>Kozmina v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 347, 349-50, 706 S.E.2d 860, 862 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">\u201cIt is a cardinal principle of law that penal statutes are to be construed strictly against the [Commonwealth]\u201d and \u201ccannot be extended by implication, or be made to include cases which are not within the letter and spirit of the statute.\u201d <em>Wade v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 117, 122, 116 S.E.2d 99, 103 (1960). However, \u201cwe will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Upon conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, a defendant \u201cshall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1 defines the phrase \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d as the \u201cimposition of] the entire term of confinement, the full amount of the fine and the complete requirement of community service pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>scribed by law,\u201d such that the trial \u201ccourt shall not suspend in full or in part any punishment described as mandatory minimum punishment.\u201d However, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 contains no specification as to the class of the offense or a range within which the trial court may set a maximum term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In such instances, Code \u00a7 18.2-14 provides that \u201c[o]ffenses ... for which punishment is prescribed without specification as to the class of the offense, shall be punished according to the punishment prescribed in the section or sections thus defining the offense.\u201d Because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 prescribes only a term of imprisonment of three years, application of Code \u00a7 18.2-14 provides that the mandatory minimum is the maximum as well. As the Commonwealth points out, this construction is problematic because the phrase \u201cmandatory <em>minimum \u201d </em>suggests that the trial court has some discretion in imposing a sentence greater than the mandatory term of incarceration. A minimum sets a sentencing floor, not a ceiling. <em>See Carroll v. Johnson, </em>278 Va. 683, 693, 685 S.E.2d 647, 652 (2009) (requiring the courts to \u201cconsider the ordinary and plain meaning of statutory terms\u201d). Thus, on one hand, it appears from the face of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>statute that no statutory maximum exists and the trial court has the discretion to sentence a defendant to up to life imprisonment for a conviction of possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. On the other hand, application of Code \u00a7 18.2-14 would seem to indicate that the trial court may impose only a three or five-year term of incarceration. To resolve this ambiguity in the statutory language, we turn to the history of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1 in 2004 as part of an extensive overhaul of those statutes prescribing mandatory punishments. <em>See </em>2004 Va. Acts, c. 461, at 674. In the same bill, the General Assembly amended twenty-five other statutes \u201cto make the language used in those sections consistent with the new statutory definition of \u2018mandatory minimum\u2019 set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1 and to make other minor editorial corrections where necessary.\u201d <em>Bullock v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 359, 376-77, 631 S.E.2d 334, 343 (2006). Each of the other statutes affected by the 2004 amendment that proscribe criminal conduct contains either a class specification or a range of punishment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-305; 18.2-36.1; 18.2-51.1; 18.2-57; 18.2-121; 18.2-154; 18.2-248; 18.2-248.01; 18.2-248.1; 18.2-248.5; 18.2-255; 18.2- 255.2; 18.2-270; 18.2-308.1; 18.2-308.2; 18.2-308.2:2; 18.2- 308.4; 19.2-120; 30-19.1:4; 46.2-301; 46.2-341.28; 46.2-357; 46.2-391; 53.1-203. In fact, the sentencing ranges and class specifications of these statutes existed prior to the 2004 amendment. As we previously mentioned above, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 is unique in that it contains neither a sentencing range nor a class specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">We do not share the Commonwealth\u2019s concern that interpreting Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to authorize only a three or five-year term of incarceration would render the inclusion of the term \u201cmandatory <em>minimum </em>\u201d superfluous. As we have previously noted, \u201cthe General Assembly did not intend, in enacting House Bill 1059, to substantively change the existing scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Bullock, </em>48 Va.App. at 377, 631 S.E.2d at 343. Prior to 2004, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 mandated that \u201cany person found guilty thereof shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction\u201d and that \u201cthe sentence prescribed for a violation of the provisions of this section shall not be suspended in whole or in part.\u201d 1993 Va. Acts c. 835; <em>see In re Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 159, 163, 326 S.E.2d 695, 698 (1985) (noting that \u201cby prescribing a mandatory sentence, the General Assembly has divested trial judges of all discretion respecting punishment\u201d). Implicitly granting a trial court the power to impose a life sentence under a statute that previously mandated only a three or five-year sentence would constitute a significant change. Had the General Assembly wished to increase the range of punishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>and grant the trial court discretion in sentencing a defendant for a conviction of use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, it could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Indeed, Code \u00a7 30-19.1:4, which was also amended by the 2004 amendment, requires the Commission to \u201cprepare a fiscal impact statement reflecting the operating costs attributable to and necessary appropriations for any bill which would result in a net increase in period of imprisonment in state adult correctional facilities.\u201d Code \u00a7 30-19.1:4(A). \u201cThe requirement for a fiscal impact statement includes ... those bills which ... impose minimum or mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment or commitment.\u201d Code \u00a7 30-19.1:4(C). In other words, any introduced bill that would result in additional incarceration <em>must </em>include a second enactment clause on the face of the bill setting forth the amount calculated by the Commission. Obviously, an amendment that was intended to increase the term of incarceration from a fixed mandatory term of three years to a potential life imprisonment would impact the operating costs of housing inmates and would require a fiscal impact statement in the bill. <em>See, e.g., </em>S. 1082, 2011 Sess. (Va.2011); H.D. 889, 1994 Sess. (Va.1994) (amending Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-57 and -121). However, House Bill 1059, as introduced, did not include such a fiscal impact statement, nor were additional funds appropriated to pay for the additional costs. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 30-19.1:4(H). Accordingly, despite the ambiguous term \u201cmandatory minimum,\u201d we conclude that the General Assembly\u2019s insertion of that phrase and its decision not to specify the class of the felony amounts to a mere legislative oversight and not an intention to substantively change the range of punishment for conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. <em>Accord Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 751, 754-55, 594 S.E.2d 925, 927 (2004) (recognizing that a \u201cliteral construction of [Code \u00a7 18.2-81] would improperly yield an absurd result\u201d because it \u201c \u2018could be construed as permitting a separate arson prosecution for every item destroyed in a home or car\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Schwartz v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 61, 77, 581 S.E.2d 891, 899 (2003) (Fitzpatrick, C.J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The dissent asserts the majority is inventing a \u201cmanifest absurdity\u201d where none exists. Citing extensively to federal case law and law from other states, the dissent posits that \u201c[i]t is not at all \u2018bizarre\u2019 for a legislature to enact a mandatory minimum sentence and \u2018decline to state a maximum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Infra </em>at 584-85, 721 S.E.2d at 800 (quoting <em>United States v. </em>Turner; 389 F.3d 111, 120 (4th Cir.2004)). However, \u201c \u2018interpreting] [such a] statute as intending to authorize a maximum of life imprisonment\u2019 \u201d is only \u201cself-evident,\u201d <em>Turner, </em>389 F.3d at 120 (quoting <em>Walberg v. United States, </em>763 F.2d 143, 148 (2d Cir.1985) (first alteration added)), because \u201c[t]here are many laws ... upon the statute books of the Federal Government, as well as of the various states, fixing a minimum sentence and leaving it within the power of the court to fix the maximum sentences,\u201d <em>Binkley v. Hunter, </em>170 F.2d 848, 849 (10th Cir.1948). By contrast, every other penal statute enacted by the General Assembly contains a maximum punishment range within the statute itself or by virtue of its class specification, thereby leaving no discretion to impose a life sentence unless specifically authorized. Because Virginia does not follow the established practice of those jurisdictions, the dissent\u2019s reliance on federal and state jurisprudence provides little persuasive value in the instant matter. <em>See Moore v. Warren, </em>250 Va. 421, 423-24, 463 S.E.2d 459, 460 (1995) (rejecting the petitioner\u2019s reliance on case law from other jurisdictions to interpret charitable immunity \u201c[b]ecause the status of charitable immunity and the theories upon which it is based vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Consistent with the dissent, we recognize and respect the good judgment of our trial judges to avoid immoderate results in cases. Here, however, ambiguity or uncertainty exists in the language of the statute, lending itself to potentially inconsistent applications. Accordingly, in consideration of the analysis advanced by the Attorney General and the historical framework of this and related criminal provisions, we believe that the majority interpretation accomplishes the objectives of the legislative scheme. Had the General Assembly only amended Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to include the phrase \u201cmandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>minimum,\u201d we would be compelled to conclude the General Assembly intended to substantially change the range of punishment available under the statute. Instead, the legislature amended a broad range of statutes that included mandatory sentences. As the dissent correctly notes, these statutes expressly provide for maximum sentences. However, the General Assembly did not cap these punishments as part of the 2004 amendment. Instead, the \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d language was inserted \u201cto make the language used in those sections consistent with the new statutory definition of \u2018mandatory minimum\u2019 set forth in Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1.\u201d <em>Bullock, </em>48 Va.App. at 376, 631 S.E.2d at 343. The dissent ignores the guidance in <em>Bullock </em>that recognizes the limited scope of the 2004 amendment and would create a life sentence crime where no class for the felony is provided for in the criminal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Because appellant has demonstrated error as to the imposition of a ten-year term of incarceration, we must determine whether affirming that sentencing order \u201c \u2018would result in a grave injustice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard, </em>281 Va. at 462, 706 S.E.2d at 889 (quoting <em>Gheorghiu, </em>280 Va. at 689, 701 S.E.2d at 413-14). \u201cWhere the sentence imposed is in excess of that prescribed by law, that part of the sentence which is excessive is invalid.\u201d <em>Deagle v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 304, 305, 199 S.E.2d 509, 510 (1973). \u201cDenying [a defendant] his liberty on the basis of a void sentence would impose a grave injustice upon him[, and t]he application of the ends of justice exception is, therefore, fully justified.\u201d <em>Charles v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 14, 20, 613 S.E.2d 432, 435 (2005). Here, the trial court sentenced appellant to a term of incarceration of ten years. Because we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 authorizes the imposition of only a three-year mandatory term of incarceration, the seven-year excess is invalid. Thus, the ends of justice exception applies, and Rule 5A:18 does not bar our consideration of appellant\u2019s argument that her sentence for the use of a firearm conviction exceeded the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the trial court erred in sentencing appellant to a ten-year term of incarceration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>remand with instructions for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">IMPOSITION OF ACTIVE SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Appellant next argues the trial court erred in sentencing her to a thirteen-year active sentence for the robbery convictions in light of the mitigating evidence she presented at the sentencing hearing. Although appellant acknowledges \u201cthe trial court sentenced [her] within the statutory maximum allowable sentence\u201d for the robbery convictions, she nevertheless contends her evidence \u201cshould have resulted in a lower sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\u201cWhen a statute prescribes a maximum imprisonment penalty and the sentence does not exceed that maximum, the sentence will not be overturned as being an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Abdo v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 473, 479, 237 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1977); <em>see, e.g., Fortune v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 643, 651, 406 S.E.2d 47, 51 (1991). Code \u00a7 18.2-58 sets the range of punishment for robbery at \u201clife or any term not less than five years.\u201d Here, the trial court sentenced appellant to twenty years incarceration for each of the robbery convictions and suspended fifteen years of each sentence. Further, upon entry of an order consistent with the views expressed in this opinion, the three years of active incarceration originally imposed will remain in full force and effect. The trial court\u2019s sentences in this case were therefore within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the statutory limits for robbery, and we find no evidence of an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Because Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 does not contain a maximum range of punishment or a specification of the class of the offense, we hold a trial court may sentence a defendant only to a mandatory term of imprisonment of three years for the first conviction or a mandatory term of imprisonment of five years for a second or subsequent conviction. Furthermore, an independent review of the history of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and the 2004 amendment compels this Court to accept the Commonwealth\u2019s concession that the statute prescribes only a three-year mandatory sentence for a first offense. The trial court therefore erred in sentencing appellant to a ten-year term of incarceration.

Contrary to the dissent's view that our \u201ctruncated\u201d interpretation of <em>Bullock </em>takes its holding out of context, that decision provides useful guidance in interpreting the underlying purpose of the 2004 amendment. In <em>Bullock, </em>the defendant argued that when the 2004 amendment omitted the \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law\" clause, the General Assembly implicitly authorized \"the courts to apply the sentencing provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(iii) to suspend any part, if not all, of a juvenile offender\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence for a use of a firearm conviction.\u201d <em>Bullock, </em>48 Va.App. at 373, 631 S.E.2d at 341. We rejected that view because \"the legislative background of the 2004 amendment of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 clearly demonstrates that the amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 was not a 'changed of substance, which add[ed] rights to, or withdr[e]w existing rights from, an original act,\u2019 but rather a 'changed of form, which merely interpreted\u2019 the existing law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375, 631 S.E.2d at 342 (quoting <em>Boyd v.

The exhaustive analysis in <em>Bullock </em>makes clear that substantive changes-such as allowing for the possibility of life imprisonment where none previously existed, as the dissent suggests-is not the purpose of the 2004 amendment.

Minimum Means Minimum</p>\n<p id=\"ARd\">In 2004, the General Assembly amended the felony-firearm statute. \u201cAs a general rule, a presumption exists that a substantive change in law was intended by an amendment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>an existing statute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Bruhn, </em>264 Va. 597, 602, 570 S.E.2d 866, 869 (2002) (citations omitted). That presumption holds true here. The earlier version of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 authorized a <em>fixed </em>\u201cterm of imprisonment\u201d of three years (for the first offense) or five years (for subsequent offenses) that could not be suspended in whole or in part. The 2004 amendment added \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d to qualify the \u201cterm of imprisonment.\u201d 2004 Va.

Hines finds this omission anomalous because, read literally, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 authorizes life imprisonment. This anomaly, Hines reasons, empowers us to blue-pencil the statute, leaving \u201cmandatory\u201d but excising \u201cminimum\u201d from the 2004 amendment. For several reasons, I am unwilling to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">To begin with, what Hines views as a legal anomaly is actually settled law. It is not at all \u201cbizarre\u201d for a legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>to enact a mandatory minimum sentence and \u201cdecline to state a maximum.\u201d <em>United States v. Turner, </em>389 F.3d 111, 120 (4th Cir.2004); <em>see also Ex parte Robinson, </em>474 So.2d 685, 686 (Ala.1985) (\u201cOur research reveals many statutes, both federal and state, which fix a minimum penalty for an offense but which fail to prescribe a maximum penalty.\u201d). When legislatures impose only a \u201cminimum sentence\u201d they leave \u201cit within the power of the court to fix the maximum sentences.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>389 F.3d at 120 (quoting <em>Binkley v. Hunter, </em>170 F.2d 848, 849 (10th Cir.1948)). In short, these statutes impose \u201ca mandatory minimum sentence, not a mandatory maximum sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Lego, </em>855 F.2d 542, 546 (8th Cir.1988). More than a few courts have found this principle \u201cso self-evident as to not need explanation.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>389 F.3d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In such cases, federal and state courts uniformly hold that \u201cin the absence of a statutory maximum penalty, the maximum penalty when a term of not less than a certain number of years is provided, means that the maximum is life imprisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Sias, </em>227 F.3d 244, 247 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also Ex parte Robinson, </em>474 So.2d at 686. This conclusion merely reflects the \u201csensible rule of statutory construction whereby the absence of a specified maximum simply means that the maximum is life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Turner, </em>389 F.3d at 120. The mandatory minimum provision, after all, \u201cis designed to serve as the floor, not the ceiling\u201d for criminal sentences. <em>Sias, </em>227 F.3d at 247.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">A multitude of courts recognize that the minimum-means-minimum principle applies to felony-firearm statutes no less than any other criminal statute. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The majority cites no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>cases suggesting otherwise, and I am unaware of any. Nor am I persuaded by the majority\u2019s cursory dismissal of this unbroken line of federal and state cases on the <em>ipse dixit </em>that they have little in common with our case. <em>Ante </em>at 579-80, 721 S.E.2d at 798. Because the legal issue is the same, they have everything in common. Neither Hines nor the majority, therefore, can shoulder the burden of rebutting the presumption that the 2004 amendment effected a \u201csubstantive change in law,\u201d <em>Bruhn, </em>264 Va. at 602, 570 S.E.2d at 869 (citations omitted), by replacing a <em>fixed </em>term of imprisonment to a mandatory <em>minimum </em>term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">II. The Bullock Digression</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The one case the majority does rely upon, <em>Bullock v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 359, 631 S.E.2d 334 (2006), is neither dispositive nor particularly relevant. <em>Bullock </em>held the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 did not supersede our prior caselaw interpreting the statute to forbid judicial suspension of mandatory sentences. The majority, however, quotes <em>Bullock </em>for a far broader proposition: \u201cAs we have previously noted, \u2018the General Assembly did not intend, in enacting [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>2004 amendment], to substantively change the existing scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.\u2019 <em>Bullock, </em>48 Va.App. at 377, 631 S.E.2d at 343.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 576, 721 S.E.2d at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The majority, however, quotes only half of the pertinent sentence from <em>Bullock. </em>The omitted half includes an important qualification. The full sentence from <em>Bullock </em>reads: \u201cPlainly, then, the General Assembly did not intend, in enacting [the 2004 amendment], to substantively change the existing scope of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 <em>to permit suspension under Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1)(iii) of the mandatory sentences required by Code \u00a7 </em>18.2-53.1.\u201d <em>Bullock, </em>48 Va.App. at 377, 631 S.E.2d at 343 (emphasis added). The truncated quote attributed by the majority to <em>Bullock </em>has been taken out of context. And, taken in context, <em>Bullock </em>adds nothing to the issue before us in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In a footnote, <em>ante </em>at 577 n. 6, 721 S.E.2d at 796-97 n. 6, the majority seeks to rehabilitate its incomplete quote from <em>Bullock </em>by attempting to connect the holding in that case\u2014 concluding that the 2004 amendments to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 did not change existing law forbidding suspension of a mandatory sentence\u2014to the broader revisions proposed by the Virginia State Crime Commission prior to the 2004 amendments. The connection in <em>Bullock </em>made sense because the Commission had repeatedly emphasized that mandatory sentences could not be suspended. Here, the connection makes no sense because the issue is entirely different. The question in our case is not whether a mandatory sentence can be suspended, but whether an unsuspendable mandatory <em>minimum </em>sentence is truly a <em>minimum </em>sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Nothing in the Commission\u2019s recommendations suggested a mandatory minimum sentence, standing alone, should be interpreted as a maximum sentence. <em>See </em>Virginia State Crime Commission Report, House Doc. No. 15, at 5 (2004), available at http://leg2.state.va.us/dls/ h &amp; sdocs. nsf/By+Year/HD152004/$file/HD15\u20142004.pdf. Though the Commission\u2019s report recommended dozens of statutory changes, <em>see id., </em>Part II at 1-7, Part V at 32-41, none <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>mentioned Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. If anything, the legislative history shows just the opposite of what the majority assumes. During the 2004 session, the General Assembly defeated two bills seeking to amend Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 while leaving intact the prior language mandating <em>fixed </em>terms of imprisonment. <em>See </em>House Bill No. 1053H1 (substitute offered Feb. 13, 2004); House Bill No. 377 (offered Jan. 14, 2004). Taking a different approach, the General Assembly replaced the fixed terms of the pre-2004 version of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 with new \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d terms of imprisonment. <em>See </em>2004 Va. Acts ch. 461 (effective July 1, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">III. The Larger Statutory Context</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Equally unconvincing is the majority\u2019s reliance on Code \u00a7 18.2-14, which merely states that unclassified felonies should be punished \u201caccording to the punishment prescribed in the section or sections thus defining the offense.\u201d I do not understand what this adds to the analysis. Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 enacts an unclassified felony. So, under Code \u00a7 18.2-14, we look solely to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 (rather than Code \u00a7 18.2-10\u2019s felony punishment classifications) to determine the sentence to be imposed. But this tells us nothing about what Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 means by imposing a \u201cmandatory minimum term of imprisonment.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-14 begs, but does not answer, the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Along the same lines, I see no interpretative relevance to Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1, which confirms existing law that a \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d sentence cannot be suspended in full or in part. This provision merely states what we already know: The mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 cannot be suspended. <em>See Bullock, </em>48 Va.App. at 377, 631 S.E.2d at 343. A sentence above the minimum, of course, can be, and often is, suspended. If Code \u00a7 18.2-12.1 really meant for a \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d term to be a \u201cmandatory maximum \u201d term, it would be in conflict with a myriad of statutes imposing an unsuspendable \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d term of imprisonment while simultaneously autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>rizing a higher, entirely suspendable, maximum term. <em>See supra </em>at 583 n. 8, 721 S.E.2d at 799-800 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">IV. Plain Meaning &amp; Statutory Absurdity</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">I also question Hines\u2019s underlying assumption, apparently shared by the majority, that the sheer possibility of a life sentence for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 would be a manifest absurdity. <em>Ante </em>at 579-80, 721 S.E.2d at 798. Working from the statutory text, Virginia courts \u201cstrive to give that language a \u2018literal construction\u2019 unless doing so \u2018would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 625, 641, 712 S.E.2d 751, 759 (2011) (citation omitted). The absurdity exception, however, applies only when a literal reading of the statute produces systemic anomalies in a realistic range of likely applications, not in fanciful hypothetical situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">A literal interpretation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1\u2014one that interprets \u201cminimum\u201d to mean minimum, not maximum\u2014cannot be dismissed as a manifest absurdity. No court has ever suggested as much. Nor can we say a life sentence would never be appropriate under this statute. The \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d term of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 applies to various felons, including murderers and rapists who use firearms to kill, abuse, or torture their victims. I see no manifest absurdity in imposing life imprisonment upon a recidivist murderer or rapist who uses a firearm to accomplish his crime.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It does not make it absurd to do so simply because the murderer or rapist also deserves equal punishment on the underlying predicate felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">As for the conjectural possibility that a life sentence could be imposed upon an undeserving criminal, I am content to rely on the good judgment of our trial judges to avoid such immoderate results. That this trust is well-placed is evidenced by the fact that life sentences are \u201crarely, if ever, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>imposed\u201d in felony-firearm cases. <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>628 F.3d 246, 258-59 (6th Cir.2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">V. The Attorney General\u2019s Concession</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Unlike the majority, I am unimpressed by what the majority calls the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cconcession that the statute prescribes only a three-year mandatory sentence.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 582, 721 S.E.2d at 799. I think it fair to call it a concession of sorts, but it is an ambivalent and puzzling one. The Attorney General\u2019s brief quotes from one of our unpublished opinions, <em>Neria v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 3088-07-4, 2009 WL 743316, 2009 Va.App. Lexis 136 (Mar. 24, 2009) (Elder, J.), which held the phrase \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d in another statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-270(C), actually meant mandatory <em>minimum:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">The statute sets a \u201cmandatory minimum fine of $1,000.\u201d The plain, obvious, and rational meaning of \u201cmandatory minimum fine of $1,000\u201d is that the trial court or jury has the discretion to impose a pecuniary punishment greater than $1,000, and nothing in the statute supports a different conclusion. Thus, setting the fine at $2,500 was clearly within the discretion of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\"><em>Neria, </em>2009 WL 743316, at *3, 2009 Va.App. Lexis 136, at *10. Adopting our reasoning, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed in an unpublished order. <em>Neria v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 090813 (Va. Feb. 19, 2010). As a \u201cdecision on the merits,\u201d the <em>Neria </em>affirmance order has precedential value because the analytical \u201cgrounds\u201d for the decision are \u201cdiscernible from the four corners of the Court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Sheets v. Castle, </em>263 Va. 407, 411-12, 559 S.E.2d 616, 619 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Relying on <em>Neria, </em>the Attorney General correctly argues: \u201cHines, in essence, is asking this Court to <em>rewrite </em>the sentencing portion of \u00a7 18.2-53.1 by effectively <em>ignoring </em>the term \u2018minimum\u2019 in the present statute.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 13 (emphasis added). \u201cHad the General Assembly intended the \u2018mandatory minimum\u2019 sentence of three years to be both the minimum and maximum term of imprisonment for an initial violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, it simply would have left the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>three year sentence to be \u2018mandator' instead of amending the statute in 2004 to add the term \u2018minimum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The Attorney General\u2019s brief then takes a surprising turn. After opining on <em>Neria </em>and the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cmandatory minimum,\u201d the Attorney General states he feels \u201cconstrained\u201d to point out that under Code \u00a7 18.2-14, \u201cwhile perhaps <em>not </em>what the General Assembly intended,\u201d it \u201cappears\u201d that the three and five-year mandatory minimums in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 are actually mandatory maximums. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 14-15 (emphasis added). As I noted earlier, however, Code \u00a7 18.2-14 says no such thing. Code \u00a7 18.2-14 merely directs us to the text of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 (rather than Code \u00a7 18.2-10\u2019s felony punishment classifications) to determine the sentence to be imposed. Once we limit ourselves to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the question still remains whether \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d can be judicially construed to mean mandatory <em>maximum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Because I do not share the Attorney General\u2019s angst over Code \u00a7 18.2-14, but agree fully with his plain reading of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1,1 respect but cannot accept his concession. Virginia courts, of course, \u201chave no obligation to accept concessions of error\u201d and can never be bound by a concession on a \u201cpure question of law.\u201d <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 529, 531, 664 S.E.2d 528, 529 (2008) (citing <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>522 F.3d 336, 340 (4th Cir.2008) (recognizing \u201cthe government\u2019s concession of error is not binding on this court\u201d), and <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>47 Va.App. 168, 172, 622 S.E.2d 771, 773 (2005) <em>(en </em>banc)). \u201cPure statutory construction, a matter within the \u2018core competency of the judiciary,\u2019 requires <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>Citland, Ltd. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Kilgore, </em>45 Va.App. 268, 275, 610 S.E.2d 321, 324 (2005) (citation omitted). Unlike the majority, I see nothing upon a <em>de novo </em>review of the law that \u201ccompels this Court,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 582, 721 S.E.2d at 799, to accept the Attorney General\u2019s halfhearted concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">VI. The \u201cFiscal Impact\u201d op the 2004 Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Lacking any textual or caselaw support for its interpretation, the majority turns to the argument that the \u201cmandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>minimum\u201d term in the 2004 amendment could not mean a minimum sentence because that would cost money and the legislature allegedly failed to allocate funds to pay for it. <em>See ante </em>at 578-80, 721 S.E.2d at 797-98 (citing Code \u00a7 30-19.1:4). This argument, it seems to me, is the weakest of all. Probably for this reason, Hines did not make it orally or on brief. Nor did the Attorney General mention it. I think the reason why is that no Virginia court has ever failed to enforce the plain meaning of a statute because, it was thought, the legislature failed to consider its economic consequences. This appears to be the first time such an argument has been factored into the traditional rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">What is more, the assumption underlying this argument rises no higher than a speculative, guess. None of us can explain the absence of a specific appropriation for the 2004 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. It could be the Virginia Criminal Sentencing Commission simply misread the proposed amendment and, as a consequence, neglected to prepare a fiscal impact statement under Code \u00a7 30-19.1:4(A). Perhaps those charged with scoring the fiscal impact relied upon the State Crime Commission Report, not realizing the recommendations in the report addressed only nineteen of the mandatory minimum statutes needing amendment and conspicuously omitted any mention of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. <em>See </em>VCC Report, <em>supra, </em>at 37-38. Maybe this specific funding issue got lost in the larger decision by the General Assembly in 2004 to build two new state prisons at a cost of over $140 million. <em>See </em>2004 Va. Acts Spec. Sess. I, ch. 4, at 493. A year later, in 2005, the General Assembly authorized yet another new prison, <em>see </em>2005 Va. Acts, ch. 951, at 2281-82, which, after being built, was promptly mothballed without ever being used.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">I do not know what to make of these budgeting and appropriation decisions. But I do know what not to make of them. No matter the plausible explanations, none persuade me to interpret \u201cminimum\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to mean anything other than minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>VII. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In sum, the plain wording of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 establishes a mandatory <em>minimum </em>term of imprisonment\u2014not a mandatory <em>maximum. </em>Because the statute sets no upper limit to the potential term of imprisonment, there is no statutory limit. In this case, therefore, the trial court did not err by imposing a ten-year sentence, with seven years suspended, for Hines\u2019s violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b629-7\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 3.2-4212; 4.1-305; 15.2-1812.2; 16.1-253.2; 18.2-36.1; 18.2-36.2; 18.2-46.3:3; 18.2-51.1; 18.2-57; 18.2-60.4; 18.2-61; 18.2- 67.1; 18.2-67.2; 18.2-121; 18.2-154; 18.2-186.4; 18.2-248; 18.2- 248.01; 18.2-248.03; 18.2-248.1; 18.2-248.5; 18.2-255; 18.2-255.2; 18.2-266.1; 18.2-270; 18.2-308.1; 18.2-308.2:2; 18.2-374.1; 18.2- 374.1:1; 18.2-374.3; 46.2-301; 46.2-341.28; 46.2-357; 46.2-391; 46.2-865.1; 53.1-203.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b629-11\">.
