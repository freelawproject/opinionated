The commission found that Richard D. Ragland (appellant) employed appellee, found that appellant \u201chad three or more regular employees,\u201d and, therefore, found that appellant was an \u201cemployer\u201d for the purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act). Code \u00a7 65.2-101 states that under the Act, \u201c \u2018[e]mployee\u2019 shall not mean ... [e]mployees of any person, firm or private corporation ... that has <em>regularly in service </em>less than three employees in the same business within this Commonwealth.\u201d (Emphasis added). On appeal, appellant argues that the commission\u2019s award of benefits should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence that he had three or more employees \u201cregularly in service\u201d at the time of the accident and, thus, contends that appellee was not entitled to benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-101. We agree with appellant\u2019s argument, and, for the following reasons, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">At the time of appellee\u2019s injury, appellant worked as a superintendent at an apartment building in Alexandria. The building\u2019s owner, Robert Whitestone, paid him to clean and manage the building. On Whitestone\u2019s behalf, appellant solicited bids from contractors to remove the building\u2019s old windows in order to install new ones. Appellant did not have a contractor\u2019s license and had never contracted to perform window replacement work before, but, because Whitestone and appellant agreed that time was not of the essence, White-stone agreed to accept appellant\u2019s proposal to complete the window project. Before hiring any workers to assist him, appellant replaced fifty-four of the apartment building\u2019s eighty-three windows. Appellee\u2019s brothers (Serafin and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Hugo) confirmed that about half of the windows had been replaced before they started working on the window project.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">It did not take more than one person to replace each window. Sometimes on the weekends, Whitestone and one or the other of his two grown sons helped appellant, but they were not paid for doing so. Seeking someone to help with the window project, appellant called a contractor he knew, who referred him to Hugo. Hugo testified that he first worked for appellant on January 16, 2008. Appellant and Hugo discussed Hugo\u2019s bringing in additional workers to save time on the window project. Hugo suggested that his brothers, appellee and Serafin, should help them.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Appellee started work on the window project on January 18, 2008, and worked one full day with his brothers and appellant. On his second day of work, January 19, 2008, appellee was injured while operating a table saw. He did not return to work for appellant after his accident. A few days after the accident, Hugo stopped working for appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, appellant never sought out workers to replace any of the three Muguruza brothers for the help they provided on the window project on January 18 and 19, 2008. Seraf\u00edn also stopped working for appellant after the accident, but later asked appellant for work and ended up helping to complete the window project and other projects. Appellee and Hugo, however, were never replaced by any other workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award of benefits to appellee for his injury. It also affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s \u201cfinding that Ragland had three or more <em>regular </em>employees.\u201d (Emphasis added). In making its decision, the commission also specifically found that appellant \u201cwas an employer who had three employees, as well as himself, performing work <em>at the time of the claimant\u2019s accident.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">All employers and employees in Virginia are \u201cconclusively presumed to have accepted the provisions of [the Act].\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-300(A). Excluded from this presumption, however, are \u201c[e]mployees of any person, firm, or private corporation ... that has <em>regularly in service </em>less than three employees.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">In other words, if an employer has three or more employees \u201cregularly in service,\u201d it is subject to the Act and responsible for providing workers\u2019 compensation benefits to qualifying employees. If an employer has fewer than three employees \u201cregularly in service,\u201d it is not subject to the Act and has no obligation to provide its employees with workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\"><em>Hoffman v. Carter, </em>50 Va.App. 199, 210, 648 S.E.2d 318, 324 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">The question here is whether the commission erred in making its finding that appellant \u201chad three or more regular employees\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101, thus subjecting appellant to the Act and requiring him to pay benefits to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">In answering the question before it, this Court is \u201crequired to construe the law as it is written. \u2018An erroneous construction by those charged with its administration cannot be permitted to override the clear mandates of a statute.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Mines, Minerals and Energy v. May Bros., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 119, 396 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1990) (quoting <em>Hurt v. Caldwell, </em>222 Va. 91, 97, 279 S.E.2d 138, 142 (1981)). Although this Court is bound by the commission\u2019s factual findings when those findings are supported by credible evidence in the record, <em>Lynch v. Lee, </em>19 Va.App. 230, 234, 450 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1994), this Court is \u201c \u2018not bound by the commission\u2019s legal analysis in this or prior cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peacock v. Browning Ferris, Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 248, 563 S.E.2d 368, 372 (2002) (quoting <em>USAir, Inc. v. Joyce, </em>27 Va.App. 184, 189 n. 1, 497 S.E.2d 904, 906 n. 1 (1998)). Here, the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>applied the incorrect legal analysis in making its determination that Ragland had three or more employees \u201cregularly in service\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The commission found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">in the context of the job [Ragland] contracted to perform for Whitestone (window replacement), he was an employer who had three employees, as well as himself, performing work <em>at the time of the claimant\u2019s accident. </em>For these reasons, we affirm the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s finding that Ragland had three or more regular employees, such that he was subject to the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">The test the commission used\u2014whether appellant here was an employer who had three employees performing work <em>\u201cat the time of the claimant\u2019s accident </em>\u201d\u2014conflicts with the Court\u2019s prior holdings interpreting Code \u00a7 65.2-101 because, without determining whether any three employees are \u201cregularly in service,\u201d the employer\u2019s liability and the employee\u2019s coverage can fluctuate rapidly based on the number of employees at work at the precise time of the accident. This Court found that \u201c[i]f applicability of the Act was influenced by transient factors, an employer\u2019s status could fluctuate between being subject to the Act and exempt from the Act.\u201d <em>Cotman v. Green, 4 </em>Va.App. 256, 259, 356 S.E.2d 447, 449 (1987). Therefore, \u201c[i]f an employer regularly employs three or more persons to carry out the established mode of performing the work of the business, he should remain subject to the provisions of the Act even if ... the number of his employees temporarily falls below three.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe converse is true, as well; where an employer temporarily or occasionally employs a third person, the employer will not be subject to the provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Osborne v. Forner, </em>36 Va.App. 91, 97, 548 S.E.2d 270, 273 (2001). <em>See also Perry v. Delisle, </em>46 Va.App. 57, 65, 615 S.E.2d 492, 496 (2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Furthermore, the legal standard applied by the commission renders its analysis inconsistent with the plain text of Code \u00a7 65.2-101, which expressly excludes employees from workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>compensation if their employers have <em>\u201cregularly in service </em>less than three employees.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101 (emphasis added). <em>See e.g. Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 599, 603, 673 S.E.2d 923, 925 (2009) (\u201c \u2018every act of the legislature should be read so as to give reasonable effect to every word ... \u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Jones v. Conwell, </em>227 Va. 176, 181, 314 S.E.2d 61, 64 (1984))). To use the legal standard applied by the commission would be to read the word \u201cregularly\u201d out of Code \u00a7 65.2-101. In short, the commission used an incorrect legal standard\u2014and is, therefore, owed no deference on this question. <em>See e.g. County of Buchanan School Bd. v. Horton, </em>35 Va.App. 26, 27, 542 S.E.2d 783, 783 (2001); <em>Biafore v. Kitchin Equipment, </em>18 Va.App. 474, 480, 445 S.E.2d 496, 499 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">B. <em>Whether Appellant Had Three Or More Regular Employees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In determining whether an employee is \u201cregularly in service\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101, this Court examines the employer\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of performing the work.\u201d <em>Cotman, 4 </em>Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448. In addition, \u201cthe term \u2018regularly\u2019 implies a \u2018practice,\u2019 <em>France v. Munson, </em>125 Conn. 22, 3 A.2d 78, 81 (1938), or a \u2018constant or periodic custom,\u2019 <em>Mathers v. Sellers, </em>113 So.2d 443, 445 (Fla.Dist.Ct. App.1959), of employment.\u201d <em>Osborne, </em>36 Va.App. at 96, 548 S.E.2d at 272-73. Therefore, we look for \u201cregularly-recurring periods\u201d of employing the requisite number of persons over some reasonable period of time. <em>Osborne, </em>36 Va.App. at 96, 548 S.E.2d at 272. In addition, \u201c[i]n order for the employer to be subject to the Act, the recurring periods of employing the requisite number of employees should be the rule and not the exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 548 S.E.2d at 272-73 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to appellee,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the undisputed evidence shows that the window <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>replacement project took months to complete and during that interval, appellant employed three workers (Hugo, Serafin, and appellee) simultaneously for, <em>at most, one and a half days\u2014January 18 and part of January 19, 2008. </em>Having three workers for at most one and a half days plainly does not constitute \u201cregularly-recurring periods.\u201d <em>Osborne, </em>36 Va.App. at 96, 548 S.E.2d at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Moreover, appellant installed at least half of the windows himself\u2014without the help of any employees. This fact clearly shows that appellant\u2019s \u201cestablished mode of performing the work of the business,\u201d as required under <em>Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448, did not demand three or more regular employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Most significantly, it is clear that appellant did not regularly employ three or more employees because there is no indication that appellant had three or more regular employees <em>before </em>the accident OR <em>after </em>the accident. Before the accident, appellant did over half of the window replacements himself\u2014without help from the Muguruza brothers or anyone else. Then for one and a half days, appellant employed all three of the Muguruza brothers to assist with the project on January 18 and 19, 2008. All three brothers stopped working for appellant after the accident. Despite the loss of this support on the window project, appellant did not seek to replace Hugo, Seraf\u00edn, or appellee for assistance with the window replacement project or any other project. Although Seraf\u00edn stopped working for appellant after the accident, he later resumed his work for appellant\u2014but only because, after the accident, <em>Seraf\u00edn asked </em>appellant for more work.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>The record simply does not show that appellant needed three or more regular workers to complete the window replacement project. Nor does the record reveal that appellant ever had or sought to hire three or more <em>regular </em>workers\u2014 before, during, or after the accident. Thus, appellant is not subject to the Act under Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Furthermore, this case is similar to <em>Osborne, </em>36 Va.App. at 91, 548 S.E.2d at 270, where this Court affirmed the commission\u2019s finding that the defendant painting contractor did not have three or more employees <em>regularly </em>in service. Each of the defendant\u2019s three part-time employees worked \u201coff and on\u201d for the defendant, but, like appellant here, the defendant usually worked alone, and only occasionally received assistance from his part-time workers. <em>Id. </em>at 94, 548 S.E.2d at 271-72.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Here, appellant employed three individuals for one and a half days in total, and during the remainder of the time he spent on the window project\u2014at least a few months\u2014he employed fewer than three workers. The one and a half day period when appellant employed the requisite number of workers\u2014like the one day in which the defendant in <em>Osborne </em>employed three or more workers\u2014does not amount to having three or more employees \u201cregularly in service\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The commission applied the incorrect legal standard in making its determination that \u201cin the context of the job [Ragland] contracted to perform for Whitestone (window replacement), he was an employer who had three employees, as well as himself, performing work <em>at the time of the claimant\u2019s accident.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Under the correct legal stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>dard\u2014whether appellant had three or more employees <em>\u201cregularly </em>in service\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-101\u2014it is plain that appellant did not have \u201cthree or more employees <em>regularly </em>in service\u201d when he employed Hugo, Serafin, and appellee for a total of one and a half days without any indication of regularity in their service. (Emphasis added). Appellant had never had three employees before the Muguruza brothers worked for him for a day and a half, and he did not have three employees afterwards. Therefore, appellant did not have \u201cthree or more employees regularly in service\u201d at the time appellee was injured either. Consequently, appellant is not subject to the Act under Code \u00a7 65.2-101. <em>See Hoffman, </em>50 Va.App. at 210, 648 S.E.2d at 324. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we reverse the decision of the commission and remand for the commission to vacate the award and for any further proceedings necessary that are consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">. It is unclear whether Hugo left the job voluntarily or whether appellant terminated Hugo's services.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b303-8\">. This Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to appellee, the party who prevailed before the commission. <em>Amoco Foam </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Products Co. v. Johnson, </em>26 Va.App. 267, 272, 494 S.E.2d 169, 172 (1997). However, the relevant facts are not in dispute here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. The commission must \"focus ultimately on \u2018the character of the business' rather than 'the character of the employment relationship' \" in evaluating whether three or more persons are needed to carry out the established mode of performing the work. <em>Hoffman, </em>50 Va.App. at 211, 648 S.E.2d at 324 (quoting <em>Cotman, </em>4 Va.App. at 259, 356 S.E.2d at 448).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\">.
