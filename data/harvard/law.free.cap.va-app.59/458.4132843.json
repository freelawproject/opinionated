BEALES, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) is authorized to review awards on the ground of a change in condition under Code \u00a7 65.2-708, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">No such review shall be made after twenty-four months from the last day for which compensation was paid, pursuant to an award under this title, except: (i) thirty-six months from the last day for which compensation was paid shall be allowed for the filing of claims payable under \u00a7 65.2-503 and certain claims under subsection B of \u00a7 65.2-406 or (ii) twenty-four months from the day that the claimant undergoes any surgical procedure compensable under \u00a7 65.2-603 <em>to repair or replace a prosthesis or orthosis.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX9\">Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In this appeal, Kathryn Saffert (Saffert) challenges the commission\u2019s finding that a prosthesis was <em>removed </em>from her ankle during a September 12, 2008 surgery\u2014but was not <em>replaced </em>within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii). For the following reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">While working as an elementary school teacher for the Fairfax County School Board (employer), Saffert suffered a compensable injury on September 18, 2002, when she stepped in a hole at the school playground and fractured her ankle. Saffert was awarded reasonable and necessary lifetime medical benefits. Saffert was also awarded various periods of wage loss benefits. The last period of Saffert\u2019s wage loss benefits ended on March 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">On June 23, 2005, Saffert underwent a total ankle replacement surgery. During this procedure, a titanium prosthesis was placed in Saffert\u2019s ankle area. This prosthesis was designed to simulate her ankle\u2019s natural motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">However, in the years following her total ankle replacement surgery, Saffert\u2019s range of motion was unsatisfactory and her pain continued\u2014leading Dr. Kitaoka of the Mayo Clinic to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>conclude that the total ankle replacement had failed. Dr. Kitaoka recommended removing the prosthesis and performing \u201can arthrodesis in order to provide stability and relief.\u201d The commission\u2019s record in this case states that an arthrodesis is a procedure that fuses a joint into a fixed position.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">On September 12, 2008, Dr. Kitaoka performed the arthrodesis of Saffert\u2019s left ankle, noting the following procedure: \u201c1. Removal of total ankle replacement. 2. Removal of retained compression screws. 3. Ankle arthrodesis with intercalated iliac crest bone graft and internal fixation.\u201d At his final evaluation of Saffert, in March 2009, Dr. Kitaoka noted that Saffert\u2019s pain had improved somewhat\u2014but that Saffert had \u201cpermanent stiffness of her ankle and hindfoot\u201d due in large part to the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On April 3, 2009, Saffert filed a change-in-condition application in the commission, requesting permanent partial disability benefits. Employer asserted that Saffert\u2019s change-in-condition application was untimely under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) because Saffert filed this application more than 24 months after March 11, 2005\u2014the last date that compensation had been paid to her. In response, Saffert contended that her total ankle replacement prosthesis was actually replaced during the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure. Thus, Saffert claimed that her April 3, 2009 change-in-condition application was timely under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) because the arthrodesis was a surgical procedure \u201cto repair or replace\u201d a prosthesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">At the evidentiary hearing before the deputy commissioner, Saffert was asked on cross-examination whether the prosthesis used in the June 23, 2005 total ankle replacement surgery was supposed to enable a range of motion \u201c[j]ust like\u201d she had before her ankle injury. Saffert responded in the affirmative. Saffert then testified that the prosthesis was removed and that her ankle joint was fused during the September 12, 2008 surgery. Saffert\u2019s cross-examination continued accordingly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">Q. It\u2019s not mobile anymore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">A. No. It doesn\u2019t ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Q. And that fused joint, it doesn\u2019t work like an ankle joint. It\u2019s just stationary, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">A. It\u2019s stationary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Based on the medical evidence and Saffert\u2019s own testimony, the deputy commissioner found that the prosthesis was <em>re</em>moved\u2014but not repaired or replaced\u2014during the arthrodesis procedure on September 12, 2008. Therefore, the deputy commissioner found that Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) was inapplicable\u2014and that Saffert\u2019s change-in-condition application was untimely under the general 24-month limitations period mentioned in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">On review by the full commission, Saffert argued that the deputy commissioner misinterpreted Code \u00a7 65.2\u2014708(A)(ii) by requiring that the prosthesis be replaced by another prosthesis. Saffert urged the commission to define the verb \u201creplace\u201d as simply \u201cto put something ... in the place of something.\u201d A majority of the commissioners disagreed with Saffert\u2019s argument, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">It is difficult to believe the legislature intended this result, since, as pointed out by the employer, one would expect that, whenever a joint prosthesis is removed, it would be replaced by something, even if only a suture. Had the legislature intended so broad a reading, it seems more likely that they would have simply used the phrase \u201cremove a prosthesis\u201d rather than \u201creplace a prosthesis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Saffert also argued to the full commission that her total ankle replacement prosthesis had actually been replaced by a \u201clongitudinal Steinmann pin\u201d during the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure. However, the commission majority found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">At the hearing below, the employer introduced a copy of the definition of prosthesis as set forth in <em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary, </em>30th edition, which states: \u201can artificial substitute for a missing body part, such as an upper limb, lower limb, eye, or tooth, used for functional or cosmetic reasons, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>As the employer points out, the purpose of the prosthesis was to replace the function of the claimant\u2019s ankle joint. The function of the ankle joint is to permit motion. The purpose of removing the claimant\u2019s prosthesis, and fusing the joint, was to prevent any motion of the joint. There is simply no sense in which the claimant\u2019s prosthesis was replaced with another prosthesis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Accordingly, the commission found that the change-in-condition application that Saffert filed on April 3, 2009 was untimely under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u201cAccording to Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), a party may ask the commission to \u2018review any award\u2019 of benefits based upon \u2018the ground of a change in condition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Gordon, </em>281 Va. 543, 550, 708 S.E.2d 846, 850 (2011) (quoting Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)). \u201c \u2018[I]n an application for review of any award on the ground of change in condition, the burden is on the party alleging such change to prove his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019\u201d <em>Herbert Clements &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Harris, </em>52 Va.App. 447, 458, 663 S.E.2d 564, 570 (2008) (quoting <em>Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Bateman, 4 </em>Va.App. 459, 464, 359 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">In addition, as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Gordon, </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) \u201calso includes language that acts, in effect, as a statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>281 Va. at 551, 708 S.E.2d at 851. Relevant to this appeal, Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) permits review of an award within \u201ctwenty-four months from the day that the claimant undergoes any surgical procedure compensable under \u00a7 65.2-603 to repair or replace a prosthesis or orthosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">A. The Commission Did Not Err in Interpreting Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Saffert argues that the commission misinterpreted Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) by requiring that a prosthesis be replaced by <em>another </em>prosthesis that serves the same function or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>purpose as the prosthesis being replaced. Saffert contends that the commission interpreted Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) too narrowly, and, therefore, failed \u201cto liberally construe the provisions\u201d of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and \u201cto carry out its humane and remedial\u201d purposes. <em>Frey v. Gunston Animal Hosp., </em>39 Va.App. 414, 421, 573 S.E.2d 307, 310 (2002); <em>see Dinwiddie Cnty. Sch. Bd. v. Cole, </em>258 Va. 430, 436, 520 S.E.2d 650, 653 (1999). Saffert raises an issue of statutory interpretation, which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Prince William Co. School Bd. v. Rahim, </em>58 Va.App. 493, 500, 711 S.E.2d 241, 244 (2011) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not expressly define what it means to \u201creplace\u201d a prosthesis for the purposes of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii). When, as here, \u201c \u2018a statute contains no express definition of a term, the general rule of statutory construction is to infer the legislature\u2019s intent from the plain meaning of the language used.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grafmuller v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 58, 62, 698 S.E.2d 276, 278 (2010) (quoting <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Pshp., </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998)). To that end, \u201cthis Court follows the long-held standard that the clear meanings of words are controlling\u201d and determines the legislature\u2019s intention from the plain language of the statute, \u201c \u2018unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alston v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 115, 124, 637 S.E.2d 344, 348 (2006) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Hall, </em>161 Va. 924, 930, 172 S.E. 445, 447 (1934)). Simply put, \u201c[o]nce the legislature has acted, the role of the judiciary \u2018is the narrow one of determining what [the legislature] meant by the words it used in the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 725, 732, 697 S.E.2d 20, 24 (2010) (quoting <em>Dionne v. Se. Foam Converting &amp; Packaging, Inc., </em>240 Va. 297, 304, 397 S.E.2d 110, 114 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Saffert argues that a \u201csurgical procedure ... to replace a prosthesis\u201d occurs under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) any time a prosthesis is removed and \u201csomething\u201d else is inserted in place of the prosthesis. However, Saffert\u2019s reading of the verb \u201creplace\u201d simply \u201cis not consistent with that word\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Carey v. Saffold, </em>536 U.S. 214, 219, 122 S.Ct. 2134, 2138, 153 L.Ed.2d 260 (2002); <em>see Ruby v. Cashnet, Inc., </em>281 Va. 604, 609, 708 S.E.2d 871, 874 (2011) (stating that, when a statutory term is undefined, that term must be accorded its ordinary meaning). Saffert\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) essentially would permit its 24-month limitations period to apply in situations where a prosthesis is removed during a surgical procedure\u2014but not actually <em>replaced.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The plain language of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) uses the words \u201creplace a <em>prosthesis\u201d\u2014not </em>\u201cremove a prosthesis.\u201d \u201c[W]hen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used ... and we are bound by those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Va. Beach v. ESG Enters., Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (quoting <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Props., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990)). To interpret Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) so as to apply in cases where a prosthesis has simply been removed, but <em>not </em>replaced, would \u201c \u2018defeat the obvious intention of the legislature,\u201d\u2019 <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 441, 393 S.E.2d 405, 411 (1990) (quoting <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 831, 94 S.Ct. 1262, 1272, 39 L.Ed.2d 782 (1974)), \u201cwhich a court simply should not and cannot do,\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>56 Va.App. at 734, 697 S.E.2d at 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Furthermore, just because a prosthesis has been <em>removed </em>does not mean that the prosthesis has been <em>replaced. </em>The Supreme Court has explained that the word \u201creplace\u201d means \u201c \u2018to take the place of: serve as <em>a substitute </em>for ... to put in place of: provide a substitute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Seoane v. Drug Emporium, </em>249 Va. 469, 475, 457 S.E.2d 93, 96 (1995) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1925 (1986)). A \u201csubstitute\u201d is something that \u201cis <em>available for use </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>instead of something else.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2280 (1981) (emphasis added); <em>see also Day v. Abernathy, </em>204 Va. 723, 729, 133 S.E.2d 299, 303 (1963) (explaining that the word \u201csubstituted\u201d in \u201cits ordinary sense and well-known meaning designates something <em>placed in a position </em>previously occupied by another thing\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Thus, in order to \u201creplace\u201d a prosthesis under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii), a <em>substitute </em>must \u201ctake the place of\u2019 the prosthesis that is removed during the surgical procedure. <em>See Seoane, </em>249 Va. at 475, 457 S.E.2d at 96. A \u201csubstitute\u201d is often defined as an \u201cequivalent\u201d of the item being replaced. <em>See R.D. Offutt Co. v. Lexington Ins. Co., </em>494 F.3d 668, 673 (8th Cir.2007) (\u201cThe [dictionary] listing for \u2018replacement\u2019 refers to \u2018replace\u2019 which is defined as \u2018to provide or procure a substitute or equivalent in place of.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>2 Oxford English Dictionary </em>2495 (compact ed.1971))). The close association between a \u201csubstitute\u201d and an \u201cequivalent\u201d is reflected in various opinions from the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Lamar Co., LLC v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>270 Va. 540, 620 S.E.2d 753 (2005), the Supreme Court noted dictionary definitions for the verb \u201creplace\u201d as to \u201c \u2018provide a substitute or successor for\u2019 \u201d and to \u201c \u2018supply an equivalent for.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 620 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>755 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1925 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">By its very nature, a prosthesis is a functional or cosmetic <em>substitute </em>(or equivalent) for an actual body part.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, when a prosthesis is <em>replaced </em>during a surgical procedure, it logically follows that <em>another substitute </em>(or equivalent) that is \u201cavailable for use\u201d for the same function or purpose must take its place. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2280 (1981) (defining \u201csubstitute\u201d). Therefore, Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) clearly requires more than just a showing that \u201csomething\u201d (or anything) was inserted back into the claimant\u2019s body during the surgical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">As the commission here noted, under Saffert\u2019s very broad definition of \u201creplace,\u201d even surgical sutures could qualify as a replacement for a prosthesis. Although it is true that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cshould be liberally construed\u201d to carry out its \u201chumane and beneficial purposes,\u201d <em>Cole, </em>258 Va. at 436, 520 S.E.2d at 653, this Court must always \u201cascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature,\u201d <em>Chase v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>266 Va. 544, 547, 587 S.E.2d 521, 522 (2003). Saffert\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) would essentially permit this subsection\u2019s 24-month limitations period to apply in cases where a prosthesis has only been <em>removed. </em>However, the plain language of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) simply does not apply to cases where a prosthesis has only been removed. This Court \u201cmay not interpret [statutory] language in a way that effectively holds that the General Assembly did not mean what it actually expressed.\u201d <em>Hicks v. Mellis, </em>275 Va. 213, 218, 657 S.E.2d 142, 144 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Given the use of the specific word \u201creplace,\u201d the disputed portion of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) applies when a prosthesis has been removed and a substitute or equivalent for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>prosthesis has been put in its place\u2014i.e., when the prosthesis has been replaced. Accordingly, the commission\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.2\u2014708(A)(ii) was consistent with the plain language of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">B. Saffert\u2019s Ankle Prosthesis Was Not Replaced During the September 12, 2008 Arthrodesis Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Saffert also challenges the commission\u2019s finding that \u201c[t]here is simply no sense in which the claimant\u2019s prosthesis was replaced\u201d during the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure. Saffert contends that the prosthesis was replaced by a \u201clongitudinal Steinmann pin\u201d during this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">On appeal from the commission, this Court reviews the facts in the light most favorable to employer, as the prevailing party in the commission. <em>Apple Constr. Corp. v. Sexton, </em>44 Va.App. 458, 460, 605 S.E.2d 351, 352 (2004). \u201c[W]e must defer to the commission\u2019s findings of fact if supported by credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Diaz v. Wilderness Resort Ass\u2019n, </em>56 Va.App. 104, 114, 691 S.E.2d 517, 522 (2010). \u201c \u2018In determining whether credible evidence exists, the appellate court does not retry the facts, reweigh the preponderance of the evidence, or make its own determination of the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pruden v. Plasser Am. Corp., </em>45 Va.App. 566, 574-75, 612 S.E.2d 738, 742 (2005) (quoting <em>Wagner Enters. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">In this case, the commission defined the term \u201cprosthesis\u201d as \u201can artificial substitute for a missing body part, such as an upper limb, lower limb, eye, or tooth, used for functional or cosmetic reasons, or both.\u201d During oral argument before this Court, Saffert\u2019s counsel acknowledged that the commission\u2019s definition of this term was appropriate. Applying the commission\u2019s definition of the term \u201cprosthesis,\u201d we conclude that credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s finding that Saffert\u2019s ankle prosthesis was not replaced during the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Here, the commission found that the purpose of the total ankle replacement prosthesis was to simulate the function of Saffert\u2019s ankle joint and permit motion\u2014but that \u201cthe purpose of removing the claimant\u2019s prosthesis, and fusing the joint, was to prevent any motion of the joint.\u201d This factual finding was certainly supported by credible evidence in the record. Saffert herself acknowledged at the evidentiary hearing that the prosthesis was <em>supposed </em>to \u201csimulate\u201d the motion of her ankle joint. Saffert testified that her ankle joint was completely immobile after the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure\u2014which removed the prosthesis\u2014explaining that it remained \u201cstationary\u201d and did not \u201cmove at all\u201d any longer following this surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to employer (as the prevailing party in the commission), nothing in this record even suggests that any of the materials used during the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure were designed to simulate motion of Saffert\u2019s natural ankle joint\u2014which was the purpose of the prosthesis that was <em>removed </em>during that procedure. No substitute or equivalent for the prosthesis took the place of the prosthesis that was removed during the procedure. The record in this case reflects that the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure did not involve a replacement of the prosthesis, but instead was an alternative treatment, having a different medical purpose than her earlier ankle replacement surgery. Therefore, credible evidence supported the commission\u2019s finding that the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure was not a surgical procedure to \u201creplace\u201d a prosthesis under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">For the 24-month limitations period of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) to apply, a prosthesis must be not only removed but actually <em>replaced </em>by a substitute or equivalent for the prosthesis that has been removed. On appeal, we \u201cmust defer to the commission\u2019s finding[ ]\u201d that the September 12, 2008 arthrodesis procedure was not a surgical procedure to <em>replace </em>a prosthesis under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) because that finding is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201csupported by credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>56 Va.App. at 114, 691 S.E.2d at 522. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s conclusion that Saffert\u2019s April 3, 2009 change-in-condition application was untimely filed under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), as it was filed more than 24 months after March 11, 2005\u2014the last day on which employer paid Saffert compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A)(ii) also applies in cases where the claimant has undergone a surgical procedure to 'repair\u201d a prosthesis. However, appellant has not ever argued to us that this particular provision has any application to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b513-5\">. <em>See, e.g., Abi-Najm v.
