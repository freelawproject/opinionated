Wills and Todd Solomon (\u201cappellants\u201d) appeal from a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach (\u201ccircuit court\u201d) dismissing their petition for appeal challenging the decision of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (\u201cVMRC\u201d) to permit Dirk Sanford and Charles Gregory (\u201cappellees\u201d) to locate pound nets in Chesapeake Bay, because their petition failed to allege sufficient facts to establish standing. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Appellees filed permit applications with VMRC to locate pound nets on bottomland in the Chesapeake Bay, near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel and Lynnhaven Inlet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 24, 2009, VMRC conducted a public hearing to consider appellees\u2019 applications. At that hearing, appellants spoke in opposition to the permit applications. They asserted the pound nets were inappropriate for such a densely populated area of Chesapeake Bay, would pose a navigation hazard for boats, and would be placed near the beach and in waters frequently and customarily used by appellants and others for recreational purposes. After consideration of VMRC staff recommendations and testimony in support of and in opposition to appellees\u2019 permit applications, VMRC approved appellees\u2019 pound net permit applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Appellants appealed VMRC\u2019s decision to grant the permits to the circuit court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 28.2-1205(F). That statute provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of the [VMRC] under this section is entitled to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act ([Code] \u00a7 2.2-4000 <em>et </em>seq.).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Appellees demurred to appellants\u2019 petition for appeal and moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that appellants lacked standing to appeal VMRC\u2019s decision to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">On July 10, 2009, following arguments on the standing issue, the circuit court found, in pertinent part, that \u201c[appellants] have failed to allege facts sufficient to show that they are aggrieved by the [VMRC\u2019s] March 24, 2009 decision to grant the respective license applications of [appellees] Sanford and Gregory to locate pound nets in the Chesapeake Bay near the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel and Lynnhaven Inlet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Appellants filed an amended petition for appeal on July 29, 2009.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They asserted that VMRC\u2019s decision to approve the permits was arbitrary and capricious and that the permits unlawfully authorized encroachment in, on, or over state-owned subaqueous bottomlands, were unsupported by adequate evidence, were granted in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 28.2-1205 and 2.2-4020(E),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and were unlawfully granted in violation of the public trust doctrine<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Virginia Constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>They also contended that VMRC\u2019s decision to approve appellees\u2019 permits \u201cha[d] caused and will continue to cause substantial harm, great inconvenience^] and added expense in the pursuit of [appellants\u2019] recreational needs and interests as the direct result of the requirement that they avoid the waters near their homes now occupied by said pound nets.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Appellants asked the circuit court to reverse VMRC\u2019s permitting decision and order that the pound nets be removed; or alternatively, that it reverse VMRC\u2019s decision and remand to VMRC for further review of the permit application in accordance with Code \u00a7 2.2-4020.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellees demurred and moved to dismiss appellants\u2019 amended petition for appeal, again asserting that appellants failed to plead a sufficient basis to establish standing to challenge VMRC\u2019s permitting decision. Appellees contended that appellants failed to establish that they possessed an \u201cimmediate, pecuniary[,] and substantial\u201d interest to challenge the permit, and failed to establish that VMRC\u2019s permitting decision imposed on them an obligation or burden that was different than that suffered by the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>After hearing argument on the standing issue, the trial court found that appellants did not \u201chave an immediate[,] pecuniary[,] or substantial interest\u201d in VMRC\u2019s decision to grant the pound net permits, thereby lacking standing to challenge the permits. On November 19, 2009, the trial court entered its final order dismissing appellants\u2019 amended petition for appeal for lack of standing. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 demurrer to their petition for appeal. A demurrer \u201cadmits the truth of the facts alleged in the pleading to which it is addressed, as well as any facts that may be reasonably and fairly implied and inferred from those facts.\u201d <em>Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc., </em>273 Va. 564, 572, 643 S.E.2d 219, 223 (2007). \u201cBecause our review of a circuit court\u2019s decision sustaining a demurrer addresses that same legal question, we review the circuit court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo.\u201d The Chesapeake Bay Found., Inc. &amp; Citizens for Stumpy Lake v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Bd., </em>46 Va.App. 104, 111, 616 S.E.2d 39, 42 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u201cVAPA\u201d) provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-7\">[a]ny ... party aggrieved by and claiming unlawfulness of a case decision ... shall have a right to the direct review thereof by an appropriate and timely court action against the agency or its officers or agents in the manner provided by the rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">Code \u00a7 2.2-4026.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">To establish that a petitioner is \u201caggrieved\u201d by a permit decision of VMRC, the petitioner \u201c \u2018must show that he has an immediate, pecuniary <em>and </em>substantial interest in the litigation, and not a remote or indirect interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bd. of Supervisors v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>268 Va. 441, 449-50, 604 S.E.2d 7, 11 (2004) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Comm\u2019n v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>231 Va. 415, 419, 344 S.E.2d 899, 902 (1986)). \u201cTo establish standing under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>this definition of \u2018aggrieved,\u2019 appellants [are] required to demonstrate that they possess[ ] either \u2018an immediate, pecuniary[,] and substantial interest in the litigation\u2019 or that they [have been] denied, \u2018some personal or property right, legal or equitable,\u2019 by VMRC\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Biddison v. Va. Marine Res. Comm\u2019n, </em>54 Va.App. 521, 529, 680 S.E.2d 343, 347 (2009) (quoting <em>Bd. of Supervisors, </em>268 Va. at 449-50, 604 S.E.2d at 11). Standing will not be conferred on a petitioner whose \u201csole interest ... is to advance some perceived public right or to redress some anticipated public injury <em>when the only wrong he has suffered is in common with other persons similarly situated.\u201d Virginia Beach Beautification Comm\u2019n, </em>231 Va. at 419, 344 S.E.2d at 902 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">While recreational interests may suffice to confer standing under VAPA if those interests are also \u201cimmediate, pecuniary, and substantial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 420, 344 S.E.2d at 903, such interests nonetheless must be distinguishable from interests \u201cshared generally with the public,\u201d <em>Va. Marine Res. Comm\u2019n v. Clark, </em>281 Va. 679, 688, 709 S.E.2d 150, 155 (2011). Here, appellants\u2019 interests are indistinguishable from those of any boater, kayaker, swimmer, or recreational fisher in the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel and Lynnhaven Inlet area of the Chesapeake Bay. Appellants are not burdened \u201cto any greater extent than\u201d any other similarly situated party who \u201cfinds itself in disagreement with\u201d the VMRC\u2019s permitting decision. <em>Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n v. City of Virginia Beach, </em>222 Va. 728, 733, 284 S.E.2d 595, 598 (1981). Because appellants have failed to plead sufficient facts to show that they have an \u201c \u2018immediate, pecuniary[,] and substantial interest in the litigation,\u2019 \u201d <em>Biddison, </em>54 Va.App. at 528, 680 S.E.2d at 347 (quoting <em>Bd. of Supervisors, </em>268 Va. at 449, 604 S.E.2d at 11), that is not shared by \u201cother persons similarly situated,\u201d <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Comm\u2019n, </em>231 Va. at 419, 344 S.E.2d at 902, we conclude they have not established standing to challenge VMRC\u2019s permitting decision in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\">.
