Thomas challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting these convictions, arguing that he cannot be convicted under the current version of Code \u00a7 46.2-357 because his driver\u2019s license was not actually \u201crevoked\u201d within the meaning of the Code. For the following reasons, we disagree with Thomas\u2019s arguments. Therefore, we affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On August 24, 1993, Thomas was declared a habitual offender, pursuant to former Code \u00a7 46.2-351.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The circuit court\u2019s order adjudicating him as such stated that Thomas was \u201cbarred from operating a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d Furthermore, the order required Thomas \u201cto surrender to [the] [c]ourt any and all licenses or permits to operate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>motor vehicle on the highways of this State for disposal according to law.\u201d The order did not use the term \u201crevoke\u201d or \u201crevocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In 2010, Thomas was indicted for two different violations of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. The first indictment was for driving as a habitual offender while in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 and having previously been convicted of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2). The second indictment was for driving as a habitual offender, second or subsequent offense. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">At trial, after the Commonwealth presented its case-in-chief, Thomas presented no evidence, but made a motion to strike, which the trial court took under advisement. On November 8, 2010, the trial court denied Thomas\u2019s motion to strike and convicted him on both counts of violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357. Thomas now appeals these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Thomas argues that he cannot be convicted for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357 because the circuit court\u2019s 1993 order declaring him a habitual offender did not \u201crevoke\u201d his driver\u2019s license within the defined meaning of that term in Title 46.2. Code \u00a7 46.2-357 provides, in relevant part: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person determined or adjudicated an habitual offender to drive any motor vehicle or self-propelled machinery or equipment on the highways of the Commonwealth while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A). Thomas does not contest that he is a habitual offender or that he is barred from driving a vehicle in the Commonwealth. Rather, he argues that the language \u201cwhile the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A), requires that the Commonwealth prove that his driver\u2019s license was actually <em>revoked. </em>This, he argues, the Commonwealth failed to do, since the 1993 order declaring him a habitual offender did not satisfy Title 46.2\u2019s definition of \u201crevoke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-100 provides that \u201c \u2018[r]evoke\u2019 or \u2018revocation\u2019 means that the document or privilege revoked is not subject to renewal or restoration except through reapplication after the expiration of the period of revocation.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question before us is whether the circuit court\u2019s 1993 order was sufficient to revoke Thomas\u2019s driving privilege for purposes of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A). We hold that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We review questions of statutory construction <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs. v. Cook, </em>276 Va. 465, 480, 666 S.E.2d 361, 368 (2008). Furthermore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201c[i]n the construction of statutes, the courts have but one object, to which all rules of construction are subservient, and that is to ascertain the will of the legislature, the true intent and meaning of the statute, which are to be gathered by giving to all the words used their plain meaning, and construing all statutes <em>in pari materia </em>in such manner as to reconcile, if possible, any discordant feature which may exist, and make the body of the laws harmonious and just in their operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\"><em>Lucy v. Cnty. of Albemarle, </em>258 Va. 118, 129-30, 516 S.E.2d 480, 485 (1999) (quoting <em>Tyson v. Scott, </em>116 Va. 243, 253, 81 S.E. 57, 61 (1914)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">At the time Thomas was declared a habitual offender, former Code \u00a7 46.2-355 provided that when a court found a person to be a habitual offender, it was to issue an order \u201cdirecting] the person not to operate a motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth and to surrender to the court all licenses or permits to drive a motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth for disposal in the manner provided in [Code] \u00a7 46.2-398.\u201d The version of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) then in effect provided that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle or self-propelled machinery or equipment on the highways of the Commonwealth while the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>order of the court prohibiting such operation remains in effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">In 1995, Code \u00a7 46.2-355 was amended to provide that when a court found a person to be a habitual offender, it was to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">enter an order (i) revoking the person\u2019s license if the proceeding is pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 46.2-351.2 or (ii) affirming the determination of the Commissioner and the revocation of the person\u2019s license if the proceeding is pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 46.2-352 and directing the person not to operate a motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth and to surrender to the court all licenses or permits to drive a motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth for disposal in the manner provided in [Code] \u00a7 46.2-398.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apo\">Similarly, Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) was simultaneously amended to provide that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle or self-propelled machinery or equipment on the highways of the Commonwealth while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thomas contends that the new \u201crevocation\u201d terminology in these amendments introduced a new element into the offense that was not present before and that a court\u2019s order tracking the language of the older version of Code \u00a7 46.2-355 is therefore insufficient to meet the requirements of the amended language of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. We believe that the circuit court\u2019s order here, which utilized the language of the older Code \u00a7 46.2-355, was sufficient to \u201crevoke\u201d Thomas\u2019s license within the definition of that term in Code \u00a7 46.2-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Under Code \u00a7 46.2-100, a driver\u2019s license or privilege to drive that has been \u201crevoked\u201d is \u201csubject to <em>renewal </em>or <em>restoration </em>... through <em>reapplication </em>after the expiration of the period of revocation.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Significantly, Code \u00a7 46.2-356 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>No license to drive motor vehicles in Virginia shall be <em>issued </em>to any person determined or adjudicated an habitual offender (i) for a period of ten years from the date of any final order of a court entered under this article or if no such order was entered then the notice of the determination by the Commissioner finding the person to be an habitual offender and (ii) until the privilege of the person to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth has been <em>restored </em>by an order of a court entered in a proceeding as provided in this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two important observations are apparent from the language of this section. First, a person who has previously been declared a habitual offender must be <em>re-issued </em>a new driver\u2019s license; he does not receive his old license back. This implies that his former license was revoked, not merely suspended, and that he must accordingly <em>reapply </em>for a new license \u201cafter the expiration of the period of revocation.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-100. Second, a person who has previously been declared a habitual offender must have his privilege to drive <em>restored </em>by a court order. This also implies that the person\u2019s license is deemed to have been revoked, because revoked licenses are subject to <em>restoration, </em>while suspended licenses are merely subject to <em>reinstatement. See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Thus, Code \u00a7 46.2-356 treats anyone who has ever been declared a habitual offender as having had his driver\u2019s license revoked. If a habitual offender is unable to obtain a driver\u2019s license without having a court order restoring his privilege to drive and being issued a new driver\u2019s license, we fail to see how a habitual offender could ordinarily be someone who has not had his privilege to drive \u201crevoked\u201d as that term is defined in Code \u00a7 46.2-100.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Thomas was declared a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>habitual offender, he was barred from operating a motor vehicle on the highways and was ordered to surrender his driver\u2019s license. Thereafter, to reacquire his privilege to drive, he would have had to apply for the issuance of a new driver\u2019s license. Therefore, it is simply a distinction without a difference to suggest that his privilege to drive was not revoked for purposes of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">It is certainly true, as Thomas points out, that \u201cwhen a statute has been amended, there is a presumption that the General Assembly intended to effect a substantive change in the law.\u201d <em>Britt Constr., Inc. v. Magazzine Clean, LLC, </em>271 Va. 58, 63, 623 S.E.2d 886, 888 (2006). Accordingly, we must \u201cassume that a statutory amendment is purposeful, rather than unnecessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we are mindful, as Thomas also observes, that \u201c \u2018[p]enal statutes must be strictly construed against the State and ... cannot be extended by implication or construction, or be made to embrace cases which are not within their letter and spirit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002) (omission in original) (quoting <em>Commonwealth Dep\u2019t of Motor Vehicles v. Athey, </em>261 Va. 385, 388, 542 S.E.2d 764, 766 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\u201cHowever, although we construe statutes strictly in criminal cases, we will not apply \u2018an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute\u2019 that would subvert the legislative intent expressed therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979)). Indeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Amerson, </em>281 Va. 414, 418, 706 S.E.2d 879, 882 (2011) (quoting <em>Conger v. Barrett, </em>280 Va. 627, 630, 702 S.E.2d 117, 118 (2010)). We believe that a fair reading of the provisions of the Habitual Offender Act indicates that the General Assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>did not intend the results that would logically follow from Thomas\u2019s proposed interpretation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Under Thomas\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A), no person can be prosecuted under that section if the order declaring him a habitual offender tracks the language of the older, preamended version of Code \u00a7 46.2-355. Thomas asks us to read Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) as requiring the specific term \u201crevoke\u201d or \u201crevocation\u201d to have been used in a court\u2019s order declaring someone a habitual offender. However, were we to adopt such an interpretation, we would effectively be asserting that by amending the statute in the manner it did in 1995, the General Assembly intended that anyone declared a habitual offender after 1995 would be subject to the provisions of Code \u00a7 46.2-357, but that anyone declared a habitual offender under the language of the pre-amended statute would no longer be subject to prosecution under Code \u00a7 46.2-357.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not believe the General Assembly intended such an incongruous result. <em>See Meeks v. Commonwealth, </em>274 Va. 798, 802, 651 S.E.2d 637, 639 (2007) (\u201c[A] statute should never be construed in a way that leads to absurd results.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Thomas attempts to analogize this case to <em>Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 430, 578 S.E.2d 758 (2003). In Rose, a general district court had issued an order in 1996 adjudicating Rose a habitual offender, but the court had not checked the box on its order that would have revoked Rose\u2019s driver\u2019s license and ordered him \u201cnot to operate a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 578 S.E.2d at 759. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Supreme Court noted that \u201cto sustain a conviction for driving a motor vehicle in violation of [Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) ], the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant\u2019s driving privilege has been revoked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 434, 578 S.E.2d at 760. Reversing Rose\u2019s conviction for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357, the Court reasoned that the order before it \u201cdetermined Rose to be an habitual offender but failed to direct him not to operate a motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435, 578 S.E.2d at 761. Accordingly, the Court held that \u201can \u2018incomplete\u2019 order which adjudicates a person as an habitual offender, but \u2018erroneously\u2019 fails to impose the required prohibition against that person operating a motor vehicle, does not satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof in a subsequent trial charging that person with violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Here, the circuit court\u2019s order did not simply adjudicate Thomas a habitual offender, but also \u201cbarred [him] from operating a motor vehicle on the highways of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d Thus, the order was not incomplete, and <em>Rose </em>does not compel a conclusion that the order in this case is insufficient to satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof for establishing a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In sum, we conclude that the circuit court\u2019s order in 1993 adjudicating Thomas a habitual offender and using the language of the pre-amended Code \u00a7 46.2-355 in effect at that time was sufficient to revoke Thomas\u2019s driving privilege within the meaning contemplated by Code \u00a7 46.2-357 and to render Thomas subject to prosecution under that section. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to convict Thomas for violating Code \u00a7 46.2-357.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Thomas\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-11\">. This section was repealed in 1999. It set forth the definitional requirements of a \"habitual offender.\u201d For a basic discussion of the General Assembly's partial repeal of the Habitual Offender Act in 1999, see <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 173, 179-81, 647 S.E.2d 517, 520-21 (2007). As this Court noted in <em>Lilly,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-12\">Effective July 1, 1999, the General Assembly repealed the then-current method of declaring a driver to be an habitual offender. Under that process, the Division of Motor Vehicles would make such a declaration in a civil administrative proceeding subject to judicial review. The General Assembly, however, did not repeal the criminal provision prohibiting previously declared habitual offenders from driving [i.e., Code \u00a7 46.2-357].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">50 Va.App. at 180, 647 S.E.2d at 520.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b546-9\">. In contrast, \" '[s]uspend\u2019 or 'suspension' means that the document or privilege suspended has been temporarily withdrawn, but may be reinstated following the period of suspension unless it has expired prior to the end of the period of suspension.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-100.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">. These amendments took effect on January 1, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b547-8\">.

The version of this statute in effect before the 1995 amendments was substantially the same as the current version for purposes relevant to the issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\">. Of course, we acknowledge that the order adjudicating a person a habitual offender must be complete, including a prohibition against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>operating a motor vehicle on the highways in the Commonwealth. <em>See Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>265 Va. 430, 435, 578 S.E.2d 758, 761 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\">. Of course, we recognize that some pre-1996 orders adjudicating individuals habitual offenders used the term \"revoke.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Varga </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 547, 549, 536 S.E.2d 711, 712 (2000) (circuit court\u2019s order from 1984 declared defendant a habitual offender and stated that his \"privilege to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth of Virginia [was] REVOKED\"); <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 537, 541, 478 S.E.2d 324, 326 (1996) (substantially identical order from 1986). Undoubtedly, however, many of the pre-1996 orders would simply have tracked the language of the statute then in effect, as did the order in this case. We do not believe the General Assembly meant to differentiate between these types of orders and the legal effect they would or would not continue to have when it amended Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-355 and 46.2-357 in 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
