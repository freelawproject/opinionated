On appeal, we hold that the circuit court committed reversible error when it found that it was constrained by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hoy v. Hoy, </em>29 Va.App. 115, 510 S.E.2d 258 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The record on appeal establishes that father has completely ignored and frustrated the trial court\u2019s child support orders\u2014 and that mother\u2019s only means of obtaining the necessary child support for the parties\u2019 two children is through attaching father\u2019s retirement account. We find that neither <em>Hoy </em>nor any other provision of Virginia domestic relations law deprived the circuit court of authority to enter a QDRO pursuant to the procedures of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Therefore, we reverse the portion of the circuit court\u2019s final order of divorce denying mother\u2019s motion for entry of a QDRO and remand the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Mother and father were married in Virginia on February 23, 2009, approximately eleven months after the birth of their first child. They separated on or about December 15, 2009, while mother was pregnant with their second child, who was born on April 13, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Father filed a complaint for a divorce on February 25, 2010, and mother filed a cross-complaint for a divorce seeking <em>pendente lite </em>child support. In its April 16, 2010 <em>pendente lite </em>order, the trial court ordered father to make monthly child support payments in the amount of $2,000. Because the trial court determined that there was already a child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>arrearage of $9,000, it ordered father to pay an additional $500 per month to begin satisfying this child support arrearage.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Father never made <em>any </em>of these child support payments ordered by the trial court. In fact, at some point in the divorce proceedings, father actually left the United States\u2014 and there is no indication from the record on appeal that he has ever returned to this country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, during the pendency of the divorce proceedings, the arrearage created by father\u2019s failure to make any child support payments continued to grow considerably.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Mother filed a written motion for the entry of a QDRO on January 13, 2011,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when father\u2019s child support arrearage had grown to almost $28,000. Mother asserted: (a) that father had not appeared at any of the hearings in the trial court; (b) that father had left the country and was \u201cnot likely to return\u201d; (c) that mother had not had any contact with father either \u201cdirectly or through counsel\u201d; (d) that father \u201cwas the sole income earner for the family prior to and during the marriage,\u201d leaving mother with essentially no assets; (e) that mother and the parties\u2019 two children had been forced to rely on charity and public assistance; and (f) that father\u2019s retirement account with his Virginia employer was \u201cthe only asset\u201d of father\u2019s that mother knew of that could be used to pay the father\u2019s unpaid child support obligation. Mother contended that ERISA gives \u201cstate courts the authority to enter QDROs assigning retirement benefits to an alternate payee for the purpose of garnishing a retirement account to enforce payment\u201d of a child support arrearage. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(E) (defining an \u201calternate payee\u201d under ERISA as \u201cany spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant\u201d); <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(J) (\u201cA person who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order shall be considered for purposes of any provision of this Act a beneficiary under the plan.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">During the divorce trial on January 21, 2011, father\u2019s counsel argued that the trial court lacked authority to enter the QDRO that mother sought. Father\u2019s counsel relied on <em>Hoy, </em>29 Va.App. at 119, 510 S.E.2d at 255, where this Court held that a litigant\u2019s claim as a judgment creditor against her former spouse for unpaid spousal support could not be \u201crecast\u201d into an appropriate circumstance for entering a QDRO. In response, mother\u2019s counsel noted that <em>Hoy </em>involved an attempt to re-open a divorce case that already had been final for over two decades\u2014in order to enter a QDRO attaching a retirement account that did not even exist at the time of the Hoys\u2019 divorce. Thus, mother\u2019s counsel argued that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hoy </em>did not affect the trial court\u2019s authority <em>in this case </em>\u201cto assign a portion of the income\u201d from father\u2019s retirement account \u201cto an alternate payee\u201d for the payment of unpaid child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Father\u2019s counsel also argued at the hearing in the trial court that a QDRO could not be entered because mother had expressly disavowed any property interest in husband\u2019s retirement account assets in the parties\u2019 premarital agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In response, mother\u2019s counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>What we are asking the Court to do is to enter a qualified domestic relations order pursuant to ERISA to allow Ms. Nkopchieu to essentially garnish Mr. Minlend\u2019s retirement account, which is an asset, for the purpose of paying unpaid support. The Court\u2019s authority to do this stems specifically from the federal law in ERISA, which allows for the Court to enter a QDRO for two separate purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">The Court is permitted to enter the QDRO as it relates to property division, which is what we would be doing in equitable distribution, which we are not in dispute that that is not before the Court today. <em>We are not saying she has a property interest in his retirement account, as it relates to a property division. </em>What we are saying is the other purpose of the QDRO, as it relates to ERISA in saying that the Court may enter a QDRO for the purpose of enforcing its child support or spousal support orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">(Emphasis added). Mother\u2019s counsel then reiterated that mother was not seeking to create a personal \u201cright or an interest\u201d in father\u2019s retirement account.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In its final order of divorce, the trial court awarded mother sole legal and physical custody over the two children and increased father\u2019s monthly child support obligation to $2,035. The trial court found that father\u2019s child support arrearage had grown to $28,106.66 and ordered father \u201cto pay this amount in full immediately.\u201d However, the trial court denied mother\u2019s motion for the entry of a QDRO to satisfy the child support arrearage\u2014finding that it was \u201cbound by the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision\u201d in <em>Hoy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">On appeal, mother emphasizes (as she emphasized in the trial court) that she does not seek any <em>personal </em>interest in father\u2019s retirement assets\u2014and that the parties\u2019 premarital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>agreement bars any such a claim. However, the premarital agreement also states, \u201cNothing in this agreement shall be construed as limiting the right of either party to make claims for child support.\u201d Mother contends that she is actually pursuing a claim of unpaid child support for her infant children. Mother asserts that she seeks a QDRO <em>only </em>in her capacity as the parent with sole legal and physical custody of the parties\u2019 children, and, therefore, as the children\u2019s guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Given mother\u2019s position here, the fact that the parties were married (and are now divorced) is simply irrelevant. Mother could have made precisely the same request for the entry of a QDRO <em>even if the parties had never married. </em>This is because mother seeks to vindicate <em>the children\u2019s rights </em>to child support\u2014not any property rights mother herself might have that resulted from the marriage with father.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Gray v. Johnson, </em>7 Va.App. 614, 622, 376 S.E.2d 787, 791 (1989), this Court noted, \u201cAn actual distinction rests in the right to child support.\u201d This Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">[T]he duty of support of all children is owed to the child, not the mother. The amount of the support is based primarily on the needs of the child and the ability of the father to provide, not the needs of the mother. Thus, the mother does not have the same legal right of the child in seeking child support; rather, <em>the right is solely that of the child. </em>The mother simply has the right to act as a conduit for the payments of support to the child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Acting solely \u201cas a conduit for the payments of support\u201d to the parties\u2019 children, <em>id., </em>mother seeks the entry of a QDRO in this case. She argues that ERISA and Virginia\u2019s laws pertaining to domestic relations would permit the entry of a QDRO under the specific circumstances of this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Mother \u201cpresents an issue of law, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Ahari v. Morrison, 275 </em>Va. 92, 95, 654 S.E.2d 891, 893 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">A. ERISA\u2019s Requirements for the Entry of QDROs</p>\n<p id=\"Avd\">Under ERISA, the funds of an employee benefit plan (such as father\u2019s retirement account with his Virginia employer) generally \u201cmay not be assigned or alienated.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1). However, this general prohibition against the assignment or alienation of employee retirement benefits does not apply when a state domestic relations order \u201cis determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3); <em>see Wilson v. Wilson, </em>18 Va.App. 193, 200, 442 S.E.2d 694, 698 (1994) (\u201cUnder federal law, qualified domestic relations orders are an exception to ERISA\u2019s proscription against alienation and assignment of pension benefits.\u201d). ERISA states that \u201c[e]ach pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">According to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(i), a \u201cqualified domestic relations order\u201d is a domestic relations order (I) \u201cwhich creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee\u2019s right to, <em>or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, </em>receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan,\u201d and (II) which meets all of the technical requirements of \u201csubparagraphs (C) and (D)\u201d of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3). (Emphasis added). ERISA further defines the term \u201cdomestic relations order\u201d as \u201cany judgment, decree, or order\u201d that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">(I) <em>relates to the provision of child support, </em>alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>(II) <em>is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law </em>(including a community property law).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Under ERISA, the children of retirement plan participants can become plan beneficiaries and alternate payees of the plan through the entry of a QDRO. <em>See Boggs v. Boggs, </em>520 U.S. 833, 847, 117 S.Ct. 1754, 1763-64, 138 L.Ed.2d 45 (1997). The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Boggs </em>that one of the \u201ccentral purposes\u201d of the 1984 amendments to ERISA that created the \u201cQDRO mechanism\u201d was to \u201cgive enhanced protection\u201d to plan beneficiaries such as \u201cdependent children in the event of divorce or separation....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Therefore, under ERISA and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of that Act\u2019s purpose, the minor children of the parties in this case certainly can be listed as beneficiaries and alternate payees of the retirement account (through mother, as their guardian) in a QDRO. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I). Furthermore, mother\u2019s request for a QDRO \u201crelates to the provision of child support,\u201d and, therefore, satisfies another of ERISA\u2019s conditions for the entry of a QDRO. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">However, the trial court never considered whether mother\u2019s draft QDRO satisfied ERISA\u2019s technical requirements for the entry of a QDRO. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C) and 1056(d)(3)(D). The trial court found that it was constrained by this Court\u2019s decision in Hoy\u2014and, therefore, that it could not enter a QDRO pursuant to Virginia\u2019s domestic relations law. We disagree with the reasoning and conclusion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">B. The Decision in <em>Hoy </em>Does Not Apply to the Very Different Circumstances in this Case</p>\n<p id=\"A_O\">Characterizing it as a \u201cdefining case\u201d in Virginia domestic relations law, father\u2019s counsel asserted in the trial court that <em>Hoy </em>established that a QDRO simply cannot be entered in Virginia to enforce a spousal support or child support arrearage in order to attach or garnish assets in a retirement account. The trial court accepted this argument and found it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>was constrained by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hoy. </em>However, the decision in <em>Hoy </em>simply is not controlling on the very different facts, circumstances, and interests that are presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In <em>Hoy, </em>when the parties (Pearce and Hoy) divorced in 1973, Pearce was awarded spousal support. Pearce was not awarded any interest in Hoy\u2019s retirement plan\u2014and Pearce could not possibly have received such an award, given that Hoy\u2019s retirement plan did not even exist at the time of the divorce. Pearce later received an $84,000 judgment for spousal support arrearages. In 1997\u2014nearly a quarter-century after the entry of the final divorce decree\u2014Pearce moved the trial court \u201cto reinstate\u201d the divorce case \u201cfor entry of a QDRO allowing garnishment of Hoy\u2019s pension plan as a source for payment of the spousal support arrearages judgment.\u201d <em>Hoy, </em>29 Va.App. at 118, 510 S.E.2d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">This Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Pearce\u2019s motion, holding that Pearce\u2019s \u201cattempt to reopen and modify the court\u2019s final decree of divorce\u201d was prohibited by Rule 1:1. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 510 S.E.2d at 254-55. This Court noted that the final divorce decree predated the effective date of the continuing jurisdiction statute, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4). <em>Id. </em>at 118, 510 S.E.2d at 255. This Court also explained that Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4) would not have provided Pearce any relief because the trial court was not permitted to make any substantive modification of the parties\u2019 divorce decree or to provide Pearce with an interest in Hoy\u2019s retirement plan that was not already recognized in the divorce decree. <em>Id. </em>at 118-19, 510 S.E.2d at 255. Given those circumstances, this Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">Under Virginia domestic relations law, Pearce may not recast her claim as a judgment creditor, albeit one that seeks recovery of unpaid spousal support, into a QDRO which substantively modifies the terms of a final divorce decree. Therefore, under ERISA, the proposed order does not qualify as a QDRO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 119, 510 S.E.2d at 255.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">This case is very different than <em>Hoy. </em>Here, mother sought the entry of a QDRO for child support <em>while the divorce </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>proceedings were active. </em>This issue was argued extensively by the parties in the trial court, and the trial court then denied mother\u2019s motion for the entry of a QDRO in its final order. Thus, unlike in <em>Hoy, </em>mother here certainly does not seek to reopen and substantively modify the terms of a final divorce decree. This difference alone brings this case completely outside of the scope of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hoy. </em>Therefore, the trial court erred when it found that it lacked authority under <em>Hoy </em>to enter a QDRO in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">C. The Trial Court Had Authority to Enforce Father\u2019s Duty to Support His Minor Children</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In addition, this case concerns a parent\u2019s duty to support his minor <em>children. </em>As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295, 298, 449 S.E.2d 55, 56 (1994), \u201cBoth parents owe a duty of support to their minor children.\u201d Thus, the rights of children to receive \u201csupport from both parents\u201d may not be \u201csubstantially abridged\u201d by the actions of either or both parents. <em>Id. </em>This principle is consistent with Virginia\u2019s \u201cstrong and compelling interest in protecting the welfare of its dependent citizens.\u201d <em>Caswell v. Lang, </em>757 F.2d 608, 610 (4th Cir.1985) (citing Code \u00a7 20-107.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In this case, ever since the beginning of the divorce proceedings (which father initiated), father has completely ignored this paramount duty to support the parties\u2019 children\u2014 and has completely frustrated the trial court\u2019s orders directing him to pay child support. According to the record on appeal, father has not paid one dime of child support since the parties separated in December 2009. Father even left the country during the middle of the divorce proceedings\u2014and, therefore, apparently has ceased earning wages from his Virginia employer that mother could seek to garnish. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-79.1. Mother also knows of no other property belonging to father, such as real estate, that could be the subject of a lien for failure to pay child support. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-460(A). Meanwhile, according to mother, she and the parties\u2019 two young children are forced to rely on charity and public assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>tance. By ignoring his obligation to support his own small children, father has left the children in a desperate plight.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Father\u2019s counsel argued in the trial court that the entry of a QDRO would be inappropriate here because \u201cCongress has an interest in protecting these sort of retirement accounts\u201d in order \u201cto allow some form of support or income to folks once they retire, so the state is not burdened with that.\u201d Although \u201c[i]t is perhaps true that the [ERISA] statutory scheme is designed for the protection of retirement income,\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Rife, </em>529 N.W.2d 280, 281 (Iowa 1995), this argument presents a very incomplete picture of the law. ERISA specifically permits the parties\u2019 minor children to qualify as beneficiaries and alternate payees of father\u2019s retirement plan. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(E) and 1056(d)(3)(J).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Boggs </em>that ERISA now provides \u201cenhanced protection\u201d to dependent children \u201cin the event of divorce or separation\u201d by authorizing a trial court to enter a QDRO. <em>Boggs, </em>520 U.S. at 846, 117 S.Ct. at 1763. Commenting on the proper balance between the protection of retirement assets and the state\u2019s authority to enforce the plan participant\u2019s domestic obligations, the Colorado Court of Appeals has noted, \u201cThe provisions creating a QDRO evince the overall congressional purpose to protect persons and their dependents from the claims of creditors while, at the same time, <em>preventing interference with the state\u2019s power to enforce family support obligations.\u201d In re LeBlanc, </em>944 P.2d 686, 688 (Col.Ct.App.1997) (emphasis added). Similarly, the Iowa Supreme Court has held, \u201cERISA was not intended to be a vehicle for avoidance of familial support\u201d duties or obligations. <em>In re Marriage of Rife, </em>529 N.W.2d at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Simply put, to use ERISA\u2019s <em>general </em>rule against assigning or alienating retirement assets as a way to permit father to continue to avoid his duty to pay child support would completely thwart Virginia\u2019s established principles of domestic relations law, especially the law dealing with child support. Code \u00a7 20-107.2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Upon entry of a decree providing (i) for the dissolution of a marriage, (ii) for a divorce, whether from the bond of matrimony or from bed and board, (iii) that neither party is entitled to a divorce, or (iv) for separate maintenance, <em>the court may make such further decree as it shall deem expedient concerning </em>the custody or visitation and <em>support of the minor children of the parties </em>as provided in Chapter 6.1 (\u00a7 20-124.1 et seq.) of Title 20, including an order that either party or both parties provide health care coverage or cash medical support, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">From the earliest versions of Code \u00a7 20-107.2, the Supreme Court has held that \u201c \u2018the evident purpose of the legislature was to give to the court <em>the largest discretion </em>in respect to the estate of the parties, and <em>not to relieve the offending parent of any duty, </em>moral, social, or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morris v. Henry, </em>193 Va. 631, 639, 70 S.E.2d 417, 422 (1952) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Heninger v. Heninger, </em>90 Va. 271, 275, 18 S.E. 193, 195 (1893)). Moreover, the Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe welfare of the child is to be regarded more highly than the technical legal rights of the parent.\u201d <em>Forbes v. Haney, </em>204 Va. 712, 716, 133 S.E.2d 533, 536 (1963). Simply put, \u201c[w]here the interest of the child demands it,\u201d the rights of a parent \u201cmay be disregarded.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Based on these established principles of Virginia domestic relations law, father owes his minor children the duty of satisfying his child support obligations. Thus, father is also obligated to satisfy any child support arrearage that has accrued due to his own failure to pay child support\u2014regardless of whether the arrearage is small or, as in this case, the arrearage has grown to over $28,000. The trial court here ordered father to pay the child support arrearage \u201cin full immediately,\u201d and the record discloses <em>only one asset </em>that could possibly be used to satisfy the child support arrearage\u2014 father\u2019s retirement account. Both ERISA and Virginia law certainly permit the attachment of this asset through the entry of a QDRO. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s finding to the contrary was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The record here establishes that a QDRO attaching father\u2019s retirement account represents <em>the only </em>actual method of enforcing the trial court\u2019s child support orders, which father has completely ignored and frustrated to the severe detriment of his own children. Code \u00a7 20-107.2. ERISA <em>and </em>Virginia\u2019s law on domestic relations authorized the circuit court to enter a QDRO under the specific circumstances of this case. Therefore, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s finding that it lacked authority to enter a QDRO. It incorrectly found that it was bound in this situation by this Court\u2019s decision in Hoy\u2014which is distinguishable from the present case before us now, given this case\u2019s very different circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Whether mother\u2019s draft QDRO in this case actually <em>qualified </em>as a QDRO under ERISA\u2019s technical requirements pertaining to the contents of a QDRO is, of course, a question that we cannot resolve in this appeal. The trial court never actually considered the contents of the draft QDRO and also denied mother\u2019s request to admit into the evidence at trial certain documents relevant to father\u2019s retirement account. Accordingly, we direct the circuit court on remand to grant mother leave to file a new draft QDRO reflecting any changes in circumstances that have occurred since her written motion of January 13, 2011, to admit financial documents relevant to the entry of a QDRO, and to determine whether mother\u2019s draft QDRO meets ERISA\u2019s technical requirements for the contents of a QDRO, including those in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(3)(C) and 1056(d)(3)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-7\">. The trial court record includes an April 29, 2010 email from father to his trial counsel indicating that father would remain in Cameroon indefinitely due to \"nerve issues or complications from malaria or something else.\" This is the last indication from the record concerning father's whereabouts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\">. This was actually mother's second written motion for the entry of a QDRO in this case. Mother's first motion for a QDRO, filed on July 21, 2010, was summarily denied by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\">. The premarital agreement provides, \"In regard to retirement plans and accounts, the parties covenant and agree that all accumulations in, and contributions to, retirement plans and accounts whether before or during the marriage shall be the Separate Property of the party who owns the account or is the plan beneficiary.\u201d However, this portion of the premarital agreement is irrelevant to the issue on appeal because this appeal simply does not concern the equitable distribution provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3. This appeal concerns mother\u2019s attempt to satisfy father's unpaid child support obligation, and the premarital agreement plainly states, \"Nothing in this agreement shall be construed as relieving either party of an obligation to support their minor chil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>dren.\u201d Furthermore, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Kelley v. Kelley, </em>248 Va. 295, 298, 449 S.E.2d 55, 56 (1994), \"[P]arents cannot contract away their children's rights to support nor can a court be precluded by agreement from exercising its power to decree child support.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-9\">. These principles also apply, of course, in cases where a father acts as a conduit for the payments of support to the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\">. For the purposes of ERISA, the United States Supreme Court has noted that \"to 'assign' is \u2018[t]o transfer; as to assign property, or some interest therein,\u2019 Black's Law Dictionary 152 (4th rev. ed.1968), and to 'alienate' is '[t]o convey; to transfer the title to property, <em>id. </em>at 96.' \u201d <em>Kennedy v. Plan Adm\u2019r for DuPont Sav. &amp; Inv. Plan, </em>555 U.S. 285, 292, 129 S.Ct. 865, 870, 172 L.Ed.2d 662 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
