Epps, pled guilty to possession of a controlled drug in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. The trial court accepted Epps\u2019s plea and found him guilty as charged. Before sentencing, Epps filed a motion requesting the trial court to vacate its finding of guilt and continue the case generally, or alternatively, to suspend imposition of sentence pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-308 with an implied final disposition that would avoid a conviction. At Epps\u2019s sentencing hearing, after listening to argument by Epps\u2019s counsel, the trial court denied Epps\u2019s motion, stating that it did not have the authority to do what Epps was requesting. On appeal, Epps assigns error to the trial court\u2019s determination that it did not have the authority to vacate its finding of guilt or suspend imposition of sentence. For the reasons expressed below, we disagree with Epps\u2019s arguments and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">On April 28, 2010, the trial court entered an order accepting Epps\u2019s guilty plea and finding Epps guilty of possessing a controlled drug in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On July 22, 2010, Epps filed a \u201cMemorandum in Aid of Sentencing,\u201d in which he requested the trial court \u201cto vacate the finding of guilt and continue the case generally ..., or in the alternative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>to suspend imposition of sentence.\u201d Between the time he pled guilty and the time of his sentencing hearing on July 23, 2010, Epps had been convicted of possession of marijuana. As Epps acknowledged, this rendered him ineligible for a deferred disposition under Code \u00a7 18.2-251.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Epps argued that \u201ca trial court has the ability to fashion a disposition in a criminal case that offers a defendant the opportunity <em>to avoid a </em>conviction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Epps pointed to Code \u00a7 19.2-303 and case law to support his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Epps\u2019s counsel elaborated upon his request for an ultimate acquittal if Epps complied with the court\u2019s conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">I think what suspended imposition means is that the Court doesn\u2019t sentence. It\u2019s perhaps set for a future review date and it imposes conditions which can include probation, can include community service, can include all the other things that go along with probation, <em>but the intent of the Court is to allow a person, </em>if they [sic] have complied fully with that, <em>to walk away and rejoin society, not as a convicted felon, </em>but as a normal, productive citizen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">In responding to Epps\u2019s argument, the trial court stated: \u201cI disagree with your assessment of the law. I don\u2019t think I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>have the authority to do what you\u2019re asking me to do....\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Epps now appeals from this ruling of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Epps argues that the trial court\u2019s authority under Code \u00a7 19.2-303 to suspend imposition of sentence includes the authority to fashion a disposition that ultimately offers a criminal defendant the opportunity to avoid a final conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>In other words, Epps contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-308 authorizes a trial court to vacate a previous conviction if a defendant complies with conditions that may be imposed upon him for the suspension of the imposition of his sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">This Court has recently recognized that there exists no \u201ccommon law power of a Virginia court to acquit a criminal defendant whose guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 435, 447, 710 S.E.2d 518, 524 (2011). In <em>Taylor, </em>the appellant argued that \u201cthe trial court erred by not using its \u2018inherent discretion and authority\u2019 to acquit her of grand larceny and substitute in its place a lesser crime of petit larceny.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 710 S.E.2d at 519. The appellant in <em>Taylor </em>\u201cconceded ... there was \u2018no legal basis\u2019 for [her] motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 710 S.E.2d at 519. Accordingly, <em>Taylor </em>addressed the inherent discretion and authority of a trial court to acquit a defendant. Regarding the inherent authority of a trial court, <em>Taylor </em>held that \u201ca Virginia court cannot refuse to convict a guilty defendant merely because it questions the category of offense assigned by the legislature, considers the range of statutory punishment too harsh, or believes certain guilty offenders undeserving of a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442, 710 S.E.2d at 521. If a trial court has no inherent authority to refuse to convict a guilty defendant based on such subjective, legally extraneous reasons, certainly a trial court cannot vacate a previously entered conviction for such reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Here, however, Epps distinguishes <em>Taylor </em>by pointing out that he has based his argument on a specific statute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>relevant case law. Essentially, Epps maintains that Code \u00a7 19.2-303 grants a trial court the authority to do what <em>Taylor </em>held a trial court does not have the inherent authority to do, viz., permit a guilty defendant to escape a conviction. Thus, the question before us is slightly different from that presented in <em>Taylor. </em>The question confronting us is whether Code \u00a7 19.2-303 authorizes a trial court to vacate a previous conviction if a defendant complies with conditions that may be imposed upon him for the suspension of the imposition of his sentence. This is a question of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u201c \u2018Statutory construction is a question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lynchburg Div. of Soc. Servs, v. Cook, </em>276 Va. 465, 480, 666 S.E.2d 361, 368 (2008) (quoting <em>Parker v. Warren, </em>273 Va. 20, 23, 639 S.E.2d 179, 181 (2007)). \u201c \u2018[C]ourts apply the plain language of a statute unless the terms are ambiguous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Boynton v. Kilgore, </em>271 Va. 220, 227, 623 S.E.2d 922, 926 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-303 provides: \u201cAfter conviction, whether with or without jury, the court may suspend imposition of sentence or suspend the sentence in whole or part and in addition may place the defendant on probation under such conditions as the court shall determine....\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-306(C) further provides: \u201cIf the court, after hearing, finds good cause to believe that the defendant has violated the terms of suspension, then: (i) if the court originally suspended the imposition of sentence, the court shall revoke the suspension, and the court may pronounce whatever sentence might have been originally imposed .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">This language is unambiguous. It plainly grants a trial court the discretion to suspend imposition of sentence after a defendant has been convicted of a crime and, if the defendant fails to comply with any conditions placed upon him, to impose a lawful sentence. However, the language of these statutes contains no authorization whatsoever for a trial court to vacate a prior conviction upon a defendant\u2019s compliance with condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>tions placed upon him for the suspension of the imposition of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Certainly, if a trial court suspends imposition of sentence, \u201cwhen the accused has complied with conditions specified, he has a right to rely upon them, and the suspension will stand. The action of the court should not, under any circumstances, be arbitrary.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Cunningham, </em>205 Va. 349, 354, 136 S.E.2d 840, 844 (1964). A defendant who complies with the conditions of a suspended imposition of sentence is entitled to avoid receiving and serving a sentence for his crime, depending on the provisions of the trial court\u2019s suspension order. <em>Cf. Dyke v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 478, 483, 69 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1952) (noting that where the trial court\u2019s order had suspended the execution of the defendant\u2019s sentence, had the defendant kept the condition of his suspension, the trial court \u201ccould not ... have revoked the suspension and required the defendant to serve the sentence\u201d). Indeed, we see no reason why the general rule for suspension of execution of sentence should not apply to suspension of imposition of sentence as well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">\u201cWhere a sentence in a criminal case is suspended upon certain valid conditions expressed in the sentence imposed, the prisoner has a right to rely upon such conditions, and so long as he complies therewith the suspension should stand. In such a case he carries the keys to his freedom in his willingness to comply with the court\u2019s sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-6\"><em>Griffin, </em>205 Va. at 354, 136 S.E.2d at 844 (quoting <em>State v. Robinson, </em>248 N.C. 282, 103 S.E.2d 376, 378-79 (1958)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">However, this does <em>not </em>mean that a defendant who complies with the conditions of a suspended imposition of sentence is entitled to have his conviction vacated. Avoiding sentencing and punishment is not the same as avoiding adjudication of guilt and a record of conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plain language of Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u00a7 19.2-303 authorizes the former, but does not authorize the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Our observation regarding the plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 is reinforced by the fact that the legislature has already provided carefully circumscribed means to allow certain defendants charged with specific offenses to avoid conviction. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-57.3 (domestic assault and battery), 18.2-251 (illegal drug possession), 19.2-303.2 (misdemeanor property offenses). Under these statutes, a trial court may defer disposition for defendants who meet certain criteria (e.g., not repeat offenders). If the defendants comply with the terms and conditions the trial court imposes, they will not be convicted. Had the legislature intended, in enacting Code \u00a7 19.2-303, to grant a trial court broad authority to fashion a disposition in <em>any </em>criminal case that offers a defendant the opportunity to avoid a final conviction, these other statutes would be superfluous. However, we interpret statutory language, whenever possible, to avoid rendering other statutory language superfluous. <em>Cook v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 111, 114, 597 S.E.2d 84, 86 (2004) (\u201cWords in a statute should be interpreted, if possible, to avoid rendering words superfluous.\u201d); <em>Zhou v. Zhou, </em>38 Va.App. 126, 136, 562 S.E.2d 336, 340 (2002) (noting that basic canons of statutory construction proscribe interpreting statutory language in a way that renders other statutory language superfluous).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The intent of the legislature in enacting statutes such as Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-57.3, 18.2-251, and 19.2-303.2 was to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>certain defendants to avoid a criminal conviction, but <em>only </em>under certain conditions. \u201c \u2018[T]he primary objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Amerson, </em>281 Va. 414, 418-19, 706 S.E.2d 879, 882 (2011) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Conger v. Barrett, </em>280 Va. 627, 630, 702 S.E.2d 117, 118 (2010)); <em>see also B.P. v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 735, 739, 568 S.E.2d 412, 413 (2002) (\u201cWe will not place a construction upon a statute which leads to an absurd result or one plainly contrary to the expressed intent of the General Assembly.... \u201d). The legislative intent expressed in these statutes is not consistent with the proposition that Code \u00a7 19.2-303 gives a trial court unfettered authority to permit any defendant to avoid a conviction under any circumstances the trial court deems appropriate. Rather, these statutes express a clear intent to permit certain defendants to avoid conviction only in limited circumstances. Thus, the legislative intent expressed in other statutes corroborates our interpretation of the plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-303. Code \u00a7 19.2-303 authorizes a trial court to suspend imposition or execution of sentence, but it simply does not authorize a trial court \u201cto fashion a disposition in a criminal case that offers a defendant the opportunity to avoid a final conviction,\u201d as Epps argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Despite the plain language of Code \u00a7 19.2-303, Epps maintains that <em>Hernandez v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 222, 707 S.E.2d 273 (2011), supports his position. In <em>Hernandez, </em>the Supreme Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">during the interval between the conclusion of the evidence and the entry of a written order adjudicating the defendant guilty, the circuit court ha[s] the inherent power, in the exercise of its discretion, to take the matter under advisement and to continue the case for future disposition, subject to such lawful conditions as the court might prescribe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVv\"><em>Id. </em>at 226, 707 S.E.2d at 275. In other words, \u201cUntil the court enters a written order finding the defendant guilty of a crime, the court has the inherent authority to take the matter under advisement or to continue the case for disposition at a later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is because \u201c \u2018the act of rendering judgment is within the inherent power of the court and ... the very essence of adjudication and entry of judgment by a judge involves discretionary power of the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225, 707 S.E.2d at 274 (quoting <em>Moreau v. Fuller, </em>276 Va. 127, 139, 661 S.E.2d 841, 847-48 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Here, however, the trial court had already rendered its judgment, pursuant to Epps\u2019s voluntary guilty plea, that Epps was guilty of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-250. The trial court had exercised its inherent adjudicatory power and, pursuant to Epps\u2019s guilty plea, had entered a written order finding him guilty of possessing a controlled drug. Thus, contrary to Epps\u2019s contention, the holding of <em>Hernandez </em>is not dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Moreover, the Supreme Court in <em>Hernandez </em>expressly noted that neither <em>Moreau </em>nor <em>Hernandez </em>addressed \u201cthe question whether a court may defer judgment and continue a case with a promise of a particular disposition at a later date.\u201d <em>Hernandez, </em>281 Va. at 225, 707 S.E.2d at 274. Here, Epps is not arguing that the trial court erred by failing to recognize that it had authority to continue a case while it contemplated what judgment to enter. Rather, Epps\u2019s position is that the trial court erred by failing to conclude that <em>after </em>adjudicating a defendant guilty, it could later, based solely on the defendant\u2019s compliance with the conditions of suspension, vacate that judgment and adjudicate the defendant not guilty.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>In addition, Epps also points to <em>Holden v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 403, 494 S.E.2d 892 (1998), and <em>Fuller v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 327, 53 S.E.2d 26 (1949), to support his position. However, these cases do not help Epps\u2019s argument. <em>Holden </em>briefly acknowledges the general proposition that Code \u00a7 19.2-303 authorizes suspension of imposition of sentence, 26 Va.App. at 407, 494 S.E.2d at 894, but it does not address the issue of whether that section authorizes a trial court to vacate a previous finding of guilt upon a defendant\u2019s compliance with the terms and conditions of the suspension of the imposition of his sentence. Moreover, although <em>Fuller </em>similarly acknowledges the authority of a trial court to suspend imposition of a defendant\u2019s sentence, <em>Fuller </em>states that the remedy \u201coffered by a suspension of imposition of sentence\u201d is \u201cescape from punishment.\u201d 189 Va. at 332, 53 S.E.2d at 28 (emphasis added). This stands in contrast to the remedy of \u201ca possible reversal of the judgment on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 332-33, 53 S.E.2d at 28. <em>Fuller </em>simply cannot be read to authorize a trial court to vacate a previous judgment of conviction after it \u201chas adjudged the defendant \u2018guilty\u2019 and has suspended [the imposition of the defendant\u2019s sentence].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, none of the other case law that Epps cites supports such a proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">At common law, \u201c[t]here simply was no such thing as a judicial pardon.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>58 Va.App. at 445, 710 S.E.2d at 523. Under Epps\u2019s reading of Code \u00a7 19.2-303, however, that statute grants a trial court what is essentially the authority to pardon a guilty defendant. We disagree. The Supreme Court has expressly held that the statutory predecessor of Code \u00a7 19.2-303 does not \u201cconstitute an invasion of the pardoning power of the governor\u201d because, \u201c[suspending execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>tion of a sentence] is not a pardon, excuse, immunity, or relief, from the punishment, but a mere suspension, or postponement, of its execution.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Commonwealth, </em>131 Va. 802, 809, 109 S.E. 460, 462 (1921). If suspending the imposition or execution of sentence is not a pardon from punishment, certainly it cannot be used as a means to gain pardon from a conviction. Contrary to Epps\u2019s contention, Code \u00a7 19.2-303 does not authorize a trial court that has previously entered an order of conviction based upon the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to vacate that conviction solely as an act of judicial clemency.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">We recognize that had Epps argued merely that the trial court should have suspended the imposition of his sentence as a means for him to escape the potential <em>punishment </em>for his crime, this case would present a different issue for our review. However, Epps expressly asked the trial court for \u201cthe opportunity to avoid a <em>conviction </em>\u201d (emphasis added), not simply for the opportunity to avoid punishment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We hold that, under these circumstances, the trial court did not err <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>when it stated that it did not have the authority to do what Epps was requesting.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">. Epps was originally charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248. In return for his plea of guilty, the Commonwealth reduced the charge to simple possession of cocaine, with no agreement as to the appropriate sentence. Epps never moved to withdraw his guilty plea, nor does he suggest what effect such a motion might have had upon his plea agreement with the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\">. The Attorney General did not argue on brief that Epps waived any right to appeal by pleading guilty. <em>See Peyton v. King, </em>210 Va. 194, 196-97, 169 S.E.2d 569, 571 (1969) (\"Where a conviction is rendered upon [a voluntary and intelligent] plea [of guilty] and the punishment fixed by law is in fact imposed in a proceeding free of jurisdictional defect, there is nothing to appeal.\u201d). At oral argument, the Attorney General specifically declined to advance this argument. Therefore, we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b121-9\">. Code \u00a7 18.2-251 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">Whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any offense under this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating to narcotic drugs, marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids, or stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic drugs, or has not previously had a proceeding against him for violation of such an offense dismissed as provided in this section, pleads guilty to or enters a plea of not guilty to possession of a controlled substance under \u00a7 18.2-250 or to possession of marijuana under \u00a7 18.2-250.1, or to possession of synthetic cannabinoids under subsection B of \u00a7 18.2-248.1:1, the court, upon such plea if the facts found by the court would justify a finding of guilt, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon terms and conditions.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b121-11\">. Epps's counsel also stated a little later: \"Ultimately there\u2019s also case law that says if you comply, the case can be discharged. That\u2019s the word, discharged, with certain conditions.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\">. We presume that the trial court was aware of the law. <em>Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 318, 326, 477 S.E.2d 7, 10 (1996). Thus, we presume that the trial court was aware of the jurisdictional limitations on its authority imposed by Rule 1:1, which provides: \"All final judgments, orders, and decrees, irrespective of terms of court, shall remain under the control of the trial court and subject to be modified, vacated, or suspended for twenty-one days after the date of entry, and no longer.\u201d <em>See City of Suffolk v. Lummis Gin Co., </em>278 Va. 270, 276, 683 S.E.2d 549, 552 (2009) (\" 'Once a final judgment has been entered and the twenty-one day time period of Rule 1:1 has expired, the trial court is thereafter without jurisdiction in the case.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Super Fresh Food Mkts. v. Ruffin, </em>263 Va. 555, 563, 561 S.E.2d 734, 739 (2002))). Furthermore, we also presume that the trial court was aware of the fact that a post-conviction order suspending the imposition of sentence is a final order. <em>See Fuller v. Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 327, 332, 53 S.E.2d 26, 28 (1949) (\"After the trial court has adjudged the defendant 'guilty' and has suspended either 'the imposition or the execution of sentence, or commitment\u2019 of the defendant, and has fixed the terms of his probation, it has made a complete disposition of the case within the purview of the statute. Its action is then final and subject to review [on appeal].\" (quoting a former version of what is now Code \u00a7 19.2-303)). While we focus our analysis in this opinion on Epps\u2019s arguments regarding the meaning of Code \u00a7 19.2-303, we do note that the trial court's comment concerning its authority to grant Epps\u2019s request is entirely consistent with the dictates of Rule 1:1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\">. In addition to arguing that the trial court erred in determining that it did not have the authority to suspend imposition of sentence, Epps also maintains that the trial court erred in determining that it did not have the authority to vacate its finding of guilt and continue the case generally. However, Epps's argument in his brief does not address this latter issue. He points to no authority, statutory or inherent, on this point. We find Epps\u2019s failure to explain, develop, or support this argument significant. Therefore, we do not address it. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(e) (requiring the argument in an appellant\u2019s opening brief to contain \"principles of law and authorities\u201d); <em>see also Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 2, 20, 698 S.E.2d 249, 258 (2010) (\"Because appellant provides no legal argument or authority in his brief to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>support his argument, and we find this omission significant, appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred ... is waived under Rule 5A:20(e).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Furthermore, we note that Epps entered a guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement with the Commonwealth and that he neither moved to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-296 nor offered any reason based on the merits of the case why the trial court should, after accepting his plea of guilty, have vacated that finding of guilt. <em>See Holden v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 403, 407, 494 S.E.2d 892, 894 (1998) (\"Generally, absent an express statutory grant, trial courts may not dismiss criminal charges on grounds other than the legal or factual merits.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">. This is not a merely theoretical distinction. There are important practical ramifications for a defendant who is convicted of a crime, even though he may not be sentenced or punished for that crime. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>example, a convicted felon or perjurer may be impeached with his prior conviction, Code \u00a7 19.2-269; a convicted felon may not knowingly and intentionally possess or transport a firearm, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2; a convicted felon is disqualified from voting, Code \u00a7 24.2-101; a person convicted of certain offenses is ineligible for a deferred disposition in certain subsequent criminal prosecutions, <em>e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-57.3 (domestic assault and battery), 18.2-251 (illegal drug possession), 19.2-303.2 (misdemeanor property offenses); and an individual with one or more previous convictions may be subject to enhanced penalties for subsequent crimes for which he is convicted, <em>e.g., </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-57.2 (domestic assault and battery), 18.2-248(C) (distributing or possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">. To the extent Epps is arguing that the trial court can simply vacate its order of conviction and then do nothing further to adjudicate the case, we note that a trial court's permanent refusal to adjudicate a case properly brought before it would directly contradict the proper role of the judiciary and would undermine the appropriate roles of the other branches of government. <em>See Ex parte United States, </em>242 U.S. 27, 42, 37 S.Ct. 72, 74, 61 L.Ed. 129, 141 (1916) (\"[T]he possession by the judicial department of power to permanently refuse to enforce a law would result in the destruction of the conceded powers of the other departments and hence leave no law to be enforced.\"). \"Where [a] defendant has been duly indicted for an offense found to be within the statute, and the proper authorities seek to proceed with the prosecution, the court cannot refuse to try the case in the constitutional method because it desires to let the defendant go free.\u201d <em>Sorrells v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><em>States, </em>287 U.S. 435, 450, 53 S.Ct. 210, 215-16, 77 L.Ed. 413, 421 (1932); <em>see also Taylor, </em>58 Va.App. at 442, 710 S.E.2d at 521 (\"[A] Virginia court cannot refuse to convict a guilty defendant merely because it questions the category of offense assigned by the legislature, considers the range of statutory punishment too harsh, or <em>believes certain guilty offenders undeserving of a criminal conviction.\" </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b130-6\">. Epps also argued, \"Ultimately there\u2019s also case law that says if you comply, the case can be discharged. That\u2019s the word, discharged, with certain conditions.\u201d It is true that the term \"discharge\u201d appears in certain case law discussing what may happen when a defendant complies with the terms and conditions of the suspension of the imposition of his sentence. <em>See Grant v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 680, 686, 292 S.E.2d 348, 351 (1982); <em>cf. Dyke v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 478, 483-84, 69 S.E.2d 483, 486 (1952) (using \"discharge\u201d in the context of a defendant's compliance with the conditions of a suspended <em>execution </em>of sentence). A defendant who complies with the terms and conditions of the suspension of the imposition of his sentence may seek \"an order of complete discharge\u201d from the trial court, clarifying that he is no longer \"subject to the sentencing authority of the [trial] court.\u201d <em>Grant, </em>223 Va. at 686, 292 S.E.2d at 351; <em>cf. Reinemer v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 462, 464, 431 S.E.2d 68, 70 (1993) (stating that a trial court\u2019s order discharging a defendant from probation \"discharged him from the [trial] court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d). However, such \"discharge\" from the trial court\u2019s sentencing authority in no way entails the vacating of a prior order of conviction. A defendant who complies with terms and conditions placed upon him for the suspension of his sentence is entitled to a final declaration that he is no longer subject to the possibility of punishment for his crime, but he is <em>not </em>entitled to have the trial court vacate its prior adjudication of guilt and order of conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
