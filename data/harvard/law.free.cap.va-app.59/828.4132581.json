Burke appeals from a decision of the Circuit Court of Roanoke County. She argues the circuit court erred in (1) concluding that it had no jurisdiction in policy matters of the state and, therefore, lacked the authority to overrule the interpretation of state policy of the Department of Human Resource Management; (2) holding that the failure of the Agency<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to follow its own grievance procedure did not violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>Code \u00a7 2.2-3000; (3) failing to redress alleged violations of the Grievance Procedure Manual, particularly \u00a7 7.2 of the Manual; and finally (4) holding that the Agency\u2019s failure to request an administrative hearing ended the case following the hearing officer\u2019s decision on February 7, 2011. We find no error and affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Debra S. Burke was employed as an Administrative and Office Specialist II by Catawba Hospital, a state hospital. She was required, among other duties, to \u201c[p]rovide clerical support to Nursing units; [and] maintain timely, accurate record keeping and filing of HIM information.\u201d One of her specific responsibilities was to listen to a doctor\u2019s dictated notes and type the recommendations within three workdays of the doctor\u2019s visit. The typed notes were used by a Licensed Independent Practitioner to determine a patient\u2019s medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">A doctor was present at the hospital on August 26, 2010, and he dictated his recommendations for seven patients. None of the recommendations were transcribed within three days, and most were not transcribed for more than two weeks. As a result of this delay, at least one patient did not receive pain medication when needed and likely suffered unnecessary pain as a consequence. Burke\u2019s explanation was that the tapes were lost when her office moved from one floor to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">The hospital found that Burke had infringed Departmental Instruction (\u201cDI\u201d) 201, the policy governing the \u201cAbuse and Neglect of Individuals Receiving Services in Department Facilities.\u201d Burke was issued a \u201cGroup III\u201d Written Notice and terminated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> DI 201 defines client abuse as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>any act or failure to act by an employee or other person responsible for the care of an individual in a Department facility that was performed or was failed to be performed knowingly, recklessly or intentionally, and that caused or might have caused physical or psychological harm, injury or death to a person receiving care or treatment for mental illness, mental retardation or substance abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">Burke filed a grievance and obtained a hearing. Hearing Officer Carl Wilson Schmidt concluded that the hospital misread DI 201. In his view, the policy applied to persons \u201cresponsible for the care ... of patients.\u201d Because Burke\u2019s responsibilities were clerical in nature, the hearing officer reasoned she did not violate the policy. The hearing officer reduced the disciplinary action to a Group II offense, with a ten-workday suspension, and reinstated Burke.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services, the hospital\u2019s parent agency (\u201cthe Agency\u201d), sought review on two fronts. First, it unsuccessfully petitioned the hearing officer for reconsideration. On February 7, 2011, the hearing officer affirmed his earlier decision. Second, the Agency petitioned the Department of Human Resource Management (\u201cDHRM\u201d) for a review of the hearing officer\u2019s interpretation of DI 201. In its petition for review, the Agency\u2019s principal argument was that the offense could be elevated to a more serious offense under DHRM Policy No. 1.60. Under Policy No. 1.60, \u201can offense typically associated with one offense category may be elevated to a higher level offense.\u201d On March 9, 2011, DHRM issued its policy ruling, stating that it did not \u201cconcur with the hearing officer\u2019s determination regarding the applicability of\u2019 DI 201. It concluded that DI 201 applied to clerical personnel such as Burke. DHRM remanded this decision to the hearing officer \u201cin light of the interpretation by this Agency of DI 201.\u201d On remand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>in light of the DHRM\u2019s definitive interpretation of DI 201, the hearing officer on March 14, 2011, reversed his previous decision and upheld the Agency\u2019s disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Burke then appealed to the circuit court. The circuit court held that it was without jurisdiction to review \u201cthe matters of policy presented in this appeal.\u201d The court also found no violation of Burke\u2019s right to due process of law. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The authority of a court to review state employee grievances is limited. \u201cThe only grounds of appeal of the hearing officer\u2019s decision is \u2018that the determination is contradictory to law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of State Police v. Barton, </em>39 Va.App. 439, 445, 573 S.E.2d 319, 322 (2002) (quoting former Code \u00a7 2.1-116.07:1(B), currently codified at Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B)). We review questions of law, including questions of statutory construction, <em>de novo. Louis Latour, Inc. v. Va. Alcoholic Bev. Contr. Bd., </em>49 Va.App. 758, 766, 645 S.E.2d 318, 322 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">I. THE CIRCUIT COURT CORRECTLY DECLINED TO REVIEW DHRM\u2019S POLICY INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">Burke first assigns error to the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that it had no jurisdiction in policy matters and, therefore, lacked the authority to overrule the decision of the DHRM. We find no error. As we explained in <em>Barton, </em>the General Assembly has adopted a \u201ctripartite review procedure.\u201d 39 Va.App. at 445, 573 S.E.2d at 322. Under this procedure, the hearing officer acts as factfinder, DHRM determines compliance with state policy, and courts review whether the grievance determination is contrary to law. <em>Id. </em>This review procedure allows the executive branch latitude to manage and discipline executive branch employees and to develop its own policy and procedures, subject to limited legal constraints. The standard of review for courts is \u201cvery nar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>row\u201d because it \u201cfocuses solely on the question whether the hearing officer\u2019s decision is contradictory to any applicable law.\u201d <em>Va. Polytechnic Inst. &amp; State Univ. v. Quesenberry, </em>277 Va. 420, 429, 674 S.E.2d 854, 858 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">The interpretation of DI 201 clearly is a matter of policy rather than a question of law. DI 201 is a component part of \u201cinstructions\u201d that were issued by the Commissioner of the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services in order to \u201cestablish policies, procedures and responsibilities for reporting, responding to, and investigating allegations of abuse and neglect of individuals receiving services in Department facilities.\u201d It is not a regulation found in the Virginia Administrative Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">By express statutory command, \u201can appeal from a hearing officer\u2019s interpretation of policy goes to the director of the [DHRM], not the circuit court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Needham, </em>55 Va.App. 316, 327-28, 685 S.E.2d 857, 863 (2009) (citing Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(A)). <em>See also Quesenberry, </em>277 Va. at 428-29, 674 S.E.2d at 858. Therefore, under the plain language of the statute and settled precedent, the circuit court correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to review DHRM\u2019s policy interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">II. AGENCY COMPLIANCE WITH ITS OWN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">In her next two assignments of error, Burke contends that the Agency\u2019s failure to follow its own procedures compels reversal. First, she presses a broad interpretation of Code \u00a7 2.2-3000, noting that under this statute a hearing must be \u201cfair.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In her view, the failure of the Agency to follow its own grievance procedures renders the decision below \u201cunfair.\u201d Second, she argues that the court erred in failing to find a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>violation of \u00a7 7.2 of the Grievance Procedure Manual. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">First, the broad statement of policy found in Code \u00a7 2.2-3000, concerning \u201cfair\u201d hearings, does not constitute an invitation for reviewing courts to police compliance with the procedures found in the Grievance Procedure Manual. Although the Code directs the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution to \u201cdevelop a grievance procedure,\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-3003(A), and provides that \u201call nonprobationary state employees shall be covered by the grievance procedure established pursuant to this chapter and any regulations adopted pursuant thereto,\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-3001(A), the statutory scheme specifically addresses how procedural defects are to be addressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIV\">[A] failure of the employee or the agency to comply with a substantial procedural requirement of the grievance procedure without just cause may result in a decision against the noncomplying party on any qualified issue.... The Director of the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution shall render all decisions related to procedural compliance, and such decisions shall contain the reasons for such decision and shall be final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Code \u00a7 2.2-3003(G). <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-1001(5) (providing that the Director of the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution has the power and duty to \u201c[r]ender final decisions, containing the reasons for such decision, on all matters related to procedural compliance with the grievance procedure\u201d). Plainly, the courts are not the proper forum to hear appellant\u2019s challenge to the procedures employed by the Agency in handling her grievance. The General Assembly has entrusted a separate component of the executive branch, the Director of the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution, with resolving disputes of procedure that arise at grievance hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Furthermore, judicial review, as noted above, is limited to ensuring that the administrative decision was not \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B). The premise of Burke\u2019s argument is that the Grievance Procedure Manual is \u201claw.\u201d As the Supreme Court explained, the appealing party must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>\u201cidentify [a] constitutional provision, statute, regulation or judicial decision which the [hearing officer\u2019s] decision contradicted.\u201d <em>Quesenberry, </em>277 Va. at 429, 674 S.E.2d at 858 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The grievance manual is none of these. It is simply a manual of procedure. Failure to abide by an agency\u2019s own policies and procedures does not render that decision \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">Finally, Burke contends that the Grievance Procedure Manual constitutes the \u201claw of this case\u201d because the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution stated in a letter dated December 3, 2010 that the hearing would be \u201cgoverned by \u00a7 5.1-5.9 of the <em>Grievance Procedure Manual </em>and the <em>Rules for Conducting Grievance Hearings </em>(8/30/2004).\u201d This claim misapprehends the concept of the law of the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-5\">\u201cUnder [the] law of the case doctrine, a legal decision made at one [stage] of the litigation, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal when the opportunity to do so existed, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the parties are deemed to have waived the right to challenge that decision at a later time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-6\"><em>Kondaurov v. Kerdasha, </em>271 Va. 646, 658, 629 S.E.2d 181, 188 (2006) (quoting <em>Virginia Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co.-Conn., </em>108 F.Supp.2d 549, 609 (W.D.Va.2000)). That concept is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">III. IMPACT OF THE AGENCY\u2019S FAILURE TO REQUEST AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OF THE FEBRUARY 7, 2011, HEARING OFFICER\u2019S OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">In her final assignment of error, Burke asserts that the Agency\u2019s failure to seek a hearing following the hearing officer\u2019s decision of February 7, 2011, means that this decision should stand. This assignment of error is procedurally defective on two grounds. First, in her brief, Burke cites to no \u201claw\u201d that was violated. Therefore, under the review procedure that applies to judicial review of grievance hearings, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>has failed to \u201cidentify [a] constitutional provision, statute, regulation or judicial decision which the [hearing officer\u2019s] decision contradicts.\u201d <em>Quesenberry, </em>277 Va. at 429, 674 S.E.2d at 858 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This failure is fatal to this assignment of error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Second, it is well established that a litigant on appeal has the burden of showing that reversible error was committed. <em>See Lutes v. Alexander, </em>14 Va.App. 1075, 1077, 421 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1992). Under Rule 5A:20(e), a brief must supply, \u201c[w]ith respect to each assignment of error, the standard of review and the argument\u2014including principles of law and the authorities....\u201d In an adversarial system of justice, it is not the role of a court to \u201csearch the record for errors in order to interpret the appellant\u2019s contention and correct deficiencies in a brief.\u201d <em>Buchanan v. Buchanan, </em>14 Va.App. 53, 56, 415 S.E.2d 237, 239 (1992). Nor is it this Court\u2019s \u201cfunction to comb through the record ... in order to ferret-out for ourselves the validity of [appellant\u2019s] claims.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Bass, </em>6 Va.App. 38, 56 n. 7, 366 S.E.2d 615, 625 n. 7 (1988) <em>(en </em>banc). Finding that the failure to comply with Rule 5A:20(e) is significant, we will not consider this assignment of error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-15\">.

Following its decision, DHRM remanded the matter to the hearing officer, who then implemented the DHRM decision in his reconsideration decision dated March 14, 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
