The VEC denied the claim and the circuit court, upon Smith\u2019s appeal, affirmed the denial. Reviewing the facts under a deferential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>standard and the law <em>de novo, </em>we affirm the circuit court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Like the circuit court, we must \u201cconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding by the Commission.\u201d <em>Va. Emp\u2019t Comm\u2019n v. Trent, </em>55 Va.App. 560, 565, 687 S.E.2d 99, 101 (2010) (citation omitted); <em>see also Va. Emp\u2019t Comm\u2019n v. Fitzgerald, </em>19 Va.App. 491, 493, 452 S.E.2d 692, 693 (1995) (applying principle to \u201cjudicial review of a commission decision pursuant to Code \u00a7 60.2-625(A)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">So viewed, the evidence before the VEC showed Smith worked for Swift Transportation as a dispatch assistant. She received three days of training when she began the job. During the course of her employment, she consistently made routing mistakes that caused truckers to be overpaid for their routes. She received three written (along with various verbal) warnings regarding the quality of her work. At the VEC hearing, Smith claimed she asked for additional training, which she said her supervisor failed to provide. The employer\u2019s representative, however, testified Smith was given \u201cformal counseling\u201d to identify her mistakes and to show her \u201chow to correct\u201d them. App. at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">After a little more than a year on the job, Smith voluntarily quit because she thought she would eventually be fired due to her chronic mistakes. She also wanted to \u201cget in college\u201d so she could find \u201canother way of having some kind of income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. After leaving work, Smith filed for unemployment benefits with the VEC. An appeals examiner denied the claim and the VEC affirmed the denial. \u201cThe record shows,\u201d the VEC held, \u201cthat the claimant\u2019s primary reason for leaving was that she anticipated discharge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Citing its own precedent, the VEC concluded: \u201cFor the last fifty years the Commission has consistently held that \u2018anticipation of being discharged\u2019 is not good cause for leaving a job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). As early as the 1950s, the VEC explained its position this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Cases where an individual leaves his work in anticipation of being discharged at some future date are not new to this Commission. In such cases the holdings have established the principle that an anticipated discharge is not a discharge in fact, and if the claimant elects to leave before the discharge actually occurs he does so voluntarily. The threat of discharge is sometimes used to warn or exhort an employee, but the threat is not tantamount to actual discharge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aue\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hutchinson v. Hill Refrigeration Corp., </em>VEC No. 3251-C (July 10, 1958)). Smith appealed the VEC\u2019s decision to the circuit court and, upon meeting with no success there, now appeals to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In all \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d involving VEC appeals, \u201cthe findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be confined to questions of law.\u201d Code \u00a7 60.2-625(A). A decision by the VEC that conjoins both factual and legal issues presents a \u201cmixed question\u201d on review. <em>Snyder v. Va. Emp\u2019t Comm\u2019n, </em>23 Va.App. 484, 491, 477 S.E.2d 785, 788 (1996). In such cases, we segregate (to the extent we can) the law from the facts\u2014 reviewing the law <em>de novo </em>and the facts with the deference required by Code \u00a7 60.2-625(A). We do so, however, mindful of the overarching premise that \u201ca reviewing court cannot substitute its own judgment for the agency\u2019s on matters committed by statute to the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Trent, </em>55 Va.App. at 568, 687 S.E.2d at 103 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">On this factual record, the VEC concluded Smith\u2019s \u201cprimary reason for leaving was that she anticipated discharge.\u201d App. at 26. The VEC found her reason for quitting was not\u2014as Smith argued\u2014that her frustration over the alleged lack of training rendered the workplace so intolerable that she could no longer bear to stay. \u201cEven if the Commission were to treat the claimant\u2019s frustration over a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>additional training rather than the anticipation of discharge as the claimant\u2019s reason for leaving,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 27, the VEC held in the alternative, this frustration did not constitute good cause for quitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">We need not address the VEC\u2019s alternative good-cause holding because we agree that, with respect to Smith\u2019s primary reason for quitting her job, the VEC\u2019s determination rested squarely on her own testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this factual issue, our appellate review begins and ends there. We cannot review \u201cthe administrative record <em>de novo </em>\u201d and \u201creweigh the possible inferences that could be drawn from it.\u201d <em>Trent, </em>55 Va.App. at 567, 687 S.E.2d at 103 (citation omitted). \u201cInstead, a court can overturn VEC factfinding \u2018only if, in considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567-68, 687 S.E.2d at 103 (emphasis in original and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">To constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d for quitting, the employee must prove the employer created workplace conditions so intolerable that the employee \u201chad no reasonable alternative except to quit her job.\u201d <em>Umbarger v. Va. Emp\u2019t Comm\u2019n, 12 </em>Va.App. 431, 436, 404 S.E.2d 380, 383 (1991). Applying its longstanding precedent, the VEC held \u201cgood cause\u201d under Code \u00a7 60.2-618(1) cannot be established by an employee who quits her job merely because she believes she will eventually be fired. We agree. In such cases, the employee\u2014not the employer\u2014causes the wage loss. Neither the VEC nor the courts should be asked to speculate when, if ever, the employee\u2019s prediction might have come to pass or whether the hypothesized firing might have implicated a disqualification for misconduct under Code \u00a7 60.2-618(2)(b). <em>See, e.g., Va.
