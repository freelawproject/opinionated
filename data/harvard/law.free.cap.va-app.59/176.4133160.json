Pilati. Her husband, Bryan P. Pilati, appeals the support order claiming the trial court did not provide sufficient \u201cwritten findings and conclusions\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F). We agree and remand for purposes of complying with this statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">During the parties\u2019 divorce proceeding, wife sought an award of permanent spousal support. Both parties provided the trial court with written proffers of fact regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>statutory factors of Code \u00a7 20-107.1. The court conducted an evidentiary hearing and announced from the bench an award of $600 a month in spousal support to wife. Husband\u2019s counsel later objected to the entry of the support order on the ground that the trial court had not provided sufficient \u201cwritten findings and conclusions\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F). App. at 55. The trial court heard argument on the objection and ordered the parties to brief the relevant statutory factors. The brief filed by wife\u2019s counsel surveyed the evidence supporting the court\u2019s award and recommended findings based upon that evidence. The brief filed by husband\u2019s counsel proposed findings in support of withholding any award of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">The trial court issued a letter opinion that included an itemized list paraphrasing most, but not all, of the statutory factors listed in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E). The letter opinion stated the court had \u201cconsidered the following\u201d in making its support award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">1. The obligations, needs and financial resources of the parties, including but not limited to income from all sources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">2. The standard of living established during the marriage which the Court found to be high middle class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">3. The duration of the marriage which the Court found to be 22 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">4. The contribution, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the wellbeing of the family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-10\">5. The property interest of the parties, both real and personal, tangible and intangible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-11\">6. The provisions made with regard to the marital property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">7. the earning capacity of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-14\">8. the actions of the parties in the dissolution of the marriage although final decree granted on separation for period of 1 year; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>9. Such other factors, including tax consequences to each party, as are necessary to consider the equities between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">App. at 39. In this recitation, the only mention of any factfinding specific to this case were the findings that the parties had been married \u201c22 years\u201d and enjoyed a \u201chigh middle class\u201d standard of living. <em>Id. </em>The letter opinion ended with the court\u2019s acknowledgment that husband would continue to pay the mortgage on the marital home until its sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The court entered an order awarding $600 a month in spousal support to wife. The order referred to \u201crulings\u201d from the bench at the evidentiary hearing and the \u201creasons set forth\u201d in its letter opinion, attached as an exhibit to the order. <em>Id. </em>at 41. Husband\u2019s counsel objected to the order on the ground that neither it nor the letter opinion provided sufficient \u201cwritten findings and conclusions\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">After entry of the order, the parties provided the court with an agreed-upon statement of facts in lieu of a transcript pursuant to Rule 5A:8(c). The statement of facts did not recite any findings or conclusions announced by the court at the evidentiary hearing. Instead, it stated that the court\u2019s letter opinion provided the \u201cwritten findings and list of factors rendered pursuant to \u00a7 20-107.1 which [the court] considered in making its $600 per month award (letter attached).\u201d App. at 55. The court signed the statement of facts and added a handwritten addendum: \u201cAlthough court in [its] letter listed only certain factors under \u00a7 20-107.1\u2014all factors were considered.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In Virginia, a trial court has no common law duty to explain in any detail the reasoning supporting its judgments. Absent a statutory requirement to do so, \u201ca trial court is not required to give findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 627, 292 S.E.2d 798, 805 (1982). Nor is a trial judge \u201crequired to give any written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>explanation for his signed, written order.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 335, 345, 533 S.E.2d 22, 27 (2000) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Trial judges sometimes refrain from providing a detailed explanation because they think \u201cthe reasons self evident.\u201d <em>Freeman v. Peyton, </em>207 Va. 194, 196, 148 S.E.2d 795, 797 (1966). Others may conclude that, in some cases, saying too much is as detrimental as saying too little. The correct balance depends on the unique context of each case, the informative value of an explanation, and the possibility of inflaming an interminable dispute with an overly detailed explanation. With few exceptions, when no specific explanation is given by a trial court, we presume the court followed the governing legal principles, <em>White v. White, </em>56 Va.App. 214, 217, 692 S.E.2d 289, 290-91 (2010), and resolved all factual contests favorable to the prevailing party, <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 671, 680 n. 2, 674 S.E.2d 571, 576, n. 2 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">By statute, however, the General Assembly has identified certain decisions that uniquely warrant an explanation by the trial court. Many involve domestic relations disputes. When a trial court rules on child custody and visitation issues, for example, Code \u00a7 20-124.3 requires the court to \u201ccommunicate to the parties the basis for the decision either orally or in writing.\u201d To satisfy this requirement, \u201cthe trial court must provide a case-specific explanation (one that finds its contextual meaning from the evidence before the court) of the fundamental, predominating reason or reasons for the decision.\u201d <em>Kane v. Szymczak, </em>41 Va.App. 365, 373, 585 S.E.2d 349, 353 (2003); <em>see also Artis v. Jones, </em>52 Va.App. 356, 363, 663 S.E.2d 521, 524 (2008); <em>Lanzalotti v. Lanzalotti </em>41 Va.App. 550, 555, 586 S.E.2d 881, 883 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">In cases involving requests for spousal support for an undefined duration, the General Assembly has expressed the duty-to-explain requirement this way: \u201cIn contested cases in the circuit courts, any order granting, reserving or denying a request for spousal support shall be accompanied by written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>findings and conclusions of the court identifying the factors in subsection E which support the court\u2019s order.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This provision requires more than merely communicating \u201cthe fundamental, predominating reason or reasons for the decision.\u201d <em>Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 873, 585 S.E.2d at 353 (interpreting Code \u00a7 20-124.3). Instead, to comply with Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F), the trial court should identify all relevant statutory factors supporting its decision and provide an explanation of its resolution of any significant underlying factual disputes. <em>See Benzine v. Benzine, </em>52 Va.App. 256, 261, 663 S.E.2d 105, 108 (2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">The written explanation requirement can be satisfied by trial court orders, written letter opinions filed in the court\u2019s record, oral rulings \u201cfrom the bench\u201d recorded in a written transcript, <em>Bruemmer v. Bruemmer, </em>46 Va.App. 205, 210, 616 S.E.2d 740, 742 (2005), as well as findings and conclusions recorded in a statement of facts in lieu of a transcript pursuant to Rule 5A:8(c). In each of these instances, the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions may incorporate by reference proffers by the parties. <em>See, e.g., West v. West, </em>53 Va.App. 125, 132, 669 S.E.2d 390, 394 (2008) (noting \u201cthe trial court expressly stated in its final decree that \u2018the statutory factors outlined by [mother] at [T]ab 12 ... are convincing in their detail\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The statutory duty to <em>explain </em>a decision, of course, does not change the <em>nature </em>of the decision itself. The General Assembly did not intend the statutory decisionmaking factors to devolve into an algorithm and thereby project a pretense of certitude. No judge who has ever made such decisions would describe the thought process in this way. While a trial judge must consider all the factors, the judge is not \u201crequired to quantify or elaborate exactly what weight or consideration it has given to each of the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Duva v. Duva, 55 </em>Va.App. 286, 300, 685 S.E.2d 842, 849 (2009) (citation omitted); <em>see also Robinson v. Robinson, </em>54 Va.App. 87, 91, 675 S.E.2d 873, 875 (2009). \u201cWhat weight, if any, to assign to this [or that] factor in the overall decision lies within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Robbins v. Robbins, </em>48 Va.App. 466, 481, 632 S.E.2d 615, 622 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In this case, we conclude the trial court\u2019s letter opinion provided the litigants with an inadequate explanation of the court\u2019s decision. The trial court paraphrased many of the statutory factors but made only two specific findings of fact: The parties had been married \u201c22 years\u201d and enjoyed a \u201chigh middle class\u201d standard of living. App. at 39. The competing letter briefs submitted by the parties, however, revealed significant factual disputes on other factors and proffered very different proposed resolutions. As husband\u2019s counsel stated in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">There was major conflict as to the causes leading up to the breakup of the marriage (20-107.1(A)). Mrs. Pilati asserted that it was because of her husband\u2019s infidelity (his viewing pornography and his visiting prostitutes) that caused their marriage to end. Mr. Pilati asserted that the marriage was \u201cover\u201d many years ago and that his viewing pornography and his visiting prostitutes was simply evidence that the marriage was broken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 32. The trial court did not expressly resolve this \u201cmajor conflict,\u201d <em>id., </em>in its ruling. And this omission cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>dismissed as legally insignificant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIn Virginia, when \u2018a claim for support is made by a party who has been held blameless for the marital breach, the law imposes upon the other party a duty, within the limits of his or her financial ability, to maintain the blameless party according to the station in life to which that party was accustomed during the marriage.\u2019\u201d <em>Brandau v. Brandau, </em>52 Va.App. 632, 637, 666 S.E.2d 532, 535 (2008) (quoting <em>Gamble v. Gamble, </em>14 Va.App. 558, 573-74, 421 S.E.2d 635, 644 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Additional conflicts in the evidence arose out of the parties\u2019 differing positions on wife\u2019s income earning potential, App. at 32-33, her alleged inclusion of adult child expenses in her household budget offered in support of her spousal support claim, <em>id. </em>at 33, and husband\u2019s alleged understatement of his income and overstatement of his expenses, <em>id. </em>at 33, 35-36. These evidentiary conflicts implicate several statutory decisionmaking factors, and thus, should have been addressed in the court\u2019s \u201cwritten findings and conclusions\u201d required by Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In short, \u201cwhere a trial court is required to make written findings supporting its decision, its failure to do so constitutes reversible error.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. 189, 194, 648 S.E.2d 314, 316 (2007). When this occurs, we \u201cremand this matter to the trial court with instructions to provide an explanation in compliance with the statute.\u201d <em>Kane, </em>41 Va.App. at 376, 585 S.E.2d at 355. This remedy precisely reflects the nature of the trial court\u2019s error. We do not address, much less hold, that the support award should not have been made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>at all or that the amount of the award was too high or too low. The lack of a sufficient explanation for the $600 monthly award of spousal support did not render it unawardable\u2014just unexplained. The error we reverse is not the fact or the amount of the award, but the absence of a sufficient explanation accompanying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Because the trial court did not provide sufficient \u201cwritten findings and conclusions\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F), we remand this matter to the trial court with instructions to do so in compliance with the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-5\">. For a particular kind of spousal support award\u2014a defined duration award\u2014the trial court's findings must go further and \"identify the basis for the nature, amount and duration of the award and, if appropriate, a specification of the events and circumstances reasonably contemplated by the court which support the award.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F). This difference in degree requires the trial court to address the unique circumstances justifying this type of award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\">. Prior to the enactment of Code \u00a7 20-107.1(F) in 1998, \"when a trial court failed to make factual findings or present any explanation of the circumstances that influenced its decision regarding spousal support, we could examine the record to determine if the trial court\u2019s decision was supported by evidence relevant to the statutory factors.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>50 Va.App. 189, 195, 648 S.E.2d 314, 317 (2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E) (requiring the court, when considering whether to award support, to \u201cconsider the circumstances and factors which contributed to the dissolution of the marriage\u201d); <em>cf. Cousins v. Cousins, </em>5 Va.App. 156, 158-59, 360 S.E.2d 882, 884 (1987) (interpreting identical language in the equitable distribution statute, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)); <em>Bentz v. Bentz, </em>2 Va.App. 486, 488, 345 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1986) (same). In addition, determining the \"nature, amount and duration\u201d of a support award requires consideration of the positive and negative \u201ccontributions, monetary and nonmonetary, of each party to the well-being of the family.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E)(6). <em>See Brandau v. Brandau, </em>52 Va.App. 632, 638-39, 666 S.E.2d 532, 535-36 (2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b231-19\">.
