Minor contends that the commission committed three errors. First, Minor argues that the commission erred in failing to require appellees to pay Minor the balance of his settlement award. Second, Minor contends that the commission erred in failing to rule that appellees should not have paid DCSE more than 65% of Minor\u2019s net settlement proceeds. Third, and finally, Minor assigns error to the commission\u2019s failure to assess a 20% late payment penalty against appellees. For the following reasons, we conclude that the commission committed no errors and affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Prior to bringing this action, Minor and his wife were divorced in a bilateral proceeding, with the court retaining continuing jurisdiction over both parties. As a result of the divorce, Minor was required to pay monthly child support for the care and maintenance of his daughter. These child support payments were deducted from Minor\u2019s wages and unemployment benefits through DCSE administrative support orders. These support orders obliged Minor to keep DCSE informed of any changes in his address or employments status. Throughout the instant action, Minor has claimed that he promptly notified DCSE each time his address or employment status changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">On June 19, 2009, Minor suffered a compensable work-related injury. On September 23, 2010, the commission approved a $30,000 settlement award for Minor\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. The settlement order specifically required appellees to comply with \u201cany legally enforceable\u201d DCSE child support lien \u201cto the extent required by law\u201d in the course of paying the award. The order also noted that legal fees of $6,000 and costs of $54.50 would be deducted from the award, leaving Minor\u2019s net proceeds at $23,945.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On an unknown date prior to the commission\u2019s approval of the settlement award, appellees received two administrative support orders from DCSE pertaining to Minor\u2019s child support obligation. The most recent order (hereinafter \u201cthe order\u201d) stated that Minor owed a child support arrearage in the amount of $22,784.46. The order commanded:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">[Y]ou are hereby ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-9\">1. To immediately withhold from access by the debtor or joint account holder any property, assets, or money which is due, owing, or belonging to the debtor with a value up to the full amount of the child support debt shown above. All property above the amount of the debt shall remain the property of the debtor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Failure to answer this order within the time prescribed, failure to withhold property as directed in this order, release of assets subject to this order to someone other than [DCSE], or failure to deliver the withheld property pursuant to an Order to Deliver creates a liability for you in an amount equal to 100 percent of the debt specified in this order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">* * * * <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">NOTICE TO DEBTOR/ABSENT PARENT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-7\">* <em>* </em>* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">To the extent that any property that is the subject of this order constitutes \u201cdisposable income\u201d as defined in [Code \u00a7 ] 63.2-100, the maximum percentage of that income that is subject to this order is <em>100%. </em>(If previous space is blank, maximum percentage of disposable income subject to this order is 65%). Any property that does not constitute disposable income is subject to withholding in its entirety. If you wish to contest the order, you must file a written request for an appeal hearing within 10 days from the date this notice is served on you. Send your request to the Hearing Officer....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">If you disagree with the hearing officer\u2019s decision, you can file an appeal with the court within 10 days of receiving the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-11\">Code Section[s]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-12\">34-29 63.2-1953 63.2-1925 63.2-1929 63.2-1930</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-13\">Minor\u2019s address was not listed on the order, and he maintained that he never received it. Minor sent approximately twenty emails to appellees between September and October 2010, inquiring about the settlement proceeds. Although appellees had multiple communications with DCSE concerning the order from August through October 2010, appellees did not inform Minor of the order or discuss the issue with him prior to paying DCSE the full amount requested: $22,784.46. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>This amount constituted approximately 97% of the settlement proceeds from Minor\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation settlement award. Minor received the balance of the award minus attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in late October 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">On November 22, 2010, Minor requested a hearing with the commission, maintaining that appellees overpaid DCSE for child support arrearages out of the balance of his settlement award. Specifically, he argued that appellees should not have paid more than 65% of the net proceeds of the award and requested that the commission order appellees to reimburse him for the difference along with a 20% late payment penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">In February 2011, the deputy commissioner convened an evidentiary hearing. Minor testified to the course of events as described above. Additionally, he testified that he had planned to use the settlement proceeds to pay for a place to live, clothing, physical therapy, and tools to find work as a handyman. Minor further testified that he was homeless, sleeping outdoors, and receiving food stamps. He asserted that although he was homeless, he was able to receive mail at his girlfriend\u2019s house and had given DCSE her address. In this regard, Minor introduced DCSE computer records that he obtained from a subpoena but none of them showed that he had informed DCSE of this most recent address change. The records also did not show that Minor was ever served with the order he contests herein. Minor also stated that he contacted DCSE only after receiving the settlement payment, which was less than he had expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The deputy commissioner dismissed Minor\u2019s application, specifically finding that appellees were not permitted to ignore administrative support orders from DCSE. Additionally, the deputy commissioner relied on the commission\u2019s decision in <em>Snyder v. Triplett, </em>No. 203-61-68, 2005 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 193 (Mar. 31, 2005), holding that the commission has no authority to modify an administrative order from a state child support enforcement agency. Relevant to this appeal, the deputy commissioner noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>[Minor] has chosen the wrong forum and the wrong procedure to contest the withholding percentage. The Commission has not entered or enforced any order or process in conflict with [Code \u00a7 ] 34-29. The Commission has repeatedly declined to interfere in a proceeding among [Minor], [appellees], and [DCSE].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On review, the commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision, noting that \u201c[i]t is well-established that the Commission has no authority to order the DCSE to change the amount it orders to be paid.\u201d The commission also found that appellees had complied with the order as written, and thus had no choice but to comply or risk incurring liability themselves as threatened by the order. On the issue of notice, the commission stated that while the evidence appeared to suggest that Minor was not served with the orders, the proper forum for this challenge was the circuit court, not the commission. The commission later denied Minor\u2019s motion to reconsider, and Minor noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Here, Minor raises three distinct arguments in his first two assignments of error. Minor argues that the commission should have ruled that appellees should not have paid DCSE more than 65% of his net settlement proceeds and should have ordered appellees to pay him the balance of his settlement award because: (1) the commission should have invalidated the order; (2) the commission should have interpreted the order differently; or (3) the commission should have found that the payment violated Minor\u2019s due process rights. We will examine each argument in turn before addressing his third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">A. The Commission\u2019s Authority over DCSE Administrative Support Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Although this Court generally gives deference to the commission\u2019s construction of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act on appeal, \u201cwe are \u2018not bound by the commission\u2019s legal analysis in this or prior cases.\u2019 \u201d <em>Peacock v. Browning Ferris, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number><em>Inc., </em>38 Va.App. 241, 248, 563 S.E.2d 368, 372 (2002) (quoting <em>USAir, Inc. v. Joyce, </em>27 Va.App. 184, 189 n. 1, 497 S.E.2d 904, 906 n. 1 (1998)). Therefore, our review of this question is <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">It cannot be disputed that Code \u00a7 65.2-700 limits the commission\u2019s jurisdiction to \u201c[a]ll questions arising under\u201d the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cexcept as otherwise herein provided.\u201d The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act specifically makes awards, even those resulting from settlements, subject to claims for child support. Code \u00a7 65.2-531(A) (\u201c[B]enefits paid in compensation or in compromise of a claim for compensation under this title shall be subject to claims for spousal and child support....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Although the question of the commission\u2019s jurisdiction to settle the dispute in the instant case is apparently one of first impression in this Court, the commission has repeatedly concluded that it lacks jurisdiction and authority to modify, invalidate or interpret DCSE administrative support orders. In <em>Quinn v. Flowers Transport Inc., </em>No. 197-02-82, 2002 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 1717 (Sept. 17, 2002), the commission addressed this issue, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">Should a \u201cresponsible person\u201d (i.e. the claimant in the present proceedings) wish to contest such an order [administrative support order], Code \u00a7 63.1-250.3 [current Code \u00a7 63.2-1924] sets forth the procedures, including an administrative hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 63.1-267.1 [current Code \u00a7 63.2-1942], with appeal to an appropriate circuit court or juvenile and domestic relations court. <em>Significantly, the applicable statutes do not grant the </em>... <em>Commission any authority to review or modify a withholding order issued by [DCSE.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-8\"><em>Id. </em>at *8-9 (emphasis added); <em>see also Snyder v. Triplett, </em>No. 203-61-68, 2005 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 193, *6-7 (Mar. 31, 2005) (citing <em>Quinn </em>for the same proposition and holding that the commission \u201cdoes not have the authority to interpret the order or to enter an award dictating how the insurer will satisfy that order\u201d); <em>Feltus v. Gammon Well Co., </em>No. 235-09-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>38, 2009 VA Wrk. Comp. LEXIS 867 (Jan. 26, 2010) (citing <em>Quinn </em>and <em>Snyder </em>to hold the commission lacks authority to order DCSE to change its orders or interpret them).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We find the analysis in these decisions compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Code \u00a7 63.2-1916 governs notice of an administrative support order, its contents, and modification, stating specifically: \u201cAny changes in the amount of the administrative [support] order must be made pursuant to this section.\u201d It also limits a support debtor to choosing between two avenues when challenging the amount or validity of an administrative support order like the order in this case. <em>Id. </em>Under Code \u00a7 63.2-1916, a support debtor may either: appeal the administrative support order to DCSE (\u201cThe debtor and the obligee have 10 days from the date of receipt of the notice to file an answer with the Commissioner to exercise the right to an administrative hearing.\u201d); or commence proceedings in the juvenile and domestic relations district court (JDR court) or the circuit court (\u201cThe existence of an administrative order shall not preclude either an obligor or obligee from commencing appropriate proceedings in a [JDR court] or a circuit court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">When engaging in statutory interpretation, we are guided by the familiar principle that \u201cstatutes concerning the same subject are to be read together, and construed, wherever possible, so as to avoid conflict between them and to permit each of them to have full operation according to their legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Eastlack v. Commonwealth, </em>282 Va. 120, 125-26, 710 S.E.2d 723, 726 (2011) (citing <em>Hood v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 526, 541-42, 701 S.E.2d 421, 430 (2010)). Other than Code \u00a7 65.2-53.1 (recognizing that awards are subject to administrative support orders), no other section of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act contemplates the commission\u2019s direct involvement or authority in the resolution of child support matters. Moreover, Code \u00a7 63.2-1916 specifies the remedies available to a support debtor who feels aggrieved by an administrative support order, and those remedies do not include filing a claim with the commission. Construing these two statutes to avoid conflict and allowing each to fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>operate according to its legislative purpose, we find that the validity of a DCSE administrative support order is not a question \u201carising under\u201d the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, or \u201cotherwise provided for\u201d in the Act. The commission therefore does not have the authority to modify, invalidate or interpret the order in the case at bar. Minor\u2019s remedy lies with DCSE, the JDR court, or the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Because the commission properly determined that it lacked authority to invalidate the order as Minor requested, we affirm the commission\u2019s refusal to invalidate the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">B. The Commission\u2019s Interpretation of the Order</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">In addition to contending that the commission could have and should have invalidated the order, Minor argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s general statutes overrode the commission\u2019s interpretation of the order. Minor misconstrues the commission\u2019s decision. The commission did not engage in any interpretation of the order\u2014it merely stated that appellees complied with what otherwise appeared to be a valid DCSE administrative support order. In making this observation the commission noted, and we agree, that appellees were essentially faced with a Hobson\u2019s Choice of paying Minor his settlement proceeds or risking their own liability for more than $22,000 to DCSE for noncompliance with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">As we concluded above, the commission has no authority to interpret DCSE administrative support orders like the order in this case. Interpretation of these types of orders is not, under any applicable principles of law, within the specialized knowledge of the commission. Consequently, the commission did not err in constraining its decision in this case to the proper scope of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">C. Minor\u2019s Due Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">Minor next contends that his due process rights were violated because the order required appellees to pay a percentage of the proceeds that exceeded what is allowable under Code \u00a7 34-29. Additionally, Minor asserts that he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>served with the order prior to appellees\u2019 paying over the percentage stated in the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Constitutional arguments raise questions of law which we review <em>de novo. Covel v. Vienna, </em>280 Va. 151, 163, 694 S.E.2d 609, 617 (2010).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">Under Code \u00a7 63.1-252.1 [current Code \u00a7 63.2-1916], a person responsible for the support of a child is <em>assured notice and an opportunity to be heard </em>prior to a final adjudication of any indebtedness. At the hearing, a responsible party may contest liability for the debt and the amount of the debt.... Therefore, <em>we hold that Code \u00a7 63.1-252.1 </em>[current Code \u00a7 63.2-1916] <em>satisfies the constitutional requirements of due process by providing a responsible party with notice and an opportunity to be heard before the judgment is final.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\"><em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 77, 83, 408 S.E.2d 588, 592 (1991) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">In its disposition, the commission observed that while Minor\u2019s due process rights may have been violated, Minor was raising the argument in the wrong forum. Additionally, the commission held that it lacked jurisdiction to interpret the service requirements for DCSE administrative support orders. Consistent with our decisions on the previous assignments of error, we find that interpretation of the service requirements for DCSE\u2019s administrative support orders is not a question arising under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Minor maintains throughout his brief that he was denied due process because the time has now expired for him to request a hearing from DCSE. The contrary is true. The ten-day period for a support debtor\u2019s response to an order is not \u201ca jurisdictional bar. If the [administrative support order] is not contested within ten days of receipt, DCSE has discretion to conduct an administrative hearing.\u201d <em>Carmon v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>21 Va.App. 749, 754, 467 S.E.2d 815, 818 (1996). Nothing precluded Minor from exercising his prerogative to obtain a hearing with DCSE and raising the notice issue in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>that forum, among the other issues he argued to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Accordingly, we find no error in the commission\u2019s determination that Minor sought relief on this issue in the wrong forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">D. The Late Payment Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In his third assignment of .error, Minor argues that the commission erred in not assessing a late payment penalty against appellees because appellees should have only paid DCSE 65% of the net settlement proceeds.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the commission appropriately concluded that it could not take any action against appellees for complying with the terms of the order, we find this argument moot and decline to address it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\">. Minor also argued on brief that appellees\u2019 counsel violated the Rules of Professional Conduct by paying 97% of the settlement award to DCSE. We decline to address this argument because the commission did not address it, and Minor failed to request that the commission rule on it in his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., </em>58 Va.App. 244, 253, 708 S.E.2d 429, 434 (2011) (refusing to consider an issue on appeal because claimant did not file a motion to reconsider after the commission failed to address an issue he raised for review (citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Gloucester Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>266 Va. 409, 411, 587 S.E.2d 546, 548 (2003))).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
