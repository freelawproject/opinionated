On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support a conviction for child neglect where appellant was not a parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the care of the child. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">On appeal, \u201c \u2018we consider the evidence and all reasonable inferences flowing from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 439, 442, 642 S.E.2d 295, 296 (2007) (en banc) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 666, 672, 594 S.E.2d 595, 598 (2004)). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In April 2010, appellant was dating and living with Monique Hawthorne (\u201cMonique\u201d), her twelve-month-old son K.H.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Monique\u2019s sister Tarnita Hawthorne (\u201cTarnita\u201d), and appellant\u2019s brother Cornelius Carrington. On April 14, 2010, Monique was sitting on the couch in her living room attempting to give K.H. a bottle because he was crying. K.H. refused to take the bottle, and threw it on the floor. Appellant, irritated by the crying, came into the living room from the kitchen, and attempted to give K.H. the bottle. Monique told appellant that K.H. did not want the bottle, but was just sleepy. Appellant then turned K.H. over on his stomach stating K.H. would go to sleep faster on his stomach. When K.H. did not stop crying, appellant punched K.H. in the thigh of his left leg three times. K.H.\u2019s leg became swollen, and made a popping noise when it was moved.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Appellant then called his brother Adrian Carrington (\u201cAdrian\u201d) who came to the apartment and drove them to Richmond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Community Hospital. Appellant, Monique, Tarnita, and K.H. were subsequently transported to the Medical College of Virginia (\u201cMCV\u201d) where Dr. Victoria Kuester, a pediatric orthopedic surgeon, treated K.H. for a \u201ctransverse femur fracture\u201d to K.H.\u2019s left leg. On several of the hospital forms, appellant was listed as KH.\u2019s guarantor as well as KH.\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Detective Edward Aeschlimann (\u201cAeschlimann\u201d), with the Richmond Police Department, and Georgi Fisher (\u201cFisher\u201d), with the Richmond Department of Social Services, arrived at MCV to investigate K.H.\u2019s injuries. In separate interviews at the hospital, Monique, Tarnita, and appellant initially told the medical personnel, the police, and social services that K.H. had sustained the injury to his leg when he fell off the bed and landed on a toy while Monique was in the shower and appellant was watching K.H. Appellant also told Fisher at the hospital that he was K.H.\u2019s father. At some point, appellant became angry with Monique, and pushed her while Fisher was in the hospital room with them. Appellant was subsequently arrested for assault and removed from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Later that evening, Fisher drove Monique to her apartment so Monique could pick up some items for K.H. Prior to doing so, Tarnita had told Fisher to get Monique to tell her the truth about what had actually happened to K.H. While Fisher drove Monique to her apartment, Fisher asked Monique what the truth was, and Monique told Fisher that appellant had punched K.H.\u2019s leg causing the injury. Monique told Fisher that she had been afraid to tell the truth because appellant had threatened that he would kill her if she told anyone the truth. Fisher then advised Aeschlimann of what Monique had told her in the car, after which Aeschlimann spoke with Monique again.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">At trial, Dr. Kuester testified that K.H.\u2019s injury was indicative of a blunt force trauma to his thigh, and was inconsistent with a fall off a bed the height of appellant\u2019s bed. Further, Monique testified that she and Tarnita told everybody that K.H. hurt himself falling off the bed while Monique was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>shower, instead of the truth that appellant punched K.H., because she was afraid of appellant. Monique stated that she was afraid of appellant based on appellant\u2019s previous actions in which appellant had hurt Monique, and appellant\u2019s threat that he would kill her if she did not tell this version.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">After the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant moved to strike the evidence of the child neglect charge on the ground that appellant was not a guardian or person responsible for the care of the child, which the trial court denied. Adrian then testified that it was not uncommon for appellant to contact him for advice on caring for K.H. and that appellant asked him to come over that night to check on K.H. Adrian also stated that he told appellant KH.\u2019s injury did not look like K.H. fell off a bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">At trial, appellant denied striking K.H., and testified that K.H. fell off the bed around 7:00 p.m. Appellant agreed on cross-examination that although he was not K.H.\u2019s father, he called K.H. his son, helped take care of K.H., and \u201clooked out for [K.H.]\u201d Appellant stated that he helped by feeding and bathing K.H., and by putting K.H. to sleep. At the conclusion of the evidence, appellant renewed his motion to strike on the same grounds, which the trial court denied noting Adrian\u2019s testimony that appellant cared for K.H., asked Adrian to come over to check on K.H., and routinely asked Adrian about K.H. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">\u201cWhen considering on appeal the sufficiency of the evidence presented below, we \u2018presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u2019 and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wood v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 286, 296, 701 S.E.2d 810, 815 (2010) (quoting <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002)). Under this standard, the reviewing court asks whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\u201cStatutory interpretation presents a pure question of law and is accordingly subject to de novo review by this Court.\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>272 Va. 449, 455, 634 S.E.2d 310, 313 (2006) (citing <em>Ainslie v. Inman, </em>265 Va. 347, 352, 577 S.E.2d 246, 248 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">On appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support a conviction for child neglect where appellant was not a \u201cperson responsible for the care of [the] child.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A). Specifically, appellant argues that he was not responsible for the care of K.H. since he was not the sole adult present with K.H. during the incident.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201cWhen the language of a statute is unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. Furthermore, we must give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention as expressed by the language used unless a literal interpretation of the language would result in a manifest absurdity. If a statute is subject to more than one interpretation, we must apply the interpretation that will carry out the legislative intent behind the statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\"><em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 35, 48-49, 707 S.E.2d 17, 24 (2011) (quoting <em>Evans v. Evans, </em>280 Va. 76, 82, 695 S.E.2d 173, 176 (2010)). \u201cAccordingly, \u2018[t]he plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is to be preferred over any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 707 S.E.2d at 24 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Evans, </em>280 Va. at 82, 695 S.E.2d at 176).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A) provides, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-11\">[a]ny parent, guardian, or other person responsible for the care of a child under the age of 18 who by willful act or omission or refusal to provide any necessary care for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>child\u2019s health causes or permits serious injury to the life or health of such child shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD1\">Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1 \u201crequires proof only that a person is \u2018responsible for the care of a child.\u2019 \u201d <em>Snow v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 766, 773, 537 S.E.2d 6, 10 (2000). \u201c[O]ne may become a person \u2018responsible for the care of a child\u2019 by a voluntary course of conduct and without explicit parental delegation of supervisory responsibility or court order.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Appellant contends that the holding in <em>Snow </em>requires that an individual be left alone with a child in order for them to be responsible for the child. Based on this interpretation, appellant specifically contends that since Monique also was with K.H. at the time of the injury, she actually was responsible for KH.\u2019s care and not appellant. This Court, however, declines to read <em>Snow </em>that narrowly as neither this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Snow </em>nor the plain language of the statute requires that a person be the sole adult responsible for the care of a child in order to be convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Turning to the plain language of the statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A) applies to <em>\u201cany ... </em>person responsible for the care of a child,\u201d which is the only proof required. (Emphasis added.); <em>see Snow, </em>33 Va.App. at 773, 537 S.E.2d at 10 (noting Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1 \u201crequires proof only that a person is \u2018responsible for the care of a child\u2019 \u201d). Nothing in this language conveys that an individual cannot have joint responsibility with another individual for the child, or that an individual cannot be responsible if a parent or guardian is also present at the time of the child\u2019s injury. Rather, the statute prohibits certain acts by <em>\u201cany ... </em>person responsible for the care of a child.... \u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">At the time of KH.\u2019s injury, appellant was a person responsible for the care of K.H. Although appellant was not KH.\u2019s biological father, he held himself out as the father, \u201clooked out\u201d for K.H., and even helped feed, bathe, and put K.H. to sleep. In addition, appellant would call Adrian to get advice on caring for K.H. On the evening of the incident, appellant had attempted to give K.H. a bottle prior to turning K.H. over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>on his stomach and then punching him in the leg. In so doing, appellant was responsible for the care of K.H. through his \u201cvoluntary course of conduct....\u201d <em>Snow, </em>33 Va.App. at 773, 537 S.E.2d at 10. For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in finding appellant was a person responsible for KH.\u2019s care through his voluntary course of conduct. Therefore, we hold that the trial court did not err in holding the evidence sufficient to find appellant guilty of child neglect, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-19\">. Appellant\u2019s convictions of malicious wounding and assault and battery against a family member are not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-9\">.
