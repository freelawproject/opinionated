Brock contends the commission misapplied the <em>res judicata </em>doctrine as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Brock was injured at work in January 2007. He filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim in July 2007 seeking benefits for injuries to his shoulder, back, and hips. Represented by counsel, he amended his claim in November 2007 to allege additional injuries to his head and leg. A deputy commissioner scheduled a hearing on his claim and warned Brock\u2019s counsel: <em>\u201cAll issues </em>will be considered at the upcoming November 20, 2007 hearing at 10:30 a.m. in Covington.\u201d App. at 8 (emphasis added). Brock\u2019s counsel requested a continuance, alleging she \u201cdid not anticipate receiving the necessary documentation\u201d prior to the scheduled hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The commission continued the hearing to March 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">A. The First Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">At the first evidentiary hearing, Brock and the employer stipulated he had injured his left shoulder in the accident. Represented by counsel, Brock produced no evidence of any other injuries and did not request additional time to develop such evidence. Nor did he ask the deputy commissioner to reserve jurisdiction to consider additional evidence at some later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">After the hearing, the deputy commissioner entered an award order stating the claim \u201cbefore the Commission\u201d was the original claim filed by Brock in July 2007, as later amended by counsel in November 2007. <em>Id. </em>at 56. The order awarded Brock temporary, total compensation and medical benefits for the \u201cstipulated\u201d injury to Brock\u2019s left shoulder. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 61. After making this award, the order concluded: \u201cThis claim is hereby dismissed, and is ordered removed from the hearing docket.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. The order also advised both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>parties of their right to appeal the decision. Neither Brock nor the employer appealed the order to the full commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">B. The Second Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Four months later, in July 2008, Brock\u2019s counsel filed a letter seeking \u201cadditional benefits\u201d for injuries to his hip, back, and legs arising out of the same accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 62. The deputy commissioner acknowledged Brock\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d claim and scheduled a hearing to address it. <em>Id. </em>at 78. Brock appeared at the hearing without counsel. At the end of the hearing, the employer\u2019s counsel pointed out the \u201cnew\u201d injuries were alleged in the original amended claim. <em>Id. </em>at 157. The employer contended these matters were \u201cabandoned\u201d at the earlier evidentiary hearing and questioned whether \u201cthey can properly be considered at this junction of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In a second award order, the deputy commissioner held Brock had \u201cabandoned\u201d any claim for injuries beyond the stipulated left shoulder injury by not presenting evidence of such injuries at the first evidentiary hearing in March 2008. <em>Id. </em>at 183. The deputy commissioner, however, declined to apply <em>res judicata </em>because Brock\u2019s abandonment, she reasoned, \u201cwas in effect a non-suit\u201d of those aspects of his claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">C. Review by the Full Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The employer appealed this second order to the full commission on several grounds, including an argument that the deputy commissioner \u201cwrongly decided that principles of <em>res judicata </em>do not bar the claims for injuries to the back, hips and legs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198. <em>Citing K &amp; L Trucking Co. v. Thurber, </em>1 Va.App. 213, 219, 337 S.E.2d 299, 302 (1985), the employer argued <em>res judicata </em>applied to workers\u2019 compensation awards and barred relitigation of matters that either were previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>litigated or \u201ccould have been litigated\u201d at the prior evidentiary hearing. App. at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">On review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s second order, the commission agreed with the employer and held <em>res judicata </em>barred Brock\u2019s allegedly new claim for injuries to his back, hips, and legs. <em>Brock v. Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation, Inc., </em>2011 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 42, at *16-17 (Jan. 26, 2011). \u201cThe Deputy Commissioner\u2019s [first] award was not appealed and became final,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *14, the commission noted. \u201cNothing more was necessary to settle the rights of the parties regarding the compensability of the injuries alleged in the claimant\u2019s application, and there was a final adjudication on the issues raised in the application.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u201cIt is critical to note,\u201d the commission explained, \u201cthat <em>res judicata </em>bars not only matters which were actually litigated in a prior proceeding, but also bars matters which could have been litigated in the prior proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *10. To hold otherwise, the commission concluded, would permit Brock, \u201cas long as he did so within the statute of limitations\u201d to \u201cfile four separate applications, one for his back, one for his legs, one for his head and one for his hips, and then litigate each application at four separate hearings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *16. Doing so would \u201cwaste considerable time and expense on the part of the Commission\u201d and do nothing to bring an \u201cend to litigation and the prevention of harassment to the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThere is simply no conceivable public policy,\u201d the commission reasoned, \u201cwhich would be furthered by allowing such piecemeal adjudication of claims.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">On appeal, Brock argues <em>res judicata </em>does not apply because there was \u201cno real adjudication on the merits of the claims for additional injuries\u201d at the first hearing. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. He also claims the 2008 award order was not a \u201cfinal adjudication\u201d because it \u201cdid not address the claims for additional injuries\u201d and \u201cdid not mention the claims for injuries to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the back, head, leg, and hip.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Like the commission, we disagree with these two closely related assertions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Two distinct concepts\u2014issue preclusion and claim preclusion\u2014are \u201ccollectively referred to as <em>\u2018res judicata.\u2019 \u201d Taylor v. Sturgell, </em>553 U.S. 880, 892, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 2171, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008). Issue preclusion bars \u201c \u2018successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,\u2019 even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 748-49, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 1814, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001)). Often called \u201ccollateral estoppel,\u201d issue preclusion bars parties from litigating in a subsequent suit \u201cany issue of fact actually litigated and essential to a valid and final personal judgment in the first action.\u201d <em>Rawlings v. Lopez, </em>267 Va. 4, 4-5, 591 S.E.2d 691, 692 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">In contrast, claim preclusion bars \u201csuccessive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>553 U.S. at 892, 128 S.Ct. at 2171 (quoting <em>New Hampshire, </em>532 U.S. at 748, 121 S.Ct. at 1814). Called \u201cmerger\u201d when the claimant wins the first suit and \u201cbar\u201d when the claimant loses, claim preclusion treats unasserted claims as being subsumed into the disposition of related, previously adjudicated, claims arising out of the same cause of action. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 18, 19 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>Virginia\u2019s application of the claim preclusion component of <em>res judicata </em>was best stated a century ago: \u201cEvery litigant should have opportunity to present whatever grievance he may have\u201d but if given an opportunity to do so and \u201chaving failed to avail himself of it, he must accept the consequences.\u201d <em>Miller v. Smith, </em>109 Va. 651, 655, 64 S.E. 956, 957 (1909). Thus, the \u201ceffect of a final decree is not only to conclude the parties as to every question actually raised and decided, but as to every claim which properly belonged to the subject of litigation and which the parties, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, might have raised at the time.\u201d <em>Smith v. Holland, </em>124 Va. 663, 666, 98 S.E. 676, 677 (1919) (citing <em>Diamond State Iron Co. v. Alex K. Rarig &amp; Co., </em>93 Va. 595, 25 S.E. 894 (1896); <em>Miller, </em>109 Va. at 651, 64 S.E. at 956).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Claims precluded by <em>res judicata </em>include those \u201cmade or tendered by the pleadings,\u201d as well as those \u201cincident to or essentially connected -with the subject matter of the litigation, whether the same, as a matter of fact, were or were not considered.\u201d <em>Lofton Ridge, LLC v. Norfolk S. Ry., </em>268 Va. 377, 381, 601 S.E.2d 648, 650 (2004) (quoting <em>Kemp v. Miller, </em>166 Va. 661, 674-75, 186 S.E. 99, 103-04 (1936)). This \u201ccould-have-litigated-should-have-litigated principle,\u201d <em>Va. Imps. Ltd. v. Kirin Brewery of Am., LLC, </em>50 Va.App. 395, 410 n. 6, 650 S.E.2d 554, 561 n. 6 (2007), finds its roots in the earliest Virginia precedents<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and was recently incorporated into Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>1:6(a), which restates the general rule that, when applicable, claim preclusion applies \u201cwhether or not the legal theory or rights asserted in the second or subsequent action were raised in the prior lawsuit, and regardless of the legal elements or the evidence upon which any claims in the prior proceeding depended, or the particular remedies sought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">These principles apply to workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>See Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 128, 510 S.E.2d 255, 259 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (confirming <em>res judicata </em>applies \u201cto decisions of deputy commissioners and the full commission\u201d). In one of our first opinions, we held \u201cthe relationship of the Commission to an award is that of a court to a judgment during the term at which it is rendered.\u201d <em>Thurber, </em>1 Va.App. at 219, 337 S.E.2d at 302. A \u201ccontested matter before the Commission,\u201d we explained, involves an \u201cassertion of particular legal rights which have arisen out of a definable factual transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 337 S.E.2d at 302. It follows that a final award \u201cbars relitigation of the same cause of action, <em>or any part thereof which could have been litigated </em>between the same parties and their privies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219, 337 S.E.2d at 302 (emphasis added). The commission, consistent with its own precedent,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> correctly held the merger principle of <em>res judicata </em>claim preclusion applies to matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>that could have been raised in the earlier proceeding in addition to those that were actually raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The question remains whether this principle should apply to the award order entered after the first hearing. We agree with the commission on this issue as well. On appeal, Brock concedes the barred allegations of injury \u201ccould have been adjudicated\u201d at the first hearing. Oral Argument Audio 00:53 to 00:57. The record fully supports this concession. Before the hearing, Brock specifically alleged injuries to his shoulder, back, hips, head, and leg. In an abundance of caution, the commission warned Brock that \u201c[a]ll issues\u201d would be considered at the first hearing. App. at 8. In response, Brock\u2019s counsel requested and received a lengthy continuance to better prepare his case. For reasons indiscernible from the record, however, Brock limited his presentation at the hearing to the stipulated left shoulder injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The commission understandably rejected its deputy\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>interpretation of the award order as \u201cin effect a non-suit\u201d that preserved all pled, but nonetheless \u201cabandoned,\u201d aspects of Brock\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>App. at 183. Nothing in the record suggests Brock ever sought to withdraw any portion of his claim. Nor did he at any time ask the deputy commissioner to hold open the evidentiary record to later consider allegations of other injuries. And even if the text of the order could arguably bear such a construction, the full commission nonetheless \u201cis entitled to interpret its own orders in determining the import of its decisions\u201d for purposes of <em>res judicata. Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc., </em>29 Va.App. at 130, 510 S.E.2d at 260; <em>see also Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., </em>58 Va.App. 244, 249, 708 S.E.2d 429, 432 (2011) (\u201cThe commission determines the nature of its orders and rulings.\u201d); <em>Lowes of Christiansburg v. Clem, </em>37 Va.App. 315, 323, 557 S.E.2d 745, 748 (2002) (recognizing the commission\u2019s authority \u201cto examine the opinion of the deputy commissioner as a whole in order to ascertain the result intended\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Workers\u2019 compensation cases, of course, cannot always be concluded in a single evidentiary hearing. For just this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>reason, the commission has tailored the application of <em>res judicata </em>to take into account allegations of injury that, while pled in the initial claim, may nonetheless not be ripe for final adjudication. The commission, for example, has the authority to defer for later determination \u201cpremature\u201d issues unripe for adjudication, <em>Brown v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>34 Va.App. 273, 280-81, 540 S.E.2d 521, 524-25 (2001), and frequently allows claimants \u201cto voluntarily withdraw [a] claim before the record has closed and the matter has been submitted to a Deputy Commissioner for a decision,\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Webb, </em>47 Va.App. 404, 407, 624 S.E.2d 115, 116-17 (2006) (quoting <em>Webb v. Jenkins, </em>2005 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 249, at *2 (Mar. 31, 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Brock, however, took advantage of none of these protective measures. Instead, after being warned of the necessity of addressing \u201c[a]ll issues\u201d raised in his claim, App. at 8, he attended the evidentiary hearing and limited his presentation to a stipulated left shoulder injury. Brock does not contend he was denied a full and fair opportunity to assert all of his alleged injuries. Nor does he offer any explanation for failing to do so. He simply asserts the right to litigate the case on an injury-by-injury basis at <em>separate </em>hearings with each resulting in <em>separate </em>award orders. Like the commission, we are unaware of any \u201cconceivable public policy which would be furthered by allowing such piecemeal adjudication of claims.\u201d <em>Brock, </em>2011 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 42, at *16.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Because the commission applied settled principles of <em>res judicata </em>to bar Brock from litigating matters he neglected to raise at his earlier evidentiary hearing, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-9\">. Brock later filed a <em>pro se </em>claim in February 2009 seeking benefits for injuries to his back, head, shoulder, leg, and hip.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b91-6\">. On brief, Brock also argues the commission failed to address whether the employer \"invited error\u201d on the <em>res judicata </em>issue, failed to decide whether the \"head injury\u201d was barred by <em>res judicata, </em>erred in reversing a portion of the deputy commissioner\u2019s award on which the employer did not seek review, and violated his constitutional due process rights. Appellant's Br. at 3 (assignments of error 2, 4, 5, 6). Because Brock made none of these arguments to the commission, it had no opportunity to address them. Under Rule 5A:18, no argument advanced on appeal \"as a basis for reversal\u201d can be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Williams v. Gloucester Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, </em>266 Va. 409, 411, 587 S.E.2d 546, 548 (2003); <em>Hodnett v. Stanco Masonry, Inc., </em>58 Va.App. 244, 248-49, 708 S.E.2d 429, 432 (2011).
