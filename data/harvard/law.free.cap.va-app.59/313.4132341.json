We conclude that the time bar found in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) does not apply to appellant\u2019s claim for medical benefits. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Geraldine T. Prophet sustained a work-related injury to her back in 1997, while employed as a certified nursing assistant. She received compensation in various amounts, and pursuant to a number of awards, for 500 weeks, the maximum allowed by statute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-518.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Over the years, the claimant has treated her pain with a great variety of drugs. In June 2007, the claimant\u2019s physician, Dr. Lawrence J. Winikur, prescribed Opana. Opana is an opioid drug prescribed to treat pain. After she began taking Opana, the claimant noticed that she was losing weight. She testified that she \u201clooked like a skeleton.\u201d Dr. Winikur found her appearance so striking that he inquired of the claimant if she was being tested for cancer. Dr. Winikur diagnosed the claimant as suffering from \u201cnarcotic induced anorexia,\u201d or weight loss triggered by long term use of opioid medications. To address the weight loss, Dr. Winikur prescribed Marinol, an appetite stimulant. The Marinol prescription was dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>November 29, 2007. The treatment was successful, and the claimant regained weight. Dr. Winikur later discontinued the claimant\u2019s use of Marinol.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On November 14, 2008, Prophet filed a claim for benefits in which she sought payment of medication expenses totaling $39,000. The employer ultimately agreed that it was responsible for all of the medications except for the Marinol. Following a hearing, Deputy Commissioner Bruner ruled in favor of the claimant. The employer appealed to the commission, contending that the claim for Marinol was time-barred by operation of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The commission, chiefly relying on <em>Berglund Chevrolet, Inc. v. Landrum, </em>43 Va.App. 742, 601 S.E.2d 693 (2004), and <em>Tricord Homes, Inc. v. Smith, </em>No. 0863-08-2, 2008 WL 5396617 (Va.Ct.App. Dec. 30, 2008), reversed the deputy commissioner and held that the claim for Marinol was untimely under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The issue before the Court is one of statutory interpretation, and we review such questions <em>de novo. Town of Waverly Law Enforcement v. Owens, </em>51 Va.App. 277, 280, 657 S.E.2d 161, 162 (2008). \u201cAs with any question of statutory interpretation, our primary objective is \u2018to ascertain and give effect to legislative intent,\u2019 as expressed by the language used in the statute.\u201d <em>Ruby v. Cashnet, Inc., </em>281 Va. 604, 609, 708 S.E.2d 871, 873-74 (2011) (quoting <em>Conger v. Barrett, </em>280 Va. 627, 630, 702 S.E.2d 117, 118 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">Upon its own motion or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in condition, the Commission may review any award and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this title, and shall immediately send to the parties a copy of the award____No such review shall be made after twenty-four months from the last day for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>which compensation was paid, pursuant to an award under this title....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">I. Statutory text and purpose compel the conclusion that THE LIMITATIONS PERIOD IN CODE \u00a7 65.2-708(A) DOES NOT APPLY TO THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG AT ISSUE.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In arguing that the claim for Marinol is time-barred under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), the employer notes that the claimant last received \u201ccompensation\u201d in November of 2005, when the maximum period for receiving compensation expired. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-518 (generally providing that \u201c[t]he total compensation payable under this title shall in no case be greater than 500 weeks\u201d). The claimant made a request for medical reimbursement on November 14, 2008. The employer contends that this claim was made more than 24 months after she received compensation and, therefore, was beyond the time limit established in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Provided that a change-in-condition claim is timely filed, the commission is authorized under Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) to \u201creview any award and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this title.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The employer focuses on the language \u201cany award.\u201d Under the construction of this statute advanced by the employer, the commission can review \u201cany award\u201d provided that the application for a change in condition is filed within 24 months after compensation was last received. The difficulty with this argument is that it focuses on two words\u2014\u201cany award\u201d\u2014while ignoring the entire thrust of the provision. The phrase \u201cany award\u201d is tethered to the next clause, which specifies that the commission, upon reviewing any award, may make an award \u201cending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). In other words, the statute of limitations applies to an application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>a change in condition that seeks \u201ccompensation.\u201d If the claim is not for compensation, the time bar found in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">The term \u201ccompensation\u201d in this setting does not encompass medical benefits. <em>See Uninsured, Emplrs. Fund v. Wilson, </em>46 Va.App. 500, 503-05, 619 S.E.2d 476, 478-79 (2005) (\u201c[T]he \u2018conventional meaning\u2019 of compensation includes only \u201cwage loss compensation, also commonly known as \u201cindemnity payments.\u2019 \u201d ... That definition would necessarily exclude medical benefits, which usually involve payments to third-party medical providers.\u201d). Indeed, the employer does not contend that a claim for medical benefits constitutes \u201ccompensation.\u201d Because the claim for a prescription drug at issue here does not constitute a claim for \u201ccompensation,\u201d the time bar in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) does not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that, unlike compensation, which is payable for a maximum duration of 500 weeks under Code \u00a7 65.2-518, Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1) requires an employer, \u201c[a]s long as necessary after an accident\u201d to \u201cfurnish or cause to be furnished ... a physician ... and such other necessary medical attention.\u201d These medical benefits can last for a lifetime. Reading Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) in the way the employer argues would create a conflict between the limitations period found in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) and the medical benefits provision found in Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1). \u201cProper construction seeks to harmonize the provisions of a statute both internally and in relation to other statutes.\u201d <em>Hulcher v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 601, 605, 575 S.E.2d 579, 581 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Read in its entirety, and in the broader context of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the statute of limitations in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), which governs changes in condition, bars claims for compensation rather than for medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">II. Prior precedent does not compel a reading of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) that would bar the claimant\u2019s prescription for Marinol.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The employer\u2019s chief argument is not one of statutory construction. Instead, the employer principally contends that our decision in <em>Berglund, </em>43 Va.App. 742, 601 S.E.2d 693, requires this Court to affirm the decision of the commission. We disagree with the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The \u201cdoctrine [of <em>stare decisis </em>] plays a significant role in the orderly administration of justice by assuring consistent, predictable, and balanced application of legal principles.\u201d <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Dean, </em>233 Va. 260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987). As the employer notes, <em>stare decisis </em>\u201capplies not merely to the literal holding of the case, but also to its <em>ratio </em>decidendi\u2014the essential rationale in the case that determines the judgment.\u201d <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 73-74, 577 S.E.2d 538, 540 (2003). \u201cIn other words, \u2018it is not only the result but also those portions of the opinion necessary to that result by which we are bound.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newman v. Newman, </em>42 Va.App. 557, 566 n. 1, 593 S.E.2d 533, 538 n. 1 (2004) (quoting <em>Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, </em>517 U.S. 44, 67, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 1129, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996)). <em>It Berglund </em>is in fact controlling, under the interpanel accord doctrine, the \u201cdecision of one panel \u2018becomes a predicate for application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis\u2019 </em>and cannot be overruled except by the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Virginia Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>40 Va.App. at 73, 577 S.E.2d at 540 (quoting <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 425, 430, 478 S.E.2d 539, 541 (1996)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>The phrase <em>ratio decidendi, </em>Latin for \u201cthe reason for the decision,\u201d means \u201cthe principle or rule of law on which a court\u2019s decision is founded.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1290 (8th ed.2004). The <em>ratio decidendi </em>of an appellate decision is discovered by examining the opinion of the court. The claimant in <em>Berglund </em>suffered a back injury at work. 43 Va.App. at 747, 601 S.E.2d at 695. Soon after the accident, he began to experience a \u201csevere\u201d and \u201csteady constant pain\u201d in his \u201cprivate area.\u201d Several months afterwards, the claimant suffered intermittent episodes of sexual dysfunction. <em>Id. </em>The question before this Court was whether Code \u00a7 65.2-601 barred a claim for a Viagra prescription to treat this sexual dysfunction. The claimant contended before the commission that his sexual dysfunction was a compensable consequence of a workplace injury to his back. <em>Id. </em>at 746-49, 601 S.E.2d at 695-96. The employer defended the claim, in part, by arguing that it was barred by the statute of limitations found in Code \u00a7 65.2-601.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">This Court rejected the employer\u2019s argument, reasoning that Code \u00a7 65.2-601 did not apply. The Court explained that the time bar found in Code \u00a7 65.2-601 applies to new injuries. When an injury arises from a change in condition, rather than a new injury, the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) are applicable. <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that the claimant\u2019s sexual dysfunction constituted \u201ca change in condition, not a new and separate injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754, 601 S.E.2d at 699. Therefore, the longer statute of limitations found in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) applied. The Court ultimately held that because the claimant had filed his claim while under an open award of temporary total disability benefits, the claimant \u201cacted before the time limitation outlined in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) even began to run.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The <em>ratio decidendi </em>of <em>Berglund </em>turns on the Court\u2019s rejection of the applicability of Code \u00a7 65.2-601 to a discrete set of facts. The <em>Berglund </em>Court did not make any broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>pronouncement about the effect of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) on a claim for medical benefits. Indeed, it had no occasion to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> True, the decision <em>assumed </em>that a claim for medical benefits fell within the scope of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A), but the Court did not address the issue. A case is not authority for a point that was not actually considered or decided by the Court. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 681, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1718, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (holding that, when a court assumes a legal conclusion without squarely addressing the question, its assumption bears no <em>stare decisis </em>effect). Principles of <em>stare decisis, </em>therefore, do not conflict with the conclusion we reach here: that a claim for a prescription drug used to treat the side effects of prior medications does not constitute \u201ccompensation\u201d and, therefore, does not fall within the time bar of Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Prophet\u2019s claim for Marinol is not time-barred by Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A). That statute bars untimely claims for \u201ccompensation\u201d when a change in circumstance has occurred, and the claim here is for medical benefits, not compensation. We, therefore, reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\">. An \u201caward\u201d is defined by statute as \"the grant or denial of benefits or other relief under this title or any rule adopted pursuant thereto.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">. Even if Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) were ambiguous as to its scope, that would not help the employer. It has long been settled that \u201cthe provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act \u2018should be liberally construed to carry out [its] humane and beneficial purposes.' \u201d <em>Dinwiddie County Sch. Bd. v. Cole, </em>258 Va. 430, 436, 520 S.E.2d 650, 653 (1999) (quoting <em>Baggett Transp. Co. v. Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 637, 248 S.E.2d 819, 822 (1978)). Therefore, \u201cshould doubt remain, [the claimant] is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.'' <em>Id. </em>Under this settled canon of construction, the claimant would still prevail with respect to her claim for medical benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\">. In contrast, unpublished opinions do not constitute binding authority on a subsequent panel. <em>See </em>Rule 5A: 1 (f). Therefore, our decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Tricord Homes, </em>No. 0863-08-2 (Va.Ct.App. Dec. 30, 2008), is not binding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\">. In <em>Berglund, </em>the claimant did not file a brief. The only brief before the Court was the brief for the employer and it simply did not address the question at issue in this case. The briefing in <em>Tricord Homes </em>also was lopsided\u2014no brief was filed on behalf of the claimant. The case at bar thus presents the first opportunity for this Court to squarely address the applicability of the time bar found in Code \u00a7 65.2-708(A) to a claim for medical benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
