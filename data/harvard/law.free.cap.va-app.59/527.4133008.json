He contends the trial court erred by: (1) determining it had the jurisdiction to modify that order; (2) allowing Thelma Ruth Markham Craig, wife, to testify about the terms of the property settlement agreement (PSA), in violation of the parol evidence rule; (3) determining the intent of the parties without first finding ambiguity in the PSA or the QDRO; (4) modifying the PSA and the QDRO despite the clear written intent of the parties expressed in the PSA; and, (5) awarding attorney\u2019s fees to wife. For the reasons stated, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The parties were divorced by final decree entered January 29, 2009, which decree affirmed, ratified, and incorporated the PSA, without being merged into the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The PSA provided, <em>inter alia, </em>for the division of husband\u2019s pension and retirement benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">11. <em>HUSBAND\u2019S Pension and Retirement Benefits: </em>The WIFE shall receive thirty seven and one-half percent (37.5%) of the HUSBAND\u2019S gross monthly annuity with the Civil Service Retirement System (hereinafter \u201cCSRS\u201d). The WIFE shall receive the maximum Former Spouse Survivor Annuity (FSSA) available to her under law with respect to the HUSBAND\u2019S Civil Service Retirement System annuity. HUSBAND affirms that he has designated the WIFE as beneficiary of said FSSA annuity and shall at no time change such designation or take any actions which would reduce the FSSA annuity available to her. Until such time as a court order acceptable for processing has been entered, the HUSBAND shall continue to pay the survivor benefit premium. <em>The order acceptable for processing shall provide that the survivor benefit shall be deducted from the WIFE\u2019S share when she receives her benefits pursuant to that order.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Until such time as the WIFE receives her CSRS benefits directly pursuant to court order, the HUSBAND shall pay to the WIFE directly, as and for a property distribution, the sum of Two Thousand One Hundred and Sixty Three Dollars per month, commencing December 2007, and continuing monthly thereafter, immediately upon the receipt of his CSRS payment. In the event that the HUSBAND receives any cost of living increases subsequent to December 2007, then his direct payment to the WIFE shall be increased by thirty seven and one-half percent (37.5%) of such increase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AfO\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On April 13, 2009, the court entered a QDRO, which essentially tracked the language of the PSA. It stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI4\">B. The Employee assigns to the Former Spouse to be paid directly from the CSRS or OPM<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an annuity that equals a sum which is thirty seven and one half percent (37.5%) of the Employee\u2019s gross retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">Hs H* H\u00ed H* * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">D. The United States Office of Personnel Management is directed to pay the Former Spouse\u2019s share directly to THELMA MARKHAM CRAIG. THELMA MARKHAM CRAIG\u2019s share of employee\u2019s employee annuity will be reduced by the amount of the costs associated with providing the former spouse survivor annuity awarded in the next paragraph. The Former Spouse shall be responsible for all federal, state and local taxes on her share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-8\">E. Under \u00a7 8341(h)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, the Former Spouse is awarded the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity (55%) under the Civil Service Retirement System. <em>The Former Spouse\u2019s share of the employee\u2019s annuity mil be reduced by the amount of the cost associated with former spouse survivor annuity benefit awarded in the previous paragraph. </em>Any cost properly payable by the Former Spouse that is deducted from the Employee\u2019s annuity shall be acknowledged by the Former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Spouse and promptly reimbursed to the Employee by the Former Spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Once the QDRO was processed, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) calculated wife\u2019s share of the annuity, based on its interpretation of its regulations defining \u201cGross Monthly Annuity\u201d (hereinafter GMA).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> OPM initially subtracted the cost of wife\u2019s survivor benefits ($810) from the total amount of the annuity ($8,348). It then multiplied that amount by 0.375 (wife\u2019s percentage share). From that amount, $2,826.75, OPM deducted another $810 from wife\u2019s share, arriving at a monthly annuity of $2,016.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">On November 4, 2010, wife filed a motion for entry of court order acceptable for processing and for reimbursement of unpaid benefits, praying that the annuity paid to her by OPM reflect the parties\u2019 agreement. Husband responded by contending the trial court lacked jurisdiction under Rule 1:1 and Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) to enter an order inconsistent with the express terms of the original decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">At the hearing on wife\u2019s motion, wife testified that, under the PSA, she would receive 37.5% of husband\u2019s annuity before any deduction for the survivor costs. Husband did not object to that testimony. Wife then testified that the survivor benefit was to be deducted from her share. Husband objected, based on the parol evidence rule, that wife cannot vary the terms of the PSA unless there is ambiguity. Wife replied that she was simply reciting the language of the PSA. The trial court overruled the objection, finding wife was not attempting to explain the PSA, or the negotiations that led to the agreement, but merely stating what the agreement provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Pam Squires testified as an expert in the interpretation of OPM documents. Squires testified that OPM had interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>the term \u201cGMA\u201d according to their regulations, rather than by the conventional definition of the term. Under those regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> GMA is the monthly annuity after reduction for the survivor annuity. As such, a reduction occurs prior to applying the former spouse\u2019s percentage. After the percentage is applied, OPM deducts an additional $810 for the cost of the survivor annuity. Under OPM\u2019s formula, wife would pay 137.5% of the cost of the survivor annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">During oral argument, both parties agreed there is no ambiguity in the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The trial court stated that it was not modifying the divorce decree, but was enforcing the decree and the intent of the parties. The trial court found the intent of the parties was to apply the 37.5% wife\u2019s share to the total annuity of $8,348 and, from that amount, to subtract the $810 survivor annuity cost to arrive at wife\u2019s share of $2,320.50 per month. The court rejected husband\u2019s argument that the parties intended for wife to pay the $810 twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Further, the trial court awarded wife attorney\u2019s fees, based on the \u201cCosts of Enforcement\u201d provision of the PSA, which allows for such fees in the enforcement of the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">JURISDICTION AND INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\">Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s determination of the intent of the parties. Husband also contends the trial court erred in ruling it had jurisdiction to amend the QDRO, because more than twenty-one days had elapsed since the entry of the final decree of divorce. <em>See </em>Rule 1:1. Further, appellant argues the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4), which allow the court to modify a pension order \u201cso as to effectuate the expressed intent of the order,\u201d is not applicable in this case. He reasons that because the terms of the PSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>clearly set forth the expressed intent of the parties, there is no need to modify the QDRO and thus Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">We must first resolve whether the trial court erred in its determination of the parties\u2019 intent before we can resolve whether Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Intent is a question to be determined by the fact finder. <em>Cirrito v. Cirrito, </em>44 Va.App. 287, 305, 605 S.E.2d 268, 276 (2004) (citing <em>Fleming v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 349, 353, 412 S.E.2d 180, 183 (1991)). While both parties concur that the PSA is unambiguous in its terms relating to the division of the pension, our inquiry does not end there.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The PSA stated that the survivor benefit shall be deducted from wife\u2019s share. The question before us is whether OPM\u2019s interpretation of that language is consistent with the expressed intent of the parties. If that interpretation is incorrect, then the trial court was correct in modifying the QDRO under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">\u201cIn Virginia[,] property settlement agreements are contracts and subject to the same rules ... of interpretation as other contracts.\u201d <em>Smith v. Smith, </em>3 Va.App. 510, 513, 351 S.E.2d 593, 595 (1986) (citing <em>Tiffany v. Tiffany, </em>1 Va.App. 11, 15, 332 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1985)). As such,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">\u201cit is the function of the court to construe the contract made by the parties, not to make a contract for them. The question for the court is what did the parties agree to as evidenced by their contract. The guiding light in the construction of a contract is the intention of the parties as expressed by them in the words they have used, and courts are bound to say that the parties intended what the written instrument plainly declares.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-10\"><em>Irwin v. Irwin, </em>47 Va.App. 287, 293, 623 S.E.2d 438, 441 (2005) (quoting <em>Wilson v. Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 187, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Furthermore, on appeal, our standard of review for property settlement agreements is the same as for other contracts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">In construing the terms of a property settlement agreement, just as in construing the terms of any contract, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s conclusions as to the construction of the disputed provisions. If all the evidence which is necessary to construe a contract was presented to the trial court and is before the reviewing court, the meaning and effect of the contract is a question of law which can readily be ascertained by this court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\"><em>Bergman v. Bergman, </em>25 Va.App. 204, 211-12, 487 S.E.2d 264, 268 (1997) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">If the terms of the agreement are unambiguous, their meaning and effect are questions of law. Ordinary words are given their ordinary meaning when constructing the contract. <em>Tiffany, </em>1 Va.App. at 15, 332 S.E.2d at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\"><em>Recker v. Recker, </em>48 Va.App. 188, 629 S.E.2d 191 (2006), provides guidance in our analysis. <em>Recker </em>involved very similar facts and issues to those before us in this appeal. The issue in <em>Recker </em>was whether the term \u201cgross retirement annuity benefits,\u201d as used in the consent decree, incorporated the definition assigned to the term \u201cgross annuity\u201d by CSRS regulations. The effect of the CSRS definition reduced the former spouse\u2019s benefits. In affirming the trial court\u2019s findings, we stated, \u201cthe decree relied on \u2018conventional definitions\u2019 and the definition of \u2018gross annuity\u2019 urged by the husband is not a conventional definition. The ordinary meaning of \u2018gross\u2019 is \u2018an overall total exclusive of deductions.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1002 (1993).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 629 S.E.2d at 193-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">We concluded that the parties intended for the term to carry its ordinary meaning, rather than the specific CSRS definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">Nothing suggested that the decree was using its term in the unusual sense it carries in the civil service regulations. The term \u201cgross\u201d as used in context with the decree carried its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ordinary and conventional meaning: before or without deductions. The decree did not intend to give \u201cgross\u201d a meaning exactly the opposite of its ordinary meaning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 198, 629 S.E.2d at 194.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Husband attempts to distinguish <em>Recker, </em>arguing the consent decree in that case did not specifically refer to the CSRS, but only made a general reference to benefits \u201cthrough [husband\u2019s] specific branch of the Federal Government Retirement <em>&amp; </em>Disability System.\u201d Thus, husband concludes the reference to the CSRS in the instant case expressed the parties\u2019 intent to incorporate all regulations and definitions of the CSRS. We find this argument unavailing. The mention of CSRS refers only to the source of the annuity payments. There is no evidence that either party was aware of the CSRS\u2019s rules, regulations, or definitions, nor intended to incorporate them by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The PSA clearly stated \u201cthe survivor benefit shall be deducted from the wife\u2019s share....\u201d In order to accept husband\u2019s position, we must conclude that wife agreed to have the survivor annuity costs ($810) deducted twice from her share. That, we cannot do. Rather, we must accept the plain language of the PSA, as did the trial court. Wife testified husband paid her $2,318.50 per month prior to her receiving benefits from CSRS. This sum reflects, within two dollars, the amount that should have been paid to wife had the $810 only been deducted from the wife\u2019s share.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">We conclude, based on the clear language of the PSA, that the parties intended that the costs of the survivor annuity should be deducted only once, and only after multiplying the entire monthly annuity by 0.375. The result of this calculation is wife\u2019s share. The $810 would then be deducted from wife\u2019s share.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">We find that the trial court did not err in concluding that wife should receive the 37.5%, thereafter deducting the costs of the survivor annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>A question regarding jurisdiction is a matter of law. \u201cWe review the trial court\u2019s statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Navas v. Navas, </em>43 Va.App. 484, 487, 599 S.E.2d 479, 480 (2004) (citing <em>Sink v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 655, 658, 507 S.E.2d 670, 671 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Our jurisdictional inquiry is whether Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4) applies in this case. We hold that it does, because the QDRO was modified in order to \u201cconform its terms so as to effectuate the expressed intent of the order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Any \u201c[s]uch modification, however, must be \u2018consistent with the substantive provisions of the original decree\u2019 and not \u2018simply to adjust its terms in light of the parties\u2019 changed circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>32 Va.App. 72, 75, 526 S.E.2d 301, 303 (2000) (quoting <em>Caudle v. Caudle, </em>18 Va.App. 795, 798, 447 S.E.2d 247, 249 (1994)); <em>see also Newsome v. Newsome, </em>18 Va.App. 22, 26, 441 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">The purpose of the legislative enactment of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(E)(4) was \u201cto protect the interests of pension recipients from the unintended consequences of improperly or incomplete drafted pension orders....\u201d Report of the Family Law Section of the Virginia State Bar on Equitable Distribution of Property in Divorce Proceedings, House Document No. 19, at 15-16 (1991). The statutory reservation permits \u201cthe court to revise its orders to comply with language required by federal law to effectuate the intended pension award, but not to substantively change the pension award itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The House document recognized that \u201cthe integrity and enforceability of such pension division orders, and the receipt by the spouse of such award in the future, relies on the present proper drafting of such orders in order to comply with applicable federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reservation of jurisdiction is necessary for \u201cthe future performance of such orders, and the receipt by spouse of [his or her] expected pension awards....\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-9\"><em>Irwin, </em>47 Va.App. at 297 n. 8, 623 S.E.2d at 443 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Because we have determined that the OPM\u2019s definition of \u201cGMA\u201d does not reflect the expressed intent of the parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>the trial court properly modified the QDRO to \u201cconfirm [sic] its terms so as to effectuate the expressed intent of the order.\u201d The OPM\u2019s calculation did not comply with the intent of the parties in their agreement. Thus, the trial court had jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 20-107.3(K)(4) to modify the order, and, as such, Rule 1:1 did not apply. The trial court did not err in modifying the QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Appellant further contends the trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to wife, which is contrary to the express language of the property settlement agreement. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The PSA provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">24. <em>Costs of Enforcement: </em>The parties agree that any costs, including but not limited to counsel fees, court costs, investigation fees and travel expenses, incurred by a party in the successful enforcement of any of the agreements, covenants, provisions of this agreement, whether through litigation or other action necessary to compel compliance herewith shall be borne by the defaulting party. Any such costs incurred by a party in the successful defense to any action for enforcement of any of the agreements, covenants or provisions of this agreement shall be borne by the party seeking to enforce compliance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">In applying those provisions, the trial court found that wife\u2019s motion to modify the QDRO was an action to enforce the parties\u2019 intent as established in both the PSA and the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">Code \u00a7 20\u2014109(C) bars the trial court from awarding counsel fees except in accordance with the property settlement agreement. <em>See also Rutledge v. Rutledge, </em>45 Va.App. 56, 67, 608 S.E.2d 504, 509 (2005) (\u201cBecause Code \u00a7 20-109(C) restricts the trial judge\u2019s jurisdiction such that he could enter \u2018no decree or order directing the payment of ... counsel fee ... except in accordance with that ... contract,\u2019 we hold that the trial judge did not err in refusing to award to the wife her attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u201cMarital property settlements ... are contracts subject to the rules of construction applicable to contracts generally, including the application of the plain meaning of unambiguous contractual terms.\u201d <em>Pysell v. Keck, </em>263 Va. 457, 460, 559 S.E.2d 677, 678 (2002). According to the rules of construction, \u201ccourts cannot read into contracts language which will add to or take away the meaning of words already contained therein.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Holyfield, </em>227 Va. 184, 187, 313 S.E.2d 396, 398 (1984).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><em>Rutledge, </em>45 Va.App. at 64, 608 S.E.2d at 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The plain terms of paragraph 24 of the PSA state that there are two predicates for an award of attorney\u2019s fees: (1) successful enforcement of the agreement; and (2) a defaulting party. At oral argument, wife contended that appellant was a defaulting party because he did not agree with wife that OPM had used an incorrect calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Paragraph 7 of the PSA obligated husband to \u201ccooperate and take all necessary steps to facilitate the entry of the [QDRO] order.\u201d Nothing in the record suggests he failed to do so. Husband did not violate the terms of the PSA. Although husband did not prevail on appeal, his failure to settle a contested claim is not a default. Husband, in fact, abided by the terms of the original QDRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">\u201c \u2018The noun \u201cdefault\u201d is defined as a \u201cfailure to do something required by duty or law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Stroud v. Stroud, </em>54 Va.App. 231, 239, 677 S.E.2d 629, 632 (2009) (quoting <em>Clevert v. Soden, Inc., </em>241 Va. 108, 111, 400 S.E.2d 181, 183 (1991) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>590 (1986))). Husband\u2019s position was not a failure to perform a legal or contractual duty as set forth in the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Even assuming the trial court correctly characterized the proceeding as one of enforcement, husband was not a defaulting party. It was OPM\u2019s actions, and not husband\u2019s, that prompted the proceeding. Therefore, we conclude the award of attorney\u2019s fees against appellant was contrary to the language of the PSA. The trial court erred in awarding such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>PAROL EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Appellant next argues the trial court erred in allowing wife to testify, contradicting the terms of the unambiguous PSA, and thus violating the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">This argument is premised on the following exchange between wife\u2019s counsel and wife, after wife was given a copy of the PSA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">Q. And what was that agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">A. That I would receive 37-1/2 percent of his annuity before any deduction for the survivor cost.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">Q. And how was the cost of that survivor benefit supposed to be paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\">A. It was supposed to be deducted from my portion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">At that point, appellant objected to that testimony, asserting wife was attempting to vary the terms of the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">In overruling the objection, the trial court found wife was only stating the terms of the agreement, not explaining the negotiations that led to the agreement. \u201cIf the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement are contained in a clear explicit writing, that writing is the sole memorial of the contract and the sole evidence of the agreement. In that event ... parol evidence ... could not be used to explain the written contractual terms.\u201d <em>Cascades North Venture L.P. v.

Robinette, 4 </em>Va.App. 123, 127, 354 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1987) (quoting <em>Amos, </em>228 Va. at 91-92, 320 S.E.2d at 337 (quoting <em>Godwin v. Kerns, </em>178 Va. 447, 451, 17 S.E.2d 410, 412 (1941))).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>However, wife\u2019s testimony did not attempt to, alter the terms of the PSA. On the contrary, the terms of the PSA stated, in relevant part: \u201cThe WIFE shall receive thirty seven and one-half percent (37.5%) of the HUSBAND\u2019S gross monthly annuity with the Civil Service Retirement System.... The order acceptable for processing shall provide that the survivor benefit shall be deducted from the WIFE\u2019S share when she receives her benefits pursuant to that order.\u201d This was precisely what wife testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">As the trial court correctly noted, wife was merely stating the terms of the agreement. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">APPELLATE ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We deny wife\u2019s request for appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Upon reviewing the record and the briefs submitted in this appeal, we conclude that husband\u2019s contentions are not frivolous, and he prevailed in part. <em>See Duva v. Duva, </em>55 Va.App. 286, 303, 685 S.E.2d 842, 851 (2009) (citing <em>Gottlieb v.

We find no error in the trial court\u2019s modification of the QDRO, as it had jurisdiction to do so. We also conclude the trial court correctly allowed wife to testify as to the terms of the PSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed and vacated in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b579-9\">.
