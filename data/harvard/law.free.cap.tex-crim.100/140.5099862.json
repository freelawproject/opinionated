The court in overruling the motion for continuance, and in qualifying the bill, stated \"that prior to and at the time said defendant\u2019s motion for continuance was passed on by the court, said Mr. and Mrs. Ira Ellison were fugitives from justice, charged' with the offenses of liquor violations, they were charged with said offenses by complaint at first and then indicted by the Grand Jury and have never been apprehended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">- The fact that these witnesses were charged with liquor violations would not render their testimony incompetent for the defendant, and had they been charged with the same identical transaction, then under the law, the defendant would have had the right to have presented a motion for severance, and have them tried first and if acquitted use them as witnesses in his behalf. From the bill of exception and the court\u2019s explanation thereof, we are of the opinion that the defendant used due diligence in attempting to procure this testimony which the record shows would have been very material to this defendant on the vital issue in his case, and the court was in error in overruling said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">There is some complaint made to the court\u2019s action in permitting the sheriff to testify as to what the defendant told him about finding whiskey in the tank of water after the sheriff and depuy sheriff had gone to the house and taken the defendant down to the tank for the purpose of searching for the whiskey in question. We think the court was in error in admitting this testimony and under the authorities, that the defendant was then under arrest. Clark v. State, 84 Texas Crim. Rep. 390, 207 S. W. 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">There is also complaint made to the court\u2019s action in refusing to give a charge on circumstantial evidence in this ease. The record discloses that one of the State\u2019s witnesses testified that while he was about two hundred yards away he saw the defendant leave the house with his arm full of fruit jars containing whiskey and take them off about fifty or seventy five yards from the house and throw them in a hole of water, three of them, and then he and the sheriff raked the hole of water and got three fruit jars of whiskey out of it. It was impossible for this witness to know this was whiskey at so great a distance and was assuming same to be whiskey from subsequent results. We are of the opinion that under the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>of this case, the court should have submitted a charge on circumstantial evidence. Rodriguez v. State, (recently decided by this court but yet unpublished.)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">For the errors above discussed, we are of the opinion that the judgment of the lower court should be reversed and remanded, and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
