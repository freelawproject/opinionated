When the case was called for trial in Bosque County appellant interposed a plea to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that he was not present and consenting to the change of venue. In Littleton v. State, 91 Texas Crim. Rep. 206, the matter is discussed at length and authorities collated. Since the early case of Rothschild v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App. 519, it has been the doctrine in this State that it is not necessary that the accused be present when the order for change of venue is made in his case. Orders made by the court relative to change of venue are regarded as being preliminary to the trial and n\u00f3t a part of the trial itself. The matter of making an order so changing the venue of the court\u2019s own motion is addressed almost entirely to his discretion and may be made whether the accused consents or not. Appellant cites Butler v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep. 560, and Harris v. State, 150 S. W. Rep. 447. These cases are discussed by this court in the comparatively recent case of Haley v. State, 88 Texas Crim. Rep. 649, and in so far as they conflicted with that .opinion, were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">We regret that we cannot agree with appellant in his contention that the evidence does not support the verdict. Appellant\u2019s first bill of exceptions complains of the overruling of his plea to the jurisdiction, and the remaining bill appears to be taken to a large part of the argument of the State\u2019s attorney, much of which must necessarily have been germane and cannot be considered by us as prejudicial without some.showing other than as appears in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">No error appearing, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b630-9\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b630-10\">LATTIMORE, Judge. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A3I\">Appellant renews his complaint of the change of venue and his insistence that he was not present when the venue was changed. The matter was disposed of us by us in our former opinion upon the proposition that this was not a complaint available. We cited authority. Our attention is now called to a fact which was not adverted to in former opinion, viz: that the order of the court changing the venue recites the presence of appellant at court at the time. The matter of appellant\u2019s absence seems to have been raised in his motion for new trial. The order of the court overruling said motion recites that \u201cthe court having heard said motion and the evidence thereon submitted, etc., is of ojiinion that same should be overruled.\u201d No evidence having been preserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>by any bill of exceptions and presented to ns, we are compelled to presume the correctness of the court\u2019s action upon the evidence heard. We see no reason to change our conclusion as expressed in the original opinion regarding the sufficiency of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">\n<em>Overruled,</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
