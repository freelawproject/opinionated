The court\u2019s explanation of this bill states that while the witness was on cross examination he was asked, \u201cI understood you to say as far as you could see he did not touch the bundle?\u201d whereupon the witness stepped down off the witness stand and, facing and pointing at the defendant, said, in a loud, angry and excited manner, \u201cIf Mr. Stroehmer don\u2019t stop laughing, I can not go through this investigation with that gentleman sitting there that way. I will not stand for that man sitting there making faces and smiling and giving me the horse laugh. You know I can not stand that and I will not. I ask the court for permission for a little recess until I can straighten out. If the court please, I have had enough trouble in this case and with that man sitting there that way, I can not stand it\u201d, \u2014 and the court instructed the jury not to consider the remarks of the sheriff for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We are in serious doubt as to whether or not the court under such circumstances was able to withdraw from the jury the damaging effect that such conduct was likely to have upon them, and, it being a close question in the case, we are unable to say it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>harmful to the defendant. As it appears from the record, it must have created considerable excitement, and was a direct statement to the jury that the defendant was anything else but the kind of a man that he ought to be and that he had given the sheriff quite a lot of trouble. \"We are of the opinion that this bill discloses a state of facts that will require a reversal of the case, although the court instructed the jury not to consider same. Haggard v. State, 269 S. W. 438; Cooper v. State, 72 Texas Crim. Rep. 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In bills of exception 10, 11 and 12 appellant complains of the action of the district attorney in his closing argument to the jury. These, and other matters raised in the other bills of exception are not likely to occur upon another trial, and from the disposition made of this case it is necessary for us to pass upon same at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We are of the opinion that this case should be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, for the reasons stated, and the same is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved -by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
