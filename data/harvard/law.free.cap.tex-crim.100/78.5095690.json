The Statements of Pacts on motion for new trial on this point discloses that after the jury had voted that the defendant was guilty and before reaching a verdict in the case they were divided on whether or not they would suspend his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>sentence, and, while so divided, the failure of the defendant to testify was discussed in the jury room. All of the jurors testified, and no one denied that same was discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-3\">Such arguments and statements as above recited are bound to-have been harmful to the defendant, although the jury stated that it did not influence them in finding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">In Branch\u2019s Annotated Penal Code, Sec. 596., it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201cWhere the jury not only refers to the failure to the defendant to testify but state that,he ought to have gone on the stand to explain certain matters, it is more than a mere allusion to his failure to testify\u2019\u2019 \u2014 citing Rogers v.

For a collation of authorities on said statute above mentioned, we cite Sec. 569, Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The State\u2019s Attorney with this court has filed a brief in this case confessing error, and we are of the opinion that his conclusions are correct in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">For the reasons above stated, we are of the opinion that the trial court erred in overruling the motion for new trial, and we therefore reverse and remand this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
