She is amply corroborated by both medical and non-expert testimony. Under cross-examination by appellant\u2019s counsel the witness' testified to various acts of intercourse between her and appellant. The State also introduced appellant\u2019s confession, in which he admits his illicit relations with prosecutrix twice on Sunday, September 17, 1922. On the trial appellant denied his guilt and by his own testimony and that of his witnesses sought to prove an alibi for Sunday, September 17, 1922; but it seems that his-alibi testimony was hardly sufficient to cover the other acts to which the prosecutrix testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Appellant\u2019s counsel and the trial court have placed in this record certain matters concerning certain bills of exceptions to which we shall but briefly advert. Bills of exceptions 2 and 3 complain of certain remarks alleged to have been made by the prosecuting attorney in the closing argument. These bills were not approved, but, instead, the trial court files a paper which is designated in the record \" Instructions of the Court\u201d and which covers four full pages of the transcript, in' which he gives his reasons for not approving said bills. Appellant\u2019s counsel counters with some six affidavits, in which he attempts to show that the matters contained in said hills are fairly stated therein. We find it unnecessary to arbitrate this dispute. In view of the fact that appellant\u2019s guilt seems abundantly proved if the State\u2019s testimony is believed and of the further fact that the jury gave him the minimum penalty in a case where at least some circumstances of aggravation are rather cogently shown, it is our opinion that if the language attributed to State\u2019s counsel was actually used same did not harm the appellant; hence the \u2022 assignment complaining of this matter is overruled. Patterson v. State, 87 Texas Crim. Rep. 95; Wright v. State, 60 Texas Crim. Rep. 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">Bill No. 1 complains of the action of the court in permitting the witness Doctor Rhodes to testify as to a physical examination made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>of defendant in jail. The bill shows that the District Attorney\u2019s office.sent for the witness, but it further shows that defendant did not object to the examination. Under these conditions we cannot say that the bill shows error.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\">The above disposes of appellant\u2019s contentions as disclosed by the record, and, finding nothing therein showing reversible error, it is our opinion that the judgment should be affirmed, and ic is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
