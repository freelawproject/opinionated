The record discloses that the statment of facts is largely made up of questions and answers, and statements of the court and attorneys interested in the trial of the case. Art. 846, Vernon\u2019s C. C. P. requires statement of facts to be in narrative form and this court has repeatedly held that under. said article it is not authorized to consider a statement of facts in question and answer form. Jacobs v. State, 92 Tex. Cr. Rep. 253, 242 S. W. 232; James v. State, 262 S. W. 500. We are therefore of the opinion that the motion should be granted, and the statement of facts stricken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">After -the elimination of the statement of facts in this case, there appear to be no other errors of record which would authorize this court to reverse the judgment of the trial court.
