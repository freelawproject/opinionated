After hearing the evidence the jury fixed his punishment at one year in the penitentiary but failed to suspend the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">By the terms of Sec. 2d, Chap. 61, 1st Called Session 37th Legislature, the benefit of suspended sentence is denied a person over twenty-five years convicted of the offense for which defendant was being 'tried. Exception was taken to the charge upon the issue of suspended sentence. We do not discuss the point for the reason that defendant was not entitled to have that issue submitted at all. The offense was alleged to have occurred in December 1923, but the case was not tried until March 14, 1924. The evidence shows defendant was born September 26, 1898, _ making him five months and eighteen days over twenty-five years of age at the time of trial. Age at time of trial controls and not at the time the offense was committed or indictment returned. Kitchen v. State, 267 S.

If there be a question about it, the court below was right in submitting the issue of suspended sentence. He instructed the jury if they found that defendant was not over twenty-five years of age, they might recommend that his sentence be suspended. The charge was excepted to upon the ground that it did not advise the jury as to the quantum of proof necessary relative to defendant\u2019s age. and that by the charge given the jury might be misled to think it was . necessary to show his age \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d. We think it was not at all likely the jury was confused about the matter. The term \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d was nowhere used in the court\u2019s charge, it relating to the plea, of guilty, and the jury would not be apt to interpolate into the charge an expression omitted therefrom by the learned trial judge. For this reason we think defendant\u2019s contention not sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
