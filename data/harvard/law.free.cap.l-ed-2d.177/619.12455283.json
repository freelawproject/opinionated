We consider in this opinion two questions arising from the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron executive, for crimes committed before the corporation\u2019s collapse. First, did pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial? Second, did the jury improperly convict Skill-ing of conspiracy to commit \u201chonest-services\u201d wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 1343, 1346?</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">Answering no to both questions, the Fifth Circuit affirmed Skilling\u2019s convictions. We conclude, in common with the Court of Appeals, that Skill-ing\u2019s fair-trial argument fails;</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">[561 U.S. 368]</p>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Skill-ing, we hold, did not establish that a presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him. But we disagree with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s honest-services ruling.  In proscribing fraudulent deprivations of \u201cthe intangible right of honest services,\u201d \u00a7 1346, Congress intended at least to reach schemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks. Construing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that core meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness shoal. We therefore hold that \u00a7 1346 covers only bribery and kickback schemes. Because Skilling\u2019s alleged misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within \u00a7 1346\u2019s proscription. We therefore affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in Houston, Texas, into one of the world\u2019s leading energy companies. Skilling launched his career there in 1990 when Kenneth Lay, the company\u2019s founder, hired him to head an Enron subsidiary. Skilling steadily rose through the corporation\u2019s ranks, serving as president and chief operating officer, and then, beginning in February 2001, as chief executive officer. Six months later, on August 14, 2001, Skilling resigned from Enron.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">Less than four months after Skill-ing\u2019s departure, Enron spiraled into bankruptcy. The company\u2019s stock, which had traded at $90 per share in August 2000, plummeted to pennies per share in late 2001. Attempting to comprehend what caused the corporation\u2019s collapse, the U. S. Department of Justice formed an Enron Task Force, comprising prosecutors and Federal Bureau of Investigation agents from around the Nation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The Government\u2019s investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron\u2019s short-run stock prices by overstating the company\u2019s financial well-being. In the years following Enron\u2019s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the scheme. In time, the Government worked its way up</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">[561 U.S. 369]</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">the corporation\u2019s chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand jury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron\u2019s former chief accounting officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">These three defendants, the indictment alleged,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">\u201cengaged in a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the investing public, including Enron\u2019s shareholders, . . . about the true performance of Enron\u2019s businesses by: (a) manipulating Enron\u2019s publicly reported financial results; and (b) making public statements and representations about Enron\u2019s financial performance and results that were false and misleading.\u201d App. \u00b65, p. 277a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Skilling and his co-conspirators, the indictment continued, \u201cenriched themselves as a result of the scheme through salary, bonuses, grants of stock and stock options, other profits, and prestige.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b614, at 280a.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Count 1 of the indictment charged Skilling with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud; in particular, it alleged that Skilling had sought to \u201cdepriv[e] Enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of [his] honest services.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b687, at 318a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment further charged Skill-ing with more than 25 substantive counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, making false representations to Enron\u2019s auditors, and insider trading.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">In November 2004, Skilling moved to transfer the trial to another venue; he contended that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pretrial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors. To support this assertion, Skilling, aided by media experts, submitted hundreds of news reports detailing Enron\u2019s downfall; he also presented affidavits from</p>\n<p id=\"AGniA\">[561 U.S. 370]</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">the experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential venues.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">The U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denied the venue-transfer motion. Despite \u201cisolated incidents of intemperate commentary,\u201d the court observed, media coverage \u201cha[d] [mostly] been objective and unemotional,\u201d and the facts of the case were \u201cneither heinous nor sensational.\u201d App. to Brief for United States 10a-11a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, \u201ccourts ha[d] commonly\u201d favored \u201cef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>fective voir dire ... to ferret out any [juror] bias.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 18a. Pretrial publicity about the case, the court concluded, did not warrant a presumption that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston. <em>Id., </em>at 22a.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">In the months leading up to the trial, the District Court solicited from the parties questions the court might use to screen prospective jurors. Unable to agree on a questionnaire\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"a3q-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 371]</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">format and content, Skilling and the Government submitted dueling documents. On venire members\u2019 sources of Enron-related news, for example, the Government proposed that they tick boxes from a checklist of generic labels such as \u201ctelevision,\u201d \u201c[newspaper,\u201d and \u201c[r]adio,\u201d Record 8415; Skill-ing proposed more probing questions asking venire members to list the specific names of their media sources and to report on \u201cwhat st[ood] out in [their] mind[s]\u201d of \u201call the things [they] ha[d] seen, heard or read about Enron,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 8404-8405.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The District Court rejected the Government\u2019s sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling\u2019s submission. Skilling\u2019s questions \u201c[we]re more helpful,\u201d the court said, \u201cbecause [they] [we]re generally . . . open-ended and w[ould] allow the potential jurors to give us more meaningful information.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 9539. The court converted Skilling\u2019s submission, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document that asked prospective jurors about, <em>inter alia, </em>their sources of news and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company and to anyone affected by its demise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">[561 U.S. 372]</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">In November 2005, the District Court mailed the questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from nearly all the addressees. The court granted hardship exemptions to approximately 90 individuals, <em>id., </em>at 11773-11774, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>the parties, with the court\u2019s approval, further winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical disability, <em>id., </em>at 11891, 13594. The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, \u201ceach and every\u201d prospective juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her from impartially considering the evidence at trial. <em>Id., </em>at 13668.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">On December 28, 2005, three weeks before the date scheduled for the commencement of trial, Causey pleaded guilty. Skilling\u2019s attorneys immediately requested a continuance, and the District Court agreed to delay the proceedings until the end of January 2006. <em>Id., </em>at 14277. In the interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey\u2019s guilty plea further tainted the jury pool. If Houston remained the trial venue, Skilling urged that \u201cjurors need to be questioned individually by both the Court <em>and </em>counsel\u201d concerning their opinions of Enron and \u201cpublicity issues.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 12074.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The District Court again declined to move the trial. Skilling, the court concluded, still had not \u201cestablish [ed] that pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d] a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 14115. The questionnaires and <em>voir dire, </em>the court observed, provided</p>\n<p id=\"a8g-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 373]</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury. <em>Id., </em>at 14115-14116.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Denying Skilling\u2019s request for attorney-led <em>voir dire, </em>the court said that in 17 years on the bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">\u201cI\u2019ve found ... I get more forthcoming responses from potential jurors than the lawyers on either side. I don\u2019t know whether people are suspicious of lawyers\u2014but I think if I ask a person a question, I will get a candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the question.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 11805.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask followup questions, <em>ibid., </em>and it agreed that venire members should be examined individually about pretrial publicity, <em>id., </em>at 11051-11053. The court also allotted the defendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than the standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B). <em>Id., </em>at 13673-13675.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\"><em>Voir dire </em>began on January 30, 2006. The District Court first emphasized to the venire the importance of impartiality and explained the presumption of innocence and the Government\u2019s burden of proof. The trial, the court next instructed, was not a forum \u201cto seek vengeance against Enron\u2019s former officers,\u201d or to \u201cprovide remedies for\u201d its victims. App. 823a. \u201cThe bottom line,\u201d the court stressed, \u201cis that we want... jurors who ... will faithfully, conscientiously and impartially serve if selected.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 823a-824a. In response to the court\u2019s query whether any prospective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these instructions, two individuals indicated that they could not be fair; they were therefore excused for cause, <em>id., </em>at 816a, 819a-820a.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">After questioning the venire as a group,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the District Court brought prospective jurors one by one to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>bench</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">[561 U.S. 374]</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">for individual examination. Although the questions varied, the process generally tracked the following format: The court asked about exposure to Enron-related news and the content of any stories that stood out in the prospective juror\u2019s mind. Next, the court homed in on questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias. The court then permitted each side to pose followup questions. Finally, after the venire member stepped away, the court entertained and ruled on challenges for cause. In all, the court granted one of the Government\u2019s for-cause challenges and denied four; it granted three of the defendants\u2019 challenges and denied six. The parties agreed to excuse three additional jurors for cause and one for hardship.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">By the end of the day, the court had qualified 38 prospective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before the jury was sworn in, Skilling objected to the seating of six jurors. He did not contend that they were in fact biased; instead, he urged that he would have used peremptories to exclude them had he not exhausted his supply by striking</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">[561 U.S. 375]</p>\n<p id=\"AE-r\">several venire members after the court refused to excuse them for cause. Supp. App. 3sa-4sa (Sealed).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court overruled this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">After the jurors took their oath, the District Court told them they could not discuss the case with anyone or follow media accounts of the proceedings. \u201c[E]ach of you,\u201d the court explained, \u201cneeds to be absolutely sure that your decisions concerning the facts will be based only on the evidence that you hear and read in this courtroom.\u201d App. 1026a.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Following a four-month trial and nearly five days of deliberation, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts. The District Court sentenced Skilling to 292 months\u2019 imprisonment, 3 years\u2019 supervised release, and $45 million in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">On appeal, Skilling raised a host of challenges to his convictions, including the fair-trial and honest-services arguments he presses here. Regarding the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron\u2019s collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice. 554 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>F.3d 529, 559 (2009).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court also noted potential prejudice stemming from Causey\u2019s guilty plea and from the large number of victims in Houston\u2014from the \u201cthousands of Enron employees</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">[561 U.S. 376]</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">. . . [who] lost their jobs, and . . . saw their 401(k) accounts wiped out,\u201d to Houstonians who suffered spillover economic effects. <em>Id., </em>at 559-560.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The Court of Appeals stated, however, that \u201cthe presumption [of prejudice] is rebuttable,\u201d and it therefore examined the <em>voir dire </em>to determine whether \u201cthe District Court empaneled an impartial jury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 561 (internal quotation marks, italics, and some capitalization omitted). The <em>voir dire </em>was, in the Fifth Circuit\u2019s view, \u201cproper and thorough.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 562. Moreover, the court noted, Skilling had challenged only one seated juror\u2014Juror 11\u2014for cause. Although Juror 11 made some troubling comments about corporate greed, the District Court \u201cobserved [his] demeanor, listened to his answers, and believed he would make the government prove its case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 564. In sum, the Fifth Circuit found that the Government had overcome the presumption of prejudice and that Skilling had not \u201cshow[n] that any juror who actually sat was prejudiced against him.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The Court of Appeals also rejected Skilling\u2019s claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit honest-services fraud. \u201c[T]he jury was entitled to convict Skilling,\u201d the court stated, \u201con these elements\u201d: \u201c(1) a material breach of a fiduciary duty ... (2) that results in a detriment to the employer,\u201d including one occasioned by an employee\u2019s decision to \u201cwithhold material information, i.e., information that he had reason to believe would lead a reasonable employer to change its conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 547. The Fifth Circuit did not address Skilling\u2019s argument that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague. Brief for Defendant-Appellant Skilling in No. 06-20885 (CA5), p. 65, n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Arguing that the Fifth Circuit erred in its consideration of these claims, Skilling sought relief from this Court. We granted certiorari, 558 U.S. 945, 130 S. Ct. 393, 175 L. Ed. 2d 267 (2009), and now affirm in</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">[561 U.S. 377]</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">part, vacate in part, and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We consider first Skilling\u2019s allegation of juror prejudice, and next, his honest-services argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">Pointing to \u201cthe community passion aroused by Enron\u2019s collapse and the vitriolic media treatment\u201d aimed at him, Skilling argues that his trial \u201cnever should have proceeded in Houston.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 20. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>even if it had been possible to select impartial jurors in Houston, \u201c[t]he truncated voir dire . . . did almost nothing to weed out prejudices,\u201d he contends, so \u201c[f]ar from rebutting the presumption of prejudice, the record below affirmatively confirmed it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 21. Skilling\u2019s fair-trial claim thus raises two distinct questions. First, did the District Court err by failing to move the trial to a different venue based on a presumption of prejudice? Second, did actual prejudice contaminate Skilling\u2019s jury?<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The Sixth Amendment secures to criminal defendants the right to trial by an impartial jury. By constitutional design, that trial occurs \u201cin the State where the . . . Crimes . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">[561 U.S. 378]</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">have been committed.\u201d Art. Ill, \u00a7 2, cl. 3. See also Amdt. 6 (right to trial by \u201cjury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed\u201d). The Constitution\u2019s place-of-trial prescriptions, however, do not impede transfer of the proceeding to a different district at the defendant\u2019s request if extraordinary local prejudice will prevent a fair trial\u2014a \u201cbasic requirement of due process,\u201d <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S.

Attorney General of Colo., </em>205 U.S. 454, 462, 27 S. Ct. 556, 51 L. Ed. 879 (1907) (opinion for the Court by Holmes, J.). When does the</p>\n<p id=\"AWlv\">[561 U.S. 379]</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">publicity attending conduct charged as criminal dim prospects that the trier can judge a case, as due process requires, impartially, unswayed by outside influence? Because most cases of consequence garner at least some pretrial publicity, courts have considered this question in diverse settings. We begin our discussion by addressing the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>sumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis in Skilling\u2019s case proceeded. The foundation precedent is <em>Rideau </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Wilbert Rideau robbed a bank in a small Louisiana town, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of them. Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his confession. Without informing Rideau, no less seeking his consent, the police filmed the interrogation. On three separate occasions shortly before the trial, a local television station broadcast the film to audiences ranging from 24,000 to 53,000 individuals. Rideau moved for a change of venue, arguing that he could not receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime occurred, which had a population of approximately 150,000 people. The trial court denied the motion, and a jury eventually convicted Rideau. The Supreme Court of Louisiana upheld the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">We reversed. \u201cWhat the people [in the community] saw on their television sets,\u201d we observed, \u201cwas Rideau, in jail, flanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in detail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and murder.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 725, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663. \u201c[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it,\u201d we explained, the interrogation \u201cin a very real sense <em>was </em>Rideau\u2019s trial\u2014at which he pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 726, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663. We therefore \u201cd[id] not hesitate to hold, without pausing to examine a particularized transcript of the <em>voir dire,\u201d </em>that \u201c[t]he kangaroo court proceedings\u201d trailing the televised confession violated due process. <em>Id., </em>at 726-727, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We followed <em>Rideau\u2019s </em>lead in two later cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution. In <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 538, 85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L.

Ed. 2d 600 (1966), news reporters extensively covered the story of Sam Sheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death. \u201c[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during the trial and newsmen took over practically the entire courtroom,\u201d thrusting jurors \u201cinto the role of celebrities.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 353, 355, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. Pretrial media coverage, which we characterized as \u201cmonths [of] virulent publicity about Sheppard and the murder,\u201d did not alone deny due process, we noted. <em>Id., </em>at 354, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. But Sheppard\u2019s case involved more than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder conviction because a \u201ccarnival atmosphere\u201d pervaded the trial, <em>id., </em>at 358, 86 S.

Ed. 2d 751 (1961) (Jurors are not required to be \u201ctotally ignorant of the facts and issues involved\u201d; \u201cscarcely any of those best qualified to serve as jurors will not have formed some impression or opinion as to the merits of the case.\u201d); <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U.S. 145, 155-156, 25 L.

A presumption of prejudice, our decisions indicate, attends only the extreme case.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Relying on <em>Rideau, Estes, </em>and <em>Sheppard, </em>Skilling asserts that we need not pause to examine the screening questionnaires or the <em>voir dire </em>before declaring his jury\u2019s verdict void. We are not persuaded. Important differences separate</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">[561 U.S. 382]</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Skilling\u2019s prosecution from those in which we have presumed juror prejudice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">First,  we have emphasized in prior decisions the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred. In <em>Rideau, </em>for ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ample, we noted that the murder was committed in a parish of only 150,000 residents. Houston, in contrast, is the fourth most populous city in the Nation: At the time of Skilling\u2019s trial, more than 4.5 million individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the Houston area. App. 627a. Given this large, diverse pool of potential jurors, the suggestion that 12 impartial individuals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain. See <em>Mu\u2019Min </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>500 U.S. 415, 429, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1991) (potential for prejudice mitigated by the size of the \u201cmetropolitan Washington [D. C.] statistical area, which has a population of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed each year\u201d); <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>State Bar of Nev., </em>501 U.S. 1030, 1044, 111 S. Ct. 2720, 115 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1991) (plurality opinion) (reduced likelihood of prejudice where venire was drawn from a pool of over 600,000 individuals).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Second, although news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no confession or other blatantly prejudicial information of the type readers or viewers could not reasonably be expected to shut from sight. Rideau\u2019s dramatically</p>\n<p id=\"AMdM\">[561 U.S. 383]</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">staged admission of guilt, for instance, was likely imprinted indelibly in the mind of anyone who watched it. Cf. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>442 U.S. 62, 72, 99 S. Ct. 2132, 60 L. Ed. 2d 713 (1979) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[T]he defendant\u2019s own confession [is] probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Pretrial publicity about Skilling was less memorable and prejudicial. No evidence of the smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpability. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chagra, </em>669 F.2d 241, 251-252, n. 11 (CA5 1982) (  \u201cA jury may have difficulty in disbelieving or forgetting a defendant\u2019s opinion of his own guilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of others because they may not be well-founded.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, <em>e.g., Rideau, </em>373 U.S., at 724, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663, over four years elapsed between Enron\u2019s bankruptcy and Skilling\u2019s trial. Although reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following Enron\u2019s collapse. See App. 700a; <em>id., </em>at 785a; <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S., at 1032, 1034, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling\u2019s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts. Similarly, earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelming victory for the Government.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Rideau, Estes, </em>and <em>Sheppard, </em>in marked contrast, the jury\u2019s verdict did not undermine in any way the supposition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>juror bias.  It would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors\u2019 actions run counter to that presumption. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Arzola-Amaya, </em>867 F.2d 1504, 1514</p>\n<p id=\"AEUD\">[561 U.S. 384]</p>\n<p id=\"AtLn\">(CA5 1989) (\u201cThe jury\u2019s ability to discern a failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes indicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and reinforces our belief and conclusion that the media coverage did not lead to the deprivation of [the] right to an impartial trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A_lm\">4</p>\n<p id=\"AUtP\">Skilling\u2019s trial, in short, shares little in common with those in which we approved a presumption of juror prejudice. The Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of media attention directed at Enron. But  \u201cpretrial publicity\u2014 even pervasive, adverse publicity\u2014 does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u201d <em>Nebraska Press Assn. </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 554, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 49 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1976). In this case, as just noted, news stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information we have recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston\u2019s size and diversity diluted the media\u2019s impact.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzmB\">Nor did Enron\u2019s \u201csheer number of victims,\u201d 554 F.3d, at 560, trigger a presumption of prejudice. Although the widespread community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors\u2019 connections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and followup <em>voir dire </em>were well suited to that task. And hindsight shows the efficacy of these devices; as we discuss <em>infra, </em>at 389-390, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 648-649, jurors\u2019 links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated.</p>\n<p id=\"Axmn\">Finally, although Causey\u2019s \u201cwell-publicized decision to plead guilty\u201d shortly before trial created a danger of juror</p>\n<p id=\"AtNE\">[561 U.S. 385]</p>\n<p id=\"Aoaz\">prejudice, 554 F.3d, at 559, the District Court took appropriate steps to reduce that risk. The court delayed the proceedings by two weeks, lessening the immediacy of that development. And during <em>voir dire, </em>the court asked about prospective jurors\u2019 exposure to recent publicity, including news regarding Causey. Only two venire members recalled the plea; neither mentioned Causey by name, and neither ultimately served on Skilling\u2019s jury. App. 888a, 993a.  Although publicity about a codefen-dant\u2019s guilty plea calls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does not ordinarily\u2014and, we are satisfied, it did not here\u2014warrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"A40L\">Persuaded that no presumption arose,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we conclude that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Court, in declining to order a venue change, did not exceed constitutional limitations.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We next consider whether actual prejudice infected Skilling\u2019s jury. <em>Voir dire, </em>Skilling asserts, did not adequately detect and defuse juror bias. \u201c[T]he record . . . affirmatively confirm[s]\u201d prejudice, he maintains, because several seated jurors \u201cprejudged his guilt.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 21. We disagree with Skilling\u2019s characterization of the <em>voir dire </em>and the jurors selected through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">[561 U.S. 386]</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">No hard-and-fast formula dictates the necessary depth or breadth of <em>voir dire. See United States </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>299 U.S. 123, 145-146, 57 S. Ct. 177, 81 L. Ed. 78 (1936) (\u201cImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of this mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Constitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is not chained to any ancient and artificial formula.\u201d). Jury selection, we have repeatedly emphasized, is \u201cparticularly within the province of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Ristaino </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 594-595, 96 S. Ct. 1017, 47 L.

Ed. 1033 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">When pretrial publicity is at issue, \u201cprimary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense\u201d because the judge \u201csits in the locale where the publicity is said to have had its effect\u201d and may base her evaluation on her \u201cown perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.\u201d <em>Mu\u2019Min, </em>500 U.S., at 427, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. Appellate courts making after-the-fact assessments of the media\u2019s impact on jurors should be mindful that their judgments lack the on-the-spot comprehension of the situation possessed by trial judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Reviewing courts are properly resistant to second-guessing the trial judge\u2019s estimation of a juror\u2019s impartiality, for that judge\u2019s appraisal is ordinarily influenced by a host of factors impossible to capture fully in the record\u2014among them, the prospective juror\u2019s inflection, sincerity, demeanor, candor, body language, and apprehension of duty. See <em>Reynolds, </em>98 U.S., at 156-157, 25 L. Ed. 244. In contrast to the cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in-the-moment <em>voir dire </em>affords the trial court a more intimate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member\u2019s fitness for jury</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">[561 U.S. 387]</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">service. We consider the adequacy of jury selection in Skilling\u2019s case, therefore, attentive to the respect due to district-court determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>tions of juror impartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that impartiality.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Skilling deems the <em>voir dire </em>insufficient because, he argues, jury selection lasted \u201cjust five hours,\u201d \u201c[m]ost of the court\u2019s questions were conclu-sory[,] high-level, and failed adequately to probe jurors\u2019 true feelings,\u201d and the court \u201cconsistently took prospective jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no matter what other indications of bias were present.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 10-11 (emphasis</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">[561 U.S. 388]</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">deleted). Our review of the record, however, yields a different appraisal.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">As noted, <em>supra, </em>at 370-372, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 637-638, and n. 4, the District Court initially screened ve-nire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling. That survey helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served as a springboard for further questions put to remaining members of the array. <em>Voir dire </em>thus was, in the court\u2019s words, the \u201cculmination of a lengthy process.\u201d App. 841a; see 554 F.3d, at 562, n. 51 (\u201cWe consider the . . . questionnaire in assessing the quality of <em>voir dire </em>as a whole.\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In other Enron-related prosecutions,</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">[561 U.S. 389]</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">we note, District Courts, after inspecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>venire members\u2019 responses to questionnaires, completed the jury-selection process within one day. See <em>supra, </em>at 374, n. 6, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 639.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The District Court conducted <em>voir dire, </em>moreover, aware of the greater-than-normal need, due to pretrial publicity, to ensure against jury bias. At Skilling\u2019s urging, the court examined each prospective juror individually, thus preventing the spread of any prejudicial information to other venire members. See <em>Mu\u2019Min, </em>500 U.S., at 425, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. To encourage candor, the court repeatedly admonished that there were \u201cno right and wrong answers to th[e] questions.\u201d <em>E.g., </em>App. 843a. The court denied Skilling\u2019s request for attorney-led <em>voir dire </em>because, in its experience, potential jurors were \u201cmore forthcoming\u201d when the court, rather than counsel, asked the question. Record 11805. The parties, however, were accorded an opportunity to ask followup questions of every prospective juror brought to the bench for colloquy. Skilling\u2019s counsel declined to ask anything of more than half of the venire members questioned individually, including eight eventually selected for the jury, because, he explained, \u201cthe Court and other counsel have covered\u201d everything he wanted to know. App. 967a.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Inspection of the questionnaires and <em>voir dire </em>of the individuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that, notwithstanding the flaws Skill-ing lists, the selection process successfully secured jurors who were largely untouched by Enron\u2019s collapse.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Eleven of the seated jurors and alternates</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">[561 U.S. 390]</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">reported no connection at all to Enron, while all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial link.

We disagree with that characterization of <em>Irvin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The facts of <em>Irvin </em>are worlds apart from those presented here. Leslie Irvin stood accused of a brutal murder and robbery spree in a small rural community. 366 U.S., at 719, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. In the months before Irvin\u2019s trial, \u201ca barrage\u201d of publicity was \u201cunleashed against him,\u201d including reports of his confessions to the slayings and robberies. <em>Id., </em>at 725-726, 81 S.

This Court\u2019s description of the media coverage in <em>Irvin </em>reveals why the dissent\u2019s \u201cbest case\u201d is not an apt comparison:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">\u201c[S]tories revealed the details of [Irvin\u2019s] background, including a reference to crimes committed when a juvenile, his convictions for arson almost 20 years previously, for burglary and by a court-martial on AWOL charges during the war. He was accused of being a parole violator. The headlines announced his police line-up identification, that he faced a he detector test, had been placed at the scene of the crime and that the six murders were solved but [he] refused to confess. Finally, they announced [Irvin\u2019s] confession to the six murders and the fact of his indictment for four of them in Indiana. They reported [Irvin\u2019s] offer to plead guilty if promised a 99-year sentence, but also the determination, on the other hand, of the prosecutor to secure the death penalty, and that [Irvin] had confessed to 24 burglaries (the <em>modus operandi </em>of these robberies was compared to that of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK6y\">[561 U.S. 393]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">murders and the similarity noted). One story dramatically relayed the promise of a sheriff to devote his life to securing [Irvin\u2019s] execution .... Another characterized [Irvin] as remorseless and without conscience but also as having been found sane by a court-appointed panel of doctors. In many of the stories [Irvin] was described as the \u2018confessed slayer of six,\u2019 a parole violator and fraudulent-check artist. [Irvin\u2019s] court-appointed counsel was quoted as having received \u2018much criticism over being Irvin\u2019s counsel\u2019 and it was pointed out, by way of excusing the attorney, that he would be subject to disbarment should he refuse to represent Irvin. On the day before the trial the newspapers carried the story that Irvin had orally admitted [to] the murder of [one victim] as well as \u2018the robbery-murder of [a second individual] ; the murder of [a third individual], and the slaughter of three members of [a different family].\u201d\u2019 <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">\u201c[Njewspapers in which the[se] stories appeared were delivered regularly to approximately 95% of the dwellings in\u201d the county where the trial occurred, which had a population of only 30,000; \u201cradio and TV stations, which likewise blanketed that county, also carried extensive newscasts covering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>the same incidents.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 725, 81 S.

Ed. 2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Reviewing Irvin\u2019s fair-trial claim, this Court noted that \u201cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice\u201d in the community \u201cwas clearly reflected in the sum total of the <em>voir </em>dire\u201c370 prospective jurors or almost 90% of those examined on the point. .. entertained some opinion as to guilt,\u201d and \u201c[8] out of the 12 [jurors] thought [Irvin] was guilty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 727, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although these jurors declared they could be impartial, we held that, \u201c[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much that [Irvin] be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so huge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one in which two-thirds of</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">[561 U.S. 394]</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">the members admit, before hearing any testimony, to possessing a belief in his guilt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 728, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">In this case, as noted <em>supra, </em>at 382-383, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 644, news stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about Irvin\u2019s rampage of robberies and murders. Of key importance, Houston shares little in common with the rural community in which Irvin\u2019s trial proceeded, and circulation figures for Houston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level recorded in <em>Irvin, </em>see App. to Brief for United States 15a (\u201cThe <em>Houston Chronicle . . </em>. reaches less than one-third of occupied households in Houston.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Skilling\u2019s seated jurors, moreover, exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in <em>Irvin. See supra, </em>at 389-392, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 648-650 (noting, <em>inter alia, </em>that none of Skilling\u2019s jurors answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if they \u201cha[d] an opinion about . . . Skilling\u201d). See also <em>post, </em>at 444, 177 L.

In light of these large differences, the District Court had far less reason than did the trial court in <em>Irvin </em>to discredit jurors\u2019 promises of fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The District Court, moreover, did not simply take venire members who proclaimed their impartiality at their word.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> As noted, all of Skilling\u2019s jurors had already affirmed on their questionnaires that they would have no trouble basing</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">[561 U.S. 395]</p>\n<p id=\"b697-11\">a verdict only on the evidence at trial. Nevertheless, the court followed up with each individually to uncover concealed bias. This face-to-face opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information from the questionnaires regarding jurors\u2019 backgrounds, opinions, and sources of news, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service. See 554 F.3d, at 562 (The District Court made \u201cthorough\u201d credibility determinations that \u201crequired] more than just the [venire members\u2019] statements that [they] could be fair.\u201d). The jury\u2019s not-guilty verdict on nine insider-trading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>counts after nearly five days of deliberation, meanwhile, suggests the court\u2019s assessments were accurate. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haldeman, </em>559 F.2d 31, 60, n. 28 (CADC 1976). Skill-ing, we conclude, failed to show that his <em>voir dire </em>fell short of constitutional requirements.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Skilling also singles out several jurors in particular and contends they were openly biased. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martinez-Salazar, </em>528 U.S. 304, 316, 120 S. Ct. 774, 145 L. Ed. 2d 792 (2000) (  \u201c[T]he seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">[561 U.S. 396]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">require[s] reversal.\u201d). In reviewing claims of this type, the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: \u201cA trial court\u2019s findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.\u201d <em>Mu\u2019Min, </em>500 U.S., at 428, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (internal quotation marks omitted). Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for cause, \u201cstrong evidence that he was convinced the [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to his guilt.\u201d <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>369 U.S. 541, 557-558, 82 S. Ct. 955, 8 L. Ed. 2d 98 (1962). With these considerations in mind, we turn to Skilling\u2019s specific allegations of juror partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Skilling contends that Juror 11\u2014 the only seated juror he challenged for cause\u2014\u201cexpressed the most obvious bias.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35. See also <em>post, </em>at 460-461, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 692 (dissent). Juror 11 stated that \u201cgreed on Enron\u2019s part\u201d triggered the company\u2019s bankruptcy and that corporate executives, driven by avarice, \u201cwalk a line that stretches sometimes the legality of something.\u201d App. 854a-855a. But, as the Fifth Circuit accurately summarized, Juror 11</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">\u201chad \u2018no idea\u2019 whether Skilling had \u2018crossed that line,\u2019 and he \u2018didn\u2019t say that\u2019 every CEO is probably a crook. He also asserted that he could be fair and require the government to prove its case, that he did not believe everything he read in the paper, that he did not \u2018get into the details\u2019 of the Enron coverage, that he did not watch television, and that Enron was \u2018old news.\u2019 \u201d 554 F.3d, at 563-564.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">Despite his criticism of greed, Juror 11 remarked that Skilling \u201cearned [his] salar[y],\u201d App. 857a, and said he would have \u201cno problem\u201d telling his co-worker, who had lost 401(k) funds due to Enron\u2019s collapse, that the jury voted to acquit, if that scenario came to pass, <em>id.., </em>at 854a. The District Court, noting that it had \u201clooked [Juror 11] in the eye and . . . heard all his [answers],\u201d found his assertions of impartiality credible. <em>Id., </em>at 858a; cf. <em>supra, </em>at 394, n. 30, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 651. We agree with the</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">[561 U.S. 397]</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Court of Appeals that \u201c[t]he express finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Juror 11 was fair is not reversible error.\u201d 554 F.3d, at 564.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Skilling also objected at trial to the seating of six specific jurors whom, he said, he would have excluded had he not already exhausted his peremptory challenges. See <em>supra, </em>at 374-375, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 639-640. Juror 20, he observes, \u201csaid she was \u2018angry\u2019 about Enron\u2019s collapse and that she, too, had been \u2018forced to forfeit [her] own 401(k) funds to survive layoffs.\u2019 \u201d Reply Brief 13. But Juror 20 made clear during <em>voir dire </em>that she did not \u201cpersonally blame\u201d Skilling for the loss of her retirement account. App. 875a. Having not \u201cpa[id] much attention\u201d to Enron-related news, she \u201cquite honestly\u201d did not \u201chave enough information to know\u201d whether Skilling was probably guilty, <em>id., </em>at 873a, and she \u201cth [ought] [she] could be\u201d fair and impartial, <em>id., </em>at 875a. In light of these answers, the District Court did not commit manifest error in finding Juror 20 fit for jury service.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The same is true of Juror 63, who, Skilling points out, wrote on her questionnaire \u201cthat [Skilling] \u2018probably knew [he] w[as] breaking the law.\u2019 \u201d Reply Brief 13. During <em>voir dire, </em>however, Juror 63 insisted that she did not \u201creally have an opinion [about Skilling\u2019s guilt] either way,\u201d App. 936a; she did not \u201cknow what [she] was thinking\u201d when she completed the questionnaire, but she \u201cabsolutely\u201d presumed Skilling innocent and confirmed her understanding that the Government would \u201chave to prove\u201d his guilt, <em>id., </em>at 937a. In response to followup questions from Skilling\u2019s counsel, she again stated she would not presume that Skilling violated any laws and could \u201c[a]bsolutely\u201d give her word that she could be fair. <em>Id., </em>at 937a-938a.  \u201cJurors,\u201d we have recognized, \u201ccannot be expected invariably to express themselves carefully or even consistently.\u201d <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S., at 1039, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847. See also <em>id., </em>at 1040, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (\u201cIt is here that the federal [appellate]</p>\n<p id=\"AO5Z\">[561 U.S. 398]</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">court\u2019s deference must operate, for while the cold record arouses some concern, only the trial judge could tell which of these answers was said with the greatest comprehension and certainty.\u201d). From where we sit, we cannot conclude that Juror 63 was biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The four remaining jurors Skilling said he would have excluded with extra peremptory strikes exhibited no sign of prejudice we can discern. See App. 891a-892a (Juror 38) (remembered no media coverage about Enron and said nothing in her experience would prevent her from being fair and impartial); Supp. App. 131sa-133sa, 136sa (Juror 67) (had no connection to Enron and no anger about its collapse); App. 969a (Juror 78) (did not \u201cknow much about\u201d Enron); Supp. App. 165sa; App. 971a (Juror 84) (had not heard or read anything about Enron and said she did not \u201cknow enough to answer\u201d the question whether she was angry about the company\u2019s demise). Skilling\u2019s counsel declined to ask followup questions of any of these jurors and, indeed, told Juror 84 he had nothing to ask because she \u201cgave all the right answers.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 972a. Whatever Skill-ing\u2019s reasons for wanting to strike these four individuals from his jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>he cannot credibly assert they displayed a disqualifying bias.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">In sum, Skilling failed to establish that a presumption of prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.  Jurors, the trial court correctly comprehended, need not enter the box with empty heads in order to determine the facts impartially. \u201cIt is sufficient if the juror[s] can lay aside [their] impression [s] or opinion [s] and render a verdict</p>\n<p id=\"Ayqc\">[561 U.S. 399]</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S., at 723, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. Taking account of the full record, rather than incomplete exchanges selectively culled from it, we find no cause to upset the lower courts\u2019 judgment that Skilling\u2019s jury met that measure. We therefore affirm the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling that Skilling received a fair trial.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">We next consider whether Skilling\u2019s conspiracy conviction was premised on an improper theory of honest-services wire fraud. The honest-services statute, \u00a7 1346, Skilling maintains, is unconstitutionally vague. Alternatively, he contends that his conduct does not fall within the statute\u2019s compass.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">To place Skilling\u2019s constitutional challenge in context, we first review the origin and subsequent application of the honest-services doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the predecessor of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws, proscribed, without further elaboration, use of the mails to advance \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud.\u201d See <em>McNally </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 356, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). In 1909, Congress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today, \u201cany scheme or artifice to defraud, <em>or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or </em>promises.\u201d \u00a7 1341</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">[561 U.S. 400]</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">(emphasis added); see <em>id., </em>at 357-358, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. Emphasizing Congress\u2019 disjunctive phrasing, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted the term \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud\u201d to include deprivations not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-16\">In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangible-rights theory, <em>Shushan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>117 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>F.2d 110 (1941), the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecution of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from entrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial to the bribe payers. \u201cIt is not true that because the [city] was to make and did make a saving by the operations there could not have been an intent to defraud,\u201d the Court of Appeals maintained. <em>Id., </em>at 119. \u201cA scheme to get a public contract on more favorable terms than would likely be got otherwise by bribing a public official,\u201d the court observed, \u201cwould not only be a plan to commit the crime of bribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Shushan </em>stimulated the development of an \u201chonest-services\u201d doctrine. Unlike fraud in which the victim\u2019s loss of money or property supplied the defendant\u2019s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>816 F.2d 94, 101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry. While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been deceived, provided the enrichment. For example, if a city mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract, yet the contract terms were the same as any that could have been negotiated at arm\u2019s length, the city (the betrayed party) would suffer no tangible loss. Cf. <em>McNally, </em>483 U.S., at 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. Even if the scheme occasioned a money or property <em>gain </em>for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, actionable harm lay in the denial of that party\u2019s right to the offender\u2019s \u201chonest services.\u201d See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>536 F.2d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">[561 U.S. 401]</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\u201cMost often these cases ... involved bribery of public officials,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bohonus, </em>628 F.2d 1167, 1171 (CA9 1980), but courts also recognized private-sector honest-services fraud. In perhaps the earliest application of the theory to private actors, a District Court, reviewing a bribery scheme, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-8\">\u201cWhen one tampers with [the employer-employee] relationship for the purpose of causing the employee to breach his duty [to his employer,] he in effect is defrauding the employer of a lawful right. The actual deception that is practised is in the continued representation of the employee to the employer that he is honest and loyal to the employer\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Procter &amp; Gamble Co., </em>47 F. Supp. 676, 678 (Mass. 1942).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">Over time, \u201c[a]n increasing number of courts\u201d recognized that \u201ca recreant employee\u201d\u2014public or private\u2014 \u201cc[ould] be prosecuted under [the mail-fraud statute] if he breache[d] his allegiance to his employer by accepting bribes or kickbacks in the course of his employment,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>McNeive, </em>536 F.2d 1245, 1249 (CA8 1976); by 1982, all Courts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud, Hurson, Limiting the Federal Mail Fraud Statute\u2014A Legislative Approach, 20 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 423, 456 (1983).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In 1987, this Court, in <em>McNally </em>v. <em>United States, </em>stopped the development of the intangible-rights doctrine in its tracks. <em>McNally </em>involved a state officer who, in selecting Kentucky\u2019s insurance agent, arranged to procure a share of the agent\u2019s commissions via kickbacks paid to companies the</p>\n<p id=\"A4b\">[561 U.S. 402]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">official partially controlled. 483 U.S., at 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. The prosecutor did not charge that, \u201cin the absence of the alleged scheme[,] the Commonwealth would have paid a lower premium or secured better insurance.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Instead, the prosecutor maintained that the kickback scheme \u201cdefraud [ed] the citizens and government of Kentucky of their right to have the Commonwealth\u2019s affairs conducted honestly.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 353, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud. \u201cRather than constru[ing] the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials,\u201d we read the statute \u201cas limited in scope to the protection of property rights.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. \u201cIf Congress desires to go further,\u201d we stated, \u201cit must speak more clearly.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Congress responded swiftly. The following year, it enacted a new statute \u201cspecifically to cover one of the \u2018intangible rights\u2019 that lower courts had protected . . . prior to <em>McNally: </em>\u2018the intangible right of honest services.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>United States, </em>531 U.S. 12, 19-20, 121 S. Ct. 365, 148 L. Ed. 2d 221 (2000). In full, the honest-services statute stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">\u201cFor the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the United States Code that prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>mail fraud, \u00a7 1341, and wire fraud, \u00a7 1343], the term \u2018scheme or artifice to defraud\u2019 includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\u201d \u00a7 1346.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">Congress, Skilling charges, reacted quickly but not clearly: He asserts that \u00a7 1346 is unconstitutionally vague.  To satisfy due process, \u201ca penal statute [must] define the criminal offense [1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory</p>\n<p id=\"A7E\">[561 U.S. 403]</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">enforcement.\u201d <em>Kolender </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903 (1983). The void-for-vagueness doctrine embraces these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">According to Skilling, \u00a7 1346 meets neither of the two due process essentials. First, the phrase \u201cthe intangible right of honest services,\u201d he contends, does not adequately define what behavior it bars. Brief for Petitioner 38-39. Second, he alleges, \u00a7 1346\u2019s \u201cstandardless sweep . . . allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal predilections,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitat[ing] opportunistic and arbitrary prosecutions.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 44 (quoting <em>Kolender, </em>461 U.S., at 358, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d 903).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">In urging invalidation of \u00a7 1346, Skilling swims against  our case law\u2019s current, which requires us, if we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>can, to construe, not condemn, Congress\u2019 enactments. See, <em>e.g., Civil Service Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. 548, 571, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 37 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1973). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>National Dairy Products Corp., </em>372 U.S. 29, 32, 83 S. Ct. 594, 9 L. Ed. 2d 561 (1963) (stressing, in response to a vagueness challenge, \u201c[t]he strong presumptive validity that attaches to an Act of Congress\u201d).

See Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for United States 37-38; <em>post, </em>at 416, 422, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 665, 668 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).

In parsing the Courts of Appeals decisions, we acknowledge that Skilling\u2019s vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions preceding <em>McNally </em>were not models of clarity or consistency. See Brief for Petitioner 39-42 (describing divisions of opinions). See also <em>post, </em>at 417-420, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 665-667 (opinion of Scalia, J.). While the honest-services cases preceding <em>McNally </em>dominantly and consistently applied the fraud statute to bribery and kickback schemes\u2014schemes that were the basis of most honest-services prosecutions\u2014there was considerable disarray over the statute\u2019s application to conduct outside that core category. In light of this disarray, Skilling urges us, as he urged the Fifth Circuit, to invalidate the statute <em>in toto. </em>Brief for Petitioner 48 (Section 1346 \u201cis intolerably and unconstitutionally vague.\u201d); Brief Defendant-Appellant Skilling in No. 06-20885 (CA5), p. 65, n. 21 (\u201c[S]ection 1346 should be invalidated as unlawfully vague on its face.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">It has long been our practice, however, before striking a federal statute as impermissibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a limiting construction.

We have rejected an argument of the same tenor before. In <em>Civil Service Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Letter Carriers, </em>federal employees challenged a provision of the Hatch Act that incorporated earlier decisions of the United States Civil Service Commission enforcing a similar law. \u201c[T]he several thousand adjudications of the Civil Service Commission,\u201d the employees maintained, were \u201can impenetrable jungle\u201d\u2014\u201cundiscoverable, inconsistent, [and] incapable of yielding any meaningful rules to govern present or future conduct.\u201d 413 U.S., at 571, 93 S.

Although some applications of the <em>pre-McNally </em>honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the Courts of Appeals, these cases do not cloud the doctrine\u2019s solid core:  The \u201cvast majority\u201d of the honest-services cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Runnels, </em>833 F.2d 1183, 1187 (CA6 1987); see Brief for United States 42, and n. 4 (citing dozens of examples).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Indeed, the <em>McNally </em>case itself, which spurred Congress to enact \u00a7 1346, presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern. 483 U.S., at 352-353,</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">[561 U.S. 408]</p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">360, 107 S.

See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orsburn, </em>525 F.3d 543, 546 (CA7 2008). Both before <em>McNally </em>and after \u00a7 1346\u2019s enactment, Courts of Appeals described schemes involving bribes or kickbacks as \u201ccore . . . honest services fraud precedents,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Czubinski, </em>106 F.3d 1069, 1077 (CA1 1997); \u201cparadigm case[s],\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>deVegter, </em>198 F.3d 1324, 1327-1328 (CA11 1999); \u201c[t]he most obvious form of honest services fraud,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carbo, </em>572 F.3d 112, 115 (CA3 2009); \u201ccore misconduct covered by the statute,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Urciuoli, </em>513 F.3d 290, 294 (CA1 2008); \u201cmost [of the] honest services cases,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sorich, </em>523 F.3d 702, 707 (CA7 2008); \u201ctypical,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>540 F.2d 364, 374 (CA8 1976); \u201cclear-cut,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mandel, </em>591 F.2d 1347, 1363 (CA4 1979); and \u201cuniformly . . . cover[ed],\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paradies, </em>98 F.3d 1266, 1283, n. 30 (CA11 1996).

Reading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct, we acknowledge, would raise the due process concerns underlying the vagueness doctrine.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> To preserve the</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">[561 U.S. 409]</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">statute without transgressing constitutional limitations, we now hold that \u00a7 1346 criminalizes <em>only </em>the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-<em>McNally </em>case law.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">The Government urges us to go <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>further by locating within \u00a7 1346\u2019s compass another category of proscribed conduct: \u201cundisclosed self-dealing by a public official or private <em>employee\u2014i.e., </em>the taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty.\u201d Brief for United States 43-44. \u201c[T]he</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">[561 U.S. 410]</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">theory of liability in <em>McNally </em>itself was nondisclosure of a conflicting financial interest,\u201d the Government observes, and \u201cCongress clearly intended to revive th[at] nondisclosure theory.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 44. Moreover, \u201c[although not as numerous as the bribery and kickback cases,\u201d the Government asserts, \u201cthe <em>pre-McNally </em>cases involving undisclosed self-dealing were abundant.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Neither of these contentions withstands close inspection. <em>McNally, </em>as we have already observed, <em>supra, </em>at 401-402, 407, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 656, 659, involved a classic kickback scheme: A public official, in exchange for routing Kentucky\u2019s insurance business through a middleman company, arranged for that company to share its commissions with entities in which the official held an interest. 483 U.S., at 352-353, 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. This was no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest; rather, the official conspired with a third party so that both would profit from wealth generated by public contracts. See <em>id., </em>at 352-353, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. Reading \u00a7 1346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks\u2014and nothing more\u2014satisfies Congress\u2019 undoubted aim to reverse <em>McNally </em>on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Nor are we persuaded that the pre-<em>McNally </em>conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of the honest-services doctrine. Although the Courts of Appeals upheld honest-services convictions for \u201csome schemes of non-disclosure and concealment of material information,\u201d <em>Mandel, </em>591 F.2d, at 1361, they reached no consensus on which schemes qualified. In light of the relative infrequency of conflict-of-interest prosecutions in comparison to bribery and kickback charges, and the inter-circuit inconsistencies they produced, we conclude that a reasonable limiting construction of \u00a7 1346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar principle that  \u201cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\u201d <em>Cleveland, </em>531 U.S., at 25, 121 S.

Recall that the void-for-vagueness doctrine addresses concerns about (1) fair notice and (2) arbitrary and discriminatory prosecutions. See <em>Kolender, </em>461 U.S., at 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L.

Ct. 576, 95 L. Ed. 774 (1951), and the statute\u2019s <em>mens rea </em>requirement further blunts any notice concern, see, <em>e.g., Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 101-104, 65 S.

The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to defraud Enron\u2019s shareholders by misrepresenting the company\u2019s fiscal health, thereby artificially inflating its stock price. It was the Government\u2019s theory at trial that Skilling \u201cprofited from the fraudulent scheme . . . through the receipt of salary and bonuses, . . . and through the sale of approximately $200 million in Enron stock, which netted him $89 million.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">The Government did not, at any time, allege that Skilling solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations. See Record 41328 (May 11, 2006 Letter from the Government to the District Court) (\u201c[T]he indictment does not allege, and the government\u2019s evidence did not show, that [Skilling] engaged in bribery.\u201d). It is therefore clear that, as we read \u00a7 1346, Skilling did not commit honest-services fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">[561 U.S. 414]</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Because the indictment alleged three objects of the conspiracy\u2014 honest-services wire fraud, money-or-property wire fraud, and securities fraud\u2014Skilling\u2019s conviction is flawed. See <em>Yates </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 77 S. Ct. 1064, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1356 (1957) (  constitutional error occurs when a jury is instructed on alternative theories of guilt and returns a general verdict that may rest on a legally invalid theory). This determination, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy conviction; we recently confirmed, in <em>Hedgpeth </em>v. <em>Pulido, </em>555 U.S. 57, 129 S. Ct. 530, 172 L. Ed. 2d 388 (2008) <em>(per curiam), </em>that errors of the <em>Yates </em>variety are subject to harmless-error analysis. The parties vigorously dispute whether the error was harmless. Compare Brief for United States 52 (\u201c[A]ny juror who voted for conviction based on [the honest-services theory] also would have found [Skilling] guilty of conspiring to commit securities fraud.\u201d) with Reply Brief 30 (The Government \u201ccannot show that the conspiracy conviction rested <em>only </em>on the securities-fraud theory, rather than the distinct, legally-flawed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>honest-services theory.\u201d). We leave this dispute for resolution on remand.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Whether potential reversal on the conspiracy count touches any of Skill-ing\u2019s other convictions is also an open question.

Assuming, as the Fifth Circuit found, that a presumption of prejudice arose in Houston, the question presented in Skilling\u2019s petition for certiorari casts his actual-prejudice argument as an inquiry into when, if ever, that presumption may be rebutted. See Pet. for Cert. i. Although we find a presumption of prejudice unwarranted in this case, we consider the actual-prejudice issue to be fairly subsumed within the question we agreed to decide.

Venue transfer in federal court is governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21, which instructs that a \u201ccourt must transfer the proceeding ... to another district if the court is satisfied that so great a prejudice against the defendant exists in the transferring district that the defendant cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial there.\u2019\u2019 As the language of the Rule suggests, district-court calls on the necessity of transfer are granted a healthy measure of appellate-court respect. See <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Minnesota Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., </em>376 U.S. 240, 245, 84 S. Ct. 769, 11 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1964). Federal courts have invoked the Rule to move certain highly charged cases, for example, the prosecution arising from the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Office Building in Oklahoma City. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>918 F. Supp. 1467, 1474 (WD Okla. 1996). They have also exercised discretion to deny venue-transfer requests in cases involving substantial pretrial publicity and community impact, for example, the prosecutions resulting from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salameh, </em>No. S5 93 Cr. 0180 (KTD) (SDNY, Sept. 15, 1993); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yousef, </em>No. S12 93 Cr. 180 (KTD) (SDNY, July 18, 1997), aff'd 327 F.3d 56, 155 (CA2 2003), and the prosecution of John Walker Lindh, referred to in the press as the American Taliban, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lindh, </em>212 F. Supp. 2d 541, 549-551 (ED Va. 2002). Skilling does not argue, distinct from his due process challenge, that the District Court abused its discretion under Rule 21 by declining to move his trial. We therefore review the District Court\u2019s venue-transfer decision only for compliance with the Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b689-12\">. <em>Murphy </em>involved the robbery prosecution of the notorious Jack Murphy, a convicted murderer who helped mastermind the 1964 heist of the Star of India sapphire from New York\u2019s American Museum of Natural History.

The Government proposes a standard that prohibits the \u2018taking of official action by the employee that furthers his own undisclosed financial interests while purporting to act in the interests of those to whom he owes a fiduciary duty,\u2019\u2019 so long as the employee acts with a specific intent to deceive and the undisclosed conduct could influence the victim to change its behavior. <em>Id., </em>at 43-44. See also <em>id., </em>at 40-41. That formulation, however, leaves many questions unanswered. How direct or significant does the conflicting financial interest have to be? To what extent does the official action have to further that interest in order to amount to fraud? To whom should the disclosure be made, and what information should it convey? These questions and others call for particular care in attempting to formulate an adequate criminal prohibition in this context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b709-12\">. Overlap with other federal statutes does not render \u00a7 1346 superfluous. The principal federal bribery statute, \u00a7 201, for example, generally applies only to federal public officials, so \u00a7 1346\u2019s application to state and local corruption and to private-sector fraud reaches misconduct that might otherwise go unpunished.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b710-18\">. The Fifth Circuit appeared to prejudge this issue, noting that, \u201cif any of the three objects of Skilling\u2019s conspiracy offers a legally insufficient theory,\u2019\u2019 it \u201cmust set aside his conviction.\u2019\u2019 554 F.3d, at 543. That reasoning relied on the mistaken premise that <em>Hedgpeth </em>v. <em>Pulido, </em>555 U.S. 57, 129 S. Ct. 530, 172 L. Ed. 2d 388 (2008) <em>(per curiam), </em>governs only cases on collateral review. See 554 F.3d, at 543, n. 10.  Harmless-error analysis, we clarify, applies equally to cases on direct appeal. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit, on remand, should take a fresh look at the parties\u2019 harmless-error arguments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b710-6\">Justice Scalia,</author>\n<p id=\"AiG7\">with whom Justice Thomas joins, and with whom Justice Kennedy joins except as to Part III, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">I agree with the Court that petitioner Jeffrey Skilling\u2019s challenge to the impartiality of his jury and to the District Court\u2019s conduct of the <em>voir dire </em>fails. I therefore join Parts I and II of the Court\u2019s opinion. I also agree that the decision upholding Skilling\u2019s conviction for so-called \u201chonest-services fraud\u201d must be reversed, but for a different reason. In my view, the specification in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (2006 ed.) that \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud\u201d in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343 (2006 ed., Supp. II), includes \u201ca scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services\u201d is vague, and therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The Court strikes a pose of judicial humility in proclaiming that our task is \u201cnot to destroy the Act . . . but to construe it,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 407, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 659 (internal quotation marks omitted). But in transforming the prohibition of \u201chonest-services fraud\u201d into a prohibition of \u201cbribery and kickbacks\u201d it is wielding a power we long ago abjured: the power to define new federal crimes. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>7 Cranch 32, 34, 3 L. Ed. 259 (1812).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it proscribes, see <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972). A statute that is unconstitutionally vague cannot be saved by a more precise indictment, see <em>Lanzetta </em>v. <em>New</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-16\">[561 U.S. 416]</p>\n<p id=\"b710-17\"><em>Jersey, </em>306 U.S. 451, 453, 59 S. Ct. 618, 83 L. Ed. 888 (1939), nor by judicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its text does not contain, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reese, 92 </em>U.S. 214, 219-221, 23 L. Ed. 563 (1876). Our cases have described <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>vague statutes as failing \u201cto provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or [as being] so standardless that [they] authoriz[e] or encourag[e] seriously discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 304, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008). Here, Skilling argues that \u00a7 1346 fails to provide fair notice and encourages arbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of the right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits. Brief for Petitioner 38-39, 42-44. In my view Skilling is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The Court maintains that \u201cthe intangible right of honest services\u201d means the right not to have one\u2019s fiduciaries accept \u201cbribes or kickbacks.\u201d Its first step in reaching that conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to \u201cthe doctrine developed\u201d in cases decided by lower federal courts prior to our decision in <em>McNally </em>v. <em>United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292 (1987). <em>Ante, </em>at 404, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 657. I do not contest that. I agree that Congress used the novel phrase to adopt the lower-court case law that had been disapproved by McNally\u2014 what the Court calls \u201cthe <em>pre-McNally </em>honest-services doctrine,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 407, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 659. The problem is that that doctrine provides no \u201cascertainable standard of guilt,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>L. Cohen Grocery Co., </em>255 U.S. 81, 89, 41 S. Ct. 298, 65 L. Ed. 516 (1921), and certainly is not limited to \u201cbribes or kickbacks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Investigation into the meaning of \u201cthe <em>pre-McNally </em>honest-services doctrine\u201d might logically begin with <em>McNally </em>itself, which rejected it. That case repudiated the many Court of Appeals holdings that had expanded the meaning of \u201cfraud\u201d in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property. 483 U.S., at 360, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. If the repudiated cases stood for a prohibition of \u201cbribery and kickbacks,\u201d one would have expected those words to appear in the opinion\u2019s description of the cases. In fact,</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">[561 U.S. 417]</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">they do not. <em>Not at all. </em>Nor did <em>McNally </em>even provide a consistent definition of the pre-existing theory of fraud it rejected. It referred variously to a right of citizens \u201cto have the [State]'s affairs conducted honestly,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 353, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292, to \u201chonest and impartial government,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 355, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292, to \u201cgood government,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 356, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292, and \u201cto have public officials perform their duties honestly,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 358, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292. It described prior case law as holding that \u201ca public official owes a fiduciary duty to the public, and misuse of his office for private gain is a fraud,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 355, 107 S. Ct. 2875, 97 L. Ed. 2d 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">But the <em>pre-McNally </em>Court of Appeals opinions were not limited to fraud by public officials. Some courts had held that those fiduciaries subject to the \u201chonest services\u201d obligation included private individuals who merely participated in public decisions, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>790 F.2d 1290, 1295-1296 (CA6 1986) <em>(per curiam) </em>(citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Margiotta, </em>688 F.2d 108, 122 (CA2 1982)), and even private employees who had no role in public decisions, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Lemire, </em>720 F.2d 1327, 1335-1336 (CADC 1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Von Barta, </em>635 F.2d 999, 1007 (CA2 1980). Moreover, \u201cto say that a man is a fiduciary only begins [the] analysis; it gives direction to further inquiry. . . . What obligations does he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>owe as a fiduciary?\u201d <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 85-86, 63 S. Ct. 454, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943). None of the \u201chonest services\u201d cases, neither those pertaining to public officials nor those pertaining to private employees, defined the nature and content of the fiduciary duty central to the \u201cfraud\u201d offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">There was not even universal agreement concerning the <em>source </em>of the fiduciary obligation\u2014whether it must be positive state or federal law, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Rabbitt, </em>583 F.2d 1014, 1026 (CA8 1978), or merely general principles, such as the \u201cobligations of loyalty and fidelity\u201d that inhere in the \u201cemployment relationship,\u201d <em>Lemire, supra, </em>at 1336. The decision <em>McNally </em>reversed had grounded the duty in general (not jurisdiction-specific) trust law, see <em>Gray, supra,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">[561 U.S. 418]</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">at 1294, a <em>corpus juris </em>festooned with various duties. See, <em>e.g., </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7\u00a7 169-185 (1976). Another pre-<em>McNally </em>case referred to the general law of agency, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>663 F.2d 534, 543, n. 22 (CA5 1981), modified on other grounds by 680 F.2d 352 (1982), which imposes duties quite different from those of a trustee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 377-398 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">This indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes that the pre-<em>McNally </em>cases developed a federal, common-law fiduciary duty; the duty remained hopelessly undefined. Some courts described it in astoundingly broad language. <em>Blachly </em>v. <em>United States, </em>380 F.2d 665 (CA5 1967), loftily declared that \u201c[l]aw puts its imprimatur on the accepted moral standards and condemns conduct which fails to match the \u2018reflection of moral uprightness, of fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the general and business life of members of society.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 671 (quoting <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>United States, </em>253 F.2d 104, 109 (CA5 1958)). Other courts unhelpfully added that any scheme \u201ccontrary to public policy\u201d was also condemned by the statute, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bohonus, </em>628 F.2d 1167, 1171 (CA9 1980). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mandel, </em>591 F.2d 1347, 1361 (CA4 1979) (any scheme that is \u201ccontrary to public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of moral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing\u201d). Even opinions that did not indulge in such grandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond loyalty or honesty, see, <em>e.g., Von Barta, supra, </em>at 1005-1006. Moreover, the demands of the duty were said to be greater</p>\n<p id=\"AOHR\">[561 U.S. 419]</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">for public officials than for private employees, see, <em>e.g., Lemire, supra, </em>at 1337, n. 13; <em>Ballard, supra, </em>at 541, n. 17, but in what respects (or by how much) was never made clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">The indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all. Many courts held that some <em>je-ne-sais-quoi </em>beyond a mere breach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish honest-services fraud. See, <em>e.g., Von Barta, supra, </em>at 1006 (collecting cases); <em>United States </em>v. <em>George, </em>477 F.2d 508, 512 (CA7 1973). There was, unsurprisingly, some dispute about that, at least in the context of acts by persons owing duties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the public. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, 788 </em>F.2d 234, 237 (CA4 1986). And even among those courts that did require something additional where a public official was involved, there was disagreement as to what the addition should be. For example, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>522 F.2d 641 (1975), the Seventh Circuit held that material misrepresentations and active concealment were enough, <em>id., </em>at 647-648. But in <em>Rabbitt, </em>583 F.2d 1014, the Eighth Circuit held that actual harm to the State was needed, <em>id., </em>at 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Similar disagreements occurred with respect to private employees. Courts disputed whether the defendant must use his fiduciary position for his own gain. Compare <em>Lemire, supra, </em>at 1335 (yes), with <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bronston, </em>658 F.2d 920, 926 (CA2 1981) (no). One opinion upheld a mail-fraud conviction on the ground that the defendant\u2019s \u201cfailure to disclose his receipt of kickbacks and consulting fees from [his employer\u2019s] suppliers resulted in a breach of his fiduciary duties depriving his employer of his loyal and honest services.\u201d Uni<em>ted States </em>v. <em>Bryza, </em>522 F.2d 414, 422 (CA7 1975). Another opinion, however, demanded more than an intentional failure to disclose: \u201cThere must be a failure to disclose something which in the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an independent business risk to the employer.\u201d <em>Lemire, supra, </em>at 1337. Other courts required that the victim suffer some loss, see, <em>e.g., Ballard, supra, </em>at 541-542\u2014a proposition that, of course, other courts</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">[561 U.S. 420]</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">rejected, see, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>664 F.2d 12, 20 (CA2 1981); <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>535 F.2d 589, 592 (CA10 1976). The Court\u2019s statement today that there was a deprivation of honest services even if \u201cthe scheme occasioned a money or property <em>gain </em>for the betrayed party,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 400, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 655, is therefore true, except to the extent it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">In short, the first step in the Court\u2019s analysis\u2014holding that \u201cthe intangible right of honest services\u201d refers to \u201cthe honest-services doctrine recognized in Courts of Appeals\u2019 decisions before McNally,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 404, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 657\u2014is a step out of the frying pan into the fire. The pre-<em>McNally </em>cases provide no clear indication of what constitutes a denial of the right of honest services. The possibilities range from any action that is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral, to only the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his principal, to only the secret use of a perpetrator\u2019s position of trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to. The duty probably did not have to be rooted in state law, but maybe it did. It might have been more demanding in the case of public officials, but perhaps not. At the time \u00a7 1346 was enacted there was no settled criterion for choosing among these options, for conclusively settling what was in and what was out.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">The Court is aware of all this. It knows that adopting by reference \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number><em>pre-McNally </em>honest-services doctrine,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 407, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 659, is adopting by reference nothing more precise than</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">[561 U.S. 421]</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">the referring term itself (\u201cthe intangible right of honest services\u201d). Hence the <em>deus ex machina: </em>\u201c[W]e pare that body of precedent down to its core,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 404, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 657. Since the honest-services doctrine \u201chad its genesis\u201d in bribery prosecutions, and since several cases and counsel for Skilling referred to bribery and kickback schemes as \u201ccore\u201d or \u201cparadigm\u201d or \u201ctypical\u201d examples, or \u201c[t]he most obvious form,\u201d of honest-services fraud, <em>ante, </em>at 408, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 660 (internal quotation marks omitted), and since two cases and counsel for the Government say that they formed the \u201cvast majority,\u201d or \u201cmost\u201d or at least \u201c [t]he bulk\u201d of honest-services cases, <em>ante, </em>at 407-408, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 659-660 (internal quotation marks omitted), THEREFORE it must be the case that they are <em>all </em>Congress meant by its reference to the honest-services doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Even if that conclusion followed from its premises, it would not suffice to eliminate the vagueness of the statute. It would solve (perhaps) the indeterminacy of what acts constitute a breach of the \u201chonest services\u201d obligation under the <em>pre-McNally </em>law. But it would not solve the most fundamental indeterminacy: the character of the \u201cfiduciary capacity\u201d to which the bribery and kickback restriction applies. Does it apply only to public officials? Or in addition to private individuals who contract with the public? Or to everyone, including the corporate officer here? The pre-<em>McNally </em>case law does not provide an answer. Thus, even with the bribery and kickback limitation the statute does not answer the question, \u201cWhat is the criterion of guilt?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">But that is perhaps beside the point, because it is obvious that mere prohibition of bribery and kickbacks was not the intent of the statute. To say that bribery and kickbacks represented \u201cthe core\u201d of the doctrine, or that most cases applying the doctrine involved those offenses, is not to say that they <em>are </em>the doctrine. All it proves is that the multifarious versions of the doctrine <em>overlap </em>with regard to those offenses. But the doctrine itself is much more. Among all the <em>pre-McNally </em>smorgasbord offerings of varieties of</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">[561 U.S. 422]</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">honest-services fraud, <em>not one </em>is limited to bribery and kickbacks. That is a dish the Court has cooked up all on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-11\">Thus, the Court\u2019s claim to \u201crespec[t] the legislature,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 409, n. 43, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 660-661 (emphasis deleted), is false. It is entirely clear (as the Court and I agree) that Congress meant to reinstate the body of <em>pre-McNally </em>honest-services law; and entirely clear that that prohibited much more (though precisely what more is uncertain) than bribery and kickbacks. Perhaps it is true that \u201cCongress intended \u00a7 1346 to reach <em>at least </em>bribes and kickbacks,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 408, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 660. That simply does not mean, as the Court now holds, that \u201c\u00a7 1346 criminalizes <em>only\u201d </em>bribery and kickbacks, <em>ante, </em>at 409, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Arriving at that conclusion requires not interpretation but invention. The Court replaces a vague criminal standard that Congress adopted with a more narrow one (included within the vague one) that can pass constitutional muster. I know of no precedent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>for such \u201cparing down,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and it seems to me clearly beyond judicial power. This is not, as the Court claims, <em>ante, </em>at 406, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 659, simply a matter of adopting a \u201climiting construction\u201d in the face of potential unconstitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">[561 U.S. 423]</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">To do that, our cases have been careful to note, the narrowing construction must be \u201cfairly possible,\u201d <em>Boos </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>485 U.S. 312, 331, 108 S. Ct. 1157, 99 L. Ed. 2d 333 (1988), \u201creasonable,\u201d <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>California, </em>155 U.S. 648, 657, 15 S. Ct. 207, 39 L. Ed. 297 (1895), or not \u201cplainly contrary to the intent of Congress,\u201d <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. </em>v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council, </em>485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S. Ct. 1392, 99 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1988). As we have seen (and the Court does not contest), <em>no court </em>before <em>McNally </em>concluded that the \u201cdeprivation of honest services\u201d meant <em>only </em>the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks. If it were a \u201cfairly possible\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d construction, not \u201ccontrary to the intent of Congress,\u201d one would think that <em>some </em>court would have adopted it. The Court does not even point to a <em>post-McNally </em>case that reads \u00a7 1346 to cover only bribery and kickbacks, and I am aware of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The canon of constitutional avoidance, on which the Court so heavily relies, see <em>ante, </em>at 405-406, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 658-659, states that \u201cwhen the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the statute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, it is our plain duty to adopt that construction which will save the statute from constitutional infirmity.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Attorney General </em>v. <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co., </em>213 U.S. 366, 407, 29 S. Ct. 527, 53 L. Ed. 836 (1909); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rumely, </em>345 U.S. 41, 45, 73 S. Ct. 543, 97 L. Ed. 770 (1953) (describing the canon as decisive \u201cin the choice of fair alternatives\u201d). Here there is no choice to be made between two \u201cfair alternatives.\u201d Until today, no one has thought (and there is no basis for thinking) that the honest-services statute prohibited only bribery and kickbacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">I certainly agree with the Court that we must, \u201cif we can,\u201d uphold, rather than \u201ccondemn,\u201d Congress\u2019s enactments, <em>ante, </em>at 403, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 656-657. But I do not believe we have the power, in order to uphold an enactment, to rewrite it. Congress enacted the entirety of the pre-<em>McNally </em>honest-services law, the content of which is (to put it mildly) unclear. In prior vagueness cases, we have resisted the temptation to make all things</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">[561 U.S. 424]</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">right with the stroke of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>pen. See, <em>e.g., Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 575, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974). I would show the same restraint today, and reverse Skilling\u2019s conviction on the basis that \u00a7 1346 provides no \u201cascertainable standard\u201d for the conduct it condemns, <em>L. Cohen, </em>255 U.S., at 89, 41 S. Ct. 298, 65 l. Ed. 2d 516. Instead, the Court today adds to our functions the prescription of criminal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">A brief word about the appropriate remedy. As I noted <em>supra, </em>at 416, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 665, Skilling has argued that \u00a7 1346 cannot be constitutionally applied to him because it affords no definition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits. Though this reasoning is categorical, it does not make Skilling\u2019s challenge a \u201cfacial\u201d one, in the sense that it seeks invalidation of the statute in all its applications, as opposed to preventing its enforcement against him. I continue to doubt whether \u201cstriking down\u201d a statute is ever an appropriate exercise of our Article III power. See <em>Chicago </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>527 U.S. 41, 77, 119 S. Ct. 1849, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting). In the present case, the universality of the infirmity Skilling identifies in \u00a7 1346 may mean that if he wins, anyone else prosecuted under the statute will win as well, see <em>Smith, supra, </em>at 576-578, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605. But Skilling only asks that <em>his </em>conviction be reversed, Brief for Petitioner 57-58, so <em>the remedy </em>he seeks is not facial invalidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">I would therefore reverse Skilling\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1346 on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it prohibits. The fate of the statute in future prosecutions\u2014obvious from my reasoning in the case\u2014would be a matter for <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"pASe9\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"31\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAS4AAAAfAQAAAABxah1SAAAAlElEQVR4nGP8z0AE+MtEjCoGhqGgrAFZEJMDVfb/AJIEFg5N3LbAEkkMCweqrBBZKxYOVFnFDyQZLByospjPSDLYOP////////8f+f8IgMn5AzWNSQHZW5gcqLLPyDJYOFBll5DDDwsHKnKEH0kGCweqrIMDSQYLB6rsPCuSDDYOxNv/7JHCAJPzh7ophHHE5VMCAABL5WqLhTQuewAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"302\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">It is hard to imagine a case that more clearly fits the description of what Chief Justice Waite said could not be done, in a colorful passage oft-cited in our vagueness opinions, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>92 U.S., at 221, 23 L.

This is no part of our duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-12\">. The Court is untroubled by these divisions because \u201cthese debates were rare in bribe and kickback cases,\u2019\u2019 in which \u201c[t]he existence of a fiduciary relationship, under any definition of that term, was usually beyond dispute,\u2019\u2019 <em>ante, </em>at 407, n. 41, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 659. This misses the point. The Courts of Appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a bribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary, but they have not consistently described (as the statute does not) any test for who is a fiduciary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-11\">. Courts since \u00a7 1346\u2019s enactment have fared no better, reproducing some of the same disputes that predated <em>McNally. </em>See, <em>e.g., Sorich </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 U.S. 1204, 1206, 129 S. Ct. 1308, 173 L. Ed. 2d 645 (2009) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (collecting cases). We have previously found important to our vagueness analysis \u201cthe conflicting results which have arisen from the painstaking attempts of enlightened judges in seeking to carry out [a] statute in cases brought before them.\u2019\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>L. Cohen Grocery Co., </em>255 U.S. 81, 89, 41 S. Ct. 298, 65 L. Ed. 516 (1921). I am at a loss to explain why the Court barely mentions those conflicts today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b715-11\">. The only alleged precedent the Court dares to describe is <em>Civil Service Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Letter Carriers, </em>413 U.S. 548, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 37 L. Ed. 2d 796 (1973). That case involved a provision of the Hatch Act incorporating prior adjudications of the Civil Service Commission. We upheld the provision against a vagueness challenge\u2014not, however, by \u201cparing down\u2019\u2019 the adjudications to a more narrow rule that we invented, but by concluding that what they held was not vague. See <em>id., </em>at 571-574, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 37 L. Ed. 2d 796. The string of cases the Court lists, see <em>ante, </em>at 406, n. 40, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 658-659 (almost none of which addressed claims of vagueness), have nothing to do with \u201cparing down.\u2019\u2019 The one that comes closest, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thirty-seven Photographs, </em>402 U.S. 363, 91 S. Ct. 1400, 28 L. Ed. 2d 822 (1971), specified a time limit within which proceedings authorized by statute for the forfeiture of obscene imported materials had to be commenced and completed. That is not much different from \u201creading in\u2019\u2019 a reasonable-time requirement for obligations undertaken in contracts, and can hardly be described as a rewriting or \u201cparing down\u2019\u2019 of the statute. The Court relied on legislative history anticipating that the proceedings would be prompt, <em>id., </em>at 370-371, 91 S. Ct. 1400, 28 L. Ed. 2d 822, and noted that (unlike here) it was not \u201cdecid[ing] issues of policy,\u2019\u2019 <em>id., </em>at 372, 91 S. Ct. 1400, 28 L.

Of course, evidence of pretrial media attention and widespread community hostility may play a role in the bias <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>inquiry. Such evidence may be important in assessing the adequacy of <em>voir dire, </em>see, <em>e.g., Mu\u2019Min </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>500 U.S. 415, 428-432, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1991), or in reviewing the denial of requests to dismiss particular jurors for cause, see, <em>e.g., Patton </em>v. <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1036-1040, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1984). There are occasions in which such evidence weighs heavily in favor of a change of venue. In the end, however, if no biased juror is actually seated, there is no violation of the defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury. See <em>id., </em>at 1031-1035, 1040, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed 2d 847; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 800-801, 803, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L.

Where there is extraordinary pretrial publicity and community hostility, he contends, a court must presume juror prejudice and thus grant a change of venue. Brief for Petitioner 25-34. I disagree. Careful <em>voir dire </em>can often ensure the selection of impartial jurors even where pretrial media coverage has generated much hostile community sentiment. Moreover, once a jury has been selected, there are measures that a trial judge may take to insulate jurors from media coverage during the course of the trial. What the Sixth Amendment requires is \u201can impartial jury.\u201d If the jury that sits and returns a verdict is impartial, a defendant has received what the Sixth Amendment requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The rule that petitioner advances departs from the text of the Sixth Amendment and is difficult to apply. It requires a trial judge to determine whether the adverse pretrial media coverage and community hostility in a particular case have reached a certain level of severity, but there is no clear way of demarcating that level or of determining whether it has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Petitioner relies chiefly on three cases from the <em>1960\u2019s\u2014Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1966), <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1965), and <em>Rideau </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1963). I do not read those cases as demanding petitioner\u2019s suggested approach. As the Court notes, <em>Sheppard </em>and <em>Estes </em>primarily \u201cinvolved media interference with courtroom proceedings <em>during </em>trial.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 382, n. 14, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 643; see also <em>post, </em>at 446, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 683 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). <em>Rideau </em>involved unique events in a small community.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">I share some of Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concerns about the adequacy of the <em>voir dire </em>in this case and the trial judge\u2019s findings that certain jurors could be impartial. See <em>post, </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"AvRW\">[561 U.S. 427]</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">458-462, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 691-693. But those highly fact-specific issues are not within the question presented. Pet. for Cert. i. I also do not understand the opinion of the Court as reaching any question regarding a change of venue under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">Because petitioner, in my view, is not entitled to a reversal of the decision below on the jury-trial question that is before us, I join the judgment of the Court in full.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"AYke\">with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">I concur in the Court\u2019s resolution of the honest-services fraud question and join Part III of its opinion. I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s conclusion that Jeffrey Skilling received a fair trial before an impartial jury. Under our relevant precedents, the more intense the public\u2019s antipathy toward a defendant, the more careful a court must be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the jury. In this case, passions ran extremely high. The sudden collapse of Enron directly affected thousands of people in the Houston area and shocked the entire community. The accompanying barrage of local media coverage was massive in volume and often caustic in tone. As Enron\u2019s onetime chief executive officer (CEO), Skilling was at the center of the storm. Even if these extraordinary circumstances did not constitutionally compel a change of venue, they required the District Court to conduct a thorough <em>voir dire </em>in which prospective jurors\u2019 attitudes about the case were closely scrutinized. The District Court\u2019s inquiry lacked the necessary thoroughness and left serious doubts about whether the jury empaneled to decide Skilling\u2019s case was capable of rendering an impartial decision based solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom. Accordingly, I would grant Skilling relief on his fair-trial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">[561 U.S. 428]</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The majority understates the breadth and depth of community hostility toward Skilling and overlooks significant deficiencies in the District Court\u2019s jury selection process. The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply. Virtually overnight, what had been the city\u2019s \u201clargest, most visible, and most prosperous company,\u201d its \u201cforemost social and charitable force,\u201d and \u201ca source of civic pride\u201d was reduced to a \u201cshattered shell.\u201d App. \u00b6\u00b611, 13, pp. 649a-650a, 1152a. Thousands of the company\u2019s employees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings vanish. As the effects rippled through the local economy, thousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses shuttered, and community groups that once benefited from Enron\u2019s largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in contributions. See, <em>e.g., </em>3 Supp. Record 1229, 1267; see also 554 F.3d 529, 560 (CA5 2009) (\u201cAccounting firms that serviced Enron\u2019s books had less work, hotels had more open rooms, restaurants sold fewer meals, and so on\u201d). Enron\u2019s community ties were so extensive that the entire local U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office was forced to recuse itself from the Government\u2019s investigation into the company\u2019s fall. See 3 Supp. Record 608 (official press release).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">With Enron\u2019s demise affecting the lives of so many Houstonians, local media coverage of the story saturated the community. According to a defense media expert, the Houston Chronicle\u2014the area\u2019s leading newspaper\u2014assigned as many as 12 reporters to work on the Enron story full time. App. 568a-569a. The paper mentioned Enron in more than 4,000 articles during the 3-year period following the company\u2019s December 2001 bankruptcy filing. Hundreds of these articles discussed Skilling by name. See 3 Supp. Record 2114. Skilling\u2019s expert, a professional journalist and academic with 30 years\u2019 experience, could not \u201crecall another instance where a local paper dedicated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>many resources to a single topic over such an extended period of time as the Houston Chronicle . . . dedicated to Enron.\u201d App. \u00b632, at 570a.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">[561 U.S. 429]</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Local television news coverage was similarly pervasive and, in terms of \u201ceditorial theme,\u201d \u201clargely followed the Chronicle\u2019s lead.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 11, at 559a; see also <em>id.., </em>at 717a. Between May 2002 and October 2004, local stations aired an estimated 19,000 news segments involving Enron, more than 1,600 of which mentioned Skilling. 3 Supp. Record 2116.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">While many of the stories were straightforward news items, many others conveyed and amplified the community\u2019s outrage at the top executives perceived to be responsible for the company\u2019s bankruptcy. A Chronicle report on Skilling\u2019s 2002 testimony before Congress is typical of the coverage. It began, \u201cAcross Houston, Enron employees watched former chief executive Jeffrey Skill-ing\u2019s congressional testimony on television, turning incredulous, angry and then sarcastic by turns, as a man they knew as savvy and detail-oriented pleaded memory failure and ignorance about critical financial transactions at the now-collapsed energy giant.\u201d App. 1218a. \u201c \u2018He is lying; he knew everything,\u2019 said [an employee], who said she had seen Skill-ing frequently over her 18 years with the firm, where Skilling was known for his intimate grasp of the inner doings at the company. \u2018I am getting sicker by the minute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1219a. A companion piece quoted a local attorney who called Skilling an \u201cidiot\u201d who was \u201cin denial\u201d; he added, \u201cI\u2019m glad [Skilling\u2019s] not my client.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 592a-593a (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Articles deriding Enron\u2019s senior executives were juxtaposed with pieces expressing sympathy toward and solidarity with the company\u2019s many victims. Skilling\u2019s media expert counted nearly a hundred victim-related stories in the Chronicle, including a \u201cmulti-page layout entitled \u2018The Faces of Enron,\u2019 \u201d which poignantly described the gut-wrenching experiences of former employees who lost vast sums of money, faced eviction from their homes, could not afford Christmas gifts for their children, and felt \u201cscared,\u201d \u201churt,\u201d \u201chumiliat[ed],\u201d \u201chelpless,\u201d and \u201cbetrayed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00b671, at</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">[561 U.S. 430]</p>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">585a-586a. The conventional wisdom that blame for Enron\u2019s devastating implosion and the ensuing human tragedy ultimately rested with Skill-ing and former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay became so deeply ingrained in the popular imagination that references to their involvement even turned up on the sports pages: \u201cIf you believe the story about [Coach Bill Parcells] not having anything to do with the end of Emmitt Smith\u2019s Cowboys career, then you probably believe in other far-fetched concepts. Like Jeff Skilling having nothing to do with Enron\u2019s collapse.\u201d 3 Supp. Record 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">When a federal grand jury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey\u2014 Enron\u2019s former chief accounting officer\u2014in 2004 on charges of conspiracy to defraud, securities fraud, and other crimes, the media placed them directly in their crosshairs. In the words of one article, \u201cthere was one thing those whose lives were touched by the once-exalted company all seemed to agree upon: The indictment of former Enron CEO Jeff Skilling was overdue.\u201d App. 1393a.

The completed questionnaires of the 283 respondents not excused for hardship dramatically illustrated the widespread impact of Enron\u2019s collapse on the Houston community and confirmed the intense animosity of Hous-tonians toward Skilling and his codefendants. More than one-third of the prospective jurors (approximately 99 of 283, by my count) indicated that they</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">[561 U.S. 432]</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">or persons they knew had lost money or jobs as a result of the Enron bankruptcy. Two-thirds of the jurors (about 188 of 283) expressed views about Enron or the defendants that suggested a potential predisposition to convict. In many instances, they did not mince words, describing Skilling as \u201csmug,\u201d \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cbrash,\u201d \u201cconceited,\u201d \u201cgreedy,\u201d \u201cdeceitful,\u201d \u201ctotally unethical and criminal,\u201d \u201ca crook,\u201d \u201cthe biggest liar on the face of the earth,\u201d and \u201cguilty as sin\u201d (capitalization omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Only about 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>percent of the prospective jurors (15 of 283) did not read the Houston Chronicle, had not otherwise \u201cheard or read about any of the Enron cases,\u201d Record 13019, were not connected to Enron victims, and gave no answers suggesting possible antipathy toward the defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties jointly stipulated to the dismissal</p>\n<p id=\"Az3v\">[561 U.S. 433]</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">Of 119 members of the jury pool for cause, hardship, or disability, but numerous individuals who had made harsh comments about Skilling remained.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">On December 28, 2005, shortly after the questionnaires had been returned, Causey pleaded guilty.

A Chronicle editorial opined that \u201cCausey\u2019s admission of securities fraud . . . makes less plausible Lay\u2019s claim that most of the guilty</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">[561 U.S. 434]</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">pleas were the result of prosecutorial pressure rather than actual wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 12391.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">With the trial date quickly approaching, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>both the questionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea confirmed that he could not receive a fair trial in Houston. In the alternative, Skilling asserted that \u201cdefendants are entitled to a more thorough jury selection process than currently envisioned by the [c]ourt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 12067. The court had announced its intention to question individual jurors at the bench with one attorney for each side present, and to complete the <em>voir dire </em>in a single day. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 11804-11805, 11808. Skilling proposed, <em>inter alia, </em>that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in questioning, <em>id.., </em>at 12074; that jurors be questioned privately <em>in camera </em>or in a closed courtroom where it would be easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues, clients, and jury consultants, <em>id., </em>at 12070-12072; and that the court \u201cavoid leading questions,\u201d which \u201ctend to [e] licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that may not reflect their actual views,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 12072. At a minimum, Skilling asserted, the court should grant a continuance of at least 30 days and send a revised questionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors. <em>Id., </em>at 12074-12075.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The District Court denied Skilling\u2019s motion without a hearing, stating in a brief order that it was \u201cnot persuaded that the evidence or arguments urged by defendants . . . establish that pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 14115. According to the court, the \u201cjury questionnaires sent to the remaining members of the jury panel and the court\u2019s voir dire examination of the jury panel provide adequate safeguards to defendants and will result in the selection of a fair and impartial jury in this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 14115-14116. The court did agree to delay the trial by two weeks, until January 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">[561 U.S. 435]</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The coming trial featured prominently in local news outlets. A front-page, eve-of-trial story in the Chronicle described \u201cthe hurt and anger and resentment\u201d that had been \u201cchurn [ing] inside\u201d Houstonians since Enron\u2019s collapse. <em>Id., </em>at 39946. Again criticizing Lay and Skilling for offering a \u201cdoofus defense\u201d (\u201ca plea of not guilty by reason of empty-headedness\u201d), the paper stated that \u201cLay and Skilling took hundreds of millions in compensation yet now fail to accept the responsibility that went with it.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The article allowed that the defendants\u2019 guilt, \u201cthough perhaps widely assumed, remains even now an assertion. Ajury now takes up the task of deciding whether that assertion is valid.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 39947. The next paragraph, however, assured readers that \u201cit\u2019s normal for your skin to crawl when Lay or Skilling claim with doe-eyed innocence that they were unaware that something was amiss at Enron. The company\u2019s utter failure belies the claim.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(one paragraph break omitted); see also <em>id., </em>at 39904 (declaring that Lay and Skilling would \u201chave to offer a convincing explanation for how executives once touted as corporate geniuses could be so much in the dark about the illegal activities and deceptive finances of their own company\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">It is against this backdrop of widespread community impact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury selection in Skilling\u2019s case unfolded. Approximately 160 prospective jurors appeared for <em>voir dire </em>at a federal courthouse located \u201cabout six blocks from Enron\u2019s former headquarters.\u201d 554 F.3d, at 561. Addressing them as a group, the District Court began by briefly describing the case and provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ing a standard admonition about the need to be fair and impartial and to decide the case based solely on the trial evidence and jury instructions. The court then asked whether anyone had \u201cany reservations about your ability to conscientiously and fairly follow these very important rules.\u201d App. 815a. Two individuals raised their hands and were called forward</p>\n<p id=\"A3ug\">[561 U.S. 436]</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">to the bench. One told the court that he thought Lay and Skilling \u201cknew exactly what they were doing\u201d and would have to prove their innocence. <em>Id., </em>at 818a-819a. The second juror, who had stated on his written questionnaire that he held no opinion that would preclude him from being impartial, declared that he \u201cwould dearly love to sit on this jury. I would love to claim responsibility, at least 1/12 of the responsibility, for putting these sons of bitches away for the rest of their lives.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 819a-820a. The court excused both jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The court proceeded to question individual jurors from the bench. As the majority recounts, <em>ante, </em>at 373-374, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 638-639, the court asked them a few general yes/no questions about their exposure to Enron-related news, often variations of, \u201cDo you recall any particular articles that stand out that you\u2019ve read about the case?\u201d App. 850a. The court also asked about questionnaire answers that suggested bias, focusing mainly on whether, notwithstanding seemingly partial comments, the prospective jurors believed they \u201ccould be fair\u201d and \u201cput the government to its proof.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 852a. Counsel were permitted to follow up on issues raised by the court. The court made clear, however, that its patience would be limited, see, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 879a, and questioning tended to be brief\u2014generally less than five minutes per person. Even so, it exposed disqualifying biases among several prospective jurors who had earlier expressed no concerns about their ability to be fair.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">[561 U.S. 437]</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Once it identified 38 qualified prospective jurors, the court allowed the defense and Government to exercise their allotted peremptory challenges. This left 12 jurors and 4 alternates, who were sworn in and instructed, for the first time, \u201cnot [to] read anything dealing with this case or listen to any discussion of the case on radio or television or access any Internet sites that may deal with the case\u201d and to \u201cinform your friends and family members that they should not discuss with you anything they may have read or heard about this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1026a. Start to finish, the selection process took about five hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">Skilling\u2019s trial commenced the next day and lasted four months. After several days of deliberations, the jury found Skilling guilty of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities fraud, 5 counts of making false representations to auditors, and 1 count of insider trading; it acquitted on 9 insider trading counts. The jury found Lay guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">On appeal, Skilling asserted that he had been denied his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury. Addressing this claim, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>of Appeals began by disavowing the District Court\u2019s findings concerning \u201ccommunity hostility.\u201d There was, the court concluded, \u201csufficient inflammatory pretrial material to require a finding of presumed prejudice, especially in light of the immense volume of coverage.\u201d 554 F.3d, at 559. \u201c[Prejudice was [also] inherent in an alleged co-conspirator\u2019s well-publicized decision to plead guilty on the eve of trial.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court of Appeals, moreover, faulted the District Court for failing to \u201cconsider the wider context.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 560. \u201c[I]t was not enough for the court merely to assess the tone of the news reporting. The evaluation of the volume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the real inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an impartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrelevant sources.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks and footnote omitted). According to the Court of Appeals, \u201c[t]he district court seemed to overlook that the</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">[561 U.S. 438]</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">prejudice came from more than just pretrial media publicity, but also from the sheer number of victims.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Having determined that \u201cSkilling was entitled to a presumption of prejudice,\u201d the Court of Appeals proceeded to explain that \u201cthe presumption is rebuttable, . . . and the government may demonstrate from the <em>voir dire </em>that an impartial jury was actually impanelled.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted). Describing the <em>voir dire </em>as \u201cexemplary,\u201d \u201csearching,\u201d and \u201cproper and thorough,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 562, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he government [had] met its burden of showing that the actual jury that convicted Skilling was impartial,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 564-565. On this basis, the Court of Appeals rejected Skilling\u2019s claim and affirmed his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and the due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guarantee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside preconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and decide guilt or innocence \u201cbased on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961); see also <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 362, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1966). Community passions, often inflamed by adverse pretrial publicity, can call the integrity of a trial into doubt. In some instances, this Court has observed, the hostility of the community becomes so severe as to give rise to a \u201cpresumption of [juror] prejudice.\u201d <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1031, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The Court of Appeals incorporated the concept of presumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting framework: Once the defendant musters sufficient evidence of community hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to prove the impartiality of the jury. The majority similarly envisions a fixed point at which public passions become so intense that prejudice to a defendant\u2019s fair-trial rights must be presumed. The majority declines, however, to decide whether the presumption is rebuttable, as the Court of Appeals held.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">[561 U.S. 439]</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">This Court has never treated the notion of presumptive prejudice so formalistically. Our decisions instead merely convey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of public enmity rises, so too does the danger that the prejudices of the community will infiltrate the jury. The underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>question has always been this: Do we have confidence that the jury\u2019s verdict was \u201cinduced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print\u201d? <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Colorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo., </em>205 U.S. 454, 462, 27 S. Ct. 556, 51 L. Ed. 879 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The inquiry is necessarily case specific. In selecting a jury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the intensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial publicity and community animus. Reviewing courts, meanwhile, must assess whether the trial court\u2019s procedures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury free from disqualifying bias. Cf. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975) (scrutinizing the record for \u201cany indications in the totality of circumstances that petitioner\u2019s trial was not fundamentally fair\u201d). This Court\u2019s precedents illustrate the sort of steps required in different situations to safeguard a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">At one end of the spectrum, this Court has, on rare occasion, confronted such inherently prejudicial circumstances that it has reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cwithout pausing to examine . . . the <em>voir dire </em>examination of the members of the jury.\u201d <em>Rideau </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 727, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1963). In <em>Rideau, </em>repeated television broadcasts of the defendant\u2019s confession to murder, robbery, and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned local sentiment as to raise doubts that even the most careful <em>voir dire </em>could have secured an impartial jury. A change of venue, the Court determined, was thus the only way to ensure a fair trial. <em>Ibid.; </em>see also 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 23.2(a), p. 264 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave) (\u201cThe best reading</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">[561 U.S. 440]</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">of <em>Rideau </em>is that the Court there recognized that prejudicial publicity may be so inflammatory and so pervasive that the voir dire simply cannot be trusted to fully reveal the likely prejudice among prospective jurors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">As the majority describes, <em>ante, </em>at 379-380, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 642, this Court reached similar conclusions in <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L. Ed. 2d 543 (1965), and <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. 333, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. These cases involved not only massive pretrial publicity but also media disruption of the trial process itself. Rejecting the argument that the defendants were not entitled to relief from their convictions because they \u201cha[d] established no isolatable prejudice,\u201d the Court described the \u201cuntoward circumstances\u201d as \u201cinherently suspect.\u201d <em>Estes, </em>381 U.S., at 542, 544, 85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L. Ed. 2d 543. It would have been difficult for the jurors not to have been swayed, at least subconsciously, by the \u201cbedlam\u201d that surrounded them. <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S., at 355, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. Criticizing the trial courts\u2019 failures \u201cto protect the jury from outside influence,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 358, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600, the Court stressed that, \u201cwhere there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to another [venue] not so permeated with publicity.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 363, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. <em>Estes </em>and <em>Sheppard </em>thus applied Rideau\u2019s insight that in particularly extreme circumstances even the most rigorous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>voir dire </em>cannot suffice to dispel the reasonable likelihood of jury bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Apart from these exceptional cases, this Court has declined to discount <em>voir dire </em>entirely and has instead examined the particulars of the jury selection process to determine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted by pretrial publicity and community animus. The Court has recognized that when antipathy toward a defendant pervades the community there is a high risk that biased jurors will find their way onto the panel. The danger is not merely that some prospective jurors will deliberately hide their prejudices, but also that, as \u201cpart of a community deeply hostile to the accused,\u201d \u201cthey may unwittingly [be] influenced\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">[561 U.S. 441]</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">by the fervor that surrounds them. <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S., at 803, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589. To ensure an impartial jury in such adverse circumstances, a trial court must carefully consider the knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors and then closely scrutinize the reliability of their assurances of fairness. Cf. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992) (\u201c[P]art of the guarantee of a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury is an adequate <em>voir dire </em>to identify unqualified jurors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\"><em>Irvin </em>offers an example of a case in which the trial court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>did not suffice to counter the \u201cwave of public passion\u201d that had swept the community prior to the defendant\u2019s trial. 366 U.S., at 728, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. The local news media had \u201cextensively covered\u201d the crimes (a murder spree), \u201carous[ing] great excitement and indignation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 719, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (internal quotation marks omitted). Following Irvin\u2019s arrest, the press \u201cblanketed\u201d the community with \u201ca barrage of newspaper headlines, articles, cartoons and pictures\u201d communicating numerous unfavorable details about Irvin, including that he had purportedly confessed. <em>Id., </em>at 725, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. Nearly 90 percent of the 430 prospective jurors examined during the trial court\u2019s <em>voir dire </em>\u201centertained some opinion as to guilt\u2014ranging in intensity from mere suspicion to absolute certainty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 727, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. Of the 12 jurors seated, 8 \u201cthought petitioner was guilty,\u201d although \u201ceach indicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could render an impartial verdict.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 727, 724, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Despite the seated jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality, this Court invalidated Irvin\u2019s conviction for want of due process. \u201cIt is not required,\u201d this Court declared, \u201cthat the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved. ... It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 722-723, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. The Court emphasized, however, that a juror\u2019s word on this matter is not decisive, particularly when \u201cthe build-up of prejudice [in the community] is clear</p>\n<p id=\"AzI6\">[561 U.S. 442]</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">and convincing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 725, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751. Many of Irvin\u2019s jurors, the Court noted, had been influenced by \u201cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown to be present throughout the community.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 727, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court did not \u201cdoubt [that] each juror was sincere when he said that he would be fair and impartial to [Irvin], but . . . [w]here so many, so many times, ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>mitted prejudice, such a statement of impartiality can be given little weight.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 728, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The media coverage and community animosity in <em>Irvin </em>were particularly intense. In three subsequent cases, this Court recognized that high-profile cases may generate substantial publicity without stirring similar public passions. The jury selection process in such cases, the Court clarified, generally need not be as exhaustive as in a case such as <em>Irvin. </em>So long as the trial court conducts a reasonable inquiry into extrajudicial influences and the ability of prospective jurors to presume innocence and render a verdict based solely on the trial evidence, we would generally have no reason to doubt the jury\u2019s impartiality.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The first of these cases, <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S. 794, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589, involved a well-known defendant put on trial for a widely publicized Miami Beach robbery. The state trial court denied his motion for a change of venue and during <em>voir dire </em>excused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause. Distinguishing <em>Irvin, </em>this Court saw no indication in the <em>voir dire </em>of \u201csuch hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who served in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not be laid aside.\u201d 421 U.S., at 800, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589. Although some jurors \u201chad a vague recollection of the robbery with which [Murphy] was charged and each had</p>\n<p id=\"ANAF\">[561 U.S. 443]</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">some knowledge of [his] past crimes,\u201d \u201cnone betrayed any belief in the relevance of [Murphy\u2019s] past to the present case.\u201d <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em>ibid., </em>n. 4 (contrasting a juror\u2019s \u201cmere familiarity with [a defendant] or his past\u201d with \u201can actual predisposition against him\u201d). \u201c[T]hese indicia of impartiality,\u201d the Court suggested, \u201cmight be disregarded in a case where the general atmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently inflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding [Murphy\u2019s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 802, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">In a second case, <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847, the defendant was granted a new trial four years after being convicted of murder. He requested a change of venue, citing pretrial publicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had previously been convicted and had made confessions that would be inadmissible in court. The state trial court denied Yount\u2019s motion and seated a jury following a 10-day <em>voir dire </em>of 292 prospective jurors. Nearly all of the prospective jurors had heard of the case, and 77 percent \u201cadmitted they would carry an opinion into the jury box.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1029, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847. Declining to grant relief on federal habeas review, this Court stressed the significant interval between Yount\u2019s first trial\u2014when \u201cadverse publicity and the community\u2019s sense of outrage were at their height\u201d\u2014and his second trial, which \u201cdid not occur until four years later, at a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly diminished and community sentiment had softened.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1032, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847. While 8 of the 14 seated jurors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>alternates had \u201cat some time . . . formed an opinion as to Yount\u2019s guilt,\u201d the \u201cparticularly extensive\u201d <em>voir dire </em>confirmed that \u201ctime had weakened or eliminated any\u201d bias they once may have harbored. <em>Id., </em>at 1029-1030, 1034, n. 10, 1033, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847. Accordingly, this Court concluded, \u201cthe trial court did not commit manifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was impartial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1032, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">This Court most recently wrestled with the issue of pretrial publicity in <em>Mu\u2019Min </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>500 U.S. 415, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">[561 U.S. 444]</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Mu\u2019Min stood accused of murdering a woman while out of prison on a work detail. Citing 47 newspaper articles about the crime, Mu\u2019Min moved for a change of venue. The state trial court deferred its ruling and attempted to seat a jury. During group questioning, 16 of the 26 prospective jurors indicated that they had heard about the case from media or other sources. Dividing these prospective jurors into panels of four, the court asked further general questions about their ability to be fair given what they had heard or read. One juror answered equivocally and was dismissed for cause. The court refused Mu\u2019Min\u2019s request to ask more specific questions \u201crelating to the content of news items that potential jurors might have read or seen.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 419, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. Of the 12 persons who served on the jury, \u201c8 had at one time or another read or heard something about the case. None had indicated that he had formed an opinion about the case or would be biased in any way.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 421, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Rejecting Mu\u2019Min\u2019s attempt to analogize his case to <em>Irvin, </em>this Court observed that \u201cthe cases differ both in the kind of community in which the coverage took place and in extent of media coverage.\u201d 500 U.S., at 429, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. Mu\u2019Min\u2019s offense occurred in the metropolitan Washington, D. C., area, \u201cwhich has a population of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed each year.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>While the crime garnered \u201csubstantial\u201d pretrial publicity, the coverage was not as pervasive as in <em>Irvin </em>and \u201cdid not contain the same sort of damaging information.\u201d 500 U.S., at 429-430, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. Moreover, in contrast to <em>Irvin, </em>the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion about the case. Given these circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu\u2019Min\u2019s assertion that the trial court committed constitutional error by declining to \u201cmake precise inquiries about the contents of any news reports that potential jurors have read.\u201d 500 U.S., at 424, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493. The Court stressed, however, that its ruling was context specific: \u201cHad the trial court in this case been confronted with the \u2018wave of public passion\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">[561 U.S. 445]</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">engendered by pretrial publicity that occurred in connection with Irvin\u2019s trial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment might well have required more extensive examination of potential jurors than it undertook here.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 429, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b728-13\">It is necessary to determine how this case compares to our existing fair-trial precedents. Were the circumstances so inherently prejudicial that, as in <em>Rideau, </em>even the most scrupulous <em>voir dire </em>would have been \u201cbut a hollow formality\u201d incapable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>reliably producing an impartial jury? 373 U.S., at 726, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663. If the circumstances were not of this character, did the District Court conduct a jury selection process sufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and community animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable of presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial influences?</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Though the question is close, I agree with the Court that the prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District Court acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling\u2019s motion to change venue. Three considerations lead me to this conclusion. First, as the Court observes, <em>ante, </em>at 382, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 643-644, the size and diversity of the Houston community make it probable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number of persons who were unaffected by Enron\u2019s collapse, neutral in their outlook, and unlikely to be swept up in the public furor. Second, media coverage of the case, while ubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as the Court points out, <em>ante, </em>at 382-383, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 644, contain a confession by Skilling or similar \u201csmoking-gun\u201d evidence of specific criminal acts. For many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of co-defendant and alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the pleas and convictions of other Enron executives, no doubt suggested guilt by association. But reasonable minds exposed to such information</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">[561 U.S. 446]</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">would not necessarily have formed an indelible impression that Skilling himself was guilty as charged. Cf. <em>Rideau, </em>373 U.S., at 726, 83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 (a majority of the county\u2019s residents were \u201cexposed repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged\u201d). Third, there is no suggestion that the courtroom in this case became, as in <em>Estes </em>and <em>Sheppard, </em>a \u201ccarnival\u201d in which the \u201ccalmness and solemnity\u201d of the proceedings were compromised. <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S., at 358, 350, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is thus appropriate to examine the <em>voir dire </em>and determine whether it instills confidence in the impartiality of the jury actually selected.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">In concluding that the <em>voir dire </em>\u201cadequately detected] and defuse[d] juror bias,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 385, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 646, the Court downplays the</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">[561 U.S. 447]</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">extent of the community\u2019s antipathy toward Skilling and exaggerates the rigor of the jury selection process. The devastating impact of Enron\u2019s collapse and the relentless media coverage demanded exceptional care on the part of the District Court to ensure the seating of an impartial jury. While the procedures employed by the District Court might have been adequate in the typical high-profile case, they did not suffice in the extraordinary circumstances of this case to safeguard Skilling\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">In conducting this analysis, I am mindful of the \u201cwide discretion\u201d owed to trial courts when it comes to jury-related issues. <em>Mu\u2019Min, </em>500 U.S., at 427, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493; cf. <em>ante, </em>at 386-387, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 646-647. Trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public sentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors. Proximity to events, however, is not always a virtue. Persons in the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view. \u201c[AJppellate tribunals [thus] have the duty to make an independent evaluation of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S., at 362, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. In particular, reviewing courts are well qualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented procedures adequate to keep community prejudices from infecting the jury. If the jury selection process does not befit the circumstances of the case, the trial court\u2019s rulings on impartiality are necessarily called into doubt. See <em>Morgan, </em>504 U.S., at 729-730, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (\u201c \u2018Without an adequate <em>voir dire </em>the trial judge\u2019s responsibility to remove prospective jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the court\u2019s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be fulfilled\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Rosales-Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 188, 101 S. Ct. 1629, 68 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1981) (plurality opinion))); see also <em>Mu\u2019Min, </em>500 U.S., at 451, 111 S. Ct. 1899, 114 L. Ed. 2d 493 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cOur willingness to accord substantial deference to a trial court\u2019s finding of juror impartiality rests on our expectation that the trial court will conduct a sufficient <em>voir dire </em>to determine the credibility of a juror professing to be impartial\u201d ).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">[561 U.S. 448]</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">As the Court of Appeals apprehended, the District Court gave short shrift to the mountainous evidence of public hostility. For Houstonians, Enron\u2019s collapse was an event of once-in-a-generation proportions. Not only was the volume of media coverage \u201cimmense\u201d and frequently intemperate, but \u201cthe sheer number of victims\u201d created a climate in which animosity toward Skilling ran deep and the desire for conviction was widely shared. 554 F.3d, at 559-560.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">The level of public animus toward Skilling dwarfed that present in cases such as <em>Murphy </em>and <em>Mu\u2019Min. </em>The pretrial publicity in those cases consisted of dozens of news reports, most of which were \u201clargely factual in nature.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S., at 802, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589. There was no indication that the relevant communities had been captivated by the cases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants. In contrast, the number of media reports in this case reached the tens of thousands, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>full-throated denunciations of Skill-ing were common. The much closer analogy is thus to <em>Irvin, </em>which similarly featured a \u201cbarrage\u201d of media coverage and a \u201chuge . . . wave of public passion,\u201d 366 U.S., at 725, 728, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751, although even that case did not, as here, involve direct harm to entire segments of the community.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Attempting to distinguish <em>Irvin, </em>the majority suggests that Skilling\u2019s economic offenses were less incendiary than Irvin\u2019s violent crime spree and that \u201cnews stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about Irvin\u2019s rampage of robberies and murders.\u201d Ante, at 394, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 651. Along similar lines, the District Court described \u201cthe facts of this case [as] neither heinous nor sensational.\u201d App. to Brief for United States 10a. The majority also points to the four years that passed between</p>\n<p id=\"aex-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 449]</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Enron\u2019s declaration of bankruptcy and the start of Skilling\u2019s trial, asserting that \u201cthe decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat\u201d over this time. <em>Ante, </em>at 383, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 644. Neither of these arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">First, while violent crimes may well provoke widespread community outrage more readily than crimes involving monetary loss, economic crimes are certainly capable of rousing public passions, particularly when thousands of unsuspecting people are robbed of their livelihoods and retirement savings. Indeed, the record in this case is replete with examples of visceral outrage toward Skilling and other Enron executives. See, <em>e.g., </em>Record 39946 (front-page, eve-of-trial story describing \u201cthe hurt and anger and resentment. . . churn [ing] inside\u201d the people of Houston). Houstonians compared Skilling to, among other things, a rapist, an axe murderer, and an al Qaeda terrorist.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As one commentator observed, \u201c [i]t\u2019s a sign of how shocked Houstonians are about Enron\u2019s ignominious demise that Sept. 11 can be invoked\u2014and is frequently\u2014to explain the shock of the company\u2019s collapse.\u201d 3 Supp. Record 544. The bad blood was so strong that Skilling and other top executives hired private security to protect themselves from persons inclined to take the law into their own hands. See, <em>e.g., </em>App. 1154a (\u201cAfter taking the temperature of Enron\u2019s victims, [a local lawyer] says the Enron executives are wise to take security precautions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">[561 U.S. 450]</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Second, the passage of time did little to soften community sentiment. Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, <em>ante, </em>at 383, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 644, this case in no way resembles <em>Yount, </em>where, by the time of the defendant\u2019s retrial, \u201cprejudicial publicity [had] greatly diminished\u201d and community animus had significantly waned. 467 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>U.S., at 1032, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847; see also <em>ibid, </em>(in the months preceding the defendant\u2019s retrial, newspaper reports about the case averaged \u201cless than one article per month,\u201d and public interest was \u201cminimal\u201d). The Enron story was a continuing saga, and \u201cpublicity remained intense throughout.\u201d 554 F.3d, at 560. Not only did Enron\u2019s downfall generate wall-to-wall news coverage, but so too did a succession of subsequent Enron-related events.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of particular note is the highly publicized guilty plea of codefendant Causey just weeks before Skilling\u2019s trial. If anything, the time that elapsed between the bankruptcy and the trial made the task of seating an unbiased jury more difficult, not less. For many members</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">[561 U.S. 451]</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">of the jury pool, each highly publicized Enron-related guilty plea or conviction likely served to increase their certainty that Skill-ing too had engaged in\u2014if not masterminded\u2014criminal acts, particularly given that the media coverage reinforced this view. See <em>supra, </em>at 433-434, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 675-676. The trial of Skilling and Lay was the culmination of all that had come before. See Record 40002 (noting that \u201cprosecutors followed the classic pattern of working their way up through the ranks\u201d). As the Chronicle put it in July 2005, shortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services executives ended without convictions: \u201cThe real trial, the true measure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in January. Let the small fry swim free if need be. We\u2019ve got bigger fish in need of frying.\u201d App. 1460a (paragraph breaks omitted); see also <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cFrom the beginning, the Enron prosecution has had one true measure of success: Lay and Skilling in a cold steel cage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the Houston community remained overwhelmingly negative was dispelled by prospective jurors\u2019 responses to the written questionnaires. As previously indicated, <em>supra, </em>at 431-433, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 674-675, more than one-third of the prospective jurors either knew victims of Enron\u2019s collapse or were victims themselves, and two-thirds gave responses suggesting an antidefen-dant bias. In many instances their contempt for Skilling was palpable. See nn. 4, 6, <em>supra. </em>Only a small fraction of the prospective jurors raised no red flags in their responses. And this was <em>before </em>Causey\u2019s guilty plea and the flurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of trial. One of Skilling\u2019s experts, a po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>litical scientist who had studied pretrial publicity \u201cfor over 35 years\u201d and consulted in more than 200 high-profile cases (in which he had recommended against venue changes more often than not), \u201cc[a]me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of bias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at least one of the very highest I have ever encountered.\u201d App. \u00b6\u00b62, 7, at 783a, 785a (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">[561 U.S. 452]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Given the extent of the antipathy evident both in the community at large and in the responses to the written questionnaire, it was critical for the District Court to take \u201cstrong measures\u201d to ensure the selection of \u201can impartial jury free from outside influences.\u201d <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S., at 362, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600. As this Court has recognized, \u201c[i]n a community where most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying prejudice, the reliability of the others\u2019 protestations may be drawn into question.\u201d <em>Murphy, </em>421 U.S., at 803, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589; see also <em>Groppi </em>v. <em>Wisconsin, </em>400 U.S. 505, 510, 91 S. Ct. 490, 27 L. Ed. 2d 571 (1971) (\u201c\u2018[A]ny judge who has sat with juries knows that in spite of forms they are extremely likely to be impregnated by the environing atmosphere\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Mangum, </em>237 U.S. 309, 349, 35 S. Ct. 582, 59 L. Ed. 969 (1915) (Holmes, J., dissenting))). Perhaps because it had underestimated the public\u2019s antipathy toward Skilling, the District Court\u2019s 5-hour <em>voir dire </em>was manifestly insufficient to identify and remove biased jurors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">[561 U.S. 453]</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">As an initial matter, important lines of inquiry were not pursued at all. The majority accepts, for instance, that \u201cpublicity about a codefendant\u2019s guilty plea calls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 385, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 645. Implying that the District Court undertook this inquiry, the majority states that \u201c[o]nly two venire members recalled [Causey\u2019s] plea.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In fact, the court asked very few prospective jurors any questions directed to their knowledge of or feelings about that event.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Considering how much news the plea generated, many more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>two venire members were likely aware of it. The lack of questioning, however, makes the prejudicial impact of the plea on those jurors impossible to assess.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The court also rarely asked prospective jurors to describe personal interactions they may have had about the case, or to consider whether they might have difficulty avoiding discussion of the case with family, friends, or colleagues during the course of the lengthy trial. The tidbits of information that trickled out on these subjects provided cause for concern. In response to general media-related questions, several prospective jurors volunteered that they had spoken with others about the case. Juror 74, for example, indicated that her husband was the \u201cnews person,\u201d that they had \u201ctalked about it,\u201d that she had also heard things \u201cfrom work,\u201d and that what she heard was \u201call negative, of course.\u201d App. 948a. The court, however, did not seek elaboration</p>\n<p id=\"Aqkh\">[561 U.S. 454]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">about the substance of these interactions. Surely many prospective jurors had similar conversations, particularly once they learned upon receiving the written questionnaire that they might end up on Skilling\u2019s jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Prospective jurors\u2019 personal interactions, moreover, may well have left them with the sense that the community was counting on a conviction. Yet this too was a subject the District Court did not adequately explore. On the few occasions when prospective jurors were asked whether they would feel pressure from the public to convict, they acknowledged that it might be difficult to return home after delivering a not-guilty verdict. Juror 75, for instance, told the court, \u201cI think a lot of people feel that they\u2019re guilty. And maybe they\u2019re expecting something to come out of this trial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 956a. It would be \u201ctough,\u201d she recognized, \u201cto vote not guilty and go back into the community.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 957a; see also <em>id., </em>at 852a (Juror 10) (admitting \u201csome hesitancy\u201d about \u201ctelling people the government didn\u2019t prove its case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">With respect to potential nonmedia sources of bias, the District Court\u2019s exchange with Juror 101 is particularly troubling.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Although Juror 101 responded in the negative when asked whether she had \u201cread anything in the newspaper that [stood] out in [her] mind,\u201d she volunteered that she \u201cjust heard that, between the two of them, [Skilling and Lay] had $43 million to contribute for their case and that there was an insurance policy that they could collect on, also.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 998a. This information, she explained, \u201cwas just something I overheard today\u2014other jurors talking.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It seemed suspicious, she intimated, \u201cto have an insurance policy ahead of time.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 999a. The court advised her that \u201cmost corporations provide insurance for their officers and directors.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court, however, did not investigate the matter further, even though it had earlier instructed prospective jurors not to talk to each other about the case. <em>Id.,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AsXH\">[561 U.S. 455]</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">at 843a. It is thus not apparent whether other prospective jurors also overheard the information and whether they too believed that it reflected unfavorably on the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>dants; nor is it apparent what other outside information may have been shared among the venire members. At the very least, Juror 101\u2019s statements indicate that the court\u2019s questions were failing to bring to light the extent of jurors\u2019 exposure to potentially prejudicial facts and that some prospective jurors were having difficulty following the court\u2019s directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The topics that the District Court did cover were addressed in cursory fashion. Most prospective jurors were asked just a few yes/no questions about their general exposure to media coverage and a handful of additional questions concerning any responses to the written questionnaire that suggested bias. In many instances, their answers were unenlightening.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Yet the court rarely sought to draw them out with open-ended questions about their impressions of Enron or Skilling and showed limited patience for counsel\u2019s followup efforts. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 879a, 966a.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When prospective</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">[561 U.S. 456]</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">jurors were more forthcoming, their responses tended to highlight the ubiquity and negative tone of the local news coverage, thus underscoring the need to press the more guarded members of the venire for further information.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Juror 17, for example, mentioned hearing a radio program that very morning in which a former Enron employee compared persons who did not think Skilling was guilty to Holocaust deniers. See <em>id., </em>at 863a (\u201c[H]e said he thought that he would find them guilty automatically if he was on the jury because he said that it would be worse than a German trying to say that they didn\u2019t kill the Jews\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Other jurors may well have encountered, and been influenced by, similarly incendiary rhetoric.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">These deficiencies in the form and content of the <em>voir dire </em>questions con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>tributed to a deeper problem: The District Court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment of prospective jurors\u2019 assurances of impartiality. Although the Court insists otherwise, <em>ante, </em>at 392, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 650, the <em>voir dire </em>transcript indicates that the District Court essentially took jurors at</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">[561 U.S. 457]</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">their word when they promised to be fair. Indeed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospective juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impartiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it. Juror 29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that Skilling was \u201cnot an honest man.\u201d App. 881a. During questioning, she acknowledged having previously thought the defendants were guilty, and she disclosed that she lost $50,000-$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result of Enron\u2019s collapse. <em>Id., </em>at 880a, 883a.

Prospective jurors who \u201chope[d]\u201d they could presume innocence and did \u201cnot necessarily\u201d think Skilling was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool. App. 932a, 857a.

Jurors who did not \u201cget into details\u201d of Enron\u2019s complicated accounting schemes, App. 856a, nevertheless knew the outline of the oft-repeated story, including that Skilling and Lay had been cast as the leading villains. Juror 63, for instance, told the court that she \u201cmay have heard a little bit\u201d about Enron-related litigation but had not \u201creally pa[id] attention.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 935a. Yet she was clearly aware of some specifics. On her questionnaire, despite stating that she had not followed Enron-related news, she wrote about \u201cwhistleblowers and Arthur Andersen lying about Enron\u2019s accounting,\u201d and she expressed the view that Skilling and Lay \u201cprobably knew they were breaking the law.\u201d Supp. App. 105sa-106sa. During questioning, which lasted barely four minutes, the District Court obtained no meaningful information about the actual extent of Juror 63\u2019s familiarity with the case or the basis for her belief in Skilling\u2019s guilt.

The majority thus misses the mark when it asserts that \u201cSkilling\u2019s seated ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>rors . . . exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in <em>Irvin.\u201d Ante, </em>at 394, 177 L.

Juror 13, for instance, wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard about the Enron cases from the \u201c[n]ews.\u201d Supp. App. 42sa. The court questioned him for two minutes, during which time he confirmed that he had \u201cheard what\u2019s on the news, basically,\u201d including \u201cthat the trial had moved from the 17th to the 31st.\u201d He added that the story \u201cwas all over the news on every detail of Enron.\u201d App. 858a-860a.

Similarly, Juror 78 wrote that she had not followed Enron-related news but was aware that \u201c[m]any people lost their jobs.\u201d Supp. App. 151sa. The court questioned her for less than 90 seconds.

When the District Court asked the prospective jurors as a group whether they had any reservations about their ability to presume innocence and put the Government to its proof, only two answered in the affirmative, and both were excused for cause. <em>Id., </em>at 815a-820a. The District Court\u2019s individual questioning, though truncated, exposed disqualifying prejudices among numerous additional prospective jurors who had earlier expressed no concerns about their impartiality. See n. 7, <em>supra. </em>It thus strikes me as highly likely that at least some of the seated jurors, despite stating that they could be fair, harbored similar biases that a more probing inquiry would likely have exposed. Cf. <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S., at 1034, n. 10, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (holding that the trial court\u2019s \u201cparticularly extensive\u201d 10-day <em>voir dire </em>ensured the jury\u2019s impartiality).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">The majority suggests, <em>ante, </em>at 383-384, 395, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 644-645, 651, that the jury\u2019s decision to acquit Skilling on nine relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>minor insider trading charges confirms its impartiality. This argument, however, mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind vindictiveness. Jurors who act in good faith and sincerely believe in their own fairness may nevertheless harbor disqualifying prejudices. Such jurors may well acquit where evidence is wholly lacking, while subconsciously resolving closer calls against the defendant rather than giving him the benefit of the doubt. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>McVeigh, </em>918 F. Supp. 1467, 1472 (WD Okla. 1996) (Prejudice \u201cmay go unrecognized</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">[561 U.S. 464]</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">in those who are affected by it. The prejudice that may deny a fair trial is not limited to a bias or discriminatory attitude. It includes an impairment of the deliberative process of deductive reasoning from evi-dentiary facts resulting from an attribution to something not included in the evidence. That something has its most powerful effect if it generates strong emotional responses\u201d). In this regard, it is significant that the Government placed relatively little emphasis on the nine insider trading counts during its closing argument, declining to explain its theory on those counts in any detail whatsoever. Record 37010. The acquittals on those counts thus provide scant basis for inferring a lack of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"pAJpd4\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"48\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAScAAAAwAQAAAAB7hYF7AAAAnElEQVR4nO2UMQoCMRREJ2Fr2QMJejM9jIew8DJabL12gpJn8YV8yQct1kaS7jFvYAghCX0+5C8kqVvd+r319mADMKvsXRDAkrsEwPpKPS2ULElcfC2ALElpnmsQge06Tq4fAQC3jZvSgu3SsHX1AMyafBCAWYfBBREAsDq7KS287mscazsEAE53V2+hmPXYuaCFsuSbSP1f/QvrCQTU02rzmGp1AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"295\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">In sum, I cannot accept the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>voir dire </em>gave the District Court \u201ca sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.\u201d Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 395, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 651. Taken together, the District Court\u2019s failure to cover certain vital subjects, its superficial coverage of other topics, and its uncritical acceptance of assurances of impartiality leave me doubtful that Skilling\u2019s jury was indeed free from the deep-seated animosity that pervaded the community at large. \u201c[RJegardless of the heinousness of the crime charged, the apparent guilt of the offender[,] or the station in life which he occupies,\u201d our system of justice demands trials that are fair in both appearance and fact. <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S., at 722, 81 S.

Ed. 2d 663 (1963), the widely felt sense of victimhood among Houstonians and the community\u2019s deep-seated animus toward Skilling certainly meant that the task of reliably identifying untainted jurors posed a major challenge, with no guarantee of success. It likely would have been far easier to empanel an impartial jury in a venue where the Enron story had less salience. I thus agree with the Court of Appeals that \u201c[i]t would not have been imprudent for the [District] [C]ourt to have granted Skilling\u2019s transfer motion.\u2019\u2019 554 F.3d 529, 558 (CA5 2009). Skilling, however, likely forfeited any Rule 21 or supervisory powers claim by failing to present it either in his opening brief before the Fifth Circuit, see <em>id., </em>at 559, n. 39, or in his petition for certiorari, cf. <em>ante, </em>at 378, n. 11, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 641.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b731-11\">. One of Skilling\u2019s experts noted that, \u201c[i]n cases involving 200 or more articles, trial judges granted a change of venue 59% of the time.\u201d App. \u00b630, at 611a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b731-12\">.

Among the highlights: In 2002, Skilling testified before Congress, and other Enron executives invoked their Fifth Amendment rights; Enron auditor Arthur Andersen was indicted, tried, convicted, and sentenced on charges of obstruction of justice; the Enron Task Force charged Enron chief financial officer and Skilling-protege Andrew Fastow with fraud, money laundering, and other crimes; and at least two Enron employees pleaded guilty on fraud and tax charges. In 2003, the Enron Task Force indicted numerous Enron employees, including Ben Clisan, Jr. (the company\u2019s treasurer), Lea Fastow (wife of Andrew and an assistant treasurer), and more than half a dozen executives of Enron Broadband Services; several Enron employees entered guilty pleas and received prison sentences; and Enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan. In 2004, Andrew and Lea Fastow both pleaded guilty; Skilling and Causey were indicted in February; a superseding indictment adding Lay was filed in July; a number of additional Enron employees entered guilty pleas; and former Enron employees and Merrill Lynch bankers were defendants in a 6-week trial in Houston concerning an Enron deal involving the sale of Nigerian barges. In 2005, a 3-month trial was held in Houston for five executives of Enron Broadband Services; various pretrial proceedings occurred in the runup to the trial of Skilling, Lay, and Causey; and, three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Causey pleaded guilty to securities fraud.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b733-10\">. The majority points out that the jury selection processes in the three previous Enron trials that had been held in Houston were similarly brief. See <em>ante, </em>at 388-389, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 647. The circumstances of those cases, however, were very different. In particular, the defendants had not been personally subjected to anything approaching the withering public criticism that had been directed at Skilling and Lay. As earlier noted, see, <em>e.g., supra, </em>at 451, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 686, it was the trial of Skilling and Lay that was widely seen as the climactic event of the Enron saga. Accordingly, my conclusion that the jury selection process in this unusual case did not suffice to select an impartial jury does not cast doubt on the adequacy of the processes used in the earlier Enron prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">Moreover, in referencing the length of the <em>voir dire </em>in this case, I do not mean to suggest that length should be a principal measure of the adequacy of a jury selection process. Trial courts, including this one, should be commended for striving to be efficient, but they must always take care to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a defendant\u2019s fair-trial right. I also express no view with respect to court-led versus attorney-led <em>voir dire. </em>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives district courts discretion to choose between these options, and I have no doubt that either is capable of producing an impartial jury even in high-profile cases so long as the trial court ensures that the scope of the <em>voir dire </em>is tailored to the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b733-12\">. Juror 33 brought up the plea in response to the District Court\u2019s question about whether he \u201crecall[ed] listening to any particular programs about the case.\u201d App. 888a. Juror 96, meanwhile, told the court that he read the \u201cwhole\u201d Houston Chronicle every day, including \u201call the articles about Enron.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 992a. The court, however, did not ask any questions designed to elicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>information about the Causey plea. Instead, Juror 96 remarked on the plea only after Skilling\u2019s counsel managed to squeeze in a followup as to whether he had \u201cread about any guilty pleas in this case over the last month or two.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 993a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b734-11\">.

The majority\u2019s criticism of Skilling\u2019s counsel for failing to ask questions of many of the prospective jurors, cf. <em>ante, </em>at 389, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 648, is thus misplaced. Given the District Court\u2019s express warning early in the <em>voir dire </em>that it would not allow counsel \u2018To ask individual questions if [they] abuse[d]\u201d that right, App. 879a, counsel can hardly be blamed for declining to test the court\u2019s boundaries at every turn. Moreover, the court\u2019s perfunctory exchanges with prospective jurors often gave counsel no clear avenue for further permissible inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b735-21\">. Although the District Court underestimated the extent of the community hostility, it was certainly aware of the ubiquity of the pretrial publicity, acknowledging that \u201call of us have been exposed to substantial media attention about this case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 841a. The court even made an offhand remark about one of the prior Enron prosecutions, \u201cthe Nigerian barge case,\u201d apparently expecting that the prospective jurors would understand the reference. <em>Id., </em>at 840a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b735-22\">. Taking a more defendant-favorable line than most prospective jurors, Juror 17 stated that he \u201cthought the guy [on the radio] was pretty narrow minded,\u201d that \u201ceveryone should be considered innocent totally until they get a chance to come [to] court,\u201d and that the Government might have been overzealous in some of its Enron-related prosecutions. <em>Id., </em>at 863a-864a. He added, however, that he \u201cbelieve [d] there was probably some accounting fraud [at Enron] <em>.\"Id., </em>at 864a. The District Court denied the Government\u2019s request to remove Juror 17 for cause, but he did not ultimately sit on the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b736-11\">. The majority attempts to downplay the significance of Juror 29 by noting that she did not end up on the jury because Skilling used a peremptory challenge to remove her. See <em>ante, </em>at 395, n. 31, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 652. The majority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members who were not ultimately seated. See <em>ante, </em>at 389-390, n. 24, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 648. The comments of these venire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impartiality of the seated jurors, who were similarly \u201cpart of a community deeply hostile to the accused\u2019\u2019 and who may have been \u201cunwittingly . . . influenced by it.\u2019\u2019 <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 803, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975); see also <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 728, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961). Moreover, the fact that the District Court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as Juror 29 goes directly to the adequacy of its <em>voir dire. </em>If Juror 29 made it through to the end of the selection process, it is difficult to have confidence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how little is known about many of them. Cf. 6 LaFave \u00a7 23.2(f), at 288 (\u201cThe responses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the seated jurors who were familiar with the same publicity\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b737-10\">. The majority also notes that about two-thirds of the seated jurors and alternates (11 of 16) had no personal Enron connection. <em>Ante, </em>at 389-390, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 648-649, and n. 25. This means, of course, that five of the seated jurors and alternates did have connections to friends or colleagues who had lost jobs or money as a result of Enron\u2019s collapse\u2014a fact that does not strike me as particularly reassuring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b737-11\">. As one of Skilling\u2019s jury experts observed, there is a \u201ctendency in voir dire of jury pool members in high-profile cases to minimize their exposure to media, their knowledge of prejudicial information, and any biases they may have.\u2019\u2019 App. \u00b699, at 763a; see also <em>id., </em>\u00b695, at 637a (\u201cThose who perceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are reluctant to admit they cannot be fair\u2019\u2019). For this reason, the fact that \u201cnone of the seated jurors and alternates checked the \u2018yes\u2019 box\u2019\u2019 on the written questionnaire when \u201casked whether they \u2018ha[d] an opinion about [Skilling],\u2019 \u2019\u2019 <em>ante, </em>at 391, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 649, is of minimal significance, particularly given that the Causey plea and the impending trial received significant media coverage <em>after </em>the questionnaires were submitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\">. Many other seated jurors and alternates expressed similarly troubling sentiments. See, <em>e.g., </em>Supp. App. 57sa-60sa (Juror 20) (obtained Enron-related news from the Chronicle and \u201clocal news stations\u2019\u2019; blamed Enron\u2019s collapse on \u201c[n]ot enough corporate controls or effective audit procedures to prevent mismanagement of corporate assets\u2019\u2019; and was \u201cangry that so many people lost their jobs and their retirement savings\u2019\u2019); <em>id., </em>at 72sa-75sa (Juror 38) (followed Enron-related news from various sources, including the Chronicle; was \u201cangry about what happened\u2019\u2019; and \u201cfe[It] bad for those that worked hard and invested in the corporation] only to have it all taken away\u2019\u2019); <em>id., </em>at 117sa-118sa (Juror 64) (had several friends who worked at Enron and lost money; heard about the Enron cases on the news; described the collapse as \u201csad\u201d because \u201cpeople lost jobs [and] money\u2014lots of money\u2019\u2019; and believed the Government \u201cdid the right thing\u2019\u2019 in its investigation); <em>id., </em>at 177sa-181sa (Juror 87) (received Enron-related news from the Chronicle, Channel 13 news, the O\u2019Reilly Factor, Internet news sources, and friends, family, and co-workers; attributed Enron\u2019s collapse to \u201c[p]oor management [and] bad judgment\u2014greed\u2019\u2019; lamented \u201c[t]he sad state of the long-term loyal employees who are left with nothing in their retirement accounts\u2019\u2019; and \u201cadmire [d] [the] bravery\u2019\u2019 of Enron whistleblower Sherron Watkins \u201cfor bringing the situation to the attention of the public, which stopped things from getting worse\u2019\u2019); <em>id., </em>at 191sa-195sa (Juror 90) (heard Enron-related news from his wife, co-workers, and television; wrote that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not right for someone ... to take\u2019\u2019 away the money that the \u201csmall average worker saves . . . for retirement all his life\u2019\u2019; and described the Government\u2019s Enron investigation as \u201ca good thing\u2019\u2019); <em>id., </em>at 221sa-225sa (Juror 113) (obtained information about Enron from a \u201cco-worker [who] was in the jury pool for Mrs. Fastow\u2019s trial\u2019\u2019; worked for an employer who lost money as a result of Enron\u2019s collapse; found it \u201csad\u201d that the collapse had affected \u201csuch a huge number of people\u2019\u2019; and thought \u201csomeone had to be doing something illegal\u2019\u2019); <em>id., </em>at 236sa-237sa (Juror 116) (knew a colleague who lost money in Enron\u2019s collapse; obtained Enron-related news from the \u201cHouston Chronicle, Time Magazine, local TV news [and] radio, friends, family, [and] co-workers, [and] internet news sources\u2019\u2019; and noted that what stood out was \u201c[t]he employees and retirees that lost their savings\u2019\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b739-9\">. Several other jurors fell into this category. Juror 67 wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard about Enron from the Chronicle and \u201cInternet news sources.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 133sa.

Juror 99 wrote that she had not heard or read about the Enron cases and did not \u201cknow anything about\u2019\u2019 Enron. Supp. App. 210sa. The District Court questioned her for barely one minute. She stated that she had \u201c[n]ot really\u2019\u2019 learned more about the case, but added that she had heard \u201cthis and that\u2019\u2019 from her parents. App. 995a-996a. The court did not press further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b739-10\">. The majority suggests that the fact that Skilling \u201cchallenged only one of the seated jurors for cause\u2019\u2019 indicates that he did not believe the other jurors were biased. <em>Ante, </em>at 396, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 652. Our decisions, however, distinguish claims involving \u201cthe partiality of an individual juror\u2019\u2019 from antecedent claims directed at \u201cthe partiality of the trial jury as a whole.\u2019\u2019 <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1036, 104 S.
