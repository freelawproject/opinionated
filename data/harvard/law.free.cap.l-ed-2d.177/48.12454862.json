Where an amended pleading changes a party or a party\u2019s name, the Rule requires, among other things, that \u201cthe party to be brought in by amendment... knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1)(C). In this case, the Court of Appeals held that Rule 15(c) was not satisfied because the plaintiff knew or should have known of the proper defendant before filing her original complaint. The court also held that relation back was not appropriate because the plaintiff had unduly delayed in seeking to amend. We hold that  relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party to be added knew or should have known, not on the amending party\u2019s knowledge or its timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">On February 21, 2007, petitioner, Wanda Krupski, tripped over a cable and fractured her femur while she was on board the cruise ship Costa Magica. Upon her return home, she acquired counsel and began the process of seeking compensation</p>\n<p id=\"AyP\">[560 U.S. 542]</p>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">for her injuries. Krupski\u2019s passenger ticket\u2014 which explained that it was the sole contract between each passenger and the carrier, App. to Pet. for Cert. 37a\u2014included a variety of requirements for obtaining damages for an injury suffered on board one of the carrier\u2019s ships. The ticket identified the carrier as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-15\">\u201cCosta Crociere S. p. A., an Italian corporation, and all Vessels and other ships owned, chartered, operated, marketed or provided by Costa Crociere, S. p. A., and all officers, staff members, crew members, independent contractors, medical providers, concessionaires, pilots, suppliers, agents and assigns onboard said Vessels, and the manufacturers of said Vessels and all their component parts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 27a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">The ticket required an injured party to submit \u201cwritten notice of the claim with full particulars ... to the carrier or its duly authorized agent within 185 days after the date of injury.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 28a. The ticket further required any lawsuit to be \u201cfiled within one year after the date of injury\u201d and to be \u201cserved upon the carrier within 120 days after filing.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>For cases arising from voyages departing from or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>returning to a United States port in which the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000, the ticket designated the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Broward County, Florida, as the exclusive forum for a lawsuit. <em>Id., </em>at 36a. The ticket extended the \u201cdefenses, limitations and exceptions . . . that may be invoked by the CARRIER\u201d to \u201call persons who may act on behalf of the CARRIER or on whose behalf the CARRIER may act,\u201d including \u201cthe CARRIER\u2019S parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, representatives, agents, employees, servants, concessionaires and contractors\u201d as well as \u201cCosta Cruise Lines N. V.,\u201d identified as the \u201csales and marketing agent for the CARRIER and the issuer of this Passage Ticket Contract.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 29a. The front of the ticket listed</p>\n<p id=\"A_W\">[560 U.S. 543]</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Costa Cruise Lines\u2019 address in Florida and stated that an entity called \u201cCosta Cruises\u201d was \u201cthe first cruise company in the world\u201d to obtain a certain certification of quality. <em>Id., </em>at 25a.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">On July 2, 2007, Krupski\u2019s counsel notified Costa Cruise Lines of Krupski\u2019s claims. App. 69-70. On July 9, 2007, the claims administrator for Costa Cruise requested additional information from Krupski \u201c [i]n order to facilitate our future attempts to achieve a pre-litigation settlement.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a-24a. The parties were unable to reach a settlement, however, and on February 1, 2008\u2014three weeks before the 1-year limitations period expired\u2014Krupski filed a negligence action against Costa Cruise, invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint alleged that Costa Cruise \u201cowned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled\u201d the ship on which Krupski had injured herself; that Costa Cruise had extended to its passengers an invitation to enter onto the ship; and that Costa Cruise owed Krupski a duty of care, which it breached by failing to take steps that would have prevented her accident. App. 23-26. The complaint further stated that venue was proper under the passenger ticket\u2019s forum selection clause and averred that, by the July 2007 notice of her claims, Krupski had complied with the ticket\u2019s presuit requirements. <em>Id., </em>at 23. Krupski served Costa Cruise on February 4, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Over the next several months\u2014after the limitations period had expired\u2014Costa Cruise brought Costa Crociere\u2019s existence to Krupski\u2019s attention three times. First, on February 25, 2008, Costa Cruise filed its answer, asserting that it was not the proper defendant, as it was merely the North American sales and marketing agent for Costa Crociere, which was the actual carrier and vessel operator. <em>Id., </em>at 31. Second, on March 20, 2008, Costa Cruise listed Costa Crociere as an interested party in its corporate disclosure statement. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. Finally, on May 6, 2008,</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">[560 U.S. 544]</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Costa Cruise moved for summary judgment, again stating that Costa Crociere was the proper defendant. App. 5, 33-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">On June 13, 2008, Krupski responded to Costa Cruise\u2019s motion for summary judgment, arguing for limited discovery to determine whether Costa Cruise should be dismissed. According to Krupski, the following sources of information led her to believe Costa Cruise was the responsible party: The travel documents prominently identified Costa Cruise and gave its Florida address; Costa Cruise\u2019s Web site listed Costa Cruise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>in Florida as the United States office for the Italian company Costa Crociere; and the Web site of the Florida Department of State listed Costa Cruise as the only \u201cCosta\u201d company registered to do business in that State. <em>Id., </em>at 43-45, 56-59. Krupski also observed that Costa Cruise\u2019s claims administrator had responded to her claims notification without indicating that Costa Cruise was not a responsible party. <em>Id., </em>at 45. With her response, Krupski simultaneously moved to amend her complaint to add Costa Crociere as a defendant. <em>Id., </em>at 41-42, 52-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">On July 2, 2008, after oral argument, the District Court denied Costa Cruise\u2019s motion for summary judgment without prejudice and granted Krupski leave to amend, ordering that Krupski effect proper service on Costa Crociere by September 16, 2008. <em>Id., </em>at 71-72. Complying with the court\u2019s deadline, Krupski filed an amended complaint on July 11, 2008, and served Costa Crociere on August 21, 2008. <em>Id., </em>at 73, 88-89. On that same date, the District Court issued an order dismissing Costa Cruise from the case pursuant to the parties\u2019 joint stipulation, Krupski apparently having concluded that Costa Cruise was correct that it bore no responsibility for her injuries. <em>Id., </em>at 85-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Shortly thereafter, Costa Crociere\u2014represented by the same counsel who had represented Costa Cruise, compare <em>id., </em>at 31, with <em>id., </em>at 100\u2014moved to dismiss, contending that the amended complaint did not relate back under</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">[560 U.S. 545]</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Rule 15(c) and was therefore untimely. The District Court agreed. App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a-22a. Rule 15(c), the court explained, imposes three requirements before an amended complaint against a newly named defendant can relate back to the original complaint. First, the claim against the newly named defendant must have arisen \u201cout of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out\u2014or attempted to be set out\u2014in the original pleading.\u201d Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 15(c)(1)(B), (C). Second, \u201cwithin the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint\u201d (which is ordinarily 120 days from when the complaint is filed, see Rule 4(m)), the newly named defendant must have \u201creceived such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). Finally, the plaintiff must show that, within the Rule 4(m) period, the newly named defendant \u201cknew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The first two conditions posed no problem, the court explained: The claim against Costa Crociere clearly involved the same occurrence as the original claim against Costa Cruise, and Costa Crociere had constructive notice of the action and had not shown that any unfair prejudice would result from relation back. App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a-18a. But the court found the third condition fatal to Krupski\u2019s attempt to relate back, concluding that Krupski had not made a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party. <em>Id., </em>at 18a-21a. Relying on Eleventh Circuit precedent, the court explained that the word \u201cmistake\u201d should not be construed to encompass a deliberate decision not to sue a party whose identity the plaintiff knew before the statute of limitations had run. Because Costa Cruise informed Krupski that Costa Crociere was the proper defendant in its answer, corporate disclosure statement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>and motion for summary judgment, and yet Krupski delayed for months in moving to</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">[560 U.S. 546]</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">amend and then in filing an amended complaint, the court concluded that Krupski knew of the proper defendant and made no mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The Eleventh Circuit affirmed in an unpublished <em>per curiam </em>opinion. <em>Krupski </em>v. <em>Costa Cruise Lines, N. V., LLC, </em>330 Fed. Appx. 892 (2009). Rather than relying on the information contained in Costa Cruise\u2019s filings, all of which were made after the statute of limitations had expired, as evidence that Krupski did not make a mistake, the Court of Appeals noted that the relevant information was located within Krupski\u2019s passenger ticket, which she had furnished to her counsel well before the end of the limitations period. Because the ticket clearly identified Costa Crociere as the carrier, the court stated, Krupski either knew or should have known of Costa Crociere\u2019s identity as a potential party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was therefore appropriate to treat Krupski as having chosen to sue one potential party over another. Alternatively, even assuming that she first learned of Costa Cro-ciere\u2019s identity as the correct party from Costa Cruise\u2019s answer, the Court of Appeals observed that Krupski waited 133 days from the time she filed her original complaint to seek leave to amend and did not file an amended complaint for another month after that. In light of this delay, the Court of Appeals concluded that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying relation back.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">We granted certiorari to resolve tension among the Circuits over the breadth of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 558 U.S. 1142, 130 S. Ct. 1133, 175 L. Ed. 2d 941 (2010), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">[560 U.S. 547]</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">\u201c(A) the law that provides the applicable statute of limitations allows relation back;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-13\">\u201c(B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out\u2014or attempted to be set out\u2014in the original pleading; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-14\">\u201c(C) the amendment changes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted, if Rule 15(c)(1)(B) is satisfied and if, within the period provided by Rule 4(m) for serving the summons and complaint, the party to be brought in by amendment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">\u201c(i) received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201c(ii) knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d Rule 15(c)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">In our view, neither of the Court of Appeals\u2019 reasons for denying relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) finds support in the text of the Rule. We consider each reason in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">[560 U.S. 548]</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">The Court of Appeals first decided that Krupski either knew or should have known of the proper party\u2019s identity and thus determined that she had made a deliberate choice instead of a mistake in not naming Costa Crociere as a party in her original pleading. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. By focusing on Krupski\u2019s knowledge, the Court of Appeals chose the wrong starting point. The question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is not whether Krupski knew or should have known the identity of Costa Crociere as the proper defendant, but whether Costa Crociere knew or should have known that it would have been named as a defendant but for an error. Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) asks what the prospective <em>defendant </em>knew or should have known during the Rule 4(m) period, not what the <em>plaintiff </em>knew or should have known at the time of filing her original complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Information in the plaintiffs possession is relevant only if it bears on the defendant\u2019s understanding of whether the plaintiff made a mistake regarding the proper party\u2019s identity. For purposes of that inquiry, it would be error to conflate knowledge of a party\u2019s existence with the absence of mistake. A mistake is \u201c[a]n error, misconception, or misunderstanding; an erroneous belief.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1092 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1446 (2002) (defining \u201cmistake\u201d as \u201ca misunderstanding of the meaning or implication of something\u201d; \u201ca wrong action or statement proceeding from faulty judgment,</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">[560 U.S. 549]</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">inadequate knowledge, or inattention\u201d; \u201can erroneous belief\u2019; or \u201ca state of mind not in accordance with the facts\u201d). That a plaintiff knows of a party\u2019s existence does not preclude her from making a mistake with respect to that party\u2019s identity. A plaintiff may know that a prospective defendant\u2014call him party A\u2014exists, while erroneously believing him to have the status of party B. Similarly, a plaintiff may know generally what party A does while misunderstanding the roles that party A and party B played in the \u201cconduct, transaction, or occurrence\u201d giving rise to her claim. If the plaintiff sues party B instead of party A under these circumstances, she has made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity\u201d notwithstanding her knowledge of the existence of both parties. The only question under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii), then, is whether party A knew or should have known that, absent some mistake, the action would have been brought against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Respondent urges that the key issue under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is whether the plaintiff made a deliberate choice to sue one party over another. Brief for Respondent 11-16. We agree that making a deliberate choice to sue one party instead of another while fully understanding the factual and legal differences between the two parties is the antithesis of making a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity. We disagree, however, with respondent\u2019s position that any time a plaintiff is aware of the existence of two parties and chooses to sue the wrong one, the proper defendant could reasonably believe that the plaintiff made no mistake. The reasonableness of the mistake is not itself at issue. As noted, a plaintiff might know that the prospective defendant exists but nonetheless harbor a misunderstanding about his status or role in the events giving rise to the claim at issue, and she may mistakenly choose to sue a different defendant based on that misimpression. That kind of deliberate but mistaken choice does not foreclose a finding that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) has been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">[560 U.S. 550]</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">This reading is consistent with the purpose of relation back: to balance the interests of the defendant protected by the statute of limitations with the preference expressed in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in general, and Rule 15 in particular, for resolving disputes on their merits. See, <em>e.g., </em>Advisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes 122; 3 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7\u00a7 15.02[1], 15.19[3] [a] (3d ed. 2009). A prospective defendant who legitimately believed that the limitations period had passed without any attempt to sue him has a strong interest in repose. But repose would be a windfall for a prospective defendant who understood, or who should have understood, that he escaped suit during the limitations period only because the plaintiff misunderstood a crucial fact about his identity. Because a plaintiffs knowledge of the existence of a party does not foreclose the possibility that she has made a mistake of identity about which that party should have been aware, such knowledge does not support that party\u2019s interest in repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Our reading is also consistent with the history of Rule 15(c)(1)(C). That provision was added in 1966 to respond to a recurring problem in suits against the Federal Government, particularly in the Social Security context. Advisory Committee\u2019s 1966 Notes 122. Individuals who had filed timely lawsuits challenging the administrative denial of benefits often failed to name the party identified in the statute as the proper defendant\u2014 the current Secretary of what was then the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\u2014and named instead the United States; the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare itself; the nonexistent \u201cFederal Security Administration\u201d; or a Secretary who had recently retired from office. <em>Ibid. </em>By the time the plaintiffs discovered their mistakes, the statute of limitations in many cases had expired, and the district courts denied the plaintiffs leave to amend on the ground that the amended complaints would not relate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>back. Rule 15(c) was therefore \u201camplified to provide a general solution\u201d to this problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">[560 U.S. 551]</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\"><em>Ibid. </em>It is conceivable that the Social Security litigants knew or reasonably should have known the identity of the proper defendant either because of documents in their administrative cases or by dint of the statute setting forth the filing requirements. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (1958 ed., Supp. III). Nonetheless, the Advisory Committee clearly meant their filings to qualify as mistakes under the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Respondent suggests that our decision in <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Adams USA, Inc., </em>529 U.S. 460, 120 S. Ct. 1579, 146 L. Ed. 2d 530 (2000), forecloses the reading of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) we adopt today. We disagree. In that case, Adams USA, Inc. (Adams), had obtained an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the corporation of which Donald Nelson was the president and sole shareholder. After Adams became concerned that the corporation did not have sufficient funds to pay the award, Adams sought to amend its pleading to add Nelson as a party and simultaneously moved to amend the judgment to hold Nelson responsible. The District Court granted both motions, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. We reversed, holding that the requirements of due process, as codified in Rules 12 and 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, demand that an added party have the opportunity to respond before judgment is entered against him. <em>Id., </em>at 465-467, 120 S. Ct. 1579, 146 L. Ed. 2d 530. In a footnote explaining that relation back does not deny the added party an opportunity to respond to the amended pleading, we noted that the case did not arise under the \u201cmistake clause\u201d of Rule 15(c):<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cRespondent Adams made no such mistake. It knew of Nelson\u2019s role and existence and, until it moved to amend its pleading,</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">[560 U.S. 552]</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">chose to assert its claim for costs and fees only against [Nelson\u2019s company].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 467, n. 1, 120 S. Ct. 1579, 146 L. Ed. 2d 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Contrary to respondent\u2019s claim, <em>Nelson </em>does not suggest that Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) cannot be satisfied if a plaintiff knew of the prospective defendant\u2019s existence at the time she filed her original complaint. In that case, there was nothing in the initial pleading suggesting that Nelson was an intended party, while there was evidence in the record (of which Nelson was aware) that Adams sought to add him only after learning that the company would not be able to satisfy the judgment. <em>Id., </em>at 463-464, 120 S. Ct. 1579, 146 L. Ed. 2d 530. This evidence countered any implication that Adams had originally failed to name Nelson because of any \u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity,\u201d and instead suggested that Adams decided to name Nelson only after the fact in an attempt to ensure that the fee award would be paid. The footnote merely observes that Adams had originally been under no misim-pression about the function Nelson played in the underlying dispute. We said, after all, that Adams knew of Nelson\u2019s \u201crole\u201d as well as his existence. <em>Id., </em>at 467, n. 1, 120 S. Ct. 1579, 146 L. Ed. 2d 530. Read in context, the footnote in <em>Nelson </em>is entirely con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>sistent with our understanding of the Rule: When the original complaint and the plaintiffs conduct compel the conclusion that the failure to name the prospective defendant in the original complaint was the result of a fully informed decision as opposed to a mistake concerning the proper defendant\u2019s identity, the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are not met. This conclusion is in keeping with our rejection today of the Court of Appeals\u2019 reliance on the plaintiffs knowledge to deny relation back.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The Court of Appeals offered a second reason why Krupski\u2019s amended complaint did not relate back: Krupski had unduly delayed in seeking to file, and in eventually filing, an amended complaint. 330 Fed. Appx., at 895. The Court of Appeals offered no support for its view that a plaintiffs dilatory</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">[560 U.S. 553]</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">conduct can justify the denial of relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C), and we find none. The Rule plainly sets forth an exclusive list of requirements for relation back, and the amending party\u2019s diligence is not among them. Moreover, the Rule mandates relation back once the Rule\u2019s requirements are satisfied; it does not leave the decision whether to grant relation back to the district court\u2019s equitable discretion. See Rule 15(c)(1) (\u201cAn amendment . . . <em>relates back . . </em>. when\u201d the three listed requirements are met (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The mandatory nature of the inquiry for relation back under Rule 15(c) is particularly striking in contrast to the inquiry under Rule 15(a), which sets forth the circumstances in which a party may amend its pleading before trial. By its terms, Rule 15(a) gives discretion to the district court in deciding whether to grant a motion to amend a pleading to add a party or a claim.  Following an initial period after filing a pleading during which a party may amend once \u201cas a matter of course,\u201d \u201ca party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave,\u201d which the court \u201cshould freely give . . . when justice so requires.\u201d Rules 15(a)(1)\u2014(2). We have previously explained that a court may consider a movant\u2019s \u201cundue delay\u201d or \u201cdilatory motive\u201d in deciding whether to grant leave to amend under Rule 15(a). <em>Foman </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S. Ct. 227, 9 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1962). As the contrast between Rule 15(a) and Rule 15(c) makes clear, however,  the speed with which a plaintiff moves to amend her complaint or files an amended complaint after obtaining leave to do so has no bearing on whether the amended complaint relates back. Cf. 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1498, pp. 142-143, and nn. 49-50 (2d ed. 1990 and Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Rule 15(c)(1)(C) does permit a court to examine a plaintiffs conduct during the Rule 4(m) period, but not in the way or for the purpose respondent or the Court of Appeals suggests. As we have explained, the question under Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">[560 U.S. 554]</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">15(c)(1)(C)(ii) is what the prospective defendant reasonably should have understood about the plaintiffs intent in filing the original complaint against the first defendant. To the extent the plaintiffs postfiling conduct informs the prospective defendant\u2019s understanding of whether the plaintiff initially made a \u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity,\u201d a court may consider the conduct. Cf. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Parry, </em>219 F.3d 25, 29 (CA1 2000) (\u201c[P]ost-filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>events occasionally can shed light on the plaintiffs state of mind at an earlier time\u201d and \u201ccan inform <em>a defendant\u2019s </em>reasonable beliefs concerning whether her omission from the original complaint represented a mistake (as opposed to a conscious choice)\u201d). The plaintiffs postfiling conduct is otherwise immaterial to the question whether an amended complaint relates back.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, we think it clear that the courts below erred in denying relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The District Court held that Costa Crociere had \u201cconstructive notice\u201d of Krupski\u2019s complaint within the Rule 4(m) period. App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a-17a. Costa Crociere has not challenged this finding. Because the complaint made clear that Krupski meant to sue the company that \u201cowned, operated, managed, supervised and controlled\u201d the ship on which she was injured, App. 23, and also indicated (mistakenly) that Costa Cruise performed those roles, <em>id., </em>at 23-27, Costa Crociere should have known, within the Rule 4(m) period, that it was not named as a</p>\n<p id=\"Avz\">[560 U.S. 555]</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">defendant in that complaint only because of Krupski\u2019s misunderstanding about which \u201cCosta\u201d entity was in charge of the ship\u2014clearly a \u201cmistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">Respondent contends that because the original complaint referred to the ticket\u2019s forum requirement and pre-suit claims notification procedure, Krupski was clearly aware of the contents of the ticket, and because the ticket identified Costa Crociere as the carrier and proper party for a lawsuit, respondent was entitled to think that she made a deliberate choice to sue Costa Cruise instead of Costa Cro-ciere. Brief for Respondent 13. As we have explained, however, that Krupski may have known the contents of the ticket does not foreclose the possibility that she nonetheless misunderstood crucial facts regarding the two companies\u2019 identities. Especially because the face of the complaint plainly indicated such a misunderstanding, respondent\u2019s contention is not persuasive. Moreover, respondent has articulated no strategy that it could reasonably have thought Krupski was pursuing in suing a defendant that was legally unable to provide relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Respondent also argues that Krupski\u2019s failure to move to amend her complaint during the Rule 4(m) period shows that she made no mistake in that period. <em>Id., </em>at 13-14. But as discussed, any delay on Krupski\u2019s part is relevant only to the extent it may have informed Costa Crociere\u2019s understanding during the Rule 4(m) period of whether she made a mistake originally. Krupski\u2019s failure to add Costa Crociere during the Rule 4(m) period is not sufficient to make reasonable any belief that she had made a deliberate and informed decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>not to sue Costa Crociere in the first instance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nothing in</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">[560 U.S. 556]</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Krupski\u2019s conduct during the Rule 4(m) period suggests that she failed to name Costa Crociere because of anything other than a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">It is also worth noting that Costa Cruise and Costa Crociere are related corporate entities with very similar names; \u201ccrociera\u201d even means \u201ccruise\u201d in Italian. Cassell\u2019s Italian Dictionary 137, 670 (1967). This interrelationship and similarity heighten the expectation that Costa Crociere should suspect a mistake has been made when Costa Cruise is named in a complaint that actually describes Costa Crociere\u2019s activities. Cf. <em>Morel </em>v. <em>DaimlerChrysler AG, </em>565 F.3d 20, 27 (CA1 2009) (where complaint conveyed plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to sue automobile manufacturer and erroneously named the manufacturer as Daimler-Chrysler Corporation instead of the actual manufacturer, a legally distinct but related entity named DaimlerChrysler AG, the latter should have realized it had not been named because of plaintiffs\u2019 mistake); <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Praxair, Inc., </em>494 F.3d 458, 473-475 (CA4 2007) (en banc) (where complaint named parent company Praxair, Inc., but described status of subsidiary company Praxair Services, Inc., subsidiary company knew or should have known it had not been named because of plaintiffs mistake). In addition, Costa Crociere\u2019s own actions contributed to passenger confusion over \u201cthe proper party\u201d for a lawsuit. The front of the ticket advertises that \u201cCosta Cruises\u201d has achieved a certification of quality, App. to Pet. for Cert. 25a, without clarifying whether \u201cCosta Cruises\u201d is Costa Cruise Lines, Costa Crociere, or some other related \u201cCosta\u201d company. Indeed, Costa Crociere is evidently aware that the difference between Costa Cruise and Costa Crociere can be confusing for cruise ship passengers. See, <em>e.g., Suppa </em>v. <em>Costa Crociere, S. p. A., </em>No. 07-60526-CIV, 2007 WL 4287508, *1 (SD Fla., Dec. 4, 2007) (denying Costa</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">[560 U.S. 557]</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Crociere\u2019s motion to dismiss the amended complaint where the original complaint had named Costa Cruise as a defendant after \u201cfind[ing] it simply inconceivable that Defendant Costa Cro-ciere was not on notice .. . that.. . but for the mistake in the original Complaint, Costa Crociere was the appropriate party to be named in the action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">In light of these facts, Costa Cro-ciere should have known that Krups-ki\u2019s failure to name it as a defendant in her original complaint was due to a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-15\">.

Because we reject the Court of Appeals\u2019 focus on the plaintiff s knowledge in the first instance, see <em>infra, </em>at 548-552, 177 L.
