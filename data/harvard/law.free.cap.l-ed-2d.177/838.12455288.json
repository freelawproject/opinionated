See <em>Rosenberger </em>v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., </em>515 U.S. 819, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995); <em>Widmar </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 102 S.

This case concerns a novel question regarding student activities at public universities: May a public law school condition its official recognition of a student group\u2014and the attendant use of school funds and facilities\u2014on the organization\u2019s agreement to open eligibility for membership and leadership to all students?</p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">In the view of petitioner Christian Legal Society (CLS), an accept-all-comers policy impairs its First Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion by prompting it, on pain of relinquishing the advantages of recognition, to accept members who do not share the organization\u2019s core beliefs about religion and sexual orientation. From the perspective of respondent Hastings College of the Law (Hastings or the Law School), CLS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>seeks special dispensation from an across-the-board open-access requirement designed to further the reasonable educational purposes underpinning the school\u2019s student-organization program.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">[561 U.S. 669]</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject CLS\u2019s First Amendment challenge. Compliance with Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy, we conclude, is a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on access to the student-organization forum. In requiring CLS\u2014in common with all other student organizations\u2014to choose between welcoming all students and forgoing the benefits of official recognition, we hold, Hastings did not transgress constitutional limitations. CLS, it bears emphasis, seeks not parity with other organizations, but a preferential exemption from Hastings\u2019 policy. The First Amendment shields CLS against state prohibition of the organization\u2019s expressive activity, however exclusionary that activity may be. But CLS enjoys no constitutional right to state subvention of its selectivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Founded in 1878, Hastings was the first law school in the University of California public school system. Like many institutions of higher education, Hastings encourages students to form extracurricular associations that \u201ccontribute to the Hastings community and experience.\u201d App. 349. These groups offer students \u201copportunities to pursue academic and social interests outside of the classroom [to] further their education\u201d and to help them \u201cdevelo[p] leadership skills.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Through its \u201cRegistered Student Organization\u201d (RSO) program, Hastings extends official recognition to student groups. Several benefits attend this school-approved status. RSOs are eligible to seek financial assistance from the Law School, which subsidizes their events using funds from a mandatory student-activity fee imposed on all students. <em>Id., </em>at 217. RSOs may also use Law-School channels to communicate with students: They may place announcements in a weekly Office-of-Student-Services newsletter, advertise events on designated bulletin boards, send e-mails using a Hastings-organization address, and participate in an annual</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">[561 U.S. 670]</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Student Organizations Fair designed to advance recruitment efforts. <em>Id., </em>at 216-219. In addition, RSOs may apply for permission to use the Law School\u2019s facilities for meetings and office space. <em>Id., </em>at 218-219. Finally, Hastings allows officially recognized groups to use its name and logo. <em>Id., </em>at 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">In exchange for these benefits, RSOs must abide by certain conditions. Only a \u201cnon-commercial organization whose membership is limited to Hastings students may become [an RSO].\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a. A prospective RSO must submit its bylaws to Hastings for approval, <em>id., </em>at 83a-84a; and if it intends to use the Law School\u2019s name or logo, it must sign a license agreement, App. 219. Critical here, all RSOs must undertake to comply with Hastings\u2019 \u201cPolicies and Regulations Applying to College Activities, Organizations and Students.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">The Law School\u2019s Policy on Nondiscrimination (N ondiscrimination Policy), which binds RSOs, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>\u201c[Hastings] is committed to a policy against legally impermissible, arbitrary or unreasonable discriminatory practices. All groups, including administration, faculty, student governments, [Hastings]-owned student residence facilities and programs sponsored by [Hastings], are governed by this policy of nondiscrimination. [Hastings\u2019] policy on nondiscrimination is to comply fully with applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-4\">\u201c[Hastings] shall not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation. This nondiscrimination policy covers admission, access and treatment in Hastings-sponsored programs and activities.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 220.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">[561 U.S. 671]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Hastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers: School-approved groups must \u201callow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions in the organization, regardless of [her] status or beliefs.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 221.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other law schools have adopted similar all-comers policies. See, <em>e.g., </em>Georgetown University Law Center, Office of Student Life: Student Organizations, available at http://www.law.georgetown.edu/ StudentLife/StudentOrgs/N ewGroup .htm (All Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and included in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (Membership in registered groups must be \u201copen to all students.\u201d); Hofstra Law School Student Handbook 2009-2010, p. 49, available at http://law.hofstra.edu/pdf/ StudentLife/StudentAffairs/Handbook/ stuhb_handbook.pdf (\u201c[Student] organizations are open to all students.\u201d). From Hastings\u2019 adoption of its Nondiscrimination Policy in 1990 until the events stirring</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">[561 U.S. 672]</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">this litigation, \u201cno student organization at Hastings . . . ever sought an exemption from the Policy.\u201d App. 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">In 2004, CLS became the first student group to do so. At the beginning of the academic year, the leaders of a predecessor Christian organization\u2014 which had been an RSO at Hastings for a decade\u2014formed CLS by affiliating with the national Christian Legal Society (CLS-National). <em>Id., </em>at 222-223, 225. CLS-National, an association of Christian lawyers and law students, charters student chapters at law schools throughout the country. <em>Id., </em>at 225. CLS chapters must adopt bylaws that, <em>inter alia, </em>require members and officers to sign a \u201cStatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>of Faith\u201d and to conduct their lives in accord with prescribed principles. <em>Id., </em>at 225-226; App. to Pet. for Cert. 101a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Among those tenets is the belief that sexual activity should not occur outside of marriage between a man and a woman; CLS thus interprets its bylaws to exclude from affiliation anyone who engages in \u201cunrepentant homosexual conduct.\u201d App. 226. CLS also excludes students who hold religious convictions different from those in the Statement of Faith. <em>Id., </em>at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">On September 17, 2004, CLS submitted to Hastings an application for RSO status, accompanied by all required documents, including the set of bylaws mandated by CLS-National. <em>Id., </em>at 227-228. Several days later, the Law School rejected the application; CLS\u2019s bylaws, Hastings explained, did not comply with the Nondiscrimination Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">[561 U.S. 673]</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">because CLS barred students based on religion and sexual orientation. <em>Id., </em>at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">CLS formally requested an exemption from the Nondiscrimination Policy, <em>id., </em>at 281, but Hastings declined to grant one. \u201c[T]o be one of our student-recognized organizations,\u201d Hastings reiterated, \u201cCLS must open its membership to all students irrespective of their religious beliefs or sexual orientation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 294. If CLS instead chose to operate outside the RSO program, Hastings stated, the school \u201cwould be pleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for its meetings and activities.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>CLS would also have access to chalkboards and generally available campus bulletin boards to announce its events. <em>Id., </em>at 219, 233. In other words, Hastings would do nothing to suppress CLS\u2019s endeavors, but neither would it lend RSO-level support for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Refusing to alter its bylaws, CLS did not obtain RSO status. It did, however, operate independently during the 2004-2005 academic year. CLS held weekly Bible-study meetings and invited Hastings students to Good Friday and Easter Sunday church services. <em>Id., </em>at 229. It also hosted a beach barbeque, Thanksgiving dinner, campus lecture on the Christian faith and the legal practice, several fellowship dinners, an end-of-year banquet, and other informal social activities. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">On October 22, 2004, CLS filed suit against various Hastings officers and administrators under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Its complaint alleged that Hastings\u2019 refusal to grant the organization RSO status violated CLS\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to free speech, expressive association, and free exercise of religion. The suit sought injunctive and declaratory relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>ruled in favor</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">[561 U.S. 674]</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">of Hastings. The Law School\u2019s all-comers condition on access to a limited public forum, the court held, was both reasonable and viewpoint neutral, and therefore did not violate CLS\u2019s right to free speech. App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a-38a.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">Nor, in the District Court\u2019s view, did the Law School impermissibly impair CLS\u2019s right to expressive association. \u201cHastings is not directly ordering CLS to admit [any] studen[t],\u201d the court observed, <em>id., </em>at 42a; \u201c[r]ather, Hastings has merely placed conditions on\u201d the use of its facilities and funds, <em>ibid. </em>\u201cHastings\u2019 denial of official recognition,\u201d the court added, \u201cwas not a substantial impediment to CLS\u2019s ability to meet and communicate as a group.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 49a.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The court also rejected CLS\u2019s Free Exercise Clause argument. \u201c[T]he Nondiscrimination Policy does not target or single out religious beliefs,\u201d the court noted; rather, the policy \u201cis neutral and of general applicability.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 63a. \u201cCLS may be motivated by its religious beliefs to exclude students based on their religion or sexual orientation,\u201d the court explained, \u201cbut that does not convert the reason for Hastings\u2019 [Nondiscrimination Policy] to be one that is religiously-based.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 63a-64a.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">On appeal, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in an opinion that stated, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-9\">\u201cThe parties stipulate that Hastings imposes an open membership rule on all student groups\u2014all groups must accept all comers as voting members even if those individuals disagree with the mission of the group. The conditions on recognition are therefore viewpoint neutral and reasonable. <em>Truth v. Kent Sch. Dist., </em>542 F.3d 634, 649-50 (9th Cir. 2008).\u201d <em>Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal. </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>319 Fed. Appx. 645, 645-646 (CA9 2009).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">We granted certiorari, 558 U.S. 1076, 130 S. Ct. 795, 175 L. Ed. 2d 558 (2009), and now affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">[561 U.S. 675]</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">Before considering the merits of CLS\u2019s constitutional arguments, we must resolve a preliminary issue: CLS urges us to review the Nondiscrimination Policy as written\u2014prohibiting discrimination on several enumerated bases, including religion and sexual orientation\u2014and not as a requirement that all RSOs accept all comers. The written terms of the Nondiscrimination Policy, CLS contends, \u201ctarge [t] solely those groups whose beliefs are based on religion or that disapprove of a particular kind of sexual behavior,\u201d and leave other associations free to limit membership and leadership to individuals committed to the group\u2019s ideology. Brief for Petitioner 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). For example, \u201c[a] political . . . group can insist that its leaders support its purposes and beliefs,\u201d CLS alleges, but \u201ca religious group cannot.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">CLS\u2019s assertion runs headlong into the stipulation of facts it jointly submitted with Hastings at the summary-judgment stage. In that filing, the parties specified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-16\">\u201cHastings requires that registered student organizations allow <em>any </em>student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions in the organization, regardless of [her] status or beliefs. Thus, for example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus cannot bar students <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>holding Republican political beliefs from becoming members or seeking leadership positions in the organization.\u201d App. 221 (Joint Stipulation \u00b618) (emphasis added; citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">[561 U.S. 676]</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Under the District Court\u2019s local rules, stipulated facts are deemed \u201cundisputed.\u201d Civil Local Rule 56-2 (ND Cal. 2010). See also Pet. for Cert. 2 (\u201cThe material facts of this case are undisputed.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Litigants, we have long recognized, \u201c[a]re entitled to have [their] case tried upon the assumption that . . . facts, stipulated into the record, were established.\u201d <em>H. Hackfeld &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>197 U.S. 442, 447, 25 S. Ct. 456, 49 L. Ed. 826 (1905).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This entitlement</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">[561 U.S. 677]</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">is the bookend to a party\u2019s undertaking to be bound by the factual stipulations it submits. See <em>post, </em>at 715, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 877 (Alito, J., dissenting) (agreeing that \u201cthe parties must be held to their Joint Stipulation\u201d). As a leading legal reference summarizes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b899-9\">\u201c[Factual stipulations are] binding and conclusive . . . , and the facts stated are not subject to subsequent variation. So, the parties will not be permitted to deny the truth of the facts stated, ... or to maintain a contention contrary to the agreed statement, ... or to suggest, on appeal, that the facts were other than as stipulated or that any material fact was omitted. The burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>is on the party seeking to recover to show his or her right from the facts actually stated.\u201d 83 C. J. S., Stipulations \u00a7 93 (2000) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">This Court has accordingly refused to consider a party\u2019s argument that contradicted a joint \u201cstipulation [entered] at the outset of th[e] litigation.\u201d <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System </em>v. <em>Southworth, </em>529 U.S. 217, 226, 120 S. Ct. 1346, 146 L. Ed. 2d 193 (2000). Time and again, the dissent races away from the facts to which CLS stipulated. See, <em>e.g., post, </em>at 707, 708, 710, 711-712, 713, 716, 728-729, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, 877-878, 885-886.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But  factual stipulations are \u201cformal concessions</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">[561 U.S. 678]</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">. . . that have the effect of withdrawing a fact from issue and dispensing wholly with the need for proof of the fact. Thus, a judicial admission . . . is conclusive in the case.\u201d 2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 254, p. 181 (6th ed. 2006) (footnote omitted). See also, <em>e.g., Oscanyan </em>v. <em>Arms Co., </em>103 U.S. 261, 263, 26 L. Ed. 539 (1881) (\u201cThe power of the court to act in the disposition of a trial upon facts conceded by counsel is as plain as its power to act upon the evidence produced.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">In light of the joint stipulation, both the District Court and the Ninth Circuit trained their attention on the constitutionality of the all-comers requirement, as described in the parties\u2019 accord. See 319 Fed. Appx., at 645-646; App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a; <em>id., </em>at 36a. We reject CLS\u2019s unseemly attempt to escape from the stipulation and shift its target to Hastings\u2019 policy as written. This opinion, therefore, considers only whether conditioning access to a student-organization forum on compliance with an all-comers policy violates the Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">In support of the argument that Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy treads on its First Amendment rights to free speech and</p>\n<p id=\"b900-12\">[561 U.S. 679]</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">expressive association, CLS draws on two lines of decisions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>First, in a progression of cases,  this Court has employed forum analysis to determine when a governmental entity, in regulating property in its charge, may place limitations on speech.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Recognizing a State\u2019s right \u201cto preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated,\u201d <em>Cornelius </em>v. <em>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court has permitted restrictions on access to a limited public forum, like the RSO program here, with this key caveat: Any access barrier must be reasonable and viewpoint neutral, <em>e.g., Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S., at 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. See also, <em>e.g., Good News Club </em>v. <em>Milford Central School, </em>533 U.S. 98, 106-107, 121 S. Ct. 2093, 150 L. Ed. 2d 151 (2001); <em>Lamb\u2019s Chapel </em>v. <em>Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., </em>508 U.S. 384, 392-393, 113 S. Ct. 2141, 124 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1993); <em>Perry Ed. Assn. </em>v. <em>Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (1983).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">[561 U.S. 680]</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Second, as evidenced by another set of decisions,  this Court has rigorously reviewed laws and regulations that constrain associational freedom. In the context of public accommodations, we have subjected restrictions on that freedom to close scrutiny; such restrictions are permitted only if they serve \u201ccompelling state interests\u201d that are \u201cunrelated to the suppression of ideas\u201d\u2014interests that cannot be advanced \u201cthrough . . . significantly less restrictive <em>[means].\u201d Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 623, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1984). See also, <em>e.g., Boy Scouts of America </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>530 U.S. 640, 648, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554 (2000). \u201cFreedom of association,\u201d we have recognized, \u201cplainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S., at 623, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462. Insisting that an organization embrace unwelcome members, we have therefore concluded, \u201cdirectly and immediately affects associational rights.\u201d <em>Dale, </em>530 U.S., at 659, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">CLS would have us engage each line of cases independently, but its expressive-association and free-speech arguments merge: <em>Who </em>speaks on its behalf, CLS reasons, colors <em>what </em>concept is conveyed. See Brief for Petitioner 35 (expressive association in this case is \u201cthe functional equivalent of speech itself\u2019). It therefore makes little sense to treat CLS\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>speech and association claims as discrete. See <em>Citizens Against Rent Control / Coalition for Fair Housing </em>v. <em>Berkeley, </em>454 U.S. 290, 300, 102 S. Ct. 434, 70 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1981). Instead, three observations lead us to conclude that our limited-public-forum precedents supply the appropriate framework for assessing both CLS\u2019s speech and association rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">First,  the same considerations that have led us to apply a less restrictive level of scrutiny to speech in limited public forums as compared to other environments, see <em>supra, </em>at 679, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 855, and n. 11, apply with equal force to expressive association occurring in limited public forums. As just noted, speech and expressive-association rights are closely linked. See <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S., at 622, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (Associational freedom is \u201cimplicit in the right to engage in activities protected by the First</p>\n<p id=\"ADHE\">[561 U.S. 681]</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Amendment.\u201d). When these intertwined rights arise in exactly the same context, it would be anomalous for a restriction on speech to survive constitutional review under our limited-public-forum test only to be invalidated as an impermissible infringement of expressive association. Accord Brief for State Universities et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>37-38. That result would be all the more anomalous in this case, for CLS suggests that its expressive-association claim plays a part auxiliary to speech\u2019s starring role. See Brief for Petitioner 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Second, and closely related, the strict scrutiny we have applied in some settings to laws that burden expressive association would, in practical effect, invalidate a defining characteristic of limited public forums\u2014 the State may \u201creserv[e] [them] for certain groups.\u201d <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S., at 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. See also <em>Perry Ed. Assn., </em>460 U.S., at 49, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794 (\u201cImplicit in the concept\u201d of a limited public forum is the State\u2019s \u201cright to make distinctions in access on the basis of. . . speaker identity.\u201d); <em>Cornelius, </em>473 U.S., at 806, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (\u201c[A] speaker may be excluded from\u201d a limited public forum \u201cif he is not a member of the class of speakers for whose especial benefit the forum was created.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">An example sharpens the tip of this point: Schools, including Hastings, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 83a, ordinarily, and without controversy, limit official student-group recognition to organizations comprising only students\u2014even if those groups wish to associate with nonstudents. See, <em>e.g., </em>Volokh, Freedom of Expressive Association and Government Subsidies, 58 Stan. L. Rev. 1919, 1940 (2006).  The same ground rules must govern both speech and association challenges in the limited-public-forum context, lest strict scrutiny trump a public university\u2019s ability to \u201cconfin [e] a [speech] forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created.\u201d <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S., at 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. See also <em>Healy, </em>408 U.S., at 189, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266 (\u201cAssociational activities need not be tolerated where they infringe reasonable campus rules.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">[561 U.S. 682]</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Third, this case fits comfortably within the limited-public-forum category, for CLS, in seeking what is effectively a state subsidy, faces only indirect pressure to modify its membership policies; CLS may exclude any person for any reason if it forgoes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>the benefits of official recognition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The expressive-association precedents on which CLS relies, in contrast, involved regulations that <em>compelled </em>a group to include unwanted members, with no choice to opt out. See, <em>e.g., </em>Dale, 530 U.S., at 648, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554 (regulation \u201cforc[ed] [the Boy Scouts] to accept members it [did] not desire\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S., at 623, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (\u201cThere can be no clearer example of an intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an association than\u201d forced inclusion of unwelcome participants.).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">In diverse contexts, our decisions have distinguished between policies that require action and those that withhold benefits. See, <em>e.g., Grove City College </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>465 U.S. 555, 575-576, 104 S. Ct. 1211, 79 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1984); <em>Bob Jones Univ. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>461</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">[561 U.S. 683]</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">U.S. 574, 602-604, 103 S. Ct. 2017, 76 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1983). Application of the less restrictive limited-public-forum analysis better accounts for the fact that Hastings, through its RSO program, is dangling the carrot of subsidy, not wielding the stick of prohibition. Cf. <em>Norwood </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>413 U.S. 455, 463, 93 S. Ct. 2804, 37 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1973) (\u201cThat the Constitution may compel toleration of private discrimination in some circumstances does not mean that it requires state support for such discrimination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">In sum, we are persuaded that our limited-public-forum precedents adequately respect both CLS\u2019s speech and expressive-association rights, and fairly balance those rights against Hastings\u2019 interests as property owner and educational institution. We turn to the merits of the instant dispute, therefore, with the limited-public-forum decisions as our guide.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">As earlier pointed out, <em>supra, </em>at 667-668, 678-679, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 848-849, 854-855, we do not write on a blank slate; we have three times before considered clashes between public universities and student groups seeking official recognition or its attendant benefits. First, in <em>Healy, </em>a state college denied school affiliation to a student group that wished to form a local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). 408 U.S., at 170, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266. Characterizing SDS\u2019s mission as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>violent and disruptive, and finding the organization\u2019s philosophy repugnant, the college completely banned the SDS chapter from campus; in its effort to sever all channels of communication between students and the group, university officials went so far as to disband a meeting of SDS members in a campus coffee shop. <em>Id., </em>at 174-176, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266. The  college, we noted, could require \u201cthat a group seeking official recognition affirm in advance its willingness to adhere to reasonable campus law,\u201d including \u201creasonable standards respecting conduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 193, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266. But a public educational institution exceeds constitutional bounds, we held, when it \u201crestrict[s] speech or association simply because</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">[561 U.S. 684]</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">it finds the views expressed by [a] group to be abhorrent.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 187-188, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">We later relied on <em>Healy </em>in <em>Widmar. </em>In that case, a public university, in an effort to avoid state support for religion, had closed its facilities to a registered student group that sought to use university space for religious worship and discussion. 454 U.S., at 264-265, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440.  \u201cA university\u2019s mission is education,\u201d we observed, \u201cand decisions of this Court have never denied a university\u2019s authority to impose reasonable regulations compatible with that mission upon the use of its campus and facilities.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 268, n. 5, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440. But because the university singled out religious organizations for disadvantageous treatment, we subjected the university\u2019s regulation to</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">[561 U.S. 685]</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">strict scrutiny. <em>Id., </em>at 269-270, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440. The school\u2019s interest \u201cin maintaining strict separation of church and State,\u201d we held, was not \u201csufficiently compelling to justify . . . [viewpoint] discrimination against. . . religious speech.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 270, 276, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Most recently and comprehensively, in <em>Rosenberger, </em>we reiterated that  a university generally may not with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>hold benefits from student groups because of their religious outlook. The officially recognized student group in <em>Rosenberger </em>was denied student-activity-fee funding to distribute a newspaper because the publication discussed issues from a Christian perspective. 515 U.S., at 825-827, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. By \u201cselect[ing] for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints,\u201d we held, the university had engaged in \u201cviewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum\u2019s limitations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 831, 830, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">In all three cases, we ruled that student groups had been unconstitutionally singled out because of their points of view.  \u201cOnce it has opened a limited [public] forum,\u201d we emphasized, \u201cthe State must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. The constitutional constraints on the boundaries the State may set bear repetition here: \u201cThe State may not exclude speech where its distinction is not reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum, . . . nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of . . . viewpoint.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">We first consider whether Hastings\u2019 policy is reasonable taking into account the RSO forum\u2019s function and \u201call the surrounding circumstances.\u201d <em>Cornelius, </em>473 U.S., at 809, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Our inquiry is shaped by the educational context in which it arises:  \u201cFirst Amendment rights,\u201d we have observed,</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">[561 U.S. 686]</p>\n<p id=\"b905-11\">\u201cmust be analyzed in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.\u201d <em>Widmar, </em>454 U.S., at 268, n. 5, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court is the final arbiter of the question whether a public university has exceeded constitutional constraints, and we owe no deference to universities when we consider that question. Cf. <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em>417 U.S. 817, 827, 94 S. Ct. 2800, 41 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1974) (\u201cCourts cannot, of course, abdicate their constitutional responsibility to delineate and protect fundamental liberties.\u201d). Cognizant that judges lack the on-the-ground expertise and experience of school administrators, however, we have cautioned courts in various contexts to resist \u201csubstitu\u00ed[ing] their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.\u201d <em>Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. </em>v. <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S. Ct. 3034, 73 L. Ed. 2d 690 (1982). See also, <em>e.g., Hazelwood School Dist. </em>v. <em>Kuhlmeier, </em>484 U.S. 260, 273, 108 S. Ct. 562, 98 L. Ed. 2d 592 (1988) (noting our \u201coft-expressed view that the education of the Nation\u2019s youth is primarily the responsibility of parents, teachers, and state and local school officials, and not of federal judges\u201d); <em>Healy, </em>408 U.S., at 180, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266 (\u201c[T]his Court has long recognized \u2018the need for affirming the comprehensive authority of the States and of school officials, consistent with fundamental constitutional safeguards, to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Des Moines Independent Commu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number><em>nity School Dist., </em>393 U.S. 503, 507, 89 S. Ct. 733, 21 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1969))).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">A college\u2019s commission\u2014and its concomitant license to choose among pedagogical approaches\u2014is not confined to the classroom, for extracurricular programs are, today, essential parts of the educational process. See <em>Board of Ed. of Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. </em>v. <em>Earls, </em>536 U.S. 822, 831, n. 4, 122 S. Ct. 2559, 153 L. Ed. 2d 735 (2002) (involvement in student groups is \u201ca significant contributor to the breadth and quality of the educational experience\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Schools, we have emphasized, enjoy \u201ca significant measure of authority over the type of officially recognized activities in</p>\n<p id=\"Alhv\">[561 U.S. 687]</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">which their students participate.\u201d <em>Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) </em>v. <em>Mergens, </em>496 U.S. 226, 240, 110 S. Ct. 2356, 110 L. Ed. 2d 191 (1990). We therefore \u201capproach our task with special caution,\u201d <em>Healy, </em>408 U.S., at 171, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266, mindful that Hastings\u2019 decisions about the character of its student-group program are due decent respect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">With appropriate regard for school administrators\u2019 judgment, we review the justifications Hastings offers in defense of its all-comers requirement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> First, the open-access policy</p>\n<p id=\"ApAM5\">[561 U.S. 688]</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">\u201censures that the leadership, educational, and social opportunities afforded by registered student organizations are available to all students.\u201d Brief for Hastings 32; see Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>11. Just as \u201cHastings does not allow its professors to host classes open only to those students with a certain status or belief,\u201d so the Law School may decide, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>reasonably in our view, \u201cthat the . . . educational experience is best promoted when all participants in the forum must provide equal access to all students.\u201d Brief for Hastings 32. RSOs, we count it significant, are eligible for financial assistance drawn from mandatory student-activity fees, see <em>supra, </em>at 669, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 849; the all-comers policy ensures that no Hastings student is forced to fund a group that would reject her as a member.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">Second, the all-comers requirement helps Hastings police the written terms of its Nondiscrimination Policy without inquiring into an RSO\u2019s motivation for membership restrictions. To bring the RSO program within CLS\u2019s view of the Constitution\u2019s limits, CLS proposes that Hastings permit exclusion because of <em>belief </em>but forbid discrimination due to <em>status. </em>See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. But that proposal would impose on Hastings a daunting labor. How should the Law School go about determining whether a student organization cloaked prohibited status exclusion in belief-based garb? If a hypothetical Male-Superiority Club barred a female student from running for its presidency, for example, how could the Law School tell whether the group rejected her bid because of her sex or because, by seeking to lead the club, she manifested a lack of belief in its fundamental philosophy?</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">[561 U.S. 689]</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">This case itself is instructive in this regard. CLS contends that it does not exclude individuals because of sexual orientation, but rather \u201con the basis of a conjunction of conduct and the belief that the conduct is not wrong.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 35-36 (emphasis deleted). Our decisions have declined to distinguish between status and conduct in this context. See <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 575, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003) (\u201cWhen homosexual <em>conduct </em>is made criminal by the law of the State, that declaration in and of itself is an invitation to subject homosexual <em>persons </em>to discrimination.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>id., </em>at 583, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\u201cWhile it is true that the law applies only to conduct, the conduct targeted by this law is conduct that is closely correlated with being homosexual. Under such circumstances, [the] law is targeted at more than conduct. It is instead directed toward gay persons as a class.\u201d); cf. <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic, </em>506 U.S. 263, 270, 113 S. Ct. 753, 122 L. Ed. 2d 34 (1993) (\u201cAtax on wearing yarmulkes is a tax on Jews.\u201d). See also Brief for Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc., et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>7-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Third, the Law School reasonably adheres to the view that an all-comers policy, to the extent it brings together individuals with diverse backgrounds and beliefs, \u201cencourages tolerance, cooperation, and learning among students.\u201d App. 349.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> And if the policy sometimes produces discord, Hastings can rationally rank among RSO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>program goals development of conflict-resolution skills, toleration, and readiness to find common ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Fourth, Hastings\u2019 policy, which incorporates\u2014in fact, subsumes\u2014state-law proscriptions on discrimination, conveys</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">[561 U.S. 690]</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">the Law School\u2019s decision \u201cto decline to subsidize with public monies and benefits conduct of which the people of California disapprove.\u201d Brief for Hastings 35; <em>id., </em>at 33-34 (citing Cal. Educ. Code Ann. \u00a7 66270 (West Supp. 2010) (prohibiting discrimination on various bases)).  State law, of course, may not <em>command </em>that public universities take action impermissible under the First Amendment. But so long as a public university does not contravene constitutional limits, its choice to advance state-law goals through the school\u2019s educational endeavors stands on firm footing.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">In sum, the several justifications Hastings asserts in support of its all-comers requirement are surely reasonable in light of the RSO forum\u2019s purposes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">The Law School\u2019s policy is all the more creditworthy in view of the \u201csubstantial alternative channels that remain open for [CLS-student] communication to take place.\u201d <em>Perry Ed. Assn., </em>460 U.S., at 53, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794.  If restrictions on access to a limited public forum are viewpoint discriminatory, the ability of a group to exist outside the forum would not cure the constitutional shortcoming. But when access barriers are viewpoint neutral, our decisions have counted it significant that other available avenues for the group to exercise its First Amendment rights lessen the burden created by those barriers. See <em>ibid.; Cornelius, </em>473 U.S., at 809, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567; <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Spock, </em>424 U.S. 828, 839, 96 S. Ct. 1211, 47 L. Ed. 2d 505 (1976); <em>Pell, </em>417 U.S., at 827-828, 94 S. Ct. 2800, 41 L. Ed. 2d 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">In this case, Hastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings and the use of chalkboards and generally available bulletin boards to advertise events. App. 232-233. Although CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of communication, see <em>supra, </em>at 669-670, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 849-850,</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">[561 U.S. 691]</p>\n<p id=\"b908-13\">the advent of electronic media and social-net-working sites reduces the importance of those channels. See App. 114-115 (CLS maintained a Yahoo! message group to disseminate information to students.); <em>Christian Legal Society </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>453 F.3d 853, 874 (CA7 2006) (Wood, J., dissenting) (\u201cMost universities and colleges, and most college-aged students, communicate through email, websites, and hosts like MySpace .... If CLS had its own website, any student at the school with access to Google\u2014that is, all of them\u2014could easily have found it.\u201d). See also Brief for Associated Students of the University of California, Hastings College of Law, as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>14-18 (describing host of ways CLS could communicate with Hastings\u2019 students outside official channels).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">Private groups, from fraternities and sororities to social clubs and secret societies, commonly maintain a presence at universities without official school affiliation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>record before us, CLS was similarly situated: It hosted a variety of activities the year after Hastings denied it recognition, and the number of students attending those meetings and events doubled. App. 224, 229-230. \u201cThe variety and type of alternative modes of access present here,\u201d in short, \u201ccompare favorably with those in other [limited public] forum cases where we have upheld restrictions on access.\u201d <em>Perry Ed. Assn., </em>460 U.S., at 53-54, 103 S. Ct. 948, 74 L. Ed. 2d 794. It is beyond dissenter\u2019s license, we note again, see <em>supra, </em>at 687-688, n. 17, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 860, constantly to maintain that nonrecognition of a student organization is equivalent to prohibiting its members from speaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">[561 U.S. 692]</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">CLS nevertheless deems Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy \u201cfrankly absurd.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 49. \u201cThere can be no diversity of viewpoints in a forum,\u201d it asserts, \u201cif groups are not permitted to form around viewpoints.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 50; accord <em>post, </em>at 730, 177 L.

This catchphrase confuses CLS\u2019s preferred policy with constitutional limitation\u2014the <em>advisability </em>of Hastings\u2019 policy does not control its <em>permissibility. </em>See <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>420 U.S. 308, 326, 95 S. Ct. 992, 43 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1975). Instead, we have repeatedly stressed that  a State\u2019s restriction on access to a limited public forum \u201cneed not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.\u201d <em>Cornelius, </em>473 U.S., at 808, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">CLS also assails the reasonableness of the all-comers policy in light of the RSO forum\u2019s function by forecasting that the policy will facilitate hostile takeovers; if organizations must open their arms to all, CLS contends, saboteurs will infiltrate groups to subvert their mission and message. This supposition strikes us as more hypothetical than real. CLS points to no history or prospect of RSO hijackings at Hastings. Cf. <em>National Endowment for Arts </em>v. <em>Finley, </em>524 U.S. 569, 584, 118 S. Ct. 2168, 141 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1998) (\u201c[W]e are reluctant ... to invalidate legislation on the basis of its hypothetical application to situations not before the Court.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Students tend to self-sort and presumably will not endeavor en masse to join\u2014let alone seek leadership positions in\u2014groups pursuing missions wholly at odds with their</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">[561 U.S. 693]</p>\n<p id=\"b909-10\">personal beliefs. And if a rogue student intent on sabotaging an organization\u2019s objectives nevertheless attempted a takeover, the members of that group would not likely elect her as an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">RSOs, moreover, in harmony with the all-comers policy, may condition eligibility for membership and leadership on attendance, the payment of dues, or other neutral requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>designed to ensure that students join because of their commitment to a group\u2019s vitality, not its demise. See <em>supra, </em>at 671, n. 2, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 850. Several RSOs at Hastings limit their membership rolls and officer slates in just this way. See, <em>e.g., </em>App. 192 (members must \u201c[p]ay their dues on a timely basis\u201d and \u201cattend meetings regularly\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 173 (members must complete an application and pay dues; \u201c[a]ny active member who misses a semester of regularly scheduled meetings shall be dropped from rolls\u201d); App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a (\u201cOnly Hastings students who have held membership in this organization for a minimum of one semester shall be eligible to be an officer.\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Hastings, furthermore, could reasonably expect more from its law students than the disruptive behavior CLS hypothesizes\u2014and to build this expectation into its educational approach. A reasonable policy need not anticipate and preemptively close off every opportunity for avoidance or manipulation. If students begin to exploit an all-comers policy by hijacking organizations to distort or destroy their missions, Hastings presumably would revisit and revise its policy. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41 (counsel for Hastings); Brief for Hastings 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Finally, CLS asserts (and the dissent repeats, <em>post, </em>at 733-734, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 888-889) that the Law School lacks any legitimate interest\u2014let</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">[561 U.S. 694]</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">alone one reasonably related to the RSO forum\u2019s purposes\u2014in urging \u201creligious groups not to favor coreligionists for purposes of their religious activities.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 43; <em>id., </em>at 50. CLS\u2019s analytical error lies in focusing on the benefits it must forgo while ignoring the interests of those it seeks to fence out: Exclusion, after all, has two sides. Hastings, caught in the crossfire between a group\u2019s desire to exclude and students\u2019 demand for equal access, may reasonably draw a line in the sand permitting <em>all </em>organizations to express what they wish but <em>no </em>group to discriminate in membership.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">We next consider whether Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">Although this aspect of limited-public-forum analysis has been the constitutional sticking point in our prior decisions, as earlier recounted, <em>supra, </em>at 683-685, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 857-859, we need not dwell on it here. It is, after all, hard to imagine a more viewpoint-neutral policy than one requiring <em>all </em>student groups to accept <em>all </em>comers. In contrast to <em>Healy, Widmar, </em>and <em>Rosenberger, </em>in which uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>versities singled out organizations for disfavored treatment because of their points of view, Hastings\u2019 all-comers requirement draws no distinction between groups based on their message or perspective. An all-comers</p>\n<p id=\"ayvo-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 695]</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">condition on access to RSO status, in short, is textbook viewpoint neutral.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Conceding that Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is \u201cnominally neutral,\u201d CLS attacks the regulation by pointing to its effect: The policy is vulnerable to constitutional assault, CLS contends, because \u201cit systematically and predictably burdens most heavily those groups whose viewpoints are out of favor with the campus mainstream.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 51; cf. <em>post, </em>at 706, 177 L.

This argument stumbles from its first step because  \u201c[a] regulation that serves purposes unrelated to the content of expression is deemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\u201d <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Rock Against Racism, </em>491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.

So long as all students have the <em>opportunity </em>to participate on equal terms, RSOs may require them, <em>inter alia, </em>to pay dues, maintain good attendance, refrain from gross misconduct, or pass a skill-based test, such as the writing competitions administered by law journals. See <em>ibid. </em>The dissent trumpets these neutral, generally applicable membership requirements, arguing that, in truth, Hastings has a \u201csome-comers,\u201d not an all-comers, policy. <em>Post, </em>at 707, 708, 713-714, 715, 727-728, 737, 177 L.

Hastings\u2019open-access policy, however, requires only that student organizations open eligibility for membership and leadership regardless of a student\u2019s status or beliefs; dues, attendance, skill measurements, and comparable uniformly applied standards are fully compatible with the policy.

In its briefs before the District Court and the Court of Appeals, CLS several times affirmed that Hastings imposes an all-comers rule on RSOs. See, <em>e.g., </em>Plaintiffs Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment in No. C 04 4484 JSW (ND Cal.), p. 4 (\u201cHastings interprets the [Nondiscrimination Policy] such that student organizations must allow <em>any </em>student, regardless of their status or beliefs, to participate in the group\u2019s activities and meetings and to become voting members and leaders of the group.\u2019\u2019); Brief for Appellant in No. 06-15956 (CA9), pp. 29-30 (\u201cHastings illustrates the application of the Nondiscrimination Policy by explaining that for the Hastings Democratic Caucus to gain recognition, it must open its leadership and voting membership to Republicans.\u2019\u2019). In a hearing before the District Court, CLS\u2019s counsel reiterated that \u201cit\u2019s important to understand what Hastings\u2019 policy is. According to . . . the stipulated facts, Hastings requires . . . that registered student organizations allow any student to participate, become a member or seek leadership positions in the organization regardless of their status or beliefs.\u2019\u2019 App. 438 (capitalization and internal quotation marks omitted). And at oral argument in this Court, counsel for CLS acknowledged that \u201cthe Court needs to reach the constitutionality <em>of the all-comers policy </em>as applied to CLS in this case.\u2019\u2019 Tr. of Oral Arg. 59 (emphasis added). We repeat, in this regard, that Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy is hardly novel. Other law schools have adopted similar requirements. See <em>supra, </em>at 671, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 850; Brief for Association of American Law Schools as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>20, n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b899-11\">. The dissent spills considerable ink attempting to create uncertainty about when the all-comers policy was adopted. See <em>post, </em>at 707, 708, 710, 711-712, 712, 713, 715, 716, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 872, 873, 874, 875, 875, 876, 877, 878. What counts, however, is the parties\u2019 unqualified agreement that the all-comers policy <em>currently </em>governs. CLS\u2019s suit, after all, seeks only declaratory and injunctive\u2014that is, prospective\u2014relief. See App. 80 (First Amended Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b899-12\">. Record evidence, moreover, corroborates the joint stipulation concerning Hastings\u2019 all-comers policy.

In an effort to undermine the stipulation, the dissent emphasizes a sentence in Hastings\u2019 answer to CLS\u2019s first amended complaint which, the dissent contends, casts doubt on Hastings\u2019 fidelity to its all-comers policy.

In context, Hastings\u2019 answer\u2014which responded to CLS\u2019s allegation that the Law School singles out religious groups for discriminatory treatment\u2014is sensibly read to convey that Hastings\u2019 policies and regulations apply to all groups equally. See App. 79 (denying that the Nondiscrimination Policy imposes on religious organizations restraints that are not applied to political, social, and cultural groups). In any event, the parties\u2019joint stipulation supersedes the answer, to the extent of any conflict between the two filings.

In conducting forum analysis, our decisions have sorted government property into three categories. First, in traditional public forums, such as public streets and parks, \u201cany restriction based on the content of . . . speech must satisfy strict scrutiny, that is, the restriction must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.\u2019\u2019 <em>Pleasant Grove City </em>v. <em>Summum, </em>555 U.S. 460, 469, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 172 L. Ed. 2d 853 (2009). Second, governmental entities create designated public forums when \u201cgovernment property that has not traditionally been regarded as a public forum is intentionally opened up for that purpose\u2019\u2019; speech restrictions in such a forum \u201care subject to the same strict scrutiny as restrictions in a traditional public forum.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 469-470, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 172 L. Ed. 2d 853. Third, governmental entities establish limited public forums by opening property \u201climited to use by certain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion of certain subjects.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 470, 129 S. Ct. 1125, 172 L. Ed. 2d 853.

Ct. 2338, 132 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1995). There, a veterans group sponsoring a St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade challenged a state law requiring it to allow gay individuals to march in the parade behind a banner celebrating their Irish heritage and sexual orientation. <em>Id., </em>at 572, 115 S. Ct. 2338, 132 L. Ed. 2d 487. In evaluating that challenge, the <em>Hurley </em>Court focused on the veterans group\u2019s interest in controlling the message conveyed by the organization. See <em>id., </em>at 573-581, 115 S. Ct. 2338, 132 L. Ed. 2d 487. Whether <em>Hurley </em>is best conceptualized as a speech or association case (or both), however, that precedent is of little help to CLS. <em>Hurley </em>involved the application of a statewide public-accommodations law to the most traditional of public forums: the street. That context differs markedly from the limited public forum at issue here: a university\u2019s application of an all-comers policy to its student-organization program.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b904-11\">. The dissent relies heavily on <em>Healy, post, </em>at 718-721, 177 L.

Ed. 2d, at 852-854, and correctly upholds the all-comers policy. I join its opinion without reservation. Because the dissent has volunteered an argument that the school\u2019s general Nondiscrimination Policy would be \u201cplainly\u201d unconstitutional if applied to this case, <em>post, </em>at 723, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 882 (opinion of Alito, J.), a brief response is appropriate. In my view, both policies are plainly legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The Hastings College of the Law\u2019s (Hastings) Nondiscrimination Policy contains boilerplate language used by institutions and workplaces across the country: It prohibits \u201cunlawful!]\u201d discrimination \u201con the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation.\u201d App. 220. Petitioner, the Hastings chapter of the Christian Legal Society (CLS), refused to comply. As the Court explains, <em>ante, </em>at 671-672, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 850-851, CLS was unwilling to admit members unless they affirmed their belief in certain Christian doctrines and refrained from \u201cparticipation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle,\u201d App. 146. CLS, in short, wanted to receive the school\u2019s formal recognition\u2014and the benefits that attend formal recognition\u2014while continuing to</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">[561 U.S. 699]</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">exclude gay and non-Christian students (as well as, it seems, students who advocate for gay rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">In the dissent\u2019s view, by refusing to grant CLS an exemption from the Nondiscrimination Policy, Hastings violated CLS\u2019s rights, for by proscribing unlawful discrimination on the basis of religion, the policy discriminates unlawfully on the basis of religion. There are numerous reasons why this counterintuitive theory is unsound. Although the First Amendment may protect CLS\u2019s discriminatory practices off campus, it does not require a public university to validate or support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\">As written, the Nondiscrimination Policy is content and viewpoint neutral. It does not reflect a judgment by school officials about the substance of any student group\u2019s speech. Nor does it exclude any would-be groups on the basis of their convictions. Indeed, it does not regulate expression or belief at all. The policy is \u201cdirected at the organization\u2019s activities rather than its philosophy,\u201d <em>Healy </em>v. <em>James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 188, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1972). Those who hold religious beliefs are not \u201csingled out,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 724, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 883 (Alito, J., dissenting); those who engage in discriminatory <em>conduct </em>based on someone else\u2019s religious status and belief are singled out.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Regardless of</p>\n<p id=\"AvzF\">[561 U.S. 700]</p>\n<p id=\"b913-13\">whether they are the product of secular or spiritual feeling, hateful or benign motives, all acts of religious dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>crimination are equally covered. The discriminator\u2019s beliefs are simply irrelevant. There is, moreover, no evidence that the policy was adopted because of any reason related to the particular views that religious individuals or groups might have, much less because of a desire to suppress or distort those views. The policy\u2019s religion clause was plainly meant to promote, not to undermine, religious freedom.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">To be sure, the policy may end up having greater consequence for religious groups\u2014whether and to what extent it will is far from clear <em>ex </em>ante\u2014inasmuch as they are more likely than their secular counterparts to wish to exclude students of particular faiths. But there is likewise no evidence that the policy was intended to cause harm to religious groups, or that it has in practice caused significant harm to their operations. And it is a basic tenet of First Amendment law that disparate impact does not, in itself, constitute viewpoint discrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dissent has thus given no reason to be skeptical of the basic design, function, or rationale of the Nondiscrimination Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">What the policy does reflect is a judgment that discrimination by school officials or organizations on the basis of certain</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">[561 U.S. 701]</p>\n<p id=\"b914-8\">factors, such as race and religion, is less tolerable than discrimination on the basis of other factors. This approach may or may not be the wisest choice in the context of a Registered Student Organization (RSO) program. But it is at least a reasonable choice. Academic administrators routinely employ antidiscrimi-nation rules to promote tolerance, understanding, and respect, and to safeguard students from invidious forms of discrimination, including sexual orientation discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applied to the RSO context, these values can, in turn, advance numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>ous pedagogical objectives. See <em>post, </em>at 705-706, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 871-872 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">It is critical, in evaluating CLS\u2019s challenge to the Nondiscrimination Policy, to keep in mind that an RSO program is a <em>limited </em>forum\u2014the boundaries of which may be <em>delimited </em>by the proprietor. When a religious association, or a secular association, operates in a wholly public setting, it must be allowed broad freedom to control its membership and its message, even if its decisions cause offense to outsiders. Profound constitutional problems would arise if the State of California tried to \u201cdemand that all Christian groups admit members who believe that Jesus was merely human.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 731, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 887 (Alito, J., dissenting). But the CLS chapter that brought this lawsuit does not want to be just a Christian group; it aspires to be a recognized student organization. The Hastings College of the Law is not a legislature. And no state actor has demanded that anyone do anything outside the confines of a discrete, voluntary academic program. Although it may be the case that to some \u201cuniversity students,</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">[561 U.S. 702]</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">the campus is their world,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 718, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 879 (internal quotation marks omitted), it does not follow that the campus ought to be equated with the public square.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">The campus is, in fact, a world apart from the public square in numerous respects, and religious organizations, as well as all other organizations, must abide by certain norms of conduct when they enter an academic community. Public universities serve a distinctive role in a modern democratic society. Like all specialized government entities, they must make countless decisions about how to allocate resources in pursuit of their role. Some of those decisions will be controversial; many will have differential effects across populations; virtually all will entail value judgments of some kind. As a general matter, courts should respect universities\u2019 judgments and let them manage their own affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The RSO forum is no different. It is not an open commons that Hastings happens to maintain. It is a mechanism through which Hastings confers certain benefits and pursues certain aspects of its educational mission. Having exercised its discretion to establish an RSO program, a university must treat all participants evenhandedly. But the university need not remain neutral\u2014indeed it could not remain neutral\u2014in determining which goals the program will serve and which rules are best suited to facilitate those goals. These are not legal questions but policy questions; they are not for the Court but for the university to make. When any given group refuses to comply with the rules, the RSO sponsor need not admit that group at the cost of undermining the program and the values reflected therein. On many levels, a university administrator has a \u201cgreater interest in the content of student activities than the police chief has in the content of a soapbox oration.\u201d <em>Widmar </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 280, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1981) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">In this case, petitioner excludes students who will not sign its State<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>ment of Faith or who engage in \u201cunrepentant homosexual conduct,\u201d App. 226. The expressive association argument it presses, however, is hardly limited to these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">[561 U.S. 703]</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Other groups may exclude or mistreat Jews, blacks, and women\u2014or those who do not share their contempt for Jews, blacks, and women. A free society must tolerate such groups. It need not subsidize them, give them its official imprimatur, or grant them equal access to law school facilities.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b913-14\">. The dissent appears to accept that Hastings may prohibit discrimination on the basis of religious <em>status, </em>though it rejects the notion that Hastings may do the same for religious <em>belief. </em>See, <em>e.g., post, </em>at 726, n. 5, 732-733, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 884, 887-888. If CLS sought to exclude a Muslim student in virtue of the fact that he \u201cis\u201d Muslim, the dissent suggests, there would be no problem in Hastings forbidding that. But if CLS sought to exclude the same student in virtue of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>he subscribes to the Muslim faith, Hastings must stand idly by. This proposition is not only unworkable in practice but also flawed in conception. A person\u2019s religion often simultaneously constitutes or informs a status, an identity, a set of beliefs and practices, and much else besides. (So does sexual orientation for that matter, see <em>ante, </em>at 689, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 861, notwithstanding the dissent\u2019s view that a rule excluding those who engage in \u201cunrepentant homosexual conduct,\u2019\u2019 App. 226, does not discriminate on the basis of status or identity, <em>post, </em>at 727, 177 L.

In a case about an antidiscrimination policy that, even if ill advised, is explicitly directed at <em>preventing </em>religious discrimination, it is rather hard to swallow the dissent\u2019s ominous closing remarks. See <em>post, </em>at 741, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 893 (suggesting that today\u2019s decision \u201cpoint[s] a judicial dagger at the heart of\u2019 religious groups in the United States (internal quotation marks omitted)). Although the dissent is willing to see pernicious antireligious motives and implications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>where there are none, it does not seem troubled by the fact that religious sects, unfortunately, are not the only social groups who have been persecuted throughout history simply for being who they are.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b916-6\">Justice Kennedy,</author>\n<p id=\"awo-dedup-0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">To be effective, a limited forum often will exclude some speakers based on their affiliation <em>(e.g., </em>student versus nonstudent) or based on the content of their speech, interests, and expertise <em>(e.g., </em>art professor not chosen as speaker for conference on public transit). When the government does exclude from a limited forum, however, other content-based judgments may be impermissible. For instance, an otherwise qualified and relevant speaker may not be excluded because of hostility to his or her views or beliefs. See <em>Healy </em>v. <em>James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 187-188, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">In <em>Rosenberger </em>v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., </em>515 U.S. 819, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995), the essential purpose of the limited forum was to facilitate the expression of differing views in the context of student publications. The forum was limited because it was confined: first, to student-run groups; and second, to publications. The forum was created in the long tradition of using newspapers and other publications to express differing views and also in the honored tradition of a university setting that stimulates the free exchange of ideas. See <em>id., </em>at 835, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (\u201c[I]n the University setting, . . . the State acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition\u201d). These considerations supported the Court\u2019s conclusion that, under the First Amendment, a limited forum for student-run publications did not permit the exclusion of a paper for the reason that it was devoted to expressing religious views.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\"><em>Rosenberger </em>is distinguishable from the instant case in various respects. Not least is that here the school policy in question is not content based either in its formulation or evident</p>\n<p id=\"Axsb\">[561 U.S. 704]</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">purpose; and were it shown to be otherwise, the case likely should have a different outcome. Here, the policy applies equally to all groups and views. And, given the stipulation of the parties, there is no basis for an allegation that the design or purpose of the rule was, by subterfuge, to discriminate based on viewpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">An objection might be that the all-comers policy, even if not so designed or intended, in fact makes it difficult for certain groups to express their views in a manner essential to their message. A group that can limit membership to those who agree in full with its aims and purposes may be more effective in delivering its message or furthering its expressive objectives; and the Court has recognized that this interest can be protected against governmental interference or regulation. See <em>Boy Scouts of America </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>530 U.S. 640, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554 (2000). By allowing like-minded students to form groups around shared identities, a school creates room for self-expression and personal development. See <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System </em>v. <em>Southworth, </em>529 U.S. 217, 229, 120 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Ct. 1346, 146 L. Ed. 2d 193 (2000) (\u201cThe University\u2019s whole justification for [its student activity program] is that it springs from the initiative of the students, who alone give it purpose and content in the course of their extracurricular endeavors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">In the instant case, however, if the membership qualification were enforced, it would contradict a legitimate purpose for having created the limited forum in the first place. Many educational institutions, including respondent Hastings College of the Law, have recognized that the process of learning occurs both formally in a classroom setting and informally outside of it. See <em>id., </em>at 233, 120 S. Ct. 1346, 146 L. Ed. 2d 193. Students may be shaped as profoundly by their peers as by their teachers. Extracurricular activities, such as those in the Hastings \u201cRegistered Student Organization\u201d program, facilitate interactions between students, enabling them to explore new points of view, to develop interests and talents, and to nurture a growing sense of self. See <em>Board of Ed. of Independent</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALWX\">[561 U.S. 705]</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\"><em>School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. </em>v. <em>Earls, </em>536 U.S. 822, 831, n. 4, 122 S. Ct. 2559, 153 L. Ed. 2d 735 (2002) (participation in extracurricular activities is \u201c \u2018a significant contributor to the breadth and quality of the educational experience\u2019 \u201d). The Hastings program is designed to allow all students to interact with their colleagues across a broad, seemingly unlimited range of ideas, views, and activities. See <em>Regents of Univ. of Cal. </em>v. <em>Bakke, </em>438 U.S. 265, 312, 313, n. 48, 98 S. Ct. 2733, 57 L. Ed. 2d 750 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.) (\u201c[A] great deal of learning . . . occurs through interactions among students . . . who have a wide variety of interests, talents, and perspectives; and who are able, directly or indirectly, to learn from their differences and to stimulate one another to reexamine even their most deeply held assumptions about themselves and their world\u201d (alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">Law students come from many backgrounds and have but three years to meet each other and develop their skills. They do so by participating in a community that teaches them how to create arguments in a convincing, rational, and respectful manner and to express doubt and disagreement in a professional way. A law school furthers these objectives by allowing broad diversity in registered student organizations. But these objectives may be better achieved if students can act cooperatively to learn from and teach each other through interactions in social and intellectual contexts. A vibrant dialogue is not possible if students wall themselves off from opposing points of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">The school\u2019s objectives thus might not be well served if, as a condition to membership or participation in a group, students were required to avow particular personal beliefs or to disclose private, off-campus behavior. Students whose views are in the minority at the school would likely fare worse in that regime. Indeed, were those sorts of requirements to become prevalent, it might undermine the principle that in a university community\u2014and in a law school community specifically\u2014speech is deemed persuasive based on its</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">[561 U.S. 706]</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">substance, not the identity of the speaker. The era of loyalty oaths is behind us. A school quite properly may conclude that allowing an oath or belief-affirming requirement, or an outside conduct requirement, could be divisive for student relations and inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>with the basic concept that a view\u2019s validity should be tested through free and open discussion. The school\u2019s policy therefore represents a permissible effort to preserve the value of its forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">In addition to a circumstance, already noted, in which it could be demonstrated that a school has adopted or enforced its policy with the intent or purpose of discriminating or disadvantaging a group on account of its views, petitioner also would have a substantial case on the merits if it were shown that the all-comers policy was either designed or used to infiltrate the group or challenge its leadership in order to stifle its views. But that has not been shown to be so likely or self-evident as a matter of group dynamics in this setting that the Court can declare the school policy void without more facts; and if there were a showing that in a particular case the purpose or effect of the policy was to stifle speech or make it ineffective, that, too, would present a case different from the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">These observations are offered to support the analysis set forth in the opinion of the Court, which I join.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b918-6\">Justice Alito,</author>\n<p id=\"AHqF\">with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">The proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express \u201cthe thought that we hate.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schwimmer, </em>279 U.S. 644, 654-655, 49 S. Ct. 448, 73 L. Ed. 889 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting). Today\u2019s decision rests on a very different principle: no freedom for expression that offends prevailing standards of political correctness in our country\u2019s institutions of higher learning.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">The Hastings College of the Law, a state institution, permits student organizations to register with the law school</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">[561 U.S. 707]</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">and severely burdens speech by unregistered groups. Hastings currently has more than 60 registered groups and, in all its history, has denied registration to exactly one: the Christian Legal Society (CLS). CLS claims that Hastings refused to register the group because the law school administration disapproves of the group\u2019s viewpoint and thus violated the group\u2019s free speech rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">Rejecting this argument, the Court finds that it has been Hastings\u2019 policy for 20 years that all registered organizations must admit <em>any </em>student who wishes to join. Deferring broadly to the law school\u2019s judgment about the permissible limits of student debate, the Court concludes that this \u201caccept-all-comers\u201d policy, <em>ante, </em>at 668, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 848, is both viewpoint neutral and consistent with Hastings\u2019 proclaimed policy of fostering a diversity of viewpoints among registered student groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">The Court\u2019s treatment of this case is deeply disappointing. The Court does not address the constitutionality of the very different policy that Hastings invoked when it denied CLS\u2019s application for registration. Nor does the Court address the constitutionality of the policy that Hastings now purports to follow. And the Court ignores strong evidence that the accept-all-comers policy is not viewpoint neutral because it was announced as a pretext to justify viewpoint discrimination. Brushing aside inconvenient precedent, the Court arms public educational institutions with a handy weapon for suppressing the speech of unpopular groups\u2014groups to which, as Hastings candidly puts it, these institutions \u201cdo not wish to . . . lend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>their name[s].\u201d Brief for Respondent Hastings College of the Law 11; see also <em>id., </em>at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The Court provides a misleading portrayal of this case. As related by the Court, (1) Hastings, for the past 20 years, has required any student group seeking registration to admit any student who wishes to join, <em>ante, </em>at 671-672, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 850-851; (2) the effects</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">[561 U.S. 708]</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">of Hastings\u2019 refusal to register CLS have been of questionable importance, see <em>ante, </em>at 690-691, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 862-863; and (3) this case is about CLS\u2019s desire to obtain \u201ca state subsidy,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 682, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 856. I begin by correcting the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">The Court bases all of its analysis on the proposition that the relevant Hastings\u2019 policy is the so-called accept-all-comers policy. This frees the Court from the difficult task of defending the constitutionality of either the policy that Hastings actually\u2014and repeatedly\u2014invoked when it denied registration, <em>i.e., </em>the school\u2019s written Nondiscrimination Policy, or the policy that Hastings belatedly unveiled when it filed its brief in this Court. Overwhelming evidence, however, shows that Hastings denied CLS\u2019s application pursuant to the Nondiscrimination Policy and that the accept-all-comers policy was nowhere to be found until it was mentioned by a former dean in a deposition taken well after this case began.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">The events that gave rise to this litigation began in 2004, when a small group of Hastings students sought to register a Hastings chapter of CLS, a national organization of Christian lawyers and law students. All CLS members must sign a Statement of Faith affirming belief in fundamental Christian doctrines, including the belief that the Bible is \u201cthe inspired Word of God.\u201d App. 226. In early 2004, the national organization adopted a resolution stating that \u201c[i]n view of the clear dictates of Scripture, unrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle is inconsistent with an affirmation of the Statement of Faith, and consequently may be regarded by CLS as disqualifying such an individual from CLS membership.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 146. The resolution made it clear that \u201ca sexually immoral lifestyle,\u201d in CLS\u2019s view, includes engaging in \u201cacts of sexual conduct outside of God\u2019s design for marriage between one man and one woman.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It was shortly after this resolution was passed that</p>\n<p id=\"AbBW\">[561 U.S. 709]</p>\n<p id=\"b919-12\">the Hastings chapter of CLS applied to register with the law school.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Hastings sponsors an active program of \u201cregistered student organizations\u201d (RSOs) pursuant to the law school\u2019s avowed responsibility to \u201censure an opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints\u201d and promote \u201cthe highest standards of. . . freedom of expression,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a, 74a. During the 2004-2005 school year, Hastings had more than 60 registered groups, including political groups <em>(e.g., </em>the Hastings Democratic Caucus and the Hastings Republicans), religious groups <em>(e.g., </em>the Hastings Jewish Law Students Association and the Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students), groups that promote social causes <em>(e.g., </em>both pro-choice and pro-life groups), groups organized around racial or ethnic identity <em>(e.g., </em>the Black Law Students Association, the Korean American Law Society, La Raza Law Students Association, and the Middle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Eastern Law Students Association), and groups that focus on gender or sexuality <em>(e.g., </em>the Clara Foltz Feminist Association and Students Raising Consciousness at Hastings). See App. 236-245; Brief for Petitioner 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Not surprisingly many of these registered groups were and are dedicated to expressing a message. For example, Silenced Right, a pro-life group, taught that \u201call human life from the moment of conception until natural death is sacred and has inherent dignity,\u201d App. 244, while Law Students for Choice aimed to \u201cdefend and expand reproductive rights,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 243. The American Constitution Society sought \u201cto counter ... a narrow conservative vision\u201d of \u201cAmerican law,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 236, and the UC Hastings Student Animal Defense Fund aimed \u201cat protecting the lives and advancing the interests of animals through the legal system,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Groups that are granted registration are entitled to meet on university grounds and to access multiple channels for communicating with students and faculty\u2014including posting messages on designated bulletin boards, sending mass</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">[561 U.S. 710]</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">e-mails to the student body, distributing material through the Student Information Center, and participating in the annual student organizations fair. App. to Pet. for Cert. 7a, 85a. They may also apply for limited travel funds, <em>id., </em>at 7a, which appear to total about $4,000 to $5,000 per year, App. 217\u2014or less than $85 per registered group. Most of the funds available to RSOs come from an annual student activity fee that every student must pay. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a-93a.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-8\">When CLS applied for registration, Judy Hansen Chapman, the Director of Hastings\u2019 Office of Student Services, sent an e-mail to an officer of the chapter informing him that \u201cCLS\u2019s bylaws did not appear to be compliant\u201d with the Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy, App. 228, 277, a written policy that provides in pertinent part that \u201c [t]he University of California, Hastings College of the Law shall not discriminate unlawfully on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sex or sexual orientation,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 220. As far as the record reflects, Ms. Chapman made no mention of an accept-all-applicants policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">A few days later, three officers of the chapter met with Ms. Chapman, and she reiterated that the CLS bylaws did not comply with \u201cthe religion and sexual orientation provisions of the Nondiscrimination Policy and that they would need to be amended in order for CLS to become a registered student organization.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 228. About a week later, Hastings sent CLS a letter to the same effect. <em>Id., </em>at 228-229, 293-295. On both of these occasions, it appears that not a word was said about an accept-all-comers policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">When CLS refused to change its membership requirements, Hastings denied its request for registration\u2014 thus making CLS the only student group whose application for registration has ever been rejected. Brief in Opposition 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">In October 2004, CLS brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the law school\u2019s dean and other school officials, claiming, among other things, that the law school, by</p>\n<p id=\"ach-dedup-1\">[561 U.S. 711]</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">enacting and enforcing the Nondiscrimination Policy, had violated CLS\u2019s First Amendment right to freedom of speech. App. 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">In May 2005, Hastings filed an an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>swer to CLS\u2019s first amended complaint and made an admission that is significant for present purposes. In its complaint, CLS had alleged that the Nondiscrimination Policy discriminates against religious groups because it prohibits those groups \u201cfrom selecting officers and members dedicated to a particular set of religious ideals or beliefs\u201d but \u201cpermits political, social and cultural student organizations to select officers and members dedicated to their organization\u2019s ideals and beliefs.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 79. In response, Hastings admitted that its Nondiscrimination Policy \u201cpermits political, social, and cultural student organizations to select officers and members who are dedicated to a particular set of ideals or beliefs.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 93. The Court states that \u201cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, as it relates to the RSO program, to mandate acceptance of all comers.\u201d Ante, at 671, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 850. But this admission in Hastings\u2019 answer shows that Hastings had not adopted this interpretation when its answer was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Within a few months, however, Hastings\u2019 position changed. In July 2005, Mary Kay Kane, then the dean of the law school, was deposed, and she stated: \u201cIt is my view that in order to be a registered student organization you have to allow all of our students to be members and full participants if they want to.\u201d App. 343. In a declaration filed in October 2005, Ms. Chapman provided a more developed explanation, stating: \u201cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy as requiring that student organizations wishing to register with Hastings allow any Hastings student to become a member and/or seek a leadership position in the organization.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Hastings claims that this accept-all-comers policy has existed since 1990 but points to no evidence that the policy was ever put in writing or brought to the attention of members</p>\n<p id=\"A2GN\">[561 U.S. 712]</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\">of the law school community prior to the dean\u2019s deposition. Indeed, Hastings has adduced no evidence of the policy\u2019s existence before that date. And while Dean Kane and Ms. Chapman stated, well after this litigation had begun, that Hastings had such a policy, neither they nor any other Hastings official has ever stated in a deposition, affidavit, or declaration when this policy took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-8\">Hastings\u2019 effort to portray the accept-all-comers policy as merely an interpretation of the Nondiscrimination Policy runs into obvious difficulties. First, the two policies are simply not the same: The Nondiscrimination Policy proscribes discrimination on a limited number of specified grounds, while the accept-all-comers policy outlaws all selectivity. Second, the Nondiscrimination Policy applies to everything that Hastings does, and the law school does not follow an accept-all-comers policy in activities such as admitting students and hiring faculty.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\">In an effort to circumvent this problem, the Court writes that \u201cHastings interprets the Nondiscrimination Policy, <em>as it relates to the RSO program, </em>to mandate acceptance of all comers.\u201d Ante, at 671, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 850 (emphasis added). This puts Hastings in the implausible position of maintaining that the Nondiscrimination Policy means one thing as applied to the RSO program and something quite different as applied to all of Hastings\u2019 other activities. But the Nondiscrimination Policy by its terms applies fully to all components of the law school, \u201cincluding administration [and] faculty.\u201d App. 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Third, the record is replete with evidence that, at least until Dean Kane unveiled the accept-all-comers policy in July 2005, Hastings routinely registered student groups with bylaws limiting membership and leadership positions to those who agreed with the groups\u2019 viewpoints. For example, the bylaws of the Hastings Democratic Caucus provided that \u201cany full-time student at Hastings may become a member of HDC <em>so long as they do not exhibit a consistent disregard, and lack of respect for the objective of the organization </em>as</p>\n<p id=\"Ay0D\">[561 U.S. 713]</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">stated in Article 3, Section 1.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a (emphasis added). The constitution of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America at Hastings provided that every member must \u201cadhere to the objectives of the Student Chapter as well as the mission of ATLA.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 110a. A student could become a member of the Vietnamese American Law Society so long as the student did not \u201cexhibit a consistent disregard and lack of respect for the objective of the organization,\u201d which centers on a \u201ccelebration] [of] Vietnamese culture.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 146a-147a. Silenced Right limited voting membership to students who \u201care committed\u201d to the group\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d of \u201cspreading] the pro-life message.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 142a-143a. La Raza limited voting membership to \u201cstudents of Raza background.\u201d App. 192. Since Hastings requires any student group applying for registration to submit a copy of its bylaws, see <em>id., </em>at 249-250, Hastings cannot claim that it was unaware of such provisions. And as noted, CLS was denied registration precisely because Ms. Chapman reviewed its bylaws and found them unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">We are told that, when CLS pointed out these discrepancies during this litigation, Hastings took action to ensure that student groups were in fact complying with the law school\u2019s newly disclosed accept-all-comers policy. For example, Hastings asked La Raza to revise its bylaws to allow all students to become voting members. App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. See also Brief for State of Michigan et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>2, n. 1 (relating anecdotally that Hastings recently notified the Hastings Democrats that \u201cto maintain the Club\u2019s standing as a student organization,\u201d it must \u201copen its membership to all students, irrespective of party affiliation\u201d). These belated remedial efforts suggest, if anything, that Hastings had no accept-all-comers policy until this litigation was well under way.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">Finally, when Hastings filed its brief in this Court, its policy, which had already evolved from a policy prohibiting certain specified forms of discrimination into an accept-all-comers</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">[561 U.S. 714]</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">policy, underwent yet another transformation. Now, Hastings claims that it does not really have an accept-all-comers policy; it has an accept-some-comers policy. Hastings\u2019 current policy, we are told, \u201cdoes not foreclose neutral and generally applicable membership requirements unrelated to \u2018status or beliefs.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent Hastings College of the Law 5. Hastings\u2019 brief goes on to note with seeming approval that some registered groups have imposed \u201ceven conduct requirements.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Hastings, however, has not told us which \u201cconduct requirements\u201d are allowed and which are not\u2014although presumably requirements regarding sexual conduct fall into the latter category.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">When this case was in the District Court, that court took care to address both the Nondiscrimination Policy and the accept-all-comers policy. See, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a-9a, 16a-17a, 21a-24a, 26a, 27a, 32a, 44a, 63a. On appeal, however, a panel of the Ninth Circuit, like the Court today, totally ignored the Nondiscrimination Policy. CLS\u2019s argument in the Ninth Circuit centered on the Nondiscrimination Policy, and CLS argued strenuously, as it had in the District Court, that prior to the former dean\u2019s deposition, numerous groups had been permitted to restrict membership to students who shared the groups\u2019 views.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the</p>\n<p id=\"APm8\">[561 U.S. 715]</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">Ninth Circuit disposed of CLS\u2019s appeal with a two-sentence, not-precedential opinion that solely addressed the accept-all-comers policy. <em>Christian Legal Soc. Chapter of Univ. of Cal. </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>319 Fed. Appx. 645-646 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Like the majority of this Court, the Ninth Circuit relied on the following Joint Stipulation, which the parties filed in December 2005, well after Dean Kane\u2019s deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b923-6\">\u201cHastings requires that registered student organizations allow any student to participate, become a member, or seek leadership positions in the organization, regardless of their status or beliefs.\u201d App. 221.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Citing the binding effect of stipulations, the majority sternly rejects what it terms \u201cCLS\u2019s unseemly attempt to escape from the stipulation and shift its target to [the Nondiscrimination Policy].\u201d Ante, at 678, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">I agree that the parties must be held to their Joint Stipulation, but the terms of the stipulation should be respected. What was admitted in the Joint Stipulation filed in December 2005 is that Hastings had an accept-all-comers policy. CLS did not stipulate that its application had been denied more than a year earlier pursuant to such a policy. On the contrary, the Joint Stipulation notes that the reason repeatedly given by Hastings at that time was that the CLS bylaws did not comply with <em>the Nondiscrimination Policy. See </em>App. 228-229. Indeed, the parties did not even stipulate that the accept-all-comers policy existed in the fall of 2004. In addition, Hastings itself is now attempting to walk away from this stipulation by disclosing that its real policy is an accept-some-comers policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">[561 U.S. 716]</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">The majority\u2019s insistence on the binding effect of stipulations contrasts sharply with its failure to recognize the binding effect of a party\u2019s admissions in an answer. See <em>American Title Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Lacelaw </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number><em>Corp., </em>861 F.2d 224, 226 (CA9 1988) (\u201cFactual assertions in pleadings and pretrial orders, unless amended, are considered judicial admissions conclusively binding on the party who made them\u201d); <em>Bakersfield Westar Ambulance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Community First Bank, </em>123 F.3d 1243, 1248 (CA9 1997) (quoting <em>Lacelaw, supra). </em>As noted above, Hastings admitted in its answer, which was filed prior to the former dean\u2019s deposition, that at least as of that time, the law school did not follow an accept-all-comers policy and instead allowed \u201cpolitical, social, and cultural student organizations to select officers and members who are dedicated to a particular set of ideals or beliefs.\u201d App. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">The Court also distorts the record with respect to the effect on CLS of Hastings\u2019 decision to deny registration. The Court quotes a letter written by Hastings\u2019 general counsel in which she stated that Hastings \u201c \u2018would be pleased to provide [CLS] the use of Hastings facilities for its meetings and activities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 673, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 851 (quoting App. 294). Later in its opinion, the Court reiterates that \u201cHastings offered CLS access to school facilities to conduct meetings,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 690, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 862, but the majority does not mention that this offer was subject to important qualifications. As Hastings\u2019 attorney put it in the District Court, Hastings told CLS: \u201c \u2018Hastings allows community groups to some degree to use its facilities, sometimes on a pay basis, I understand, if they\u2019re available after priority is given to registered organizations.\u2019 We offered that.\u201d App. 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The Court also fails to mention what happened when CLS attempted to take advantage of Hastings\u2019 offer. On August 19, 2005, the local CLS president sent an e-mail to Ms. Chapman requesting permission to set up an \u201cadvice</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">[561 U.S. 717]</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">table\u201d on a campus patio on August 23 and 24 so that members of CLS could speak with students at the beginning of the fall semester. <em>Id., </em>at 298. This request\u2014merely to set up a table on a patio\u2014could hardly have interfered with any other use of the law school\u2019s premises or cost the school any money. But although the request was labeled \u201ctime sensitive,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>Ms. Chapman did not respond until the dates in question had passed, and she then advised the student that all further inquiries should be made through CLS\u2019s attorney, <em>id., </em>at 297-298.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">In September 2005, CLS tried again. Through counsel, CLS sought to reserve a room on campus for a guest speaker who was scheduled to appear on a specified date. <em>Id., </em>at 302-303. Noting Ms. Chapman\u2019s tardy response on the prior occasion, the attorney asked to receive a response before the scheduled date, but once again no answer was given until after the date had passed. <em>Id., </em>at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Other statements in the majority opinion make it seem as if the denial of registration did not hurt CLS at all. The Court notes that CLS was able to hold Bible-study meetings and other events. <em>Ante, </em>at 673, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 851. And \u201c[although CLS could not take advantage of RSO-specific methods of communication,\u201d the Court states, \u201cthe advent of electronic media and social-networking sites reduces the importance of those channels.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 690-691, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 862-863.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">At the beginning of the 2005 school year, the Hastings CLS group had seven members, App. to Pet. for Cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>13a, so there can be no suggestion that the group flourished. And since one of CLS\u2019s principal claims is that it was subjected to discrimination based on its viewpoint, the majority\u2019s emphasis on CLS\u2019s ability to endure that discrimination\u2014by using private facilities and means of communication\u2014is quite amazing.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">This Court does not customarily brush aside a claim of unlawful discrimination with the observation that the effects of the discrimination were really not so bad. We have never</p>\n<p id=\"AG1v\">[561 U.S. 718]</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">before taken the view that a little viewpoint discrimination is acceptable. Nor have we taken this approach in other discrimination cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Finally, I must comment on the majority\u2019s emphasis on funding. According to the majority, CLS is \u201cseeking what is effectively a state subsidy,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 682, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 856, and the question presented in this case centers on the \u201cuse of school funds,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 668, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 848. In fact, funding plays a very small role in this case. Most of what CLS sought and was denied\u2014such as permission to set up a table on the law school patio\u2014would have been virtually cost free. If every such activity is regarded as a matter of funding, the First Amendment rights of students at public universities will be at the mercy of the administration. As CLS notes: \u201c[T]o university students, the campus is their world. The right to meet on campus and use campus channels of communication is at least as important to university students as the right to gather on the town square and use local communication forums is to the citizen.\u201d Reply Brief for Petitioner 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">To appreciate how far the Court has strayed, it is instructive to compare this case with <em>Healy </em>v. <em>James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1972), our only First Amendment precedent involving a public college\u2019s refusal to recognize a student group. The group in <em>Healy </em>was a local chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). When the students who applied for recognition of the chapter were asked by a college committee whether they would \u201c \u2018respond to issues of violence as other S.D.S. chapters have,\u2019 \u201d their answer was that their \u201c \u2018action would have to be dependent upon each issue.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 172-173, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266. They similarly refused to provide a definitive answer when asked whether they would be willing to \u201cuse any means possible\u201d to achieve their aims. <em>Id., </em>at 173, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266. The president of the college refused to allow the group to be recognized,</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">[561 U.S. 719]</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">concluding that the philosophy of the SDS was \u201cantithetical to the school\u2019s policies\u201d and that it was doubtful that the local chapter was independent of the national organization, the \u201c \u2018published aims and philosophy\u2019 \u201d of which included \u201c \u2018disruption and violence.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 174-175, and n. 4, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">The effects of nonrecognition in <em>Healy </em>were largely the same as those present here. The SDS was denied the use of campus facilities, as well as access to the customary means used for communication among the members of the college community. <em>Id., </em>at 176, 181-182, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">The lower federal courts held that the First Amendment rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>SDS chapter had not been violated, and when the case reached this Court, the college, much like today\u2019s majority, sought to minimize the effects of nonrecognition, arguing that the SDS members \u201cstill may meet as a group off campus, that they still may distribute written material off campus, and that they still may meet together informally on campus ... as individuals.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 182-183, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">This Court took a different view. The Court held that the denial of recognition substantially burdened the students\u2019 right to freedom of association. After observing that \u201c[t]he primary impediment to free association flowing from nonrecognition is the denial of use of campus facilities for meetings and other appropriate purposes,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 181, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266, the Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-5\">\u201cPetitioners\u2019 associational interests also were circumscribed by the denial of the use of campus bulletin boards and the school newspaper. If an organization is to remain a viable entity in a campus community in which new students enter on a regular basis, it must possess the means of communicating with these students. Moreover, the organization\u2019s ability to participate in the intellectual give and take of campus debate, and to pursue its stated purposes, is limited by denial of access to the customary media for communicating with the administration, faculty members, and other students.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-6\">[561 U.S. 720]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-7\">Such impediments cannot be viewed as insubstantial.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 181-182, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">It is striking that all of these same burdens are now borne by CLS. CLS is prevented from using campus facilities\u2014unless at some future time Hastings chooses to provide a timely response to a CLS request and allow the group, as a favor or perhaps in exchange for a fee, to set up a table on the patio or to use a room that would otherwise be unoccupied. And CLS, like the SDS in <em>Healy, </em>has been cut off from \u201cthe customary media for communicating with the administration, faculty members, and other students.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 181-182, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">It is also telling that the <em>Healy </em>Court, unlike today\u2019s majority, refused to defer to the college president\u2019s judgment regarding the compatibility of \u201csound educational policy\u201d and free speech rights. The same deference arguments that the majority now accepts were made in defense of the college president\u2019s decision to deny recognition in <em>Healy. </em>Respondents in that case emphasized that the college president, not the courts, had the responsibility of administering the institution and that the courts should allow him \u201c \u2018wide discretion ... in determining what actions are most compatible with its educational objectives.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondents in <em>Healy </em>v. <em>James, </em>O. T. 1971, No. 71-452, pp. 7-8. A supporting <em>amicus </em>contended that college officials \u201cmust be allowed a very broad discretion in formulating and implementing policies.\u201d Brief for Board of Trustees, California State Colleges 6. Another argued that universities should be permitted to impose restrictions on speech that would not be tolerated elsewhere. Brief for American Association of Presidents of Independent Colleges and Universities 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">The <em>Healy </em>Court would have none of this. Unlike the Court today, the <em>Healy </em>Court emphatically rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>proposition that \u201cFirst Amendment protections should apply with less force on college campuses than in the community at large.\u201d 408 U.S., at 180, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266. And on one key question after</p>\n<p id=\"alea-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 721]</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">another\u2014 whether the local SDS chapter was independent of the national organization, whether the group posed a substantial threat of material disruption, and whether the students\u2019 responses to the committee\u2019s questions about violence and disruption signified a willingness to engage in such activities\u2014the Court drew its own conclusions, which differed from the college president\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The <em>Healy </em>Court was true to the principle that when it comes to the interpretation and application of the right to free speech, we exercise our own independent judgment. We do not defer to Congress on such matters, see <em>Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>492 U.S. 115, 129, 109 S. Ct. 2829, 106 L. Ed. 2d 93 (1989), and there is no reason why we should bow to university administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">In the end, I see only two possible distinctions between <em>Healy </em>and the present case. The first is that <em>Healy </em>did not involve any funding, but as I have noted, funding plays only a small part in this case. And if <em>Healy </em>would otherwise prevent Hastings from refusing to register CLS, I see no good reason why the potential availability of funding should enable Hastings to deny all of the other rights that go with registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">This leaves just one way of distinguishing <em>Healy: </em>the identity of the student group. In <em>Healy, </em>the Court warned that the college president\u2019s views regarding the philosophy of the SDS could not \u201cjustify the denial of First Amendment rights.\u201d 408 U.S., at 187, 92 S. Ct. 2338, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266. Here, too, disapproval of CLS cannot justify Hastings\u2019 actions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">[561 U.S. 722]</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">The Court pays little attention to <em>Healy </em>and instead focuses solely on the question whether Hastings\u2019 registration policy represents a permissible regulation in a limited public forum. While I think that <em>Healy </em>is largely controlling, I am content to address the constitutionality of Hastings\u2019 actions under our limited public forum cases, which lead to exactly the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">In this case, the forum consists of the RSO program. Once a public university opens a limited public forum, it \u201cmust respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\u201d <em>Rosenberger </em>v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., </em>515 U.S. 819, 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1995). The university \u201cmay not exclude speech where its distinction is not \u2018reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Cornelius </em>v. <em>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S. Ct. 3439, 87 L. Ed. 2d 567 (1985)). And the university must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>maintain strict viewpoint neutrality. <em>Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System </em>v. <em>Southworth, </em>529 U.S. 217, 234, 120 S. Ct. 1346, 146 L. Ed. 2d 193 (2000); <em>Rosenberger, supra, </em>at 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">This requirement of viewpoint neutrality extends to the expression of religious viewpoints. In an unbroken line of decisions analyzing private religious speech in limited public forums, we have made it perfectly clear that \u201c[r]eligion is [a] viewpoint from which ideas are conveyed.\u201d <em>Good News Club </em>v. <em>Milford Central School, </em>533 U.S. 98, 112, and n. 4, 121 S. Ct. 2093, 150 L. Ed. 2d 151 (2001). See <em>Rosenberger, supra, </em>at 831, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700; <em>Lamb\u2019s Chapel </em>v. <em>Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., </em>508 U.S. 384, 393-394, 113 S. Ct. 2141, 124 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1993); <em>Widmar </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>454 U.S. 263, 277, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">We have applied this analysis in cases in which student speech was restricted because of the speaker\u2019s religious viewpoint, and we have consistently concluded that such restrictions constitute viewpoint discrimination. <em>E.g., Rosenberger, supra, </em>at 845-846, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700; <em>Widmar, supra, </em>at 267, n. 5, 269, 277, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440; see also <em>Good News Club, supra, </em>at 106-107, 109-110, 121 S. Ct. 2093, 150 L. Ed. 2d 151;</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">[561 U.S. 723]</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\"><em>Lamb\u2019s Chapel, supra, </em>at 392-393, 394, 113 S. Ct. 2141, 124 L. Ed. 2d 352. We have also stressed that the rules applicable in a limited public forum are particularly important in the university setting, where \u201cthe State acts against a background of tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition.\u201d <em>Rosenberger, supra, </em>at 835, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">Analyzed under this framework, Hastings\u2019 refusal to register CLS pursuant to its Nondiscrimination Policy plainly fails.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As previously noted, when Hastings refused to register CLS, it claimed that the CLS bylaws impermissibly discriminated on the basis of religion and sexual orientation.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">[561 U.S. 724]</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">As interpreted by Hastings and applied to CLS, both of these grounds constituted viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\"><em>Religion. </em>The First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>protects the right of \u201c \u2018expressive association\u2019 \u201d\u2014that is, the \u201cright to associate for the purpose of speaking.\u201d <em>Rumsfeld </em>v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., </em>547 U.S. 47, 68, 126 S. Ct. 1297, 164 L. Ed. 2d 156 (2006) (quoting <em>Boy Scouts of America </em>v. <em>Dale, </em>530 U.S. 640, 644, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554 (2000)). And the Court has recognized that \u201c[t]he forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the group\u2019s freedom of expressive association if the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group\u2019s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 648, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">With one important exception, the Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy respected that right. As Hastings stated in its answer, the Nondiscrimination Policy \u201cpermit[ted] political, social, and cultural student organizations to select officers and members who are dedicated to a particular set of ideals or beliefs.\u201d App. 93. But the policy singled out one category of expressive associations for disfavored treatment: groups formed to express a religious message. Only religious groups were required to admit students who did not share their views. An environmentalist group was not required to admit students who rejected global warming. An animal rights group was not obligated to accept students who supported the use of animals to test cosmetics. But CLS was required to admit avowed atheists. This was patent viewpoint discrimination. \u201cBy the very terms of the [Nondiscrimination Policy], the University . . . selected] for disfavored treatment those student [groups] with religious . . . viewpoints.\u201d <em>Rosenberger, supra, </em>at 831, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. It is no wonder that the Court makes no attempt to defend the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Unlike the Court, Justice Stevens attempts a defense, contending that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">[561 U.S. 725]</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">neutral. But his arguments are squarely contrary to established precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Justice Stevens first argues that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint neutral because it \u201cdoes not regulate expression or belief at all\u201d but instead regulates conduct. See <em>ante, </em>at 699, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 867 (concurring opinion). This Court has held, however, that the particular conduct at issue here constitutes a form of expression that is protected by the First Amendment. It is now well established that the First Amendment shields the right of a group to engage in expressive association by limiting membership to persons whose admission does not significantly interfere with the group\u2019s ability to convey its views. See <em>Dale, </em>648, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 623, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1984); see also <em>New York State Club Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>487 U.S. 1, 13, 108 S. Ct. 2225, 101 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1988) (acknowledging that an \u201cassociation might be able to show that it is organized for specific expressive purposes and that it will not be able to advocate its desired viewpoints nearly as effectively if it cannot confine its membership to those who share the same sex, for example, or the same religion\u201d); <em>Widmar, </em>454 U.S., at 268-269, 102 S. Ct. 269, 70 L. Ed. 2d 440 (\u201c[T]he First Amendment rights of speech and association extend to the campuses of state universities\u201d). Indeed, the opinion of the Court, which Justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Stevens joins, acknowledges this rule. See <em>ante, </em>at 680, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 855-856.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Justice Stevens also maintains that the Nondiscrimination Policy is viewpoint neutral because it prohibits all groups, both religious and secular, from engaging in religious speech. See <em>ante, </em>at 699-700, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 867-868. This argument is also contrary to established law. In <em>Rosenberger, </em>the dissent, which Justice Stevens joined, made exactly this argument. See 515 U.S., at 895-896, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700 (opinion of Souter, J.). The Court disagreed, holding that a policy that treated secular speech more favorably than religious speech discriminated on the</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">[561 U.S. 726]</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">basis of viewpoint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 831, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. The Court reaffirmed this holding in <em>Good News Club, </em>533 U.S., at 112, and n. 4, 121 S. Ct. 2093, 150 L. Ed. 2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Here, the Nondiscrimination Policy permitted membership requirements that expressed a secular viewpoint. See App. 93. (For example, the Hastings Democratic Caucus and the Hastings Republicans were allowed to exclude members who disagreed with their parties\u2019 platforms.) But religious groups were not permitted to express a religious viewpoint by limiting membership to students who shared their religious viewpoints. Under established precedent, this was viewpoint discrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">It bears emphasis that permitting religious groups to limit membership to those who share the groups\u2019 beliefs would not have the effect of allowing other groups to discriminate on the basis of religion. It would not mean, for example, that fraternities or sororities could exclude students on that basis. As our cases have recognized, the right of expressive association permits a group to exclude an applicant for membership</p>\n<p id=\"a6pd-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 727]</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">only if the admission of that person would \u201caf-fec[t] in a significant way the group\u2019s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\u201d <em>Dale, </em>530 U.S., at 648, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554. Groups that do not engage in expressive association have no such right. Similarly, groups that are dedicated to expressing a viewpoint on a secular topic (for example, a political or ideological viewpoint) would have no basis for limiting membership based on religion because the presence of members with diverse religious beliefs would have no effect on the group\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>ability to express its views. But for religious groups, the situation is very different. This point was put well by a coalition of Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Sikh groups: \u201cOf course there is a strong interest in prohibiting religious discrimination where religion is irrelevant. But it is fundamentally confused to apply a rule against religious discrimination to a religious association.\u201d Brief for American Islamic Congress et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>3.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><em>Sexual orientation. </em>The Hastings Nondiscrimination Policy, as interpreted by the law school, also discriminated on the basis of viewpoint regarding sexual morality. CLS has a particular viewpoint on this subject, namely, that sexual conduct outside marriage between a man and a woman is wrongful. Hastings would not allow CLS to express this viewpoint by limiting membership to persons willing to express a sincere agreement with CLS\u2019s views. By contrast, nothing in the Nondiscrimination Policy prohibited a group from expressing a contrary viewpoint by limiting membership to persons willing to endorse that group\u2019s beliefs. A Free Love Club could require members to affirm that they reject the traditional view of sexual morality to which CLS adheres. It is hard to see how this can be viewed as anything other than viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Hastings\u2019 current policy, as announced for the first time in the brief filed in this Court, fares no better than the policy that the law school invoked when CLS\u2019s application was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">[561 U.S. 728]</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">According to Hastings\u2019 brief, its new policy, contrary to the position taken by Hastings officials at an earlier point in this litigation, really does not require a student group to accept all comers. Now, Hastings explains, its policy allows \u201cneutral and generally applicable membership requirements unrelated to \u2018status or beliefs.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent Hastings College of the Law 5. As examples of permissible membership requirements, Hastings mentions academic standing, writing ability, \u201cdues, attendance, and <em>even conduct requirements.\u201d Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">It seems doubtful that Hastings\u2019 new policy permits registered groups to condition membership eligibility on whatever \u201cconduct requirements\u201d they may wish to impose. If that is the school\u2019s current policy, it is hard to see why CLS may not be registered, for what CLS demands is that members foreswear \u201cunrepentant participation in or advocacy of a sexually immoral lifestyle.\u201d App. 146. That should qualify as a conduct requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">If it does not, then what Hastings\u2019 new policy must mean is that registered groups may impose some, but not all, conduct requirements. And if that is the case, it is incumbent on Hastings to explain which conduct requirements are acceptable, which are not, and why CLS\u2019s requirement is not allowed. Hastings has made no effort to provide such an explanation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">I come now to the version of Hastings\u2019 policy that the Court has chosen to address. This is not the policy that Hastings invoked when CLS was denied registration. Nor is it the policy that Hastings now proclaims\u2014and presumably implements. It is a policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>that, as far as the record</p>\n<p id=\"ABWT\">[561 U.S. 729]</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">establishes, was in force only from the time when it was first disclosed by the former dean in July 2005 until Hastings filed its brief in this Court in March 2010. Why we should train our attention on this particular policy and not the other two is a puzzle. But in any event, it is clear that the accept-all-comers policy is not reasonable in light of the purpose of the RSO forum, and it is impossible to say on the present record that it is viewpoint neutral.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">Once a state university opens a limited forum, it \u201cmust respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.\u201d <em>Rosenberger, </em>515 U.S., at 829, 115 S. Ct. 2510, 132 L. Ed. 2d 700. Hastings\u2019 regulations on the registration of student groups impose only two substantive limitations: A group seeking registration must have student members and must be noncommercial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 82a-83a, Hastings Board of Directors, Policies and Regulations Applying to College Activities, Organizations and Students \u00a7 34.10 (June 22, 1990) (hereinafter Hastings Regulations). Access to the forum is not limited to groups devoted to particular purposes. The regulations provide that a group applying for registration must submit an official document including \u201ca statement of <em>its </em>purpose,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 83a (Hastings Regulations \u00a734.10.A.l (emphasis added)), but the regulations make no attempt to define the limits of acceptable purposes. The regulations do not require a group seeking registration to show that it has a certain number of members or that its program is of interest to any particular number of Hastings students. Nor do the regulations require that a group serve a need not met by existing groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">The regulations also make it clear that the registration program is not meant to stifle unpopular speech. They proclaim that \u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the Dean to ensure an ongoing opportunity for the expression of a variety of viewpoints.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 82a (Hastings Regulations \u00a7 33.11).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">[561 U.S. 730]</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">They also emphatically disclaim any endorsement of or responsibility for views that student groups may express. <em>Id., </em>at 85a (Hastings Regulations \u00a7 34.10.D).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-13\">Taken as a whole, the regulations plainly contemplate the creation of a forum within which Hastings students are free to form and obtain registration of essentially the same broad range of private groups that nonstudents may form off campus. That is precisely what the parties in this case stipulated: The RSO forum \u201cseeks to promote a diversity of viewpoints <em>among </em>registered student organizations, including viewpoints on religion and human sexuality.\u201d App. 216 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">The way in which the RSO forum actually developed corroborates this design. As noted, Hastings had more than 60 RSOs in 2004-2005, each with its own independently devised purpose. Some addressed serious social issues; others\u2014for example, the wine appreciation and ultimate Frisbee clubs\u2014were simply recreational. Some organizations focused on a subject but did not claim to promote a particular viewpoint on that subject (for example, the Association of Communications, Sports &amp; Entertainment Law); others were defined, not by subject, but by viewpoint. The forum did not have a single Party Politics Club; rather, it featured both the Hastings Democratic Caucus and the Hastings Republicans. There was no Reproductive Issues Club; the forum included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>separate pro-choice and pro-life organizations. Students did not see fit to create a Monotheistic Religions Club, but they have formed the Hastings Jewish Law Students Association and the Hastings Association of Muslim Law Students. In short, the RSO forum, true to its design, has allowed Hastings students to replicate on campus a broad array of private, independent, noncommercial organizations that is very similar to those that nonstudents have formed in the outside world.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">[561 U.S. 731]</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The accept-all-comers policy is antithetical to the design of the RSO forum for the same reason that a state-imposed accept-all-comers policy would violate the First Amendment rights of private groups if applied off campus. As explained above, a group\u2019s First Amendment right of expressive association is burdened by the \u201cforced inclusion\u201d of members whose presence would \u201caffec[t] in a significant way the group\u2019s ability to advocate public or private viewpoints.\u201d <em>Dale, </em>530 U.S., at 648, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554. The Court has therefore held that the government may not compel a group that engages in \u201cexpressive association\u201d to admit such a member unless the government has a compelling interest, \u201c \u2018unrelated to the suppression of ideas, that cannot be achieved through means significantly less restrictive of associational freedoms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S., at 623, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">There can be no dispute that this standard would not permit a generally applicable law mandating that private religious groups admit members who do not share the groups\u2019 beliefs. Religious groups like CLS obviously engage in expressive association, and no legitimate state interest could override the powerful effect that an accept-all-comers law would have on the ability of religious groups to express their views. The State of California surely could not demand that all Christian groups admit members who believe that Jesus was merely human. Jewish groups could not be required to admit anti-Semites and Holocaust deniers. Muslim groups could not be forced to admit persons who are viewed as slandering Islam.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">While there can be no question that the State of California could not impose such restrictions on all religious groups in the State, the Court now holds that Hastings, a state institution, may impose these very same requirements on students who wish to participate in a forum that is designed to foster the expression of diverse viewpoints. The Court lists four justifications offered by Hastings in defense of the accept-</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">[561 U.S. 732]</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">all-comers policy and, deferring to the school\u2019s judgment, <em>ante, </em>at 687, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 860, the Court finds all those justifications satisfactory, <em>ante, </em>at 687-690, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 860-862. If we carry out our responsibility to exercise our own independent judgment, however, we must conclude that the justifications offered by Hastings and accepted by the Court are insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">The Court first says that the accept-all-comers policy is reasonable because it helps Hastings to ensure that \u201c \u2018leadership, educational, and social opportunities\u2019 \u201d are afforded to all students. <em>Ante, </em>at 688, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 860 (quoting Brief for Respondent Hastings College of the Law 32). The RSO forum, however, is designed to achieve these laudable ends in a very different way\u2014by permitting groups of students, no matter how small, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>form the groups they want. In this way, the forum multiplies the opportunity for students to serve in leadership positions; it allows students to decide which educational opportunities they wish to pursue through participation in extracurricular activities; and it permits them to create the \u201csocial opportunities\u201d they desire by forming whatever groups they wish to create.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Second, the Court approves the accept-all-comers policy because it is easier to enforce than the Nondiscrimination Policy that it replaced. It would be \u201ca daunting labor,\u201d the Court warns, for Hastings to try to determine whether a group excluded a member based on belief as opposed to status. <em>Ante, </em>at 688, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 861; see also <em>ante, </em>at 699, n. 1, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 867-868 (opinion of Stevens, J.) (referring to the \u201cimpossible task of separating out belief-based from status-based religious discrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">This is a strange argument, since the Nondiscrimination Policy prohibits discrimination on substantially the same grounds as the antidiscrimi-nation provisions of many States,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> including California, and except for the inclusion of the prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation, the</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">[561 U.S. 733]</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Nondiscrimination Policy also largely tracks federal antidis-crimination laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, Hastings now willingly accepts greater burdens under its latest policy, which apparently requires the school to distinguish between certain \u201cconduct requirements\u201d that are allowed and others that are not. Nor is Hastings daunted by the labor of determining whether a club admissions exam legitimately tests knowledge or is a pretext for screening out students with disfavored beliefs. Asked at oral argument whether CLS could require applicants to pass a test on the Bible, Hastings\u2019 attorney responded: \u201cIf it were truly an objective knowledge test, it would be okay.\u201d Tr. of Oral Arg. 52. The long history of disputes about the meaning of Bible passages belies any suggestion that it would be an easy task to determine whether the grading of such a test was \u201cobjective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Third, the Court argues that the accept-all-comers policy, by bringing together students with diverse views, encourages tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the development of conflict-resolution skills. <em>Ante, </em>at 689, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 861. These are obviously commendable goals, but they are not undermined by permitting a religious group to restrict membership to persons who share the group\u2019s faith. Many religious groups impose such restrictions. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Agudath Israel of America as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>3 (\u201c[Biased upon millennia-old Jewish laws and traditions, Orthodox Jewish institutions . . . regularly differentiate between Jews and non-Jews\u201d). Such</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">[561 U.S. 734]</p>\n<p id=\"AX7r\">practices are not manifestations of \u201ccontempt\u201d for members of other faiths. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 703, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 870 (opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>of Stevens, J.) (invoking groups that have \u201ccontempt for Jews, blacks, and women\u201d). Nor do they thwart the objectives that Hastings endorses. Our country as a whole, no less than the Hastings College of the Law, values tolerance, cooperation, learning, and the amicable resolution of conflicts. But we seek to achieve those goals through \u201c[a] confident pluralism that conduces to civil peace and advances democratic consensus-building,\u201d not by abridging First Amendment rights. Brief for Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>35.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">Fourth, the Court observes that Hastings\u2019 policy \u201cincorporates\u2014in fact, subsumes\u2014state-law proscriptions on discrimination.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 689, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 862. Because the First Amendment obviously takes precedence over any state law, this would not justify the Hastings policy even if it were true\u2014but it is not. The only Hastings policy considered by the Court\u2014the accept-all-comers policy\u2014 goes far beyond any California anti-discrimination law. Neither Hastings nor the Court claims that California law demands that state entities must accept all comers. Hastings itself certainly does not follow this policy in hiring or student admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Nor is it at all clear that California law requires Hastings to deny registration to a religious group that limits membership to students who share the group\u2019s religious beliefs. Hastings cites no California court decision or administrative authority addressing this question. Instead, Hastings points to a statute prohibiting discrimination on specified grounds, including religion or sexual orientation, \u201cin any program or activity <em>conducted by\u201d </em>certain postsecondary educational institutions. Cal. Educ. Code Ann. \u00a7 66270 (West Supp. 2010) (emphasis added). Hastings, however, does not conduct the activities of the student groups it registers. Indeed, Hastings disclaims such responsibility, stating both in</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">[561 U.S. 735]</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">its regulations and its Handbook for Student Organizations that it <em>\u201cdoes not sponsor </em>student organizations and therefore does not accept liability for activities of student organizations.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 85a (Hastings Regulations \u00a7 34.10.D (emphasis added)); App. 250. In addition, as CLS notes, another provision of California law specifically exempts \u201cany funds that are used directly or indirectly for the benefit of student organizations\u201d from a ban on state funding of private groups that discriminate on any of the grounds listed in \u00a766270. See \u00a792150 (West Supp. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">The authority to decide whether \u00a7 66270 or any other provision of California law requires religious student groups at covered institutions to admit members who do not share the groups\u2019 religious views is of course a question of state law that we cannot resolve. The materials that have been brought to our attention, however, provide little support for the majority\u2019s suggested interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">In sum, Hastings\u2019 accept-all-comers policy is not reasonable in light of the stipulated purpose of the RSO forum: to promote a diversity of viewpoints \u201camong\u201d\u2014not within\u2014\u201cregistered student organizations.\u201d App. 216 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">The Court is also wrong in holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>that the accept-all-comers policy is viewpoint neutral. The Court proclaims that it would be \u201chard to imagine a more viewpoint-neutral policy,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 694, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 864, but I would not be so quick to jump to this conclusion. Even if it is assumed that the policy is</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">[561 U.S. 736]</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">viewpoint neutral on its face,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there is strong evidence in the record that the policy was announced as a pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The adoption of a facially neutral policy for the purpose of suppressing the expression of a particular viewpoint is viewpoint discrimination. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, </em>458 U.S. 527, 544, 102 S. Ct. 3211, 73 L. Ed. 2d 948 (1982) (\u201c[A] law neutral on its face still may be unconstitutional if motivated by a discriminatory purpose\u201d). A simple example illustrates this obvious point. Suppose that a hated student group at a state university has never been able to attract more than 10 members. Suppose that the university administration, for the purpose of preventing that group from using the school grounds for meetings, adopts a new rule under which the use of its facilities is restricted to groups with more than 25 members. Although</p>\n<p id=\"ARgi\">[561 U.S. 737]</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">this rule would be neutral on its face, its adoption for a discriminatory reason would be illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Here, CLS has made a strong showing that Hastings\u2019 sudden adoption and selective application of its accept-all-comers policy was a pretext for the law school\u2019s unlawful denial of CLS\u2019s registration application under the Nondiscrimination Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\"><em>Shifting policies. </em>When Hastings denied CLS\u2019s application in the fall of 2004, the only policy mentioned was the Nondiscrimination Policy. In July 2005, the former dean suggested in a deposition that the law school actually followed the very different accept-all-comers policy. In March of this year, Hastings\u2019 brief in this Court rolled out still a third policy. As is recognized in the employment discrimination context, where issues of pretext regularly arise, \u201c[s]ubstantial changes over time in [an] employer\u2019s proffered reason for its employment decision support a finding of pretext.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number><em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>University of Minnesota, </em>34 F.3d 698, 703 (CA8 1994); see also, <em>e.g., Aragon </em>v. <em>Republic Silver State Disposal Inc., </em>292 F.3d 654, 661 (CA9 2002); <em>Cicero </em>v. <em>Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc., </em>280 F.3d 579, 592 (CA6 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><em>Timing. </em>The timing of Hastings\u2019 revelation of its new policies closely tracks the law school\u2019s litigation posture. When Hastings denied CLS registration, it cited only the Nondiscrimination Policy. Later, after CLS alleged that the Nondiscrimination Policy discriminated against religious groups, Hastings unveiled its accept-all-comers policy. Then, after we granted certiorari and CLS\u2019s opening brief challenged the constitutionality\u2014and the plausibility\u2014of the accept-all-comers policy, Hastings disclosed a new policy. As is true in the employment context, \u201c[w]hen the justification for an adverse . . . action changes during litigation, that inconsistency raises an issue whether the proffered reason truly motivated the defendant\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\"><em>Lack of documentation. </em>When an employer has a written policy and then relies on a rule for which there is no written</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">[561 U.S. 738]</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">documentation, that deviation may support an inference of pretext. See, <em>e.g., Diaz </em>v. <em>Eagle Produce Ltd. Partnership, </em>521 F.3d 1201, 1214 (CA9 2008); <em>Rudin </em>v. <em>Lincoln Land Community College, </em>420 F.3d 712, 727 (CA7 2005); <em>Machinchick </em>v. <em>PB Power, Inc., </em>398 F.3d 345, 354, n. 29 (CA5 2005); <em>Russell </em>v. <em>TG Missouri Corp., </em>340 F.3d 735, 746 (CA8 2003); <em>Mohammed </em>v. <em>Callaway, </em>698 F.2d 395, 399-400, 401 (CA10 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Here, Hastings claims that it has had an accept-all-comers policy since 1990, but it has not produced a single written document memorializing that policy. Nor has it cited a single occasion prior to the dean\u2019s deposition when this putative policy was orally disclosed to either student groups interested in applying for registration or to the Office of Student Services, which was charged with reviewing the bylaws of applicant groups to ensure that they were in compliance with the law school\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\"><em>Nonenforcement. </em>Since it appears that no one was told about the accept-all-comers policy before July 2005, it is not surprising that the policy was not enforced. The record is replete with evidence that Hastings made no effort to enforce the all-comers policy until after it was proclaimed by the former dean. See, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 118a (Hastings Democratic Caucus); <em>id., </em>at 110a (Association of Trial Lawyers of America at Hastings); <em>id., </em>at 146a-147a (Vietnamese American Law Society); <em>id., </em>at 142a-143a (Silenced Right); App. 192 (La Raza). See generally <em>supra, </em>at 712-713, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 875-876. If the record here is not sufficient to permit a finding of pretext, then the law of pretext is dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">The Court\u2014understandably\u2014sidesteps this issue. The Court states that the lower courts did not address the \u201cargument that Hastings selectively enforces its all-comer policy,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that \u201cthis Court is not the proper forum to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>air the</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">[561 U.S. 739]</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">issue in the first instance,\u201d and that \u201c[o]n remand, the Ninth Circuit may consider CLS\u2019s pretext argument if, and to the extent, it is preserved.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 697-698, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Because the Court affirms the entry of summary judgment in favor of respondents, it is not clear how CLS will be able to ask the Ninth Circuit on remand to review its claim of pretext. And the argument that we should not address this issue of pretext because the Ninth Circuit did not do so is hard to take, given that the Ninth Circuit barely addressed anything, disposing of this case in precisely two sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">Neither of those two sentences addressed the \u201cnovel question,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 668, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 848, to which the bulk of this Court\u2019s opinion is devoted, <em>i.e., </em>whether the accept-all-comers policy is reasonable in light of the purposes of the RSO forum and is viewpoint neutral, see <em>ante, </em>at 683-697, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 857-866. If it is appropriate for us to consider that issue, then the Ninth Circuit\u2019s failure to address the issue of pretext should not stand in the way of review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">One final aspect of the Court\u2019s decision warrants comment. In response to the argument that the accept-all-comers policy would permit a small and unpopular group to be taken over by students who wish to silence its message, the Court states that the policy would permit a registered group to impose membership requirements \u201cdesigned to ensure that students join because of their commitment to a group\u2019s vitality, not its demise.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 693, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 864. With this concession, the Court tacitly recognizes that Hastings does not really have an accept-all-comers policy\u2014it has an accept-some-</p>\n<p id=\"AJoF\">[561 U.S. 740]</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">dissident-comers policy\u2014and the line between members who merely seek to change a group\u2019s message (who apparently must be admitted) and those who seek a group\u2019s \u201cdemise\u201d (who may be kept out) is hopelessly vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Here is an example. Not all Christian denominations agree with CLS\u2019s views on sexual morality and other matters. During a recent year, CLS had seven members. Suppose that 10 students who are members of denominations that disagree with CLS decided that CLS was misrepresenting true Christian doctrine. Suppose that these students joined CLS, elected officers who shared their views, ended the group\u2019s affiliation with the national organization, and changed the group\u2019s message. The new leadership would likely proclaim that the group was \u201cvital\u201d but rectified, while CLS, I assume, would take the view that the old group had suffered its \u201cdemise.\u201d Whether a change represents reform or transformation may depend very much on the eye of the beholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-13\">Justice Kennedy takes a similarly mistaken tack. He contends that CLS \u201cwould have a substantial case on the merits if it were shown that the all-comers policy was . . . used to infiltrate the group or challenge its leadership in order to stifle its views,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 706, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 872 (concurring opinion), but he does not explain on what ground such a claim could succeed. The Court holds that the accept-all-comers policy is view<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>point neutral and reasonable in light of the purposes of the RSO forum. How could those characteristics be altered by a change in the membership of one of the forum\u2019s registered groups? No explanation is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">In the end, the Court refuses to acknowledge the consequences of its holding. A true accept-all-comers policy permits small unpopular groups to be taken over by students who wish to change the views that the group expresses. Rules requiring that members attend meetings, pay dues, and behave politely, see <em>ante, </em>at 693, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 863-864, would not eliminate this threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">[561 U.S. 741]</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The possibility of such takeovers, however, is by no means the most important effect of the Court\u2019s holding. There are religious groups that cannot in good conscience agree in their bylaws that they will admit persons who do not share their faith, and for these groups, the consequence of an accept-all-comers policy is marginalization. See Brief for Evangelical Scholars (Officers and 24 Former Presidents of the Evangelical Theological Society) et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>19 (affirmance in this case \u201cwill allow every public college and university in the United States to exclude ah evangelical Christian organizations\u201d); Brief for Agudath Israel of America as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>3, 8 (affirmance would \u201cpoint a judicial dagger at the heart of the Orthodox Jewish community in the United States\u201d and permit that community to be relegated to the status of \u201ca second-class group\u201d); Brief for Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>3 (affirmance \u201ccould significantly affect the ability of [affiliated] student clubs and youth movements ... to prescribe requirements for their membership and leaders based on religious beliefs and commitments\u201d). This is where the Court\u2019s decision leads.</p>\n<p id=\"pAVE\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"46\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAATAAAAAuAQAAAACHK3gBAAAAnklEQVR4nO2UOw6DQAxEvQilDQ095ARcIafKMeBGiOsgCjpWiGRSGGEXo4giaaJ19+wZf6TVBsiZyE6pkux/ZdHnCOyyyVcI/GK3Ne8sxUBlS+GcFAAA8XHFEQy026VvrAEFNQ1wQWC/9ObPYqCe0jcgoN2edWV+Birb7rNVKAAA5qW1MQwCREReY7RBDHRotrl1GHz3hYT0vyXZx3gDJqO4eBLe5U8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"304\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that today\u2019s decision is a serious setback for freedom of expression in this country. Our First Amendment reflects a \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964). Even if the United States is the only Nation that shares this commitment to the same extent, I would not change our law to conform to the international norm. I fear that the Court\u2019s decision marks a turn in that direction. Even those who find CLS\u2019s views objectionable should be concerned about the way the group has been treated\u2014by Hastings, the Court of Appeals, and now this Court. I can only hope that this decision will turn out to be an aberration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b923-12\">. CLS consistently argued in the courts below that Hastings had applied its registration policy in a discriminatory manner. See, <em>e.g., </em>Plaintiff\u2019s Notice of Motion for Summary Judgment and Memorandum in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment in No. C 04-4484-JSW (ND Cal.), pp. 6-7 (\u201cHastings allows other registered student organizations to require that their members and/or leaders agree with the organization\u2019s beliefs and purposes\u2019\u2019). CLS took pains to bring forward evidence to substantiate this claim. See <em>supra, </em>at 712-713, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 875-876. CLS\u2019s brief in the Court of Appeals reiterated its contention that Hastings had not required all RSOs to admit all student applicants. CLS\u2019s brief stated that \u201cHastings allows other registered student organizations to require that their leaders and/or members agree with the organization\u2019s beliefs and purposes.\u2019\u2019 Brief for Appellant in No. 06-15956 (CA9), pp. 14-15 (citing examples). See also <em>id., </em>at 54-55 (\u201cHastings routinely recognizes student groups that limit membership or leadership on the basis of belief. . . . Hastings\u2019 actual practice demonstrates that the forum is not reserved to student organizations that do not discriminate on the basis of belief\u2019). Responding to these arguments, the law school remarked that CLS \u201crepeatedly asserts that \u2018Hastings routinely recognizes student groups that limit membership or leadership on the basis of belief.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Brief for Appellees in No. 06-15956 (CA9), p. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-14\">. The Court attempts to distinguish <em>Healy </em>on the ground that there the college \u201cexplicitly denied the student group official recognition <em>because </em>of the group\u2019s viewpoint.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 684, n. 15, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 858. The same, however, is true here. CLS was denied recognition under the Nondiscrimination Policy because of the viewpoint that CLS sought to express through its membership requirements. See <em>supra, </em>at 710, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 874; <em>infra, </em>at 723-728, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 882-885. And there is strong evidence that Hastings abruptly shifted from the Nondiscrimination Policy to the accept-all-comers policy as a pretext for viewpoint discrimination. See <em>infra, </em>at 737-739, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 890-892.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b928-14\">. CLS sought a declaratory judgment that this policy is unconstitutional and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement. See App. 80. Particularly in light of Hastings\u2019 practice of changing its announced policies, these requests are not moot. It is well settled that the voluntary cessation of allegedly unlawful conduct does not moot a case in which the legality of that conduct is challenged. See <em>City of Mesquite </em>v. <em>Aladdin\u2019s Castle, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 283, 289, 102 S. Ct. 1070, 71 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1982); see also <em>Allee </em>v. <em>Medrano, </em>416 U.S. 802, 810-811, 94 S. Ct. 2191, 40 L. Ed. 2d 566 (1974); <em>DeFunis </em>v. <em>Odegaard, </em>416 U.S. 312, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1704, 40 L. Ed. 2d 164 (1974) <em>(per curiam). </em>If the rule were otherwise, the courts would be compelled to leave \u201c \u2018[t]he defendant . . . free to return to his old ways.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc., </em>393 U.S. 199, 203, 89 S. Ct. 361, 21 L. Ed. 2d 344 (1968) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>345 U.S. 629, 632, 73 S. Ct. 894, 97 L. Ed. 1303 (1953)). Here, there is certainly a risk that Hastings will \u201creturn to [its] old ways,\u2019\u2019 and therefore CLS\u2019s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the Nondiscrimination Policy are not moot. If, as the Court assumes, the parties stipulated that the only relevant policy is the accept-all-comers policy, then the District Court should not have addressed the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy. But the District Court approved both policies, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. That judgment remains binding on CLS, so it is only appropriate that CLS be permitted to challenge that determination now. The question of the constitutionality of the Nondiscrimination Policy falls comfortably within the question presented, and CLS raised that issue in its brief.
