The patent application claims a procedure for instructing buyers and sellers how to protect against the risk of price fluctuations in a discrete section of the economy. Three arguments are advanced for the proposition that the claimed invention is outside the scope of patent law: (1) It is not tied to a machine and does not transform an article; (2) it involves a method of conducting business; and (3) it is merely an abstract idea. The Court of Appeals ruled that the first mentioned of these, the so-called machine-or-transformation test, was the sole test to be used for determining the patent-ability of a \u201cprocess\u201d under the Patent Act, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">[561 U.S. 599]</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">Petitioners\u2019 application seeks patent protection for a claimed invention that explains how buyers and sellers of commodities in the energy market can protect, or hedge, against the risk of price changes. The key claims are claims 1 and 4. Claim 1 describes a series of steps instructing how to hedge risk. Claim 4 puts the concept articulated in claim 1 into a simple mathematical formula. Claim 1 consists of the following steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-12\">\u201c(a) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and consumers of said commodity wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said consumers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-14\">\u201c(b) identifying market participants for said commodity having a counter-risk position to said consumers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-15\">\u201c(c) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and said market participants at a second fixed rate such that said series of market participant transactions balances the risk position of said series of consumer transactions.\u201d App. 19-20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">The remaining claims explain how claims 1 and 4 can be applied to allow energy suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market demand for energy. For example, claim 2 claims \u201c [t]he method of claim 1 wherein said commodity is energy and said market participants are transmission distributors.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 20. Some of these claims also suggest familiar statistical approaches to determine the inputs to use in claim 4\u2019s equation. For example, claim 7 advises using well-known random analysis techniques to determine how much a seller will gain \u201cfrom each transaction under each historical weather pattern.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">The patent examiner rejected petitioners\u2019 application, explaining that it \u201c \u2018is not implemented on a specific apparatus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and solves a purely</p>\n<p id=\"A9u\">[561 U.S. 600]</p>\n<p id=\"b845-18\">mathematical problem without any limitation to a practical application, therefore, the invention is not directed to the technological arts.\u2019 \u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a. The Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed, concluding that the application involved only mental steps that do not transform physical matter and was directed to an abstract idea. <em>Id., </em>at 181a-186a.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard the case en banc and affirmed. The case produced five different opinions. Students of patent law would be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Chief Judge Michel wrote the opinion of the court. The court rejected its prior test for determining whether a claimed invention was a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101\u2014whether it produces a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete and tangible result\u2019 \u201d\u2014as articulated in <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Signature Financial Group, Inc., </em>149 F.3d 1368, 1373 (1998), and <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Excel Communications, Inc., </em>172 F.3d 1352, 1357 (1999). See <em>In re Bilski, </em>545 F.3d 943, 959-960, and n. 19 (CA Fed. 2008) (en banc). The court held that \u201c[a] claimed process is surely patent-eligible under \u00a7 101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 954. The court concluded this \u201cmachine-or-transformation test\u201d is \u201cthe sole test governing \u00a7 101 analy-ses,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 955, and thus the \u201ctest for determining patent eligibility of a process under \u00a7 101,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 956. Applying the machine-or-transformation test, the court held that petitioners\u2019 application was not patent eligible. <em>Id., </em>at 963-966. Judge Dyk wrote a separate concurring opinion, providing historical support for the court\u2019s approach. <em>Id., </em>at 966-976.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Three judges wrote dissenting opinions. Judge Mayer argued that petitioners\u2019 application was \u201cnot eligible for patent protection because it is directed to a method of conducting business.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 998. He urged the adoption of a \u201ctechnological standard for patentability.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1010. Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">[561 U.S. 601]</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Rader would have found petitioners\u2019 claims were an unpatentable abstract idea. <em>Id., </em>at 1011. Only Judge Newman disagreed with the court\u2019s conclusion that petitioners\u2019 application was outside of the reach of \u00a7 101. She did not say that the application should have been granted but only that the issue should be remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the application qualified as patentable under other provisions. <em>Id., </em>at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">This Court granted certiorari. 556 U.S. 1268, 129 S. Ct. 2735, 174 L. Ed. 2d 246 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">Section 101 defines the subject matter that may be patented under the Patent Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-14\">\u201cWhoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-15\">Section 101 thus specifies four independent categories of inventions or discoveries that are eligible for protection: processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. \u201cIn choosing such expansive terms . . . modified by the comprehensive \u2018any,\u2019 Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.\u201d <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Chakrabarty, </em>447 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>U.S. 303, 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1980). Congress took this permissive approach to patent eligibility to ensure that \u201c \u2018ingenuity should receive a liberal encouragement.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 308-309, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (quoting 5 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 75-76 (H. Washington ed. 1871)).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">The Court\u2019s precedents provide three specific exceptions to \u00a7 101\u2019s broad patent-eligibility principles: \u201claws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas.\u201d <em>Chakrabarty, supra, </em>at 309, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144. While these exceptions are not required by the statutory text, they are consistent with the notion that</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">[561 U.S. 602]</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">a patentable process must be \u201cnew and useful.\u201d And, in any case, these exceptions have defined the reach of the statute as a matter of statutory <em>stare decisis </em>going back 150 years. See <em>Le Roy </em>v. Tatham, 14 How. 156, 174-175, 14 L. Ed. 367 (1853). The concepts covered by these exceptions are \u201cpart of the storehouse of knowledge of all men . . . free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.\u201d <em>Funk Brothers Seed Co. </em>v. <em>Kalo Inoculant Co., </em>333 U.S. 127, 130, 68 S. Ct. 440, 92 L. Ed. 588 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">The \u00a7 101 patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold test. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive the Patent Act\u2019s protection the claimed invention must also satisfy \u201cthe conditions and requirements of this title.\u201d \u00a7 101. Those requirements include that the invention be novel, see \u00a7 102, nonob-vious, see \u00a7 103, and fully and particularly described, see \u00a7 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">The present case involves an invention that is claimed to be a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101.  Section 100(b) defines \u201cprocess\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">\u201cprocess, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">The Court first considers two proposed categorical limitations on \u201cprocess\u201d patents under \u00a7 101 that would, if adopted, bar petitioners\u2019 application in the present case: the machine-or-transformation test and the categorical exclusion of business method patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b847-12\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 formulation, an invention is a \u201cprocess\u201d only if: \u201c(1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.\u201d 545 F.3d, at 954. This Court has \u201cmore than once cautioned that  courts \u2018should not read into the patent laws limitations and conditions which the legislature has not expressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S. 175,</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">[561 U.S. 603]</p>\n<p id=\"b847-15\">182, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1981) (quoting <em>Chakrabarty, supra, </em>at 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144; some internal quotation marks omitted). In patent law, as in all statutory construction, \u201c[u]nless otherwise defined, \u2018words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diehr, supra, </em>at 182, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (quoting <em>Perrin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>444 U.S. 37, 42, 100 S. Ct. 311, 62 L. Ed. 2d 199 (1979)).  The Court has read the \u00a7 101 term \u201cmanufacture\u201d in accordance with dictionary definitions, see <em>Chakrabarty, supra, </em>at 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (citing <em>American Fruit Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brogdex Co., </em>283 U.S. 1, 11, 51 S. Ct. 328, 75 L. Ed. 801 (1931)), and approved a construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>of the term \u201ccomposition of matter\u201d consistent with common usage, see <em>Chakrabarty, supra, </em>at 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (citing <em>Shell Development Co. </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>149 F. Supp. 279, 280 (DC 1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Any suggestion in this Court\u2019s case law that the Patent Act\u2019s terms deviate from their ordinary meaning has only been an explanation for the exceptions for laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. See <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S. 584, 588-589, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1978). This Court has not indicated that the existence of these well-established exceptions gives the Judiciary <em>carte blanche </em>to impose other limitations that are inconsistent with the text and the statute\u2019s purpose and design. Concerns about attempts to call any form of human activity a \u201cprocess\u201d can be met by making sure the claim meets the requirements of \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Adopting the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test for what constitutes a \u201cprocess\u201d (as opposed to just an important and useful clue) violates these statutory interpretation principles. Section 100(b) provides that \u201c [t]he term \u2018process\u2019 means process, art or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\u201d The Court is unaware of any \u201c \u2018ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u2019 \u201d <em>Diehr, supra, </em>at 182, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, of the definitional terms \u201cprocess, art or method\u201d that would require these terms to be tied to a machine or to transform an article. Respondent urges the Court to look to the other patentable categories in \u00a7 101\u2014ma-chines, manufactures, and compositions of matter\u2014to confine the meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">[561 U.S. 604]</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">of \u201cprocess\u201d to a machine or transformation, under the doctrine of <em>noscitur a sociis. </em>Under this canon, \u201can ambiguous term may be given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>559 U.S. 460, 474, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 176 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). This canon is inapplicable here, for \u00a7 100(b) already explicitly defines the term \u201cprocess.\u201d See <em>Burgess </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. 124, 130, 128 S. Ct. 1572, 170 L. Ed. 2d 478 (2008) (  \u201cWhen a statute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that definition\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">The Court of Appeals incorrectly concluded that this Court has endorsed the machine-or-transformation test as the exclusive test. It is true that <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Deener, </em>94 U.S. 780, 788, 24 L. Ed. 139 (1877), explained that a \u201cprocess\u201d is \u201can act, or a series of acts, performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing.\u201d More recent cases, however, have rejected the broad implications of this dictum; and, in all events, later authority shows that it was not intended to be an exhaustive or exclusive test. <em>Gottschalk </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>409 U.S. 63, 70, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1972), noted that \u201c[t]ransformation and reduction of an article \u2018to a different state or thing\u2019 is the clue to the patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.\u201d At the same time, it explicitly declined to \u201chold that no process patent could ever qualify if it did not meet [machine-or-transformation] requirements.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 71, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273. <em>Flook </em>took a similar approach, \u201cassuming] that a valid process patent may issue even if it does not meet [the machine-or-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>transformation test].\u201d 437 U.S., at 588, n. 9, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\">This Court\u2019s precedents establish that the machine-or-transformation test is a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under \u00a7 101. The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for deciding whether an invention is a patent-eligible \u201cprocess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">[561 U.S. 605]</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">It is true that patents for inventions that did not satisfy the machine-or-transformation test were rarely granted in earlier eras, especially in the Industrial Age, as explained by Judge Dyk\u2019s thoughtful historical review. See 545 F.3d, at 966-976 (concurring opinion). But times change. Technology and other innovations progress in unexpected ways. For example, it was once forcefully argued that until recent times, \u201cwell-established principles of patent law probably would have prevented the issuance of a valid patent on almost any conceivable computer program.\u201d <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S., at 195, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (Stevens, J., dissenting). But this fact does not mean that unforeseen innovations such as computer programs are always unpatentable. See <em>id., </em>at 192-193, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (majority opinion) (holding a procedure for molding rubber that included a computer program is within patentable subject matter). Section 101 is a \u201cdynamic provision designed to encompass new and unforeseen inventions.\u201d <em>J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>534 U.S. 124, 135, 122 S. Ct. 593, 151 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2001). A categorical rule denying patent protection for \u201cinventions in areas not contemplated by Congress . . . would frustrate the purposes of the patent law.\u201d <em>Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S., at 315, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-9\">The machine-or-transformation test may well provide a sufficient basis for evaluating processes similar to those in the Industrial Age\u2014for example, inventions grounded in a physical or other tangible form. But there are reasons to doubt whether the test should be the sole criterion for determining the patentability of inventions in the Information Age. As numerous <em>amicus </em>briefs argue, the machine-or-transformation test would create uncertainty as to the patentability of software, advanced diagnostic medicine techniques, and inventions based on linear programming, data compression, and the manipulation of digital signals. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Business Software Alliance 24-25; Brief for Biotechnology Industry Organization et al. 14-27; Brief for</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">[561 U.S. 606]</p>\n<p id=\"b849-11\">Boston Patent Law Association 8-15; Brief for Houston Intellectual Property Law Association 17-22; Brief for Dolby Laboratories, Inc., et al. 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-12\">In the course of applying the machine-or-transformation test to emerging technologies, courts may pose questions of such intricacy and refinement that they risk obscuring the larger object of securing patents for valuable inventions without transgressing the public domain. The dissent by Judge Rader refers to some of these difficulties. 545 F.3d, at 1015. As a result, in deciding whether previously unforeseen inventions qualify as patentable \u201cprocess[es],\u201d it may not make sense to require courts to confine themselves to asking the questions posed by the machine-or-transformation test. Section 101\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>terms suggest that new technologies may call for new inquiries. See <em>Benson, supra, </em>at 71, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (to \u201cfreeze process patents to old technologies, leaving no room for the revelations of the new, onrushing technology[,] ... is not our purpose\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">It is important to emphasize that the Court today is not commenting on the patentability of any particular invention, let alone holding that any of the above-mentioned technologies from the Information Age should or should not receive patent protection. This Age puts the possibility of innovation in the hands of more people and raises new difficulties for the patent law. With ever more people trying to innovate and thus seeking patent protections for their inventions, the patent law faces a great challenge in striking the balance between protecting inventors and not granting monopolies over procedures that others would discover by independent, creative application of general principles. Nothing in this opinion should be read to take a position on where that balance ought to be struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Section 101 similarly precludes the broad contention that the term \u201cprocess\u201d categorically excludes business methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">[561 U.S. 607]</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">The term \u201cmethod,\u201d which is within \u00a7 100(b)\u2019s definition of \u201cprocess,\u201d at least as a textual matter and before consulting other limitations in the Patent Act and this Court\u2019s precedents, may include at least some methods of doing business. See, <em>e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1548 (2d ed. 1954) (defining \u201cmethod\u201d as \u201c[a]n orderly procedure or process . . . regular way or manner of doing anything; hence, a set form of procedure adopted in investigation or instruction\u201d). The Court is unaware of any argument that the \u201c \u2018ordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u2019 \u201d <em>Diehr, supra, </em>at 182, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, of \u201cmethod\u201d excludes business methods. Nor is it clear how far a prohibition on business method patents would reach, and whether it would exclude technologies for conducting a business more efficiently. See, <em>e.g., </em>Hall, Business and Financial Method Patents, Innovation, and Policy, 56 Scottish J. Pol. Econ. 443, 445 (2009) (\u201cThere is no precise definition of. . . business method patents\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">The argument that business methods are categorically outside of \u00a7 101\u2019s scope is further undermined by the fact that  federal law explicitly contemplates the existence of at least some business method patents. Under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 273(b)(1), if a patent holder claims infringement based on \u201ca method in [a] patent,\u201d the alleged infringer can assert a defense of prior use. For purposes of this defense alone, \u201cmethod\u201d is defined as \u201ca method of doing or conducting business.\u201d \u00a7 273(a)(3). In other words, by allowing this defense the statute itself acknowledges that there may be business method patents. Section 273\u2019s definition of \u201cmethod,\u201d to be sure, cannot change the meaning of a prior-enacted statute. But what \u00a7 273 does is clarify the understanding that a business method is simply one kind of \u201cmethod\u201d that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patenting under \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">A conclusion that business methods are not patentable in any circumstances would render \u00a7 273 meaningless. This would violate  the canon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>against interpreting any statutory</p>\n<p id=\"AHX6\">[561 U.S. 608]</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">provision in a manner that would render another provision superfluous. See <em>Corley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>556 U.S. 303, 314, 129 S. Ct. 1558, 173 L. Ed. 2d 443 (2009). This principle, of course, applies to interpreting any two provisions in the U. S. Code, even when Congress enacted the provisions at different times. See, <em>e.g., Hague </em>v. <em>Committee for Industrial Organization, </em>307 U.S. 496, 529-530, 59 S. Ct. 954, 83 L. Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion of Stone, J.). This established rule of statutory interpretation cannot be overcome by judicial speculation as to the subjective intent of various legislators in enacting the subsequent provision. Finally, while \u00a7 273 appears to leave open the possibility of some business method patents, it does not suggest broad patent-ability of such claimed inventions.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Interpreting \u00a7 101 to exclude all business methods simply because business method patents were rarely issued until modern times revives many of the previously discussed difficulties. See <em>supra, </em>at 605-606, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 803-804. At the same time, some business method patents raise special problems in terms of vagueness and suspect validity. See <em>eBay Inc. </em>v. <em>MercExchange, L. L. C., </em>547 U.S. 388, 397, 126 S. Ct. 1837, 164 L. Ed. 2d 641 (2006) (Kennedy, J., concurring). The Information Age empowers people with new capacities to perform statistical analyses and mathematical calculations with a speed and sophistication that enable the design of protocols for more efficient performance of a vast number of business tasks. If a high enough bar is not set when considering patent applications of this sort, patent examiners and courts could be flooded with claims that would put a chill on creative endeavor and dynamic change.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">In searching for a limiting principle, this Court\u2019s precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas provide useful tools. See <em>infra, </em>at 609-612, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 805-807. Indeed, if the Court of Appeals were to succeed in defining a narrower category or class of patent applications that claim to instruct how business should be conducted, and then rule that the category is unpatentable because, for instance, it represents an attempt to</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">[561 U.S. 609]</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">patent abstract ideas, this conclusion might well be in accord with controlling precedent. See <em>ibid. </em>But beyond this or some other limitation consistent with the statutory text, the Patent Act leaves open the possibility that there are at least some processes that can be fairly described as business methods that are within patentable subject matter under \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">Finally, even if a particular business method fits into the statutory definition of a \u201cprocess,\u201d that does not mean that the application claiming that method should be granted. In order to receive patent protection, any claimed invention must be novel, \u00a7 102, nonobvious, \u00a7 103, and fully and particularly described, \u00a7 112. These limitations serve a critical role in adjusting the tension, ever present in patent law, between stimulating innovation by protecting inventors and impeding progress by granting patents when not justified by the statutory design.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">Even though petitioners\u2019 application is not categorically outside of \u00a7101 under the two broad and atex-tual approaches the Court rejects to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>day, that does not mean it is a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101. Petitioners seek to patent both the concept of hedging risk and the application of that concept to energy markets. App. 19-20. Rather than adopting categorical rules that might have wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts, the Court resolves this case narrowly on the basis of this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Benson, Flook, </em>and <em>Diehr, </em>which show that petitioners\u2019 claims are not patentable processes because they are attempts to patent abstract ideas. Indeed, all Members of the Court agree that the patent application at issue here falls outside of \u00a7 101 because it claims an abstract idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In <em>Benson, </em>the Court considered whether a patent application for an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary code was a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101. 409 U.S., at 64-67, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273. The Court first explained that  \u201c \u2018[a] principle,</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">[561 U.S. 610]</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 67, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (quoting <em>Le Roy, </em>14 How., at 175, 14 L. Ed. 367). The Court then held the application at issue was not a \u201cprocess,\u201d but an unpatentable abstract idea. \u201cIt is conceded that  one may not patent an idea. But in practical effect that would be the result if the formula for converting . . . numerals to pure binary numerals were patented in this case.\u201d 409 U.S., at 71, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273. A contrary holding \u201cwould wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 72, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">In <em>Flook, </em>the Court considered the next logical step after <em>Benson. </em>The applicant there attempted to patent a procedure for monitoring the conditions during the catalytic conversion process in the petrochemical and oil-refining industries. The application\u2019s only innovation was reliance on a mathematical algorithm. 437 U.S., at 585-586, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. <em>Flook </em>held the invention was not a patentable \u201cprocess.\u201d The Court conceded the invention at issue, unlike the algorithm in <em>Benson, </em>had been limited so that it could still be freely used outside the petrochemical and oil-refining industries. 437 U.S., at 589-590, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. Nevertheless, <em>Flook </em>rejected \u201c [t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter how conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 590, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. The Court concluded that the process at issue there was \u201cunpatentable under \u00a7 101, not because it contain [ed] a mathematical algorithm as one component, but because once that algorithm [wa]s assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contained] no patentable invention.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 594, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. As the Court later explained, <em>Flook </em>stands for the proposition that  the prohibition against patenting abstract ideas \u201ccannot be circumvented by attempting to limit the use of the formula to a particular technological environment\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">[561 U.S. 611]</p>\n<p id=\"b852-10\">or adding \u201cinsignificant postsolution activity.\u201d <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S., at 191-192, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">Finally, in <em>Diehr, </em>the Court established a limitation on the principles articulated in <em>Benson </em>and <em>Flook. </em>The application in <em>Diehr </em>claimed a previously unknown method for \u201cmolding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>raw, uncured synthetic rubber into cured precision products,\u201d using a mathematical formula to complete some of its several steps by way of a computer. 450 U.S., at 177, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155. <em>Diehr </em>explained that  while an abstract idea, law of nature, or mathematical formula could not be patented, \u201can <em>application </em>of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 187, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155. <em>Diehr </em>emphasized the need to consider the invention as a whole, rather than \u201cdissecting] the claims into old and new elements and then . . . ignoring] the presence of the old elements in the analysis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 188, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155. Finally, the Court concluded that because the claim was not \u201can attempt to patent a mathematical formula, but rather [was] an industrial process for the molding of rubber products,\u201d it fell within \u00a7 101\u2019s patentable subject matter. <em>Id., </em>at 192-193, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">In light of these precedents, it is clear that petitioners\u2019 application is not a patentable \u201cprocess.\u201d Claims 1 and 4 in petitioners\u2019 application explain the basic concept of hedging, or protecting against risk: \u201cHedging is a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce and taught in any introductory finance class.\u201d 545 F.3d, at 1013 (Rader, J., dissenting); see, <em>e.g., </em>D. Chorafas, Introduction to Derivative Financial Instruments 75-94 (2008); C. Stickney, R. Weil, K. Schipper, &amp; J. Francis, Financial Accounting: An Introduction to Concepts, Methods, and Uses 581-582 (13th ed. 2010); S. Ross, R. Westerfield, &amp; B. Jordan, Fundamentals of Corporate Finance 743-744 (8th ed. 2008). The concept of hedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathematical formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea, just like the algorithms at issue in <em>Benson </em>and <em>Flook. </em>Allowing</p>\n<p id=\"AhBW\">[561 U.S. 612]</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">petitioners to patent risk hedging would pre-empt use of this approach in all fields, and would effectively grant a monopoly over an abstract idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining claims are broad examples of how hedging can be used in commodities and energy markets. <em>Flook </em>established that  limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postsolution components did not make the concept patentable. That is exactly what the remaining claims in petitioners\u2019 application do. These claims attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of hedging risk in the energy market and then instruct the use of well-known random analysis techniques to help establish some of the inputs into the equation. Indeed, these claims add even less to the underlying abstract principle than the invention in <em>Flook </em>did, for the <em>Flook </em>invention was at least directed to the narrower domain of signaling dangers in operating a catalytic converter.</p>\n<p id=\"pAuO4\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"33\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASUAAAAgAQAAAAB8plPdAAAAmElEQVR4nOWTMQpCMRBEJ8HCTi8g/yLi2byR2FlaeADP8DsrsYsgPotfOOCAFh8R3O7tzmR3Q1LQ+7jWD0TSb6v2nkoAQIfFK7TR5zou1s9MgipJO8tHqJK0vFkhAsBla1sFaAK4z6wQYLiJMrcmEQDaxuwBhrNOxewJqiT1U9s+QZWkw8TsEQDOKxslQPv+myh/8x/HUT0Adifr2scEz4cAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"293\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Today, the Court once again declines to impose limitations on the Patent Act that are inconsistent with the Act\u2019s text. The patent application here can be rejected under our precedents on the unpatentability of abstract ideas. The Court, therefore, need not define further what constitutes a patentable \u201cprocess,\u201d beyond pointing to the definition of that term provided in \u00a7 100(b) and looking to the guideposts in <em>Benson, Flook, </em>and <em>Diehr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">And nothing in today\u2019s opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>should be read as endorsing interpretations of \u00a7 101 that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has used in the past. See, <em>e.g., State Street, </em>149 F.3d, at 1373; <em>AT&amp;T Corp., </em>172 F.3d, at 1357. It may be that the Court of Appeals thought it needed to make the machine-or-transformation test exclusive precisely because its case law had not adequately identified less extreme means of restricting business method patents, including (but not limited to) application of our opinions in <em>Benson, Flook, </em>and <em>Diehr. </em>In disapproving an exclusive machine-</p>\n<p id=\"AczA\">1561 U.S. 613]</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">or-transformation test, we by no means foreclose the Federal Circuit\u2019s development of other limiting criteria that further the purposes of the Patent Act and are not inconsistent with its text.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-12\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b845-19\"> Justice Scalia does not join Parts II-B-2 and II-C-2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<p id=\"b854-4\">SEPARATE OPINIONS</p>\n<author id=\"b854-5\">Justice Stevens,</author>\n<p id=\"AWG2k\">with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor join, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">In the area of patents, it is especially important that the law remain stable and clear. The only question presented in this case is whether the so-called machine-or-transformation test is the exclusive test for what constitutes a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. It would be possible to answer that question simply by holding, as the entire Court agrees, that although the machine-or-transformation test is reliable in most cases, it is not the <em>exclusive </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">I agree with the Court that, in light of the uncertainty that currently pervades this field, it is prudent to provide further guidance. But I would take a different approach. Rather than making any broad statements about how to define the term \u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7 101 or tinkering with the bounds of the category of unpatentable, abstract ideas, I would restore patent law to its historical and constitutional moorings.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">For centuries, it was considered well established that a series of steps for conducting business was not, in itself, patentable. In the late 1990\u2019s, the Federal Circuit and others called this proposition into question. Congress quickly responded to a Federal Circuit decision with a stopgap measure designed to limit a potentially significant new problem for the business community. It passed the First Inventor Defense Act of 1999 (1999 Act), 113 Stat. 1501A-555 (codified at 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 273), which provides a limited defense to claims of patent infringement, see \u00a7 273(b), for \u201cmethod[s] of</p>\n<p id=\"b854-15\">[561 U.S. 614]</p>\n<p id=\"b854-16\">doing or conducting business,\u201d \u00a7 273(a)(3). Following several more years of confusion, the Federal Circuit changed course, overruling recent decisions and holding that a series of steps may constitute a patentable process only if it is tied to a machine or transforms an article into a different state or thing. This \u201cmachine-or-transformation test\u201d excluded general methods of doing business as well as, potentially, a variety of other subjects that could be called processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-17\">The Court correctly holds that the machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for what constitutes a patentable process; rather, it is a criti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>cal clue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But the Court is quite wrong, in my view, to suggest that any series of steps that is not itself an abstract idea or law of nature may constitute a \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 101. The language in the Court\u2019s opinion to this effect can only cause mischief. The wiser course would have been to hold that petitioners\u2019 method is not a \u201cprocess\u201d because it describes only a general method of engaging in business transactions\u2014 and business methods are not patentable. More precisely, although a process is not patent ineligible simply because it is useful for conducting business, a claim that merely describes a method of doing business does not qualify as a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Although the Court provides a brief statement of facts, <em>ante, </em>at 597-601, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 799-800, a more complete explication may be useful for those unfamiliar with petitioners\u2019 patent application and this case\u2019s procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Petitioners\u2019 patent application describes a series of steps for managing risk amongst buyers and sellers of commodities. The general method, described in claim 1, entails</p>\n<p id=\"ACfv\">[561 U.S. 615]</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">\u201cmanaging the consumption risk costs of a commodity sold by a commodity provider at a fixed price,\u201d and consists of the following steps:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">\u201c(a) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and consumers of said commodity wherein said consumers purchase said commodity at a fixed rate based upon historical averages, said fixed rate corresponding to a risk position of said consumers;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-11\">\u201c(b) identifying market participants for said commodity having a counter-risk position to said consumers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-12\">\u201c(c) initiating a series of transactions between said commodity provider and said market participants at a second fixed rate such that said series of market participant transactions balances the risk position of said series of consumer transactions.\u201d App. 19-20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">Although the patent application makes clear that the \u201cmethod can be used for any commodity to manage consumption risk in a fixed bill price product,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 11, it includes specific applications of the method, particularly in the field of energy, as a means of enabling suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in demand during specified time periods, see <em>id., </em>at 20-22. Energy suppliers and consumers may use that method to hedge their risks by agreeing upon a fixed series of payments at regular intervals throughout the year instead of charging or paying prices that fluctuate in response to changing weather conditions. The patent application describes a series of steps, including the evaluation of historical costs and weather variables and the use of economic and statistical formulas, to analyze these data and to estimate the likelihood of certain outcomes. See <em>id., </em>at 12-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">The patent examiner rejected petitioners\u2019 application on the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>that it \u201cis not directed to the technological arts,\u201d insofar as it \u201cis not implemented on a specific apparatus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and solves a purely</p>\n<p id=\"Ae14\">[561 U.S. 616]</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">mathematical problem without any limitation to a practical application.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 148a.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences affirmed the examiner\u2019s decision, but it rejected the position that a patentable process must relate to \u201ctechnological arts\u201d or be performed on a machine. <em>Id., </em>at 180-181a. Instead, the Board denied petitioners\u2019 patent on two alternative, although similar, grounds: first, that the patent involves only mental steps that do not transform physical subject matter, <em>id., </em>at 181a-184a; and, second, that it is directed to an \u201cabstract idea,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 184a-187a.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Petitioners appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. After briefing and argument before a three-judge panel, the court <em>sua sponte </em>decided to hear the case en banc and ordered the parties to address: (1) whether petitioners\u2019 \u201cclaim 1 . . . claims patent-eligible subject matter under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\u201d; (2) \u201c[w]hat standard should govern in determining whether a process is patent-eligible subject matter\u201d; (3) \u201c[w]hether the claimed subject matter is not patent-eligible because it constitutes an abstract idea or mental process\u201d; (4) \u201c[w]hether a method or process must result in a physical transformation of an article or be tied to a machine to be patent-eligible subject matter\u201d; and (5) whether the court\u2019s decisions in <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Signature Financial Group, Inc., </em>149 F.3d 1368 (1998) <em>(State Street), </em>and <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Excel Communications, Inc., </em>172 F.3d 1352 (1999), should be overruled in any respect. App. to Pet. for Cert. 144a-145a.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The en banc Court of Appeals affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. Eleven of the twelve judges agreed that petitioners\u2019 claims do not describe a patentable \u201cprocess,\u201d \u00a7 101. Chief Judge Michel\u2019s opinion, joined by eight other judges, rejected several possible tests for what is a patent-eligible process, including whether the patent produces a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete and tangible result,\u2019 \u201d whether the process relates to \u201ctechnological arts,\u201d and \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d for certain processes</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">[561 U.S. 617]</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">such as business methods. <em>In re Bilski, </em>545 F.3d 943, 959-960 (2008). Relying on several of our cases in which we explained how to differentiate a claim on a \u201cfundamental principle\u201d from a claim on a \u201cprocess,\u201d the court concluded that a \u201cclaimed process is surely patent-eligible under \u00a7 101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 954-955. The court further concluded that this \u201cmachine-or-transformation test\u201d is \u201cthe <em>sole </em>test governing \u00a7 101 analyses,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 955 (emphasis added), and therefore the \u201ctest for determining patent eligibility of a process under \u00a7 101,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 956. Applying that test, the court held that petitioners\u2019 claim is not a patent-eligible process. <em>Id., </em>at 963-966.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-11\">In a separate opinion reaching the same conclusion, Judge Dyk carefully reviewed the history of American patent law and English precedents upon which our law is based, and found that \u201cthe unpatentability of processes not involving manufactures, machines, or compositions of matter has been firmly embedded . . . since the time of the Patent Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>1793.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 966. Judge Dyk observed, moreover, that \u201c[t]here is no suggestion in any of this early consideration of process patents that processes for organizing human activity were or ever had been patentable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Three judges wrote dissenting opinions, although two of those judges agreed that petitioners\u2019 claim is not patent eligible. Judge Mayer would have held that petitioners\u2019 claim \u201cis not eligible for patent protection because it is directed to a method of conducting business.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 998. He submitted that \u201c[t]he patent system is intended to protect and promote advances in science and technology, not ideas about how to structure commercial transactions.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cAffording patent protection to business methods lacks constitutional and statutory support, serves to hinder rather than promote innovation [,] and usurps that which rightfully belongs in the public domain.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">[561 U.S. 618]</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Judge Rader would have rejected petitioners\u2019 claim on the ground that it seeks to patent merely an abstract idea. <em>Id., </em>at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Only Judge Newman disagreed with the court\u2019s conclusion that petitioners\u2019 claim seeks a patent on ineligible subject matter. Judge Newman urged that the en banc court\u2019s machine-or-transformation test ignores the text and history of \u00a7 101, <em>id., </em>at 977-978, 985-990, is in tension with several decisions by this Court, <em>id., </em>at 978-985, and the Federal Circuit, <em>id., </em>at 990-992, and will invalidate thousands of patents that were issued in reliance on those decisions, <em>id., </em>at 992-994.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">Before explaining in more detail how I would decide this case, I will comment briefly on the Court\u2019s opinion. The opinion is less than pellucid in more than one respect, and, if misunderstood, could result in confusion or upset settled areas of the law. Three preliminary observations may be clarifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">First, the Court suggests that the terms in the Patent Act must be read as lay speakers use those terms, and not as they have traditionally been understood in the context of patent law. See, <em>e.g., ante, </em>at 603, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 801 (terms in \u00a7 101 must be viewed in light of their \u201c \u2018ordinary, contemporary, common meaning\u2019 \u201d); <em>ante, </em>at 607, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 804 (patentable \u201cmethod\u201d is any \u201corderly procedure or process,\u201d \u201cregular way or manner of doing anything,\u201d or \u201cset form of procedure adopted in investigation or instruction\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). As I will explain at more length in Part III, <em>infra, </em>if this portion of the Court\u2019s opinion were taken literally, the results would be absurd: Anything that constitutes a series of steps would be patentable so long as it is novel, non obvious, and described with specificity. But the opinion cannot be taken literally on this point. The Court makes this clear when it accepts that the \u201catextual\u201d machine-or-transformation test, <em>ante, </em>at 609, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 805, is \u201cuseful and important,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 604, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 803, even though it</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">[561 U.S. 619]</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">\u201cviolates\u201d the stated \u201cstatutory interpretation principles,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 603, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 802; and when the Court excludes processes that tend to pre-empt commonly used ideas, see <em>ante, </em>at 610-611, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 806-807.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">Second, in the process of addressing the sole issue presented to us, the opinion uses some language that seems inconsistent with our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>centuries-old reliance on the machine-or-transformation criteria as clues to patentability. Most notably, the opinion for a plurality suggests that these criteria may operate differently when addressing technologies of a recent vintage. See <em>ante, </em>at 605, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 803 (machine-or-transformation test is useful \u201cfor evaluating processes similar to those in the Industrial Age,\u201d but is less useful \u201cfor determining the patentability of inventions in the Information Age\u201d). In moments of caution, however, the opinion for the Court explains\u2014 correctly\u2014that the Court is merely restoring the law to its historical state of rest. See <em>ante, </em>at 604, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 803 (\u201cThis Court\u2019s precedents establish that the machine- or-transformation test is a useful and important clue, an investigative tool, for determining whether some claimed inventions are processes under \u00a7 101\u201d). Notwithstanding this internal tension, I understand the Court\u2019s opinion to hold only that the machine-or-transformation test remains an important test for patent-ability. Few, if any, processes cannot effectively be evaluated using these criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Third, in its discussion of an issue not contained in the questions presented\u2014whether the particular series of steps in petitioners\u2019 application is an abstract idea\u2014the Court uses language that could suggest a shift in our approach to that issue. Although I happen to agree that petitioners seek to patent an abstract idea, the Court does not show how this conclusion follows \u201cclear[ly],\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 611, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 807, from our case law. The patent now before us is not for \u201c[a] principle, in the abstract,\u201d or a \u201cfundamental truth.\u201d <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S. 584, 589, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor does it claim the sort of phenomenon of nature or abstract idea that was embodied by the mathematical formula</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">[561 U.S. 620]</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">at issue in <em>Gottschalk </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>409 U.S. 63, 67, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1972), and in <em>Flook.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">The Court construes petitioners\u2019 claims on processes for pricing as claims on \u201cthe basic concept of hedging, or protecting against risk,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 611, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 807, and thus discounts the application\u2019s discussion of what sorts of data to use, and how to analyze those data, as mere \u201ctoken postsolution components,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 612, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 807. In other words, the Court artificially limits petitioners\u2019 claims to hedging, and then concludes that hedging is an abstract idea rather than a term that describes a category of processes including petitioners\u2019 claims. Why the Court does this is never made clear. One might think that the Court\u2019s analysis means that any process that utilizes an abstract idea is <em>itself </em>an unpatentable, abstract idea. But we have never suggested any such rule, which would undermine a host of patentable processes. It is true, as the Court observes, that petitioners\u2019 application is phrased broadly. See <em>ante, </em>at 611-612, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 807. But claim specification is covered by \u00a7 112, not \u00a7 101; and if a series of steps constituted an unpatentable idea merely because it was described without sufficient specificity, the Court could be calling into question some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>our own prior decisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At points, the opinion suggests that novelty is the clue. See <em>ante, </em>at 610-611, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 806-807. But the fact that hedging is \u201c \u2018long prevalent in our system of commerce,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 611, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 807, cannot justify the Court\u2019s conclusion, as \u201cthe proper construction of \u00a7 101 . . . does not involve the familiar issu[e] of novelty\u201d that arises under \u00a7 102, <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S., at 588, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. At other points, the opinion for a plurality suggests that the analysis turns on the category of patent involved. See, <em>e.g., ante, </em>at 608, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 805 (courts</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">[561 U.S. 621]</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">should use the abstract-idea rule as a \u201ctoo[l]\u201d to set \u201ca high enough bar\u201d \u201cwhen considering patent applications of this sort\u201d). But we have never in the past suggested that the inquiry varies by subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The Court, in sum, never provides a satisfying account of what constitutes an unpatentable abstract idea. Indeed, the Court does not even explain if it is using the machine-or-transformation criteria. The Court essentially asserts its conclusion that petitioners\u2019 application claims an abstract idea. This mode of analysis (or lack thereof) may have led to the correct outcome in this case, but it also means that the Court\u2019s musings on this issue stand for very little.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">I agree with the Court that the text of \u00a7 101 must be the starting point of our analysis. As I shall explain, however, the text must not be the end point as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">Pursuant to its power \u201c [t] o promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries,\u201d U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8, Congress has passed a series of patent laws that grant certain exclusive rights over certain inventions and discoveries as a means of encouraging innovation. In the latest iteration, the Patent Act of 1952 (1952 Act), Congress has provided that \u201c[w]hoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title,\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101, which include that the patent also be novel, \u00a7 102, and nonobvious, \u00a7 103. The statute thus authorizes four categories of subject matter that may be patented: processes, machines, manufactures, and compositions of matter. Section 101 imposes a threshold condition. \u201c[N]o patent is available for a discovery, however useful, novel, and nonobvious, unless it falls within one of the express categories of patentable subject matter.\u201d <em>Kewanee Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Bicron Corp., </em>416 U.S. 470, 483, 94 S. Ct. 1879, 40 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">[561 U.S. 622]</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Section 101 undoubtedly defines in \u201cexpansive terms\u201d the subject matter eligible for patent protection, as the statute was meant to ensure that \u201c \u2018ingenuities] receive a liberal encouragement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S. 303, 308-309, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1980); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>also <em>J. E. M. Ag Supply, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>534 U.S. 124, 130, 122 S. Ct. 593, 151 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2001). Nonetheless, not every new invention or discovery may be patented. Certain things are \u201cfree for all to use.\u201d <em>Bonito Boats, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., </em>489 U.S. 141, 151, 109 S. Ct. 971, 103 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The text of the Patent Act does not on its face give much guidance about what constitutes a patentable process. The statute defines the term \u201cprocess\u201d as a \u201cprocess, art or method [that] includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.\u201d \u00a7 100(b). But, this definition is not especially helpful, given that it also uses the term \u201cprocess\u201d and is therefore somewhat circular.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">As lay speakers use the word \u201cprocess,\u201d it constitutes any series of steps. But it has always been clear that, as used in \u00a7 101, the term does not refer to a \u201c \u2018process\u2019 in the ordinary sense of the word,\u201d <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S., at 588, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451; see also <em>Corning </em>v. <em>Burden, </em>15 How. 252, 268, 14 L. Ed. 683 (1854) (\u201c[T]he term process is often used in a more vague sense, in which it cannot</p>\n<p id=\"ApzQ\">[561 U.S. 623]</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">be the subject of a patent\u201d). Rather, as discussed in some detail in Part IV, <em>infra, </em>the term \u201cprocess\u201d (along with the definitions given to that term) has long accumulated a distinctive meaning in patent law. When the term was used in the 1952 Act, it was neither intended nor understood to encompass <em>any </em>series of steps or any <em>way </em>to do any <em>thing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">With that understanding in mind, the Government has argued that because \u201ca word\u201d in a statute \u201cis given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it\u201d associates, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>553 U.S. 285, 294, 128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008), we may draw inferences from the fact that \u201c [t]he other three statutory categories of patent-eligible subject matter identified in Section 101\u2014\u2018machine, manufacture, or composition of matter\u2019\u2014all \u2018are things made by man, and involve technology.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Respondent 26. Specifically, the Government submits, we may infer \u201cthat the term \u2018process\u2019 is limited to technological and industrial methods.\u201d <em>Ibid.. </em>The Court rejects this submission categorically, on the ground that \u201c\u00a7 100(b) already explicitly defines the term \u2018process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 604, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 802. But \u00a7 100(b) defines the term \u201cprocess\u201d by using the term \u201cprocess,\u201d as well as several other general terms. This is not a case, then, in which we must <em>either </em>\u201cfollow\u201d a definition, <em>ibid., </em>rely on neighboring words to understand the scope of an ambiguous term. The definition itself contains the very ambiguous term that we must define.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>In my view, the answer lies in between the Government\u2019s and the Court\u2019s positions: The terms adjacent to \u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7 101 provide a clue as to its meaning, although not a very strong clue. Section 101\u2019s list of categories of patentable subject matter is phrased in the disjunctive, suggesting that the term \u201cprocess\u201d has content distinct from the other items in the list. It would therefore be illogical to \u201crob\u201d the word \u201cprocess\u201d of all independent meaning. <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 338, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979). Moreover, to the extent we can draw inferences about what is a \u201cprocess\u201d from common attributes in \u00a7 101, it is a dangerous endeavor to do so on the</p>\n<p id=\"amza-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 624]</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">basis of a perceived overarching theme. Given the many moving parts at work in the Patent Act, there is a risk of merely confirming our preconceived notions of what should be patentable or of seeing common attributes that track \u201cthe familiar issues of novelty and obviousness\u201d that arise under other sections of the statute but are not relevant to \u00a7 101, <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S., at 588, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. The placement of \u201cprocess\u201d next to other items thus cannot prove that the term is limited to any particular categories; it does, however, give reason to be skeptical that the scope of a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d extends to cover any series of steps at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The Court makes a more serious interpretive error. As briefly discussed in Part II, <em>supra, </em>the Court at points appears to reject the well-settled proposition that the term \u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7 101 is not a \u201c \u2018process\u2019 in the ordinary sense of the word,\u201d <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S., at 588, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. Instead, the Court posits that the word \u201cprocess\u201d must be understood in light of its \u201cordinary, contemporary, common meaning,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 603, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 801 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although this is a fine approach to statutory interpretation in general, it is a deeply flawed approach to a statute that relies on complex terms of art developed against a particular historical background.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, the approach would render \u00a7 101 almost comical. A process for training a dog, a series of dance steps, a method of shooting a basketball, maybe even words, stories, or songs if framed as the steps of typing letters or uttering sounds\u2014all would be patent eligible. I am confident that the term \u201cprocess\u201d in \u00a7 101 is not nearly so capacious.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">[561 U.S. 625]</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">So is the Court, perhaps. What is particularly incredible about the Court\u2019s stated method of interpreting \u00a7101 (other than that the method itself may be patent eligible under the Court\u2019s theory of \u00a7 101) is that the Court deviates from its own professed commitment to \u201cordinary, contempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>rary, common meaning.\u201d As noted earlier, the Court accepts a role for the \u201catextual\u201d machine-or-transformation \u201cclue.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 609, 604, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 805, 802. The Court also accepts that we have \u201cforeclose [d] a purely literal reading of \u00a7 101,\u201d <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S., at 589, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451, by holding that claims that are close to \u201claws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas,\u201d <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S. 175, 185, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1981), do not count as \u201cprocesses\u201d under \u00a7 101, even if they can be colloquially described as such.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Court attempts to justify this latter exception to \u00a7 101 as \u201ca matter of statutory <em>stare decisis.\u201d Ante, </em>at 602, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 801. But it is strange to think that the very same term must be interpreted literally on some occasions, and in light of its historical usage on others.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">In fact, the Court\u2019s understanding of \u00a7 101 is even more remarkable because its willingness to <em>exclude </em>general principles from the provision\u2019s reach is in tension with its apparent willingness to <em>include </em>steps for conducting business. The history of patent law contains strong norms against</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">[561 U.S. 626]</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">patenting these two categories of subject matter. Both norms were presumably incorporated by Congress into the 1952 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Because the text of \u00a7 101 does not on its face convey the scope of patentable processes, it is necessary, in my view, to review the history of our patent law in some detail. This approach yields a much more straightforward answer to this case than the Court\u2019s. As I read the history, it strongly supports the conclusion that a method of doing business is not a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">I am, of course, mindful of the fact that \u00a7 101 \u201cis a dynamic provision designed to encompass new and unforeseen inventions,\u201d and that one must therefore view historical conceptions of patent-eligible subject matter at an appropriately high level of generality. <em>J. E. M. Ag Supply, </em>534 U.S., at 135, 122 S. Ct. 593, 151 L. Ed. 2d 508; see also <em>Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S., at 315-316, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144. But it is nonetheless significant that while people have long innovated in fields of business, methods of doing business fall outside of the subject matter that has \u201chistorically been eligible to receive the protection of our patent laws,\u201d <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S., at 184, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, and likely go beyond what the modern patent \u201cstatute was enacted to protect,\u201d <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S., at 593, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. It is also significant that when Congress enacted the 1952 Act, it did so against the background of a well-settled understanding that a series of steps for conducting business cannot be patented. These considerations ought to guide our analysis. As Justice Holmes noted long ago, sometimes, \u201ca page of history is worth a volume of logic.\u201d <em>New York Trust Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>Eisner, </em>256 U.S. 345, 349, 41 S.

P. 1795) (holding that the term \u201cmanufacture\u201d \u201capplied not only to things made, but to the practice of making, to principles carried into practice in a new manner, to new results of principles carried into practice\u201d). Thus, English courts upheld James Watt\u2019s famous patent on a method for reducing the consumption of fuel in steam engines,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as well as a variety of patents issued for</p>\n<p id=\"AICk7\">[561 U.S. 628]</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">methods of synthesizing substances or building mechanical devices.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">Although it is difficult to derive a precise understanding of what sorts of methods were patentable under English law, there is no basis in the text of the Statute of Monopolies, nor in pre-1790 English precedent, to infer that business methods could qualify.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> There was some debate throughout the relevant time period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>about what processes could be patented. But it does not appear that anyone seriously believed that one could patent \u201ca method for organizing human activity.\u201d 545 F.3d, at 970 (Dyk, J., concurring).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">There were a small number of patents issued between 1623 and 1790 relating to banking or lotteries and one for a method of life insurance,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but these did not constitute the \u201cprevail [ing]\u201d \u201cprinciples and practice\u201d in England on which our patent law was based, <em>Pennock </em>v. <em>Dialogue, </em>2 Pet. 1, 18, 7 L.

Such patents were exceedingly rare, and some of</p>\n<p id=\"a9z-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 629]</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">them probably were viewed not as inventions or discoveries but rather as special state privilege<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that until the mid-1800\u2019s were recorded alongside inventions in the patent records, see MacLeod 1-2 (explaining that various types of patents were listed together). It appears that the only English patent of the time that can fairly be described as a business method patent was one issued in 1778 on a \u201cPlan for assurances on lives of persons from 10 to 80 years of Age.\u201d Woodcroft 324.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And \u201c[t]here is no indication\u201d that this patent \u201cwas ever enforced or its validity tested,\u201d 545 F.3d, at 974 (Dyk, J., concurring); the patent may thus have represented little more than the whim\u2014or error\u2014of a single patent clerk.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">In any event, these patents (or patent) were probably not known to the Framers of early patent law.

So far as I am aware, no published cases pertained to patents on business methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Also noteworthy is what was <em>not </em>patented under the English system.

However, we have generally assumed that \u201cuseful art,\u201d at least as it is used in the Patent Act, is itself a term of art. See <em>Burden, </em>15 How., at 267-268, 14 L.

There is room, moreover, to debate at what level of generality we should understand these broad and historical terms, given that \u201c[a] rule that unanticipated inventions are without protection would conflict with the core concept of the patent law,\u201d <em>Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S., at 316, 100 S.

Although other dictionaries defined the word \u201cart\u201d more broadly,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Webster\u2019s definition likely conveyed a message similar to the meaning of the word \u201cmanufactures\u201d in the earlier English statute. And we know that the term \u201cuseful arts\u201d was used in the founding era to refer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>manufacturing and similar applied trades.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> See Coulter, The Field of the Statutory Useful Arts, 34 J.

Indeed, just</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">[561 U.S. 634]</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">days before the Constitutional Convention, one delegate listed examples of American progress in \u201cmanufactures and the useful arts,\u201d all of which involved the creation or transformation of physical substances. See T. Coxe, An Address to an Assembly of the Friends of American Manufactures 17-18 (1787) (listing, <em>inter alia, </em>meal, ships, liquors, potash, gunpowder, paper, starch, articles of iron, stone work, carriages, and harnesses).

See, <em>e.g., </em>The Federalist No. 8, p. 69 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A.

Indeed, the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>delegate to the Constitutional Convention who gave an address in which he listed triumphs in the useful arts distinguished between those arts and the conduct of business.

Coxe, A Statement of the Arts and Manufactures of the United States of America for the Year 1810 (1814), in 2 American State Papers, Finance 666, 688 (1832).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Some scholars have remarked, as did Thomas Jefferson, that early patent statutes neither included nor reflected any serious debate about the precise scope of patentable subject matter. See, <em>e.g., Graham, </em>383 U.S., at 9-10, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (discussing Thomas Jefferson\u2019s observations). It has been suggested, however, that \u201c[plerhaps this was in part a function of an understanding\u2014 shared widely among legislators, courts, patent office officials, and inventors\u2014about what patents were meant to protect. Everyone knew that manufactures and machines were at the core of the patent system.\u201d Merges, Property Rights for Business Concepts and Patent System Reform, 14 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 577, 585 (1999) (hereinafter Merges). Thus, although certain processes, such as those related to the technology of the time, might have been considered patentable, it is possible that \u201c[algainst this background, it would have been seen as absurd for an entrepreneur to file a patent\u201d on methods of conducting business. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">\n<em>Development of American Patent Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">During the first years of the patent system, no patents were issued on methods of doing business.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Indeed, for</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">[561 U.S. 636]</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">some time, there were serious doubts as to \u201cthe patentability of processes per se,\u201d as distinct from the physical end product or the tools used to perform a process. <em>Id., </em>at 581-582.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Thomas Jefferson was the \u201c \u2018first administrator of our patent system\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthe author of the 1793 Patent Act.\u201d <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S., at 7, 86 S.

Thus \u201c[although the Patent Act was amended, revised or codified some 50 times between 1790 and 1950, Congress steered clear\u201d of adding statutory requirements of patent-ability. <em>Ibid. </em>For nearly 160 years, Congress retained the term \u201cuseful arts,\u201d see, e.g., Act of July 4, 1836, ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117, leaving \u201cwide latitude for judicial construction ... to keep pace with industrial development,\u201d Berman, Method Claims, 17 J.

The rationales for those decisions sometimes varied. But there was an overarching theme, at least in dicta: Business methods are not patentable arts.

The new terminology was added only in recognition of the fact that courts had been interpreting the category \u201cart\u201d by using the terms \u201cprocess or method\u201d; Congress thus wanted to avoid \u201cthe necessity of explanation that the word \u2018art\u2019 as used in this place means \u2018process or method.\u2019 \u201d S.

Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144, in turn quoting S. Rep. 1979, at 5). Similarly, the Court relies on language from our opinion in <em>Chakrabarty </em>that was based in part on this piece of legislative history. See <em>ante, </em>at 601, 602-603, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 800-801, 801-802.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">This reliance is misplaced. We have never understood that piece of legislative history to mean that any series of steps is a patentable process. Indeed, if that were so, then our many opinions analyzing what is a patentable process were simply wastes of pages in the U. S. Reports. And to accept that errant piece of legislative history as widening the scope of the patent law would contradict other evidence in the congressional record, as well as our presumption that the 1952 Act merely codified the meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d and did not expand it, see <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S., at 184, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Taken in context, it is apparent that the quoted language has a far less expansive meaning. The full sentence in the Committee Reports reads: \u201cA person may have \u2018invented\u2019 a machine or a manufacture, which may include anything under the sun that is made by man, but it is not necessarily patentable under section 101 unless the conditions of [this] title are fulfilled.\u201d S. Rep. 1979, at 5; H. R. Rep. 1923, at 6. Viewed as a whole, it seems clear that this language does not purport to explain that \u201canything under the sun\u201d is patentable. Indeed, the language may be understood to state the exact opposite: that \u201c[a] person may have \u2018invented\u2019 . . . anything under the sun,\u201d but that thing \u201cis not necessarily patentable under section 101.\u201d Thus, even in the <em>Chakrabarty </em>opinion, which relied on this quote, we cautioned that the 1952 Reports did not \u201csuggest that \u00a7 101 has no limits or that it embraces every discovery.\u201d 447 U.S., at 309, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">Moreover, even if the language in the Committee Reports was meant to flesh out the meaning of any portion of \u00a7 101, it did not purport to define the term \u201cprocess.\u201d The language refers only to \u201cmanufacture [s]\u201d and \u201cmachine [s],\u201d tangible</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">[561 U.S. 643]</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\">objects \u201cmade by man.\u201d It does not reference the \u201cprocess\u201d category of subject matter (nor could a process be comfortably described as something <em>\u201cmade </em>by man\u201d). The language may also be understood merely as defining the term \u201cinvents\u201d in \u00a7 101. As Judge Dyk explained in his opinion below, the phrase \u201cmade by man\u201d \u201cis reminiscent\u201d of a 1790\u2019s description of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>limits of English patent law, that an \u201cinvention must be \u2018made by man\u2019 \u201d and cannot be \u201c \u2018a philosophical principle only, neither organized or capable of being organized\u2019 from a patentable manufacture.\u201d 545 F.3d, at 976 (quoting <em>Hornblower </em>v. <em>Boulton, </em>8 T. R. 95, 98, 101 Eng. Rep. 1285, 1288 (K. B. 1799)).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The 1952 Act, in short, cannot be understood as expanding the scope of patentable subject matter by suggesting that any series of steps may be patented as a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101. If anything, the 1952 Act appears to have codified the conclusion that subject matter which was understood not to be patentable in 1952 was to remain unpatentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Our recent case law reinforces my view that a series of steps for conducting business is not a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101. Since Congress passed the 1952 Act, we have never ruled on whether that Act authorizes patents on business methods. But we have cast significant doubt on that proposition by giving substantial weight to the machine-or-transformation test, as general methods of doing business do not pass that test. And more recently, Members of this Court have noted that patents on business methods are of \u201csuspect validity.\u201d <em>eBay Inc. </em>v. <em>MercExchange, L. L.

Although</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">[561 U.S. 644]</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">it may be difficult to define with precision what is a patentable \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101, the historical clues converge on one conclusion: A business method is not a \u201cprocess.\u201d And to the extent that there is ambiguity, we should be mindful of our judicial role. \u201c[W]e must proceed cautiously when we are asked to extend patent rights\u201d into an area that the Patent Act likely was not \u201cenacted to protect,\u201d <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S., at 596, 593, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451, lest we create a legal regime that Congress never would have endorsed, and that can be repaired only by disturbing settled property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Despite the strong historical evidence that a method of doing business does not constitute a \u201cprocess\u201d under \u00a7 101, petitioners nonetheless argue\u2014and the Court suggests in dicta, <em>ante, </em>at 607-608, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 804-805\u2014that a subsequent law, the First Inventor Defense Act of 1999, \u201cmust be read together\u201d with \u00a7 101 to make business methods patentable. Brief for Petitioners 29. This argument utilizes a flawed method of statutory interpretation and ignores the motivation for the 1999 Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-11\">In 1999, following a Federal Circuit decision that intimated business methods could be patented, see <em>State Street, </em>149 F.3d 1368, Congress moved quickly to limit the potential fallout. Congress passed the 1999 Act, codified at 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 273, which provides a limited defense to claims of patent infringement, see \u00a7 273(b), regarding certain \u201cmethod [s] of doing or conducting business,\u201d \u00a7 273(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-12\">It is apparent, both from the content and history of the 1999 Act, that Congress did not in any way ratify <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number><em>Street </em>(or, as petitioners contend, the broadest possible reading of <em>State Street). </em>The 1999 Act merely limited one potential effect of that decision: that businesses might suddenly find themselves liable for innocently using methods they assumed could not be patented. The 1999 Act did not purport to amend the limitations in \u00a7 101 on eligible subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">[561 U.S. 645]</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Indeed, Congress placed the statute in Part III of Title 35, which addresses \u201cPatents and Protection of Patent Rights,\u201d rather than in Part II, which contains \u00a7 101 and addresses \u201cPatentability of Inventions and Grant of Patents.\u201d Particularly because petitioners\u2019 reading of the 1999 Act would expand \u00a7 101 to cover a category of processes that have not \u201chistorically been eligible\u201d for patents, <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S., at 184, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, we should be loathe to conclude that Congress effectively amended \u00a7 101 without saying so clearly. We generally presume that Congress \u201cdoes not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc., </em>531 U.S. 457, 468, 121 S. Ct. 903, 149 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">The 1999 Act therefore is, at best, merely evidence of 1999 legislative views on the meaning of the earlier, 1952 Act. \u201c[T]he views of a subsequent Congress,\u201d however, \u201cform a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Price, </em>361 U.S. 304, 313, 80 S. Ct. 326, 4 L. Ed. 2d 334 (1960). When a later statute is offered as \u201can expression of how the . . . Congress interpreted a statute passed by another Congress ... a half century before,\u201d \u201csuch interpretation has very little, if any, significance.\u201d <em>Rainwater </em>v. <em>United States, </em>356 U.S. 590, 593, 78 S. Ct. 946, 2 L. Ed. 2d 996 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">Furthermore, even assuming that Congress\u2019 views at the turn of the 21st century could potentially serve as a valid basis for interpreting a statute passed in the mid-20th century, the First Inventor Defense Act does not aid petitioners because it does not show that the later Congress itself understood \u00a7 101 to cover business methods. If anything, it shows that a few judges on the Federal Circuit understood \u00a7 101 in that manner and that Congress understood what those judges had done. The 1999 Act appears to reflect surprise and perhaps even dismay that business methods might be patented. Thus, in the months following <em>State Street, </em>congressional authorities lamented that \u201cbusiness methods and processes . . . until recently were thought not to be patentable,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">[561 U.S. 646]</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">H. R. Rep. No. 106-464, p. 121 (1999); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 106-287, pt. 1, p. 31 (1999).<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The fact that Congress decided it was appropriate to create a new <em>defense </em>to claims that business method patents were being infringed merely demonstrates recognition that such claims could create a significant new problem for the business community.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-12\">The Court nonetheless states that the 1999 Act \u201cacknowledges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>there may be business method patents,\u201d thereby \u201cclarify[ing]\u201d its \u201cunderstanding\u201d of \u00a7 101. <em>Ante, </em>at 607, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 804. More specifically, the Court worries that if we were to interpret the 1952 Act to exclude business methods, our interpretation \u201cwould render \u00a7 273 meaningless.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>I agree that \u201c[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions.\u201d <em>Corley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>556 U.S. 303, 314, 129 S. Ct. 1558, 173 L. Ed. 2d 443 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). But it is a different matter altogether when the Court construes one statute, the 1952 Act, to give effect to a different statute, the 1999 Act. The canon on which the Court relies is predicated upon the idea that \u201c[a] statute is passed as a whole.\u201d 2A N. Singer &amp; J. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 46:5, p. 189 (7th ed. 2007). But the two statutes in question were not passed as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Put another way, we ordinarily assume, quite sensibly, that Congress would not in one statute include two provisions that are at odds with each other. But as this case shows, that sensible reasoning can break down when applied to different</p>\n<p id=\"AYkg\">[561 U.S. 647]</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">statutes.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The 1999 Act was passed to limit the impact of the Federal Circuit\u2019s then-recent statements on the 1952 Act. Although repudiating that judicial dictum (as we should) might effectively render the 1999 Act a nullity going forward, such a holding would not mean that it was a nullity when Congress enacted it. Section 273 may have been a technically unnecessary response to confusion about patentable subject matter, but it appeared necessary in 1999 in light of what was being discussed in legal circles at the time.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Consider the logical implications of the Court\u2019s approach to this question: If, tomorrow, Congress were to conclude that patents on business methods are so <em>important </em>that the special infringement defense in \u00a7 273 ought to be abolished, and thus repealed that provision, this could paradoxically strengthen the case <em>against </em>such patents because there would no longer be a \u00a7 273 that \u201cacknowledges . . . business method patents,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 607, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 804. That is not a sound method of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">In light of its history and purpose, I think it obvious that the 1999 Congress would never have enacted \u00a7 273 if it had foreseen that this Court would rely on the provision as a</p>\n<p id=\"A7Bc\">[561 U.S. 648]</p>\n<p id=\"b875-9\">basis for concluding that business methods are patentable. Section 273 is a red herring; we should be focusing our attention on \u00a7 101 itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">The constitutionally mandated purpose and function of the patent laws bolster the conclusion that methods of doing business are not \u201cprocesses\u201d under \u00a7 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The Constitution allows Congress to issue patents \u201c[t]o promote the Progress of. .. useful Arts,\u201d Art.

We should not casually risk exceeding the constitutional limitation on Congress\u2019 behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">The Court has kept this \u201cconstitutional standard\u201d in mind when deciding what is patentable subject matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>under \u00a7 101.

Ed. 2d 155, than for methods of doing business.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">[561 U.S. 651]</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Many have expressed serious doubts about whether patents are necessary to encourage business innovation.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Despite the fact that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>have long assumed business methods could not be patented, it has been remarked that \u201cthe chief business of the American people is business.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Federal Express developed an overnight delivery service and a variety of specific methods (including shipping through a central hub and online package tracking) without a patent. Although counterfactuals are a dubious form of analysis, I find it hard to believe that many of our entrepreneurs forwent business innovation because they could not claim a patent on their new methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">\u201c[C]ompanies have ample incentives to develop business methods even without patent protection, because the competitive marketplace rewards companies that use more efficient business methods.\u201d Burk &amp; Lemley 1618.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Innovators often capture advantages from new business methods notwithstanding the risk of others copying their innovation. Some business methods occur in secret and therefore can be protected with trade secrecy.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> And for those methods that occur in public, firms that innovate often capture long-term benefits from doing so, thanks to various first-mover advantages, including lock-ins, branding, and networking effects.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">[561 U.S. 652]</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">Business innovation, moreover, generally does not entail the same kinds of risk as does more traditional, technological innovation. It generally does not require the same \u201cenormous costs in terms of time, research, and development,\u201d <em>Bicron, </em>416 U.S., at 480, 94 S. Ct. 1879, 40 L. Ed. 2d 315, and thus does not require the same kind of \u201ccompensation to [innovators] for their labor, toil, and expense,\u201d <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>11 Wall. 516, 533-544, 20 L. Ed. 33 (1871).<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Nor, in many cases, would patents on business methods promote progress by encouraging \u201cpublic disclosure.\u201d <em>Pfaff, </em>525 U.S., at 63, 119 S. Ct. 304, 142 L. Ed. 2d 261; see also <em>Brenner </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>383 U.S. 519, 533, 86 S. Ct. 1033, 16 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1966) (\u201c[0]ne of the purposes of the patent system is to encourage dissemination of information concerning discoveries and inventions\u201d). Many business methods are practiced in public, and therefore a patent does not necessarily encourage the dissemination of anything not already known. And for the methods practiced in private, the benefits of disclosure may be small: Many such methods are distributive, not productive\u2014that is, they do not generate any efficiency but only provide a means for competitors to one-up each other in a battle for pieces of the pie. And as the Court has explained, \u201cit is hard to see how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>public would be benefited by disclosure\u201d of certain business tools, since the nondisclosure of these tools \u201cencourages businesses to initiate new and individualized plans of operation,\u201d which, \u201cin turn, leads to a greater variety of business methods.\u201d <em>Bicron, </em>416 U.S., at 483, 94 S. Ct. 1879, 40 L. Ed. 2d 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">In any event, even if patents on business methods were useful for encouraging innovation and disclosure, it would</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">[561 U.S. 653]</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">still be questionable whether they would, on balance, facilitate or impede the progress of American business. For even when patents encourage innovation and disclosure, <em>\u201ctoo much </em>patent protection can impede rather than \u2018promote the Progress of . . . useful Arts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings </em>v. <em>Metabolite Laboratories, Inc., </em>548 U.S. 124, 126-127, 126 S. Ct. 2921, 165 L. Ed. 2d 399 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari). Patents \u201ccan discourage research by impeding the free exchange of information,\u201d for example, by forcing people to \u201cavoid the use of potentially patented ideas, by leading them to conduct costly and time-consuming searches of existing or pending patents, by requiring complex licensing arrangements, and by raising the costs of using the patented\u201d methods. <em>Id., </em>at 127, 126 S. Ct. 2921, 165 L. Ed. 2d 399. Although \u201c[e]very patent is the grant of a privilege of exacting tolls from the public,\u201d <em>Great Atlantic, </em>340 U.S., at 154, 71 S. Ct. 127, 95 L. Ed. 162 (Douglas, J., concurring), the tolls of patents on business methods may be especially high.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The primary concern is that patents on business methods may prohibit a wide swath of legitimate competition and innovation. As one scholar explains, \u201cit is useful to conceptualize knowledge as a pyramid: the big ideas are on top; specific applications are at the bottom.\u201d Dreyfuss 275. The higher up a patent is on the pyramid, the greater the social cost and the greater the hindrance to further innovation.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Thus, this Court stated in <em>Benson </em>that \u201c[p]henomena of nature . . . , mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work,\u201d 409 U.S., at 67, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273; see also <em>Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>180 F.2d, at 28 (\u201cTo give appellant a monopoly, through the issuance of a patent, upon so great an area . . . would in our view impose without warrant of law a serious restraint upon the advance of science and industry\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">[561 U.S. 654]</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">Business methods are similarly often closer to \u201cbig ideas,\u201d as they are the basic tools of <em>commercial </em>work. They are also, in many cases, the basic tools of further business innovation: Innovation in business methods is often a sequential and complementary process in which imitation may be a <em>\u201cspur </em>to innovation\u201d and patents may \u201cbecome an <em>impediment.\u201d </em>Bessen &amp; Maskin, Sequential Innovation, Patents, and Imitation, 40 RAND J. Econ. 611, 613 (2009).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> \u201cThink how the airline industry might now be structured if the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>company to offer frequent flyer miles had enjoyed the sole right to award them.\u201d Dreyfuss 264. \u201c[limitation and refinement through imitation are both necessary to invention itself and the very lifeblood of a competitive economy.\u201d <em>Bonito Boats, </em>489 U.S., at 146, 109 S. Ct. 971, 103 L. Ed. 2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">If business methods could be patented, then many business decisions, no matter how small, could be <em>potential </em>patent violations. Businesses would either live in constant fear of litigation or would need to undertake the costs of searching through patents that describe methods of doing business, attempting to decide whether their innovation is one that remains in the public domain. See Long, Information Costs in Patent and Copyright, 90 Va. L. Rev. 465, 487-488 (2004) (hereinafter Long). But as we have long explained, patents should not \u201cembarras [s] the honest pursuit of business with fears and apprehensions of concealed hens and unknown liabilities to lawsuits and vexatious accountings for profits made in good faith.\u201d <em>Atlantic Works </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>107 U.S. 192, 200, 2 S. Ct. 225, 27 L. Ed. 438 (1883).<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">[561 U.S. 655]</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">These effects are magnified by the \u201cpotential vagueness\u201d of business method patents, <em>eBay Inc., </em>547 U.S., at 397, 126 S. Ct. 1837, 164 L. Ed. 2d 641 (Kennedy, J., concurring). When it comes to patents, \u201cclarity is essential to promote progress.\u201d <em>Festo Corp., </em>535 U.S., at 730-731, 122 S. Ct. 1831, 152 L. Ed. 2d 944. Yet patents on methods of conducting business generally are composed largely or entirely of intangible steps. Compared to \u201cthe kinds of goods . . . around which patent rules historically developed,\u201d it thus tends to be more costly and time consuming to search through, and to negotiate licenses for, patents on business methods. See Long 539, 470.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">The breadth of business methods, their omnipresence in our society, and their potential vagueness also invite a particularly pernicious use of patents that we have long criticized. As early as the 19th century, we explained that the patent laws are not intended to \u201ccreat[e] a class of speculative schemers who make it their business to watch the advancing wave of improvement, and gather its foam in the form of patented monopolies, which enable them to lay a heavy tax upon the industry of the country, without contributing anything to the real advancement of the arts.\u201d <em>Atlantic Works, </em>107 U.S., at 200, 2 S. Ct. 225, 27 L. Ed. 438. Yet business method patents may have begun to do exactly that. See <em>eBay Inc., </em>547 U.S., at 396-397, 126 S. Ct. 1837, 164 L. Ed. 2d 641 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">These many costs of business method patents not only may stifle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>innovation, but they are also likely to \u201cstifle competition,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">[561 U.S. 656]</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\"><em>Bonito Boats, </em>489 U.S., at 146, 109 S. Ct. 971, 103 L. Ed. 2d 118. Even if a business method patent is ultimately held invalid, patent holders may be able to use it to threaten litigation and to bully competitors, especially those that cannot bear the costs of a drawn-out, fact-intensive patent litigation.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> That can take a particular toll on small and upstart businesses.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Of course, patents always serve as a barrier to competition for the type of subject matter that is patented. But patents on business methods are patents on business itself. Therefore, unlike virtually every other category of patents, they are by their very nature likely to depress the dynamism of the marketplace.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pA3Wm\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"35\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAATIAAAAjAQAAAAA/QLviAAAAk0lEQVR4nO2UsQnDMBREJUHAXUaI1vAuWSKdy5QZI6PIxn0gq7hJYTg3B7niCALHndS9/56NbIQiQs0aU1UWQut+d3cdGmCHIsbBQft79jJzwO6mzzpgN3xEOWB3XURZAABgveC7DBS+L2X9NgPsFlUO2L31PzrgaD6LcsDu0YlywO51EuWAXZ5EOfj3eYnt3tjVbaU0SfJkfDKrAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"306\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The constitutional standard for pat-entability is difficult to apply with any precision, and Congress has significant discretion to \u201cimplement the stated purpose of the Framers by selecting the policy which in its judgment best effectuates the constitutional aim,\u201d <em>Graham, </em>383 U.S., at 6, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545. But Congress has not, either explicitly or implicitly, determined that patents on methods of doing business would effectuate this aim. And as I understand their practical consequences, it is hard to see how they would.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">[561 U.S. 657]</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">The Constitution grants to Congress an important power to promote innovation. In its exercise of that power, Congress has established an intricate system of intellectual property. The scope of patentable subject matter under that system is broad. But it is not endless. In the absence of any clear guidance from Congress, we have only limited textual, historical, and functional clues on which to rely. Those clues all point toward the same conclusion: that petitioners\u2019 claim is not a \u201cprocess\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7101 because methods of doing business are not, in themselves, covered by the statute. In my view, acknowledging as much would be a far more sensible and restrained way to resolve this case. Accordingly, while I concur in the judgment, I strongly disagree with the Court\u2019s disposition of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-15\">. Even if the machine-or-transformation test may not define the scope of a patentable process, it would be a grave mistake to assume that anything with a \u201c Rseful, concrete and tangible result,\u2019 \u201d <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Signature Financial Group, Inc., </em>149 F.3d 1368, 1373 (CA Fed. 1998), may be patented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-13\">. For example, a rule that broadly phrased claims cannot constitute patentable processes could call into question our approval of Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s famous fifth claim on \u201c \u2018[t]he method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically, as herein described, by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds, substantially as set forth,\u2019 \u201d <em>The Telephone Cases, </em>126 U.S. 1, 531, 8 S.

Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1980), for the proposition that, \u201c \u2018[i]n choosing such expansive terms . . . modified by the comprehensive \u201cany,\u201d Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 601, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 800. But the Court fails to mention which terms we were discussing in <em>Chakrabarty: </em>the terms \u201cmanufacture\u201d and \u201ccomposition of matter.\u201d See 447 U.S., at 308, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (\u201cIn choosing such expansive terms as \u2018manufacture\u2019 and \u2018composition of matter,\u2019 modified by the comprehensive \u2018any,\u2019 Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope\u201d). As discussed herein, Congress\u2019 choice of the term \u201cprocess\u201d reflected a background understanding of what sorts of series of steps could be patented, and likely reflected an intentional design to codify that settled, judicial understanding. This may not have been the case with the terms at issue in <em>Chakrabarty.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\">. For example, if this Court were to interpret the Sherman Act according to the Act\u2019s plain text, it could prohibit \u201cthe entire body of private contract,\u2019\u2019 <em>National Soc. of Professional Engineers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>435 U.S. 679, 688, 98 S.

The Court attempts to avoid such absurd results by stating that these \u201c[c]oncerns\u2019\u2019 \u201ccan be met by making sure the claim meets the requirements of \u00a7 101.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 603, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 802. Because the only limitation on the plain meaning of \u201cprocess\u201d that the Court acknowledges explicitly is the bar on abstract ideas, laws of nature, and the like, it is presumably this limitation that is left to stand between all conceivable human activity and patent monopolies. But many processes that would make for absurd patents are not abstract ideas. Nor can the requirements of novelty, nonobviousness, and particular description pick up the slack.

See <em>ante, </em>at 601-602, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 800-801 (opinion of the Court); <em>ante, </em>at 622, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 813-814 (opinion of Stevens, J.). \u201c[T]he underlying policy of the patent system [is] that \u2018the things which are worth to the public the embarrassment of an exclusive patent,\u2019 . . . must outweigh the restrictive effect of the limited patent monopoly.\u201d <em>Graham </em>v. <em>John Deere Co. of Kansas City, </em>383 U.S. 1, 10-11, 86 S. Ct. 684, 15 L. Ed. 2d 545 (1966) (quoting Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Isaac McPherson (Aug. 13, 1813), in 6 Writings of Thomas Jefferson 181 (H. Washington ed.)). The Court has thus been careful in interpreting the Patent Act to \u201cdetermine not only what is protected, but also what is free for all to use.\u201d <em>Bonito Boats, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., </em>489 U.S. 141, 151, 109 S. Ct. 971, 103 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1989). In particular, the Court has long held that \u201c[p]henomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable\u201d under \u00a7 101, since allowing individuals to patent these fundamental principles would \u201cwholly preempt\u201d the public\u2019s access to the \u201cbasic tools of scientific and technological work.\u201d <em>Gottschalk </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>409 U.S. 63, 67, 72, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (1972); see also, <em>e.g., Diamond </em>v. <em>Diehr, </em>450 U.S. 175, 185, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (1981); <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Chakrabarty, </em>447 U.S. 303, 309, 100 S. Ct. 2204, 65 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-11\"><em>Second, </em>in a series of cases that extend back over a century, the Court has stated that \u201c[t]ransformation and reduction of an article to a different state or thing is <em>the clue </em>to the patent-ability of a process claim that does not include particular machines.\u201d <em>Diehr, supra, </em>at 184, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted); see also, <em>e.g., Benson, supra, </em>at 70, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Flook, </em>437 U.S. 584, 588, n. 9, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1978); <em>Cochrane </em>v. <em>Deener, </em>94 U.S. 780, 788, 24 L. Ed. 139 (1877). Application of</p>\n<p id=\"b882-12\">[561 U.S. 659]</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">this test, the so-called \u201cmachine-or-transformation test,\u201d has thus repeatedly helped the Court to determine what is \u201ca patentable \u2018process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flook, supra, </em>at 589, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\"><em>Third, </em>while the machine-or-transformation test has always been a \u201cuseful and important clue,\u201d it has never been the \u201csole test\u201d for deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>mining patentability. <em>Ante, </em>at 604, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 803; see also <em>ante, </em>at 614, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 808 (opinion of Stevens, J.); <em>Benson, supra, </em>at 71, 93 S. Ct. 253, 34 L. Ed. 2d 273 (rejecting the argument that \u201cno process patent could ever qualify\u201d for protection under \u00a7 101 \u201cif it did not meet the [machine-or-transformation] requirements\u201d). Rather, the Court has emphasized that a process claim meets the requirements of \u00a7 101 when, \u201cconsidered as a whole,\u201d it \u201cis performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect <em>(e.g., </em>transforming or reducing an article to a different state or thing).\u201d <em>Diehr, supra, </em>at 192, 101 S. Ct. 1048, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155. The machine-or-transformation test is thus an <em>important example </em>of how a court can determine patentability under \u00a7 101, but the Federal Circuit erred in this case by treating it as the <em>exclusive test.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\"><em>Fourth, </em>although the machine-or-transformation test is not the only test for patentability, this by no means indicates that anything which produces a \u201c \u2018useful, concrete and tangible result,\u2019 \u201d <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Signature Financial Group, Inc., </em>149 F.3d 1368, 1373 (CA Fed. 1998), is patentable. \u201c[T]his Court has never made such a statement and, if taken literally, the statement would cover instances where this Court has held the contrary.\u201d <em>Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings </em>v. <em>Metabolite Laboratories, Inc., </em>548 U.S. 124, 136, 126 S. Ct. 2921, 165 L. Ed. 2d 399 (2006) (Breyer, J., dissenting from dismissal of certiorari as improvidently granted); see also, <em>e.g., O\u2019Reilly </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>15 How. 62, 117, 14 L. Ed. 601 (1854); <em>Flook, supra, </em>at 590, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451. Indeed, the introduction of the \u201cuseful, concrete and tangible result\u201d approach to patentability, associated with the Federal Circuit\u2019s <em>State Street </em>decision, preceded the granting of patents that \u201cranged from the somewhat ridiculous to the truly absurd.\u201d <em>In re Bilski, </em>545 F.3d 943, 1004</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">[561 U.S. 660]</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">(CA Fed. 2008) (Mayer, J., dissenting) (citing patents on, <em>inter alia, </em>a \u201cmethod of training janitors to dust and vacuum using video displays,\u201d a \u201csystem for toilet reservations,\u201d and a \u201cmethod of using color-coded bracelets to designate dating status in order to limit \u2018the embarrassment of rejection\u2019 \u201d); see also Brief for Respondent 40-41, and n. 20 (listing dubious patents). To the extent that the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in this case rejected that approach, nothing in today\u2019s decision should be taken as disapproving of that determination. See <em>ante, </em>at 612, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 807-808; <em>ante, </em>at 614, n. 1, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 809 (opinion of Stevens, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">In sum, it is my view that, in reemphasizing that the \u201cmachine-or-transformation\u201d test is not necessarily the <em>sole </em>test of patentability, the Court intends neither to deemphasize the test\u2019s usefulness nor to suggest that many patentable processes he beyond its reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b883-11\">With these observations, I concur in the Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
