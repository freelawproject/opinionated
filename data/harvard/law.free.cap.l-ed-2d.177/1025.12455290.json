Sears performs at or</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-19\">[561 U.S. 946]</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-20\">below the bottom first percentile in several measures of cognitive functioning and reasoning. The cause of this abnormality appears to be significant frontal lobe brain damage Sears suffered as a child, as well as drug and alcohol abuse in his teens. But because\u2014in the words of the state trial court\u2014his counsel conducted a penalty phase investigation that was \u201con its face . . . constitutionally inadequate,\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B, evidence relating to Sears\u2019 cognitive impairments and childhood difficulties was not brought to light at the time he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-23\">After finding constitutionally deficient attorney performance under the framework we set forth in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the state postconviction court found itself unable to assess whether counsel\u2019s inadequate investigation might have prejudiced Sears. App. to Pet. for Cert. 29B-30B. Because Sears\u2019 counsel did present <em>some </em>mitigation evidence during Sears\u2019 penalty phase\u2014 but not the significant mitigation evidence a constitutionally adequate investigation would have uncovered\u2014 the state court determined it could not speculate as to what the effect of additional evidence would have been. <em>Id., </em>at 30B. Accordingly, it denied Sears postconviction relief. <em>Id., </em>at 34B. Thereafter, the Supreme Court of Georgia summarily denied review of his claims. <em>Id., </em>at 1A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>For the reasons that follow, it is plain from the face of the state court\u2019s opinion that it failed to apply the correct prejudice inquiry we have established for evaluating Sears\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim. We therefore grant the petition for writ of certio-rari, vacate the judgment, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\">[561 U.S. 947]</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">In 1993, a Georgia jury convicted Sears of armed robbery and kidnap-ing with bodily injury (which also resulted in death), a capital crime under state law. See Ga. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-40(d)(4) (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the penalty phase of Sears\u2019 capital trial, his counsel presented evidence describing his childhood as stable, loving, and essentially without incident. Seven witnesses offered testimony along the following lines: Sears came from a middle-class background; his actions shocked and dismayed his relatives; and a death sentence, the jury was told, would devastate the family. See Pet. for Cert. 6-7. Counsel\u2019s mitigation theory, it seems, was calculated to portray the adverse impact of Sears\u2019 execution on his family and loved ones. 20 Record 5181. But the strategy backfired. The prosecutor ultimately used the evidence of Sears\u2019 purportedly stable and advantaged upbringing against him during the State\u2019s closing argument. With Sears, the prosecutor told the jury, \u201c[w]e don\u2019t have a deprived child from an inner city; a person who[m] society has turned its back on at an early age. But, yet, we have a person, privileged in every way, who has rejected every opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">[561 U.S. 948]</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">that was afforded him.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 7-8 (quoting trial transcript; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">The mitigation evidence that emerged during the state postconviction evidentiary hearing, however, demonstrates that Sears was far from \u201cprivileged in every way.\u201d Sears\u2019 home life, while filled with material comfort, was anything but tranquil: His parents had a physically abusive relationship, Exh. 26, 6 Record 1676 (Affidavit of Demetrius A. Sears), and divorced when Sears was young, Exh. 22, <em>id., </em>at 1654 (Affidavit of Virginia Sears Graves); he suffered sexual abuse at the hands of an adolescent male cousin, Exh. 26, <em>id., </em>at 1681-1682; his mother\u2019s \u201cfavorite word for referring to her sons was \u2018little mother fuckers,\u2019\u201d Exh. 3, 2 <em>id., </em>at 265 (Affidavit of Richard G. Dudley, Jr., M. D.); and his father was \u201cverbally abusive,\u201d Exh. 37, 6 <em>id., </em>at 1746-1747 (Affidavit of Carol Becci-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>Youngs),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and disciplined Sears with age-inappropriate military-style drills, Exh. 3, 2 <em>id., </em>at 263-264; Exh. 19, 6 <em>id., </em>at 1622 (Affidavit of Frank Sears); Exh. 22, <em>id., </em>at 1651; Exh. 28, <em>id., </em>at 1694 (Affidavit of Kenneth Burns, Sr.). Sears struggled in school, demonstrating substantial behavior problems from a very young age. For example, Sears repeated the second grade, Exh. 6, 3 <em>id., </em>at 500-501, and was referred to a local health center for evaluation at age nine, Exh. 7, <em>id., </em>at 503, 504, 508. By the time Sears reached high school, he was \u201cdescribed as severely learning disabled and as severely behaviorally handicapped.\u201d Exh. A to Exh. 1, 2 <em>id., </em>at 174-176 (Affidavit of Tony L. Strickland, M. S., Ph. D.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">[561 U.S. 949]</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">Environmental factors aside, and more significantly, evidence produced during the state postconviction relief process also revealed that Sears suffered \u201csignificant frontal lobe abnormalities.\u201d Exh. 1, <em>id., </em>at 147. Two different psychological experts testified that Sears had substantial deficits in mental cognition and reason<em>ing\u2014i.e., </em>\u201cproblems with planning, sequencing and impulse control,\u201d ibid.\u2014as a result of several serious head injuries he suffered as a child, as well as drug and alcohol abuse. See 1 Record 37-40 (Testimony of Dr. Strickland); <em>id.., </em>at 95-96 (Testimony of Dr. Dudley). Regardless of the cause of his brain damage, his scores on at least two standardized assessment tests placed him at or below the first percentile in several categories of cognitive function, \u201cmaking him among the most impaired individuals in the population in terms of ability to suppress competing impulses and conform behavior only to relevant stimuli.\u201d Exh. 1, 2 <em>id., </em>at 148; see also 1 <em>id., </em>at 37. The assessment also revealed that Sears\u2019 \u201cability to organize his choices, assign them relative weight and select among them in a deliberate way is grossly impaired.\u201d Exh. 1, 2 <em>id., </em>at 149. From an etiological standpoint, one expert explained that Sears\u2019 \u201chistory is replete with multiple head trauma, substance abuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected\u201d to lead to these significant impairments. <em>Id., </em>at 150; see also 1 <em>id., </em>at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">Whatever concern the dissent has about some of the sources relied upon by Sears\u2019 experts\u2014informal personal accounts, see <em>post, </em>at 960-963, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1037-1039 (opinion of Sca-lia, J.)\u2014it does not undermine the well-credentialed expert\u2019s assessment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> based</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">[561 U.S. 950]</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-9\">on between 12 and 16 hours of interviews, testing, and observations, see 1 Record 32, that Sears suffers from substantial cognitive impairment. Sears performed dismally on several of the forensic tests administered to him to assess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>his frontal lobe functioning. On the Stroop Word Interference Test, which measures response inhibition, <em>id., </em>at 36-37, 99.6% of those individuals in his cohort (which accounts for age, education, and background) performed better than he did. <em>Ibid. </em>On the Trail-Making B test, which also measures frontal lobe functioning, <em>id., </em>at 37-38, Sears performed at the first (and lowest) percentile. <em>Id., </em>at 38. Based on these results, the expert\u2019s firsthand observations, and an extensive review of Sears\u2019 personal history, the expert\u2019s opinion was unequivocal: There is \u201cclear and compelling evidence\u201d that Sears has \u201cpronounced frontal lobe pathology.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\">Further, the fact that Sears\u2019 brother is a convicted drug dealer and user, and introduced Sears to a life of crime, 6 <em>id., </em>at 1683-1686, actually would have been consistent with a mitigation theory portraying Sears as an individual with diminished judgment and reasoning skills, who may have desired to follow in the footsteps of an older brother who had shut him out of his life, <em>post, </em>at 962, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1038. And the fact that some of such evidence may have been \u201chearsay\u201d does not necessarily undermine its value\u2014or its admissibility\u2014for penalty phase purposes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Post, </em>at 961, n. 3, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1037-1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">[561 U.S. 951]</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">Finally, the fact that along with this new mitigation evidence there was also some adverse evidence is unsurprising, <em>post, </em>at 962-963, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1038-1039, given that counsel\u2019s initial mitigation investigation was constitutionally inadequate. Competent counsel should have been able to turn some of the adverse evidence into a positive\u2014perhaps in support of a cognitive deficiency mitigation theory. In particular, evidence of Sears\u2019 grandiose self-conception and evidence of his magical thinking, <em>ibid., </em>were features, in another well-credentialed expert\u2019s view,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of a \u201cprofound personality disorder.\u201d 1 Record 104. This evidence might not have made Sears any more likable to the jury, but it might well have helped the jury understand Sears, and his horrendous acts\u2014especially in light of his purportedly stable upbringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>Because they failed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation, <em>none </em>of this evidence was known to Sears\u2019 trial counsel. It emerged only during state postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Unsurprisingly, the state postcon-viction trial court concluded that Sears had demonstrated his counsel\u2019s penalty phase investigation was constitutionally deficient. See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (explaining that  first inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">[561 U.S. 952]</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">when evaluating Sixth Amendment ineffectiveness claim is whether counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d). In its view, the cursory nature of counsel\u2019s investigation into mitigation evidence\u2014\u201climited to one day or less, talking to witnesses selected by [Sears\u2019] mother\u201d\u2014was \u201con its face . . . constitutionally inadequate.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 27B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">What is surprising, however, is the court\u2019s analysis regarding whether counsel\u2019s facially inadequate mitigation investigation prejudiced Sears. See <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. Although the court appears to have stated the proper prejudice standard,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it did not correctly conceptualize how that standard applies to the circumstances of this case. Because Sears\u2019 counsel did present some mitigation evidence during his penalty phase, the court concluded that \u201c [t]his case cannot be fairly compared with those where little or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome can be made.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. The court explained that \u201cit is impossible to know what effect [a different mitigation theory] would have had on [the jury].\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cBecause counsel put forth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201c[Sears] . . . failed to meet his burden of proving that there is a reasonable likelihood that the outcome at trial would have been different if a different mitigation theory had been advanced.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">[561 U.S. 953]</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-11\">There are two errors in the state court\u2019s analysis of Sears\u2019 Sixth Amendment claim. First, the court curtailed a more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel\u2019s mitigation theory. The court\u2019s determination that counsel had conducted a constitutionally deficient mitigation investigation should have, at the very least, called into question the reasonableness of this theory. Cf. <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>539 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>510, 522, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003) (explaining that \u201ccounsel\u2019s failure to uncover and present voluminous mitigating evidence at sentencing could not be justified as a tactical decision . . . because counsel had not \u2018fulfill [ed] their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 396, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000); alteration in original)). And, more to the point,  that a theory might be reasonable, in the abstract, does not obviate the need to analyze whether counsel\u2019s failure to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation before arriving at this particular theory prejudiced Sears. The \u201creasonableness\u201d of counsel\u2019s theory was, at this stage in the inquiry, beside the point: Sears might be prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failures, whether his haphazard choice was reasonable or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">Justice Scalia chides the Court for concluding that the trial court assumed, rather than found, that counsel\u2019s mitigation theory was a reasonable one. <em>Post, </em>at 957, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1035. But our point is that  any finding with respect to the reasonableness of the mitigation theory counsel utilized\u2014in this case, family impact\u2014is in tension with the trial court\u2019s unambiguous finding</p>\n<p id=\"A2BH\">[561 U.S. 954]</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">that counsel\u2019s investigation was itself so unreasonable as to be facially unconstitutional. This point is plain in <em>Williams: </em>We rejected any suggestion that a decision to focus on one potentially reasonable trial strategy\u2014in that case, petitioner\u2019s voluntary confession\u2014was \u201cjustified by a tactical decision\u201d when \u201ccounsel did not fulfill their obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background.\u201d 529 U.S., at 396, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389. A \u201ctactical decision\u201d is a precursor to concluding that counsel has developed a \u201creasonable\u201d mitigation theory in a particular case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Second, and more fundamentally, the court failed to apply the proper prejudice inquiry.  We have never limited the prejudice inquiry under <em>Strickland </em>to cases in which there was only \u201clittle or no mitigation evidence\u201d presented, App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. True, we have considered cases involving such circumstances,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and we have explained that there is no prejudice when the new mitigating evidence \u201cwould barely have altered the sentencing profile presented\u201d to the decisionmaker, <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S., at 700, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. But we also have found deficiency <em>and </em>prejudice in other cases in which counsel presented what could be described as a superficially reasonable mitigation theory during the penalty phase. <em>E.g., Williams, supra, </em>at 398, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (remorse and cooperation with police); <em>Rompilla </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 378, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>2d 360 (2005) (residual doubt). We did so most recently in <em>Porter</em></p>\n<p id=\"aqkn-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 955]</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">v. <em>McCollum, </em>558 U.S. 30, 32, 130 S. Ct. 447, 175 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2009) <em>(per curiam), </em>where counsel at trial had attempted to blame his client\u2019s bad acts on his drunkenness, and had failed to discover significant mitigation evidence relating to his client\u2019s heroic military service and substantial mental health difficulties that came to light only during postconviction relief, <em>id., </em>at 40-41, 130 S. Ct. 447, 175 L. Ed. 2d 398. Not only did we find prejudice in <em>PoHer, </em>but\u2014bound by deference owed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2014we also concluded the state court had <em>unreasonably </em>applied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong when it analyzed Porter\u2019s claim. <em>Porter, supra, </em>at 42, 130 S. Ct. 447, 175 L. Ed. 2d 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">We certainly have never held that counsel\u2019s effort to present <em>some </em>mitigation evidence should foreclose an inquiry into whether a facially deficient mitigation investigation might have prejudiced the defendant. To the contrary, we have consistently explained that the <em>Strickland, </em>inquiry requires precisely the type of probing and fact-specific analysis that the state trial court failed to undertake below.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the <em>Williams </em>decision, for instance, we categorically rejected the type of truncated prejudice inquiry undertaken by the state court in this case. 529 U.S., at 397-398, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389. And, in <em>Poider, </em>we recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-7\">\u201cTo assess [the] probability [of a different outcome under <em>Strick</em>land'], we consider the totality of the available</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-8\">[561 U.S. 956]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_q_\">mitigation evidence\u2014 both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding\u2014and reweig[h] it against the evidence in aggravation.\u201d 558 U.S., at 41, 130 S. Ct. 447, 175 L. Ed. 2d 398 (internal quotation marks omitted; third alteration in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">That same standard applies\u2014and will necessarily require a court to \u201cspeculate\u201d as to the effect of the new evidence\u2014regardless of how much or how little mitigation evidence was presented during the initial penalty phase. Indeed, it is exactly this kind of probing inquiry that Justice Scalia now undertakes, <em>post, </em>at 960-964, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1037-1039, and that the trial court failed to do. In all circumstances, this is the proper prejudice standard for evaluating a claim of ineffective representation in the context of a penalty phase mitigation investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">A proper analysis of prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>would have taken into account the newly uncovered evidence of Sears\u2019 \u201csignificant\u201d mental and psychological impairments, along with the mitigation evidence introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>during Sears\u2019 penalty phase trial, to assess whether there is a reasonable probability that Sears would have received a different sentence after a constitutionally sufficient mitigation investigation. See <em>Porter, supra, </em>at 40, 130 S. Ct. 447, 175 L. Ed. 2d 398; <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 397-398, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389; <em>Strickland, supra, </em>at 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. It is for the state court\u2014and not for either this Court or even Justice Scalia\u2014to undertake this reweighing in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">Accordingly, the petition for certio-rari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>are granted.

This is a curious assertion in light of the 22 volumes of evidentiary hearing transcripts and submissions in the record, which spell out the findings discussed above.

Ed. 2d, at 1032-1034, that the Superior Court of Butts County, Georgia, made errors of law in applying the prejudice inquiry for ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). In my view there was no error of law, and the Court today remands for the state court to do what it has already done: find no reasonable likelihood that the mitigation evidence the Court details in its opinion would have persuaded a jury to change its mind about the death sentence for this brutal rape-murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">The state habeas court responsibly executed the first step in the <em>Strickland. </em>analysis, finding that the investigation of mitigation evidence by Sears\u2019 trial counsel was deficient performance. The issue here is the second step: whether Sears was prejudiced by that deficiency. As the Court acknowledges, <em>ante, </em>at 952, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1032, the state habeas court correctly stated the prejudice standard under <em>Strickland: </em>The defendant has the burden to establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 24B-25B (citing 466 U.S., at 688, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674). \u201cWhen applied to the sentencing phase of death penalty trials,\u201d that means \u201ca reasonable probability that, absent [counsel\u2019s] errors, the sentencer would have concluded that the balance of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 25B-26B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">The Court today concludes that there were two errors in the <em>application </em>of that proper standard. First, it reasons that the court erroneously \u201ccurtailed a more probing prejudice inquiry because it placed undue reliance on the assumed reasonableness of counsel\u2019s mitigation theory\u201d at trial. <em>Ante, </em>at 953, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1032. That argument is flawed on several levels. To begin with, the state habeas court did not <em>assume </em>trial counsel\u2019s mitigation theory was reasonable; it <em>found, </em>that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-15\">[561 U.S. 958]</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-16\">It said: \u201c[Although counsel failed to investigate thoroughly, they did develop a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>reasonable mitigation theory with evidence to support it.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B. After interviews of roughly a dozen potential mitigation witnesses, who, with the exception of Sears\u2019 father, gave positive accounts of Sears and his family, see 7 Record 2025, 2051-2052; 8 <em>id., </em>at 2129, 2291-2344, Sears\u2019 trial counsel developed a mitigation theory that Sears came from a good family and had a solid middle-class upbringing; that his offense was completely out of character; that he cooperated with police; and that sentencing Sears to death would devastate his family and friends, see <em>id., </em>at 2124-2125; 19 <em>id., </em>at 4861-4862, 4916-4917, 4954-4955; 20 <em>id., </em>at 5181. To support that approach his attorneys called seven witnesses, including Sears\u2019 mother, four family friends, and his high school guidance counselor. See Pet. for Cert. 6-7 (citing trial transcript pages between 2375 and 2451). The state habeas court did not declare that this mitigation theory \u201cmight be reasonable, in the abstract,\u201d as the Court puts it, <em>ante, </em>at 953, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1033. Rather, it concluded that counsel \u201cput forth a reasonable theory with supporting evidence.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">The Court\u2019s argument is also flawed because the habeas court\u2019s reasonableness finding did <em>not </em>cause it to \u201ccurtai[l]\u201d its prejudice inquiry, or lead to the conclusion that it could \u201cobviate the need to analyze\u201d whether pursuing a different mitigation theory would have made a difference. <em>Ante, </em>at 953, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1033. The reasonableness finding merely meant that the prejudice determination had to be made by asking, not whether the jury\u2019s mind would probably have been changed by hearing Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory instead of hearing no mitigation theory at all; but rather whether it would probably have been changed by substituting Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory for the reasonable mitigation theory that was presented and rejected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After hearing all the witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">[561 U.S. 959]</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">and other evidence Sears presented before it, the state court concluded that \u201cit is just not possible to know what effect a <em>different </em>mitigation theory would have had.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">The second, \u201cand more fundamental!],\u201d legal error the Court alleges, <em>ante, </em>at 954, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1033, is really encased within the first. The Court claims that the state habeas court \u201climited the prejudice inquiry under <em>Strickland, </em>to cases in which there was only \u2018little or no mitigation evidence\u2019 presented.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B). The court erred, we are told, by determining that \u201cpresentation of] <em>some </em>mitigation evidence should foreclose an inquiry into whether\u201d Sears was prejudiced. <em>Ante, </em>at 955, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1034. That is not a fair reading of the opinion. The state court did not hold that a defendant could never suffer prejudice whenever his counsel provided <em>any </em>mitigation evidence. Rather, it stated that \u201c|t]his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>case <em>cannot be fairly compared </em>with those where little or no mitigation evidence is presented and where a reasonable prediction of outcome can be made.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B (emphasis added). That is absolutely correct. This case is not like the prejudice cases on which the Court relies, where it could readily be said that the overlooked mitigation theory would have made a much deeper impression on the jury than the utterly unsupported theory (or absence of any theory) offered at trial. See <em>Porter </em>v. <em>McCollum, </em>558 U.S. 30, 41, 130 S. Ct. 447, 175 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2009) <em>(per curiam); Rompilla </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 378, 393, 125 S. Ct. 2456, 162 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2005); <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510,</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\">[561 U.S. 960]</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">515, 537, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 369, 120 S. Ct. 1495, 146 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2000). Sears\u2019 trial counsel presented a reasonable mitigation theory and offered evidence sufficient to support it, so the prejudice inquiry was more difficult\u2014so difficult that Sears could not make the requisite showing. Clearly referring to the evidence in this particular case, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-6\">\u201cAlthough here, the Petitioner can argue that a prior appeal shows the difficulty one juror was having reaching the same verdict as the others, it is just not possible to know what effect a different mitigation theory would have had on her, just as it is impossible to know what effect it would have had on other jurors.\u201d App. to Pet. for Cert. 30B.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Since the habeas court made no legal error en route to its <em>Strickland </em>conclusion, the only basis for reversing the judgment here would be disagreement with the conclusion itself: that Sears had not established that his new mitigation theory would probably have caused the jury to impose a life sentence instead of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">The Court makes no attempt to contradict that conclusion. Doing so would require a fact-intensive inquiry into the 22-volume record to measure the persuasiveness of the evidence supporting Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory\u2014an inquiry the Court purports to disavow, <em>ante, </em>at 956, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1034, but nonetheless tendentiously undertakes, <em>ante, </em>at 948-950, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1029-1031. The reader might think the state habeas court\u2019s conclusion highly questionable from the Court\u2019s account, which recites as solid all the evidence supporting Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory, see <em>ante, </em>at 948-551, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1029-1032. It is far from solid. Some is likely inadmissible as unreliable hearsay under Georgia law, see <em>Gissendaner </em>v. <em>State, </em>272 Ga. 704, 714, 532 S.E.2d 677, 688-689 (2000); <em>Gulley </em>v. <em>State, </em>271 Ga. 337, 347, 519 S.E.2d 655, 664 (1999)\u2014such as much of the evidence for the uncorroborated second-hand claim that Sears \u201csuffered sexual abuse at the hands of</p>\n<p id=\"A6iI\">[561 U.S. 961]</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">an adolescent male cousin,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 948, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1029.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Other evidence a competent attorney would likely not have placed before the jury\u2014such as all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>testimony about Sears\u2019 childhood from his brother Demetrius, an admitted drug dealer and drug user, 6 Record 1682-1684, 1695, 1752, and a convicted felon (for bank fraud, wire fraud, identity theft, and cocaine trafficking), id<em>., </em>at 1687. No juror would have been impressed by such a character witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">Some of the evidence is incredible, such as the psychiatrist\u2019s assertion that Sears had \u201csubstantial deficits in mental cognition and reasoning ... as a result of several serious head injuries he suffered as a child,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 949, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1030. The serious head injuries consisted of Sears\u2019 hitting his head at a rollerskating rink sometime early in elementary school, 1 Record 76; 2 <em>id., </em>at 225, running into an end table as a child, 6 <em>id., </em>at 1651, and getting hit with a golf club sometime later in elementary school, 1 <em>id., </em>at 79; 2 <em>id., </em>at 225.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (The last of</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">[561 U.S. 962]</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">these major injuries might not have been introduced anyway, since that would have provided the prosecution an opportunity to refute both the extent of the injury and the mercy-worthiness of Sears, by introducing into evidence Sears\u2019 boast that when he was 11 or 12 he \u201cbeat the s*** out of\u2019 someone after he was hit on the head with a golf club, 8 <em>id., </em>at 2195.) Likewise incredible was the assertion that Demetrius \u201cintroduced Sears to a life of crime,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 950, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1031. According to testimony on which the Court relies, Demetrius would \u201cnever let [Sears] hang around\u201d with him and his drug-dealing friends. 6 Record 1685-1686.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">A jury also would have discredited the psychiatric testimony of Dr. Strickland that \u201c[f]rom an etiological standpoint . . . Sears\u2019 \u2018history is replete with multiple head trauma, substance abuse and traumatic experiences of the type expected\u2019 to lead to these significant [mental] impairments,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 949, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1030 (quoting 2 Record 150). As already noted, the evidence of brain-damaging trauma is nonexistent. The psychiatric testimony of Dr. Dudley relied upon the self-interested reporting of Sears himself and the testimony of his less-than-trustworthy brother, Demetrius, see, <em>e.g., </em>1 <em>id., </em>at 122, 133. And then there are the unfavorable parts of Dr. Dudley\u2019s testimony: Sears is a \u201cnarcissis [t],\u201d <em>id., </em>at 135, with a \u201cgrandiose\u201d opinion of himself, <em>id., </em>at 98-99; 2 <em>id., </em>at 246. Dr. Dudley\u2019s affidavit portrays Sears as arrogant and self-centered, <em>id., </em>at 246, 247, and notes what he termed Sears\u2019 \u201cfantastical\u201d boasting of his first sexual experience with a woman at the age of six and his other \u201cinnumerable sexual experiences,\u201d 1 <em>id., </em>at 98-99, 100; 2 <em>id., </em>at 246-247. It is hard to see how it could be thought probable that Sears\u2019 so-called \u201cmagical thinking,\u201d 1 <em>id., </em>at 84, would have helped his plea for leniency, see <em>ante, </em>at 951, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1031. It seems to me more likely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>jury would conclude that Sears\u2019 \u201cpro-foun[d] personality</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">[561 U.S. 963]</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">disorder,\u201d 1 Record 104, made him exactly the kind of person who would commit heinous crimes in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">And some of the evidence the Court recounts is so utterly unlikely to affect a jury\u2019s determination that this brutal murder deserved death that its recitation is just plain hilarious. For example, the claim that Sears\u2019 father \u201cwas \u2018verbally abusive,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 948, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1029, resting on nothing more than an art teacher\u2019s recollection that Sears\u2019 father \u201cseverely criticized\u201d him\u2014\u201cand meant it\u201d!\u2014at a conference with the principal concerning his son\u2019s poor academic performance, 6 Record 1747; the claim that his father \u201cdisciplined Sears with age-inappropriate military-style drills,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 948, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1030, which consisted of positively VonSteubenesque acts such as dousing the kid with cold water when he refused to get up for school, and making him run extra laps after sports practices, 6 Record 1622; and the claim that his mother\u2019s \u201c \u2018favorite word\u2019 \u201d\u2014actually three words\u2014to refer to her sons was scatological, <em>ante, </em>at 948, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1029 (quoting 2 Record 265).</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">While the Court takes pains to describe all the elements of Sears\u2019 new mitigation theory, down to the silliest, it does not trouble to describe the brutal circumstances of the crime\u2014 which are at least just as relevant to assessing whether the different mitigation theory would probably have altered the sentence. But the jury heard all about them. See <em>Sears </em>v. <em>State, </em>268 Ga. 759, 759-760, 493 S.E.2d 180, 182 (1997). They heard Sears\u2019 confession that he kidnaped, raped, and murdered Gloria Wilbur, a 59-year-old wife and mother. Sears, carrying a briefcase containing various instruments of mayhem\u2014brass knuckles, knives, and handcuffs\u2014and his accomplice, Phillip Williams, were surveying a supermarket parking lot on a Sunday evening in October 1990, looking for a car to steal to drive back home to Ohio from Georgia. As the victim was putting her groceries in the trunk of her car, Sears approached, punched her in the face with his brass knuckles, shoved her into the car, and drove to pick up Williams. Sears then handcuffed her and pulled her into the</p>\n<p id=\"apgc-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 964]</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-10\">backseat as Williams drove. After they passed into Tennessee, Sears raped her. Later in the evening, after they had crossed into Kentucky, Sears told Williams to stop the car. Sears forced her, still handcuffed, into the woods by the side of the highway as she begged for her life. After throwing her on the ground, he stabbed her in the neck. In his confession he showed no regret or remorse for his heinous crimes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1085-12\">I do not know how anyone could disagree with the habeas court\u2019s conclusion that it is impossible to say that substituting the \u201cdeprived-childhood-cum-brain-damage\u201d defense for the \u201cgood-middle-class-kid-who-made-a-mistake\u201d defense would probably have produced a different verdict. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">. The Court contends, <em>ante, </em>at 953, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1033, that there was a \u201ctension\u201d between the state court\u2019s conclusion that the investigation was deficient and its conclusion that the mitigation theory presented to the jury was reasonable. This terribly misreads the state court\u2019s opinion. It did not say (as the Court\u2019s point assumes) that counsel\u2019s <em>using </em>the mitigation theory they did was reasonable; it said that the <em>theory itself </em>was reasonable, making it hard to say whether a different theory would have persuaded the jury. This presents no conceivable \u201ctension.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">.

Ed. 2d 738 (1979) <em>(per curiam), ante, </em>at 950-951, n. 6, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1031, to suggest that this unreliable hearsay would be admissible for sentencing purposes is entirely misplaced. In <em>Green, </em>we held it violated constitutional due process to exclude testimony regarding a co-conspirator\u2019s confession that he alone committed the capital murder with which the defendant was charged. Our holding depended on \u201cth[e] unique circumstances\u201d of the case: The testimony to be used at sentencing was \u201chighly relevant\u201d and \u201csubstantial[ly]\u201d reliable as a statement against penal interest made to a close friend; it was corroborated by \u201cample\u201d evidence and was used by the State to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>conviction in a separate trial against the co-conspirator. 442 U.S., at 97, 99 S. Ct. 2150, 60 L. Ed. 2d 738. Here there are no such circumstances. The testimony is uncorroborated secondhand reporting from self-interested witnesses that is unreliable and therefore likely inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1084-10\">. There is an unsubstantiated claim from Sears himself, 8 Record 2195, that when he was a teenager he was hit with a \u201chatchet\u201d above his right eye. Of course, that is the same place where he collided with an end table, 6 <em>id., </em>at 1651, leaving the \u201clesion\u201d\u2014better known as a scar\u2014on his head that Dr. Strickland noted, <em>ante, </em>at 950, n. 5, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1031 (quoting 1 Record 78). There is no corroborating evidence for this event: no medical records, 1 <em>id., </em>at 77, no other apparent scars, 2 <em>id., </em>at 245; 6 <em>id., </em>at 1651, and, tellingly, no family or friends to confirm what surely would have been memorable had it happened.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1085-14\">. The jury also heard from several corrections officers who testified that while Sears was incarcerated awaiting trial and sentencing, he racked up dozens of disciplinary infractions, including assaults on other inmates. \u201c \u2018Predatory\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018[i]ncorrigible,\u2019 \u201d and incapable of reform was how they described him. 10 <em>id., </em>at 2951-2957; 19 <em>id., </em>at 4868.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
