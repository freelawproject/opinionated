The voyage here included ocean transit followed by transfer to a rail carrier in this country. The Court addressed similar factual circumstances in <em>Norfolk Southern R. Co. </em>v. <em>James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., </em>543 U.S. 14, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (2004). In that case the terms of a through bill were controlled by federal maritime law and by a federal statute known as the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), note following 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30701. <em>Kirby </em>held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>that bill of lading provisions permissible under COGSA can be invoked by a domestic rail carrier, despite contrary state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The instant cases present a question neither raised nor addressed in <em>Kirby. </em>It is whether the terms of a through bill of lading issued abroad by an ocean carrier can apply to the domestic part of the import\u2019s journey by a rail carrier, despite prohibitions or limitations in another federal statute. That statute is known as the Carmack Amendment and it governs the terms of bills of lading issued by domestic rail carriers. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11706(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Respondents Regal-Beloit Corporation, Victory Fireworks, Inc., PICC Property &amp; Casualty Company Ltd., and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. are cargo owners or insurance firms that paid losses to cargo owners and succeeded to their rights, all referred to as \u201ccargo owners.\u201d To ship their goods from China to inland destinations in the Midwestern United States, the cargo owners delivered the goods in China to petitioners in No. 08-1553, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., and its agent \u201cK\u201d Line America, Inc., both referred to as \u201cK\u201d Line. All agree the relevant contract terms governing the shipment are contained in four</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">[561 U.S. 94]</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">through bills of lading \u201cK\u201d Line issued to the cargo owners. The bills of lading covered the entire course of shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The bills required \u201cK\u201d Line to arrange delivery of the goods from China to their final destinations in the United States, by any mode of transportation of \u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s choosing. A bill of lading \u201crecords that a carrier has received goods from the party that wishes to ship them, states the terms of carriage, and serves as evidence of the contract for carriage.\u201d <em>Kirby, </em>543 U.S., at 18-19, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. A through bill of lading covers both the ocean and inland portions of the transport in a single document. <em>Id., </em>at 25-26, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">\u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s through bills contain five relevant provisions. First, they include a so-called \u201cHimalaya Clause,\u201d which extends the bills\u2019 defenses and limitations on liability to parties that sign subcontracts to perform services contemplated by the bills. See <em>id., </em>at 20, and n. 2, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. Second, the bills permit \u201cK\u201d Line \u201cto sub-contract on any terms whatsoever\u201d for the completion of the journey. App. 145. Third, the bills provide that COGSA\u2019s terms govern the entire journey. Fourth, the bills require that any dispute will be governed by Japanese law. Fifth, the bills state that any action relating to the carriage must be brought in \u201cTokyo District Court in Japan.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 144. The forum-selection provision in the last clause gives rise to the dispute here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">\u201cK\u201d Line, pursuant to the bills of lading, arranged for the entire journey. It subcontracted with petitioner in No. 08-1554, Union Pacific Railroad Company, for rail shipment in the United States. The goods were to be shipped in a \u201cK\u201d Line vessel to a port in Long Beach, California, and then transferred to Union Pacific for rail carriage to the final destinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">In March and April 2005, the cargo owners brought four different container shipments to \u201cK\u201d Line vessels in Chinese ports. All parties seem to assume that \u201cK\u201d Line safely transported the cargo across the Pacific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Ocean to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">[561 U.S. 95]</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The containers were then loaded onto a Union Pacific train and that train, or some other train operated by Union Pacific, derailed in Tyrone, Oklahoma, allegedly destroying the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The cargo owners filed four separate lawsuits in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles. The suits named \u201cK\u201d Line and Union Pacific as defendants. Union Pacific removed the suits to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Union Pacific and \u201cK\u201d Line then moved to dismiss based on the parties\u2019 Tokyo forum-selection clause. The District Court granted the motion to dismiss. It decided that the forum-selection clause was reasonable and applied to Union Pacific pursuant to the Himalaya Clause in \u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s bills of lading. 462 F. Supp. 2d 1098, 1102-1103 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded. 557 F.3d 985 (2009). The court concluded that the Carmack Amendment applied to the inland portion of an international shipment under a through bill of lading and thus trumped the parties\u2019 forum-selection clause. <em>Id., </em>at 994-995. The court noted that this view was consistent with the position taken by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, see <em>id., </em>at 994 (citing <em>Sompo Japan Ins. Co. of Am. </em>v. <em>Union Pacific R. </em>Co., 456 F.3d 54 (2006)), but inconsistent with the views of the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits, see 557 F.3d, at 994 (citing <em>Shao </em>v. <em>Link Cargo (Taiwan) Ltd., </em>986 F.2d 700 (CA4 1993); <em>American Road Serv. Co. </em>v. <em>Consolidated Rail Corporation, </em>348 F.3d 565 (CA6 2003); <em>Capitol Converting Equip., Inc. </em>v. <em>LEP Transp., Inc., </em>965 F.2d 391 (CA7 1992); <em>Altadis USA, Inc., ex rel. Fireman\u2019s Fund. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sea Star Line, LLC, </em>458 F.3d 1288 (CA11 2006)). This Court granted certiorari to address whether Carmack applies to the inland segment of an overseas import shipment under a through bill of lading. 558 U.S. 969, 130 S. Ct. 459, 175 L. Ed. 2d 306 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">[561 U.S. 96]</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">Before turning to Carmack, a brief description of COGSA is in order; for \u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s and Union Pacific\u2019s primary contention is that COGSA, not Car-mack, controls.  COGSA governs the terms of bills of lading issued by ocean carriers engaged in foreign trade. 49 Stat. 1207, as amended, note following 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30701, p. 1178. It requires each carrier to issue to the cargo owner a bill that contains certain terms. \u00a7\u00a7 3(3)-(8), at 1178-1179. Although COGSA imposes some limitations on the parties\u2019 authority to adjust liability, it does not limit the parties\u2019 ability to adopt forum-selection clauses. See <em>Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. </em>v. <em>M/V Sky Reefer, </em>515 U.S. 528, 537-539, 115 S. Ct. 2322, 132 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1995). By its terms, COGSA only applies to shipments from United States ports to ports of foreign countries and vice versa. \u00a7\u00a7 1(e), 13, at 1178, 1180. The statute, however, allows parties \u201cthe option of extending [certain COGSA terms] by contract\u201d to cover \u201cthe entire period in which [the goods] would be under [a carrier\u2019s] responsibility, including [a] period of . . . inland transport.\u201d <em>Kirby, </em>543 U.S., at 29, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (citing COGSA \u00a7 7, at 1180). Ocean carriers, which often must issue COGSA bills of lading, are regulated by the Federal Maritime Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>mission (Maritime Commission), which is responsible for oversight over \u201ccommon carriage of goods by water in . . . foreign commerce.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 40101(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The next statute to consider is the Carmack Amendment, \u00a7 7, 34 Stat. 595, which governs the terms of bills of lading issued by domestic rail carriers. Carmack was first enacted in 1906 as an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 379. The Carmack Amendment has been altered and recodified over the last century. It now provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">[561 U.S. 97]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201c(a) A rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [Surface Transportation Board (STB)] under this part shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this part. That rail carrier and any other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this subsection is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">\u201c(1) the receiving rail carrier;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">\u201c(2) the delivering rail carrier; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">\u201c(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">\u201cFailure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a rail carrier.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11706; see also \u00a7 14706(a) (motor carriers).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">The Carmack Amendment thus requires a rail carrier that \u201creceives [property] for transportation under this part\u201d to issue a bill of lading. \u00a7 11706(a). The provision \u201cthis part\u201d refers to is the STB\u2019s jurisdiction over rail transportation within the United States. See \u00a7 10501 (2006 ed. and Supp. II). The STB is the successor to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The STB has \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction to regulate \u201ctransportation by rail carrier [s]\u201d between places in the United States as well as between a place in \u201cthe United States and a place in a foreign country.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 10501(a)(1), (a)(2)(F), (b) (2006 ed.). Regulated rail carriers must provide transportation subject to STB rail carrier jurisdiction \u201con reasonable request,\u201d \u00a7 11101(a), at reasonable rates, \u00a7\u00a7 10702, 10707(b), 11101(a), (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">[561 U.S. 98]</p>\n<p id=\"b481-18\">In cases where it applies, Car-mack imposes upon \u201creceiving rail carrier [s]\u201d and \u201cdelivering rail carrier[s]\u201d liability for damage caused during the rail route under the bill of lading, regardless of which carrier caused the damage. \u00a7 11706(a). Car-mack\u2019s purpose is to relieve cargo owners \u201cof the burden of searching out a particular negligent carrier from among the often numerous carriers handling an interstate shipment of goods.\u201d <em>Reider </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>339 U.S. 113, 119, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698 (1950). To help achieve this goal, Carmack constrains carriers\u2019 ability to limit liability by contract. \u00a7 11706(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-19\">Carmack also limits the parties\u2019 ability to choose the venue of their suit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201c(d)(1) A civil action under this section may be brought in a district court of the United States or in a State court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">\u201c(2)(A) A civil action under this section may only be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-5\">\u201c(i) against the originating rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201c(ii) against the delivering rail carrier, in the judicial district in which the principal place of business of the person bringing the action is located if the delivering carrier operates a railroad or a route through such judicial district, or in the judicial district in which the point of destination is located; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">\u201c(iii) against the carrier alleged to have caused the loss or damage, in the judicial district in which such loss or damage is alleged to have occurred.\u201d \u00a7 11706.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">For purposes of these cases, it can be assumed that if Carmack\u2019s terms apply to the bills of lading here, the cargo owners would have a substantial argument that the Tokyo forum-selection clause in the bills is pre-empted by Carmack\u2019s venue provisions. The parties argue about whether</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">[561 U.S. 99]</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">they may contract out of Car-mack\u2019s venue provisions and other requirements, see \u00a7\u00a7 10502, 10709; but in light of the disposition and ruling to follow, those matters need not be discussed or further explored.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">In <em>Kirby, </em>an ocean shipping company issued a through bill of lading, agreeing to deliver cargo from Australia to Alabama. Like the through bills in the present cases, the <em>Kirby </em>bill extended COGSA\u2019s terms to the inland segment under a Himalaya Clause. There, as here, the property was damaged by a domestic rail carrier during the inland rail portion. 543 U.S., at 19-20, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-14\"><em>Kirby </em>held that the through bill\u2019s terms governed under federal maritime law, notwithstanding contrary state laws. <em>Id., </em>at 23-27, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. <em>Kirby </em>explained that  \u201cso long as a bill of lading requires substantial carriage of goods by sea, its purpose is to effectuate maritime commerce.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 27, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. The Court added that \u201c[alpplying state law to cases like this one would undermine the uniformity of general maritime law.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 28, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. \u201cConfusion and inefficiency will inevitably result if more than one body of law governs a given contract\u2019s meaning.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 29, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. The Court noted that its conclusion \u201creinforce [d] the liability regime Congress established in COGSA,\u201d and explained that COGSA allows parties to extend its terms to an inland portion of a journey under a through bill of lading. <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the Court concluded that a contrary holding would defeat \u201cthe apparent purpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by sea.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-15\">Much of what the Court said in <em>Kirby </em>applies to the present cases. \u201cK\u201d Line issued the through bills under COGSA, in maritime commerce. Congress considered such international through bills and decided to permit parties to extend COGSA\u2019s terms to the inland domestic segment of the journey. The cargo owners and \u201cK\u201d Line did exactly that in</p>\n<p id=\"AJqdy\">[561 U.S. 100]</p>\n<p id=\"b482-16\">these cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>agreeing in the through bills to require that any suit be brought in Tokyo.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The cargo owners argue that the Carmack Amendment, which has its own venue provisions and was not discussed in <em>Kirby, </em>requires a different result. In particular they argue that Carmack applies to the domestic inland segment of the carriage here, so the Tokyo forum-selection clause is inapplicable. For the reasons set forth below, this contention must be rejected. Instructed by the text, history, and purposes of Carmack, the Court now holds that  the amendment does not apply to a shipment originating overseas under a single through bill of lading. As in <em>Kirby, </em>the terms of the bill govern the parties\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The text of the statute charts the analytic course.  Carmack divides the realm of rail carriers into three parts: (1) receiving rail carriers; (2) delivering rail carriers; and (3) connecting rail carriers. A \u201creceiving rail carrier\u201d is one that \u201cprovid[es] transportation or service ... for property it receives for transportation under this part.\u201d \u00a7 11706(a); see \u00a7 11706(a)(1). The provision \u201cthis part\u201d refers to is the STB\u2019s jurisdiction over rail transportation within the United States. See \u00a7 10501. A \u201cdelivering rail carrier\u201d \u201cdelivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part.\u201d \u00a7 11706(a); see \u00a7 11706(a)(2). A connecting rail carrier is \u201canother rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading.\u201d \u00a7 11706(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">A rail carrier\u2019s obligation to issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading is determined by Carmack\u2019s first sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">\u201cA rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">[561 U.S. 101]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-11\">shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this part.\u201d \u00a7 11706(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">This critical first sentence requires a Carmack-compliant bill of lading if two conditions are satisfied. First, the rail carrier must \u201cprovid [e] transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB].\u201d Second, that carrier must \u201creceiv[e]\u201d the property \u201cfor transportation under this part,\u201d where \u201cthis part\u201d is the STB\u2019s jurisdiction over domestic rail transport. Carmack thus requires the receiving rail carrier\u2014but not the delivering or connecting rail carrier\u2014to issue a bill of lading. As explained below, ascertaining the shipment\u2019s point of origin is critical to deciding whether the shipment includes a receiving rail carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">The conclusion that  Carmack\u2019s bill of lading requirement only applies to the receiving rail carrier is dictated by the text and is consistent with this Court\u2019s precedent. See <em>St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Starbird, </em>243 U.S. 592, 604, 37 S. Ct. 462, 61 L. Ed. 917 (1917) (explaining that Carmack \u201crequires the receiving carrier to issue a through bill of lading\u201d). A receiving rail carrier is the initial carrier, which \u201creceives\u201d the property for domestic rail transportation at the journey\u2019s point of origin. \u00a7 11706(a). If Car-mack\u2019s bill of lading requirement did not refer to the initial carrier, but rather to any rail carrier that in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>colloquial sense \u201creceived\u201d the property from another carrier, then every carrier during the shipment would have to issue its own separate bill. This would be altogether contrary to Carmack\u2019s purpose of making the receiving and delivering carriers liable under a single, initial bill of lading for damage caused by any carrier within a single course of shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mexican Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas Mexican R. Co., </em>331 U.S. 731, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779 (1947), supports the conclusion that only the receiving rail carrier must issue a Carmack bill of lading. There, a subsequent rail carrier in an export shipment from the United States to Mexico issued its own separate bill of lading at the U. S.-Mexico border. The</p>\n<p id=\"azd-dedup-1\">[561 U.S. 102]</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">second bill differed from the through bill issued by the \u201cinitial carrier,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 733, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779, (that is, the receiving carrier) at the inland point of origin. The Court held that Carmack, far from requiring nonre-ceiving carriers to issue their separate bills of lading, makes any subsequent bill \u201cvoid\u201d unless the \u201cso-called second bill of lading represents the initiation of a new shipment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 734, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Reider, </em>339 U.S. 113, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698, is not to the contrary. That case involved goods originating in Argentina, bound for an inland location in the United States. The Court in <em>Reider </em>determined that because there was no through bill of lading, the original journey from Argentina terminated at the port of New Orleans. Thus, the first rail carrier in the United States was the receiving rail carrier and had to issue a Carmack bill of lading. <em>Id., </em>at 117, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698. And because that carrier had to issue a separate bill of lading, it was not liable for damage done during the ocean-based portion of the shipment. <em>Id., </em>at 118-119, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698. Notably, neither <em>Mexican Light </em>nor <em>Reider </em>addressed the situation in the present cases, where the shipment originates overseas under a through bill of lading. And, for this reason, neither case discussed COGSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The Carmack Amendment\u2019s second sentence establishes when Carmack liability applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">\u201c[The receiving rail carrier referred to in the first sentence] and any other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the [STB] under this part are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading.\u201d \u00a7 11706(a)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Thus, the receiving and delivering rail carriers are subject to liability only when damage is done to this \u201cproperty,\u201d that is to say, to property for which Carmack\u2019s first sentence requires the receiving rail carrier to issue a bill of lading. <em>Ibid. </em>Put another way, Carmack applies only to transport</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">[561 U.S. 103]</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">of property for which Car-mack requires a receiving carrier to issue a bill of lading, regardless of whether that carrier erroneously fails to issue such a bill. See <em>ibid. </em>(\u201cFailure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a rail carrier\u201d). The language in some of the Courts of Appeals\u2019 decisions, which were rejected by the Court of Appeals in the opinion now under review, could be read to imply that Carmack applies only if a rail carrier actually issued a separate domestic bill of lading. See, <em>e.g., Altadis, </em>458 F.3d, at 1291-1294; <em>American Road, </em>348 F.3d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>at 568; <em>Shao, </em>986 F.2d, at 703; <em>Capitol Converting, </em>965 F.2d, at 394. This may have led to some confusion. The decisive question is not whether the rail carrier in fact issued a Carmack bill but rather whether that carrier was required to issue a bill by Carmack\u2019s first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The above principles establish that  for Carmack\u2019s provisions to apply the journey must begin with a receiving rail carrier, which would have to issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading. It follows that Carmack does not apply if the property is received at an overseas location under a through bill that covers the transport into an inland location in the United States. In such a case, there is no receiving rail carrier that \u201creceives\u201d the property \u201cfor [domestic rail] transportation,\u201d \u00a7 11706(a), and thus no carrier that must issue a Carmack-compliant bill of lading. The initial carrier in that instance receives the property at the shipment\u2019s point of origin for overseas multimodal import transport, not for domestic rail transport. (Today\u2019s decision need not address the instance where goods are received at a point in the United States for export. Nor is it necessary to decide if Carmack applies to goods initially received in Canada or Mexico, for import into the United States. See <em>infra, </em>at 107, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 441.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The present cases illustrate the operation of these principles. Carmack did not require \u201cK\u201d Line to issue bills of lading because \u201cK\u201d Line was not a receiving rail carrier. \u201cK\u201d Line obtained the cargo in China for overseas transport</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">[561 U.S. 104]</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">across an ocean and then to inland destinations in the United States. \u201cK\u201d Line shipped this property under COGSA-authorized through bills of lading. See <em>supra, </em>at 94-95, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 433-434. That \u201cK\u201d Line chose to use rail transport to complete one segment of the journey under these \u201cessentially maritime\u201d contracts, <em>Kirby, </em>543 U.S., at 24, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283, does not put \u201cK\u201d Line within Carmack\u2019s reach and thus does not require it to issue Carmack bills of lading.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">As for Union Pacific, it was also not a receiving rail carrier under Car-mack. The cargo owners conceded at oral argument that, even under their theory, Union Pacific was a mere delivering carrier, which did not have to issue its own Carmack bill of lading. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, 39. This was a necessary concession.  A carrier does not become a receiving carrier simply by accepting goods for further transport from another carrier in the middle of an international shipment under a through bill. After all, Union Pacific was not the \u201cinitial carrier\u201d for the carriage. <em>Mexican Light, </em>331 U.S., at 733, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">If a carrier like Union Pacific, which acts as a connecting or delivering carrier during an international through shipment, was, counterintuitively, a receiving carrier under Carmack, this would in effect outlaw through shipments under a single bill of lading. This is because a carriage like the one in the present case would require two bills of lading: one that the overseas carrier (here, \u201cK\u201d Line) issues to the cargo owners under COGSA, and a second one that the first domestic rail carrier (here, Union Pacific) issues to the overseas carrier under Carmack. <em>Kirby </em>noted \u201cthe popularity of \u2018through\u2019 bills of lading, in which cargo owners can contract for transportation across oceans and to inland destinations in a single transaction.\u201d 543 U.S., at 25-26, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Court sees no reason to read COGSA and Carmack to outlaw this efficient mode of international shipping by requiring these journeys to have multiple bills of lading. In addition, if Union Pacific had to issue a Carmack bill of lading to \u201cK\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">[561 U.S. 105]</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Line, it is unclear whether the cargo owners (the parties Carmack is designed to protect) would be able to sue under the terms governing that bill, especially in light of their different through bill with \u201cK\u201d Line. These difficulties are reason enough to reject this novel interpretation of Carmack, which was neither urged by any party nor adopted by any authority that has been called to this Court\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">This would be a quite different case if, as in <em>Reider, </em>the bills of lading for the overseas transport ended at this country\u2019s ports and the cargo owners then contracted with Union Pacific to complete a new journey to an inland destination in the United States. Under those circumstances, Union Pacific would have been the receiving rail carrier and would have been required to issue a separate Carmack-compliant bill of lading to the cargo owners. See <em>Reider, </em>339 U.S., at 117, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698 (\u201cIf the various parties dealing with this shipment separated the carriage into distinct portions by their contracts, it is not for courts judicially to meld the portions into something they are not\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The Court of Appeals interpreted Carmack as applying to any domestic rail segment of an overseas shipment, regardless of whether Carmack required a bill of lading. The court rested on the assumption that the \u201c [STB]'s jurisdiction ... is coextensive with Carmack\u2019s coverage.\u201d 557 F.3d, at 992. Yet, as explained above,  Carmack applies only to shipments for which Carmack requires a bill of lading; that is to say, to shipments that start with a carrier that is both subject to the STB\u2019s jurisdiction and \u201creceives [the property] for [domestic rail] transportation.\u201d The Court of Appeals ignored this \u201creceive [d] ... for transportation\u201d limitation and so reached the wrong conclusion. See, <em>e.g., Reiter </em>v. <em>Sonotone Corp., </em>442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S. Ct. 2326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 931 (1979) (courts are \u201cobliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion is also an awkward fit with Carmack\u2019s venue provisions.  Under Carmack, a suit</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">[561 U.S. 106]</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">against the \u201coriginating\u201d (that is, receiving) rail carrier that has not actually caused the damage to the goods \u201cmay only be brought... in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 11706(d)(2)(A), (A)(i). Suit against either a delivering carrier or any carrier that caused the damage, by contrast, may be brought in various other districts. See \u00a7\u00a7 11706(d)(2)(B), (C). \u201c[Judicial district\u201d refers to \u201cdistrict court of the United States or in a State Court.\u201d \u00a7 11706(d)(1). Carmack\u2019s venue provisions presume that the receiving carrier obtains the property in a judicial district within the United States. Here, the journey\u2019s \u201cpoint of origin\u201d was China, so Carmack\u2019s venue provisions reinforce the interpretation that Carmack does not apply to this carriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">Indeed, if \u201cK\u201d Line were a receiving carrier in a case where the journey\u2019s \u201cpoint of origin\u201d was China, there would be no place under Carmack to sue \u201cK\u201d Line, since China is not within a judicial district \u201cof the United States or in a State court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Carmack\u2019s original premise is that the receiving carrier is liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>damage caused by the other carriers in the delivery chain. This premise would be defeated if there were no venue in which to sue the receiving rail carrier, as opposed to suing a different carrier under one of Car-mack\u2019s other venue provisions and then naming the receiving carrier as a codefendant. The far more likely conclusion is that \u201cK\u201d Line is not a receiving rail carrier at all under Carmack, and thus Carmack, including its venue provisions, does not apply to property shipped under \u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s through bills. True, if the sole question were one of venue, suit could still be brought against the carrier that caused the damage or the delivering carrier. But the issue need not be explored here, for, as the Court holds, Carmack is inapplicable in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Carmack\u2019s statutory history supports the conclusion that it does not apply to a shipment originating overseas under a</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">[561 U.S. 107]</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">through bill. None of Carmack\u2019s legislative versions have applied to the inland domestic rail segment of an import shipment from overseas under a through bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Congress enacted Carmack in 1906, as an amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act. At that time, the amendment\u2019s provisions applied only to \u201cproperty for transportation from a point in one State to a point in another State.\u201d \u00a7 7, 34 Stat. 595. Congress amended Carmack in 1915, \u00a7 1, 38 Stat. 1197, and the relevant language remained unchanged until Carmack was recodified in 1978. Under the pre-1978 language, Carmack\u2019s bill of lading provisions applied not only to wholly domestic rail transport but also to cargo \u201creceive [d] ... for transportation\u201d \u201cfrom any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign country.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11) (1976 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Even if there could be some argument that the Carmack Amendment before 1978 applied to imports from Canada and Mexico because the phrase \u201cfrom . . . to\u201d could also mean \u201cbetween,\u201d cf. <em>Reider, supra, </em>at 118, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698 (explicitly not deciding this issue), the Court is unaware of any authority holding that the Carmack Amendment before 1978 applied to cargo originating from nonadjacent overseas countries under a through bill. See, <em>e.g., In re The Cummins Amendment, </em>33 I. C. C. 682, 693 (1915); Brief for Respondents 8 (effectively conceding this point).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">In 1978, Congress adopted the Car-mack Amendment in largely its current form. \u00a7 1, 92 Stat. 1337. Congress in the statute itself stated that it was recodifying Carmack and instructed that this recodification \u201cmay not be construed as making a substantive change in the la[w].\u201d \u00a7 3(a), <em>id., </em>at 1466; see <em>Burlington Northern R. Co. </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>481 U.S. 454, 457, n. 1, 107 S. Ct. 1855, 95 L. Ed. 2d 404 (1987). By interpreting the current version of the Carmack Amendment to cover cargo originating overseas, the Court of Appeals disregarded this direction and dramatically expanded Carmack\u2019s scope beyond its historical coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">[561 U.S. 108]</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">Finally, in 1995, Congress reenacted Carmack. But that reenactment evidenced no intent to affect the substantive change that the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision would entail. See \u00a7 102(a), 109 Stat. 847-849. There is no claim that the 1995 statute altered Carmack\u2019s text in any manner relevant here, as that reenactment merely indented subsections of Car-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>mack for readability. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>560 U.S. 218, 233-234, 130 S. Ct. 2169, 176 L. Ed. 2d 979 (2010) (\u201c[C]urrent legislative drafting guidelines .. . advise drafters to break lengthy statutory provisions into separate subsections that can be read more easily\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Where the text permits, congressional enactments should be construed to be consistent with one another. And the interpretation of Carmack the Court now adopts attains the most consistency between Carmack and COGSA. First, applying Carmack to the inland segment of an international carriage originating overseas under a through bill would undermine Carmack\u2019s purposes. Car-mack is premised on the view that the shipment has a single bill of lading and any damage during the journey is the responsibility of both the receiving and the delivering carrier. See <em>supra, </em>at 98, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 435-436. Yet, under the Court of Appeals\u2019 interpretation of Carmack, there would often be no venue in which to sue the receiving carrier. See <em>supra, </em>at 106, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 440-441.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Applying two different bill of lading regimes to the same through shipment would undermine COGSA and international, container-based multi-modal transport. As <em>Kirby </em>explained, \u201c[t]he international transportation industry \u2018clearly has moved into a new era\u2014the age of multimodalism, door-to-door transport based on efficient use of all available modes of transportation by air, water, and land.\u2019 \u201d 543 U.S., at 25, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (quoting 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law 589 (4th ed. 2004)). If Carmack applied to an inland segment of a shipment from overseas under a through bill, then one set of liability and venue rules would apply when cargo is damaged</p>\n<p id=\"ARSH\">[561 U.S. 109]</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">at sea (COGSA) and another almost always would apply when the damage occurs on land (Carmack). Rather than making claims by cargo owners easier to resolve, a court would have to decide where the damage occurred to determine which law applied. As a practical matter, this requirement often could not be met; for damage to the content of containers can occur when the contents are damaged by rough handling, seepage, or theft, at some unknown point. See H. Kindred &amp; M. Brooks, Multimodal Transport Rules 143 (1997). Indeed, adopting the Court of Appeals\u2019 approach would seem to require rail carriers to open containers at the port to check if damage has been done during the sea voyage. This disruption would undermine international container-based transport. The Court will not read Congress\u2019 nonsubstantive recodification of Carmack in 1978 to create such a drastic sea change in practice in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">Applying Carmack\u2019s provisions to international import shipping transport would also undermine the \u201cpurpose of COGSA, to facilitate efficient contracting in contracts for carriage by sea.\u201d <em>Kirby, supra, </em>at 29, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. These cases provide an apt illustration. The sophisticated cargo owners here agreed to maritime bills of lading that applied to the inland segment through the Himalaya Clause and authorized \u201cK\u201d Line to subcontract for that inland segment \u201con any terms whatsoever.\u201d The cargo owners thus made the decision to select \u201cK\u201d Line as a single company for their through transportation needs, rather than contracting for rail services them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>selves. The through bills provided the liability and venue rules for the foreseeable event that the cargo was damaged during carriage. Indeed, the cargo owners obtained separate insurance to protect against any excess loss. The forum-selection clause the parties agreed upon is \u201can indispensable element in international trade, commerce, and contracting\u201d because it allows parties to \u201cagre[e] in advance on a forum acceptable\u201d to them. <em>The Bremen </em>v. <em>Zapata Off-Shore Co., </em>407 U.S. 1, 13-14, 92 S. Ct. 1907, 32 L. Ed. 2d 513 (1972).  A clause of this</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">[561 U.S. 110]</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">kind is enforced unless it imposes a venue \u201cso gravely difficult and inconvenient that [the plaintiff] will for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in court.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 18, 92 S. Ct. 1907, 32 L. Ed. 2d 513. The parties sensibly agreed that because their bills were governed by Japanese law, Tokyo would be the best venue for any suit relating to the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The cargo owners\u2019 contrary policy arguments are unavailing. They assert that if Carmack does not apply, the inland segment of international shipments will be \u201cunregulated.\u201d Brief for Respondents 2, 21, 24, 64, 91. First, any speculation that not applying Carmack to inland segments of overseas shipments will cause severe problems is refuted by the fact that Carmack even arguably did not govern the inland portion of such shipments from its enactment in 1906 until its nonsubstantive recodification in 1978. See <em>supra, </em>at 107, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 441. It is true that if the cargo owners\u2019 position were to prevail, the terms of through bills of lading made in maritime commerce would be more restricted in some circumstances. But that does not mean that the Court\u2019s holding leaves the field unregulated. Ocean-based through bills are governed by COGSA, and ocean vessels like those operated by \u201cK\u201d Line are overseen by the Maritime Commission. <em>Supra, </em>at 96, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 434-435. Rail carriers like Union Pacific, furthermore, remain subject to the STB\u2019s regulation to the extent they operate within the United States. See <em>supra, </em>at 105, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 440. It is notable that although the STB has jurisdiction to regulate the rates of such carriers, even when the carriage is not governed by the Carmack Amendment, the STB has exercised its authority to exempt from certain regulations service provided by a rail carrier \u201cas part of a continuous intermodal freight movement,\u201d 49 CFR \u00a7 1090.2 (2009), like the journey at issue in these cases, see <em>ibid, </em>(exercising the STB\u2019s deregulation authority under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Finally, the cargo owners miss the mark in relying on the recent United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea,</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">[561 U.S. 111]</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">which has yet to be \u201cratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>11. These so-called \u201cRotterdam Rules\u201d would explicitly allow the inland leg of an international shipment to be governed by a different legal regime than the ocean leg, under some circumstances. See G. A. Res. 63/122, art. 26, U. N. Doc. A/RES/63/122 (Dec. 11, 2008). Nothing in the Rotterdam Rules, however, requires every country to mandate a different regime to govern the inland rail leg of an international through shipment; and, as explained above, Congress, by enacting COGSA, has opted for allowing shipments gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>erned by a single through bill. And if the objection is that today\u2019s decision will undermine the results of these international negotiations in some way, that concern is met by the fact that the United States Government has urged the result the Court adopts today. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>13-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Congress has decided to allow parties engaged in international maritime commerce to structure their contracts, to a large extent, as they see fit. It has not imposed Carmack\u2019s regime, textually and historically limited to the carriage of goods received for domestic rail transport, onto what are \u201cessentially maritime\u201d contracts. <em>Kirby, </em>543 U.S., at 24, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u201cK\u201d Line received the goods in China, under through bills for shipment into the United States. \u201cK\u201d Line was thus not a receiving rail carrier under Carmack and was not required to issue bills of lading under that amendment. Union Pacific is also not a receiving carrier for this carriage and was thus not required to issue Carmack-compliant bills. Because the journey included no receiving rail carrier that had to issue bills of lading under Carmack, Carmack does not apply. The parties\u2019 agreement to litigate these cases in Tokyo is binding. The cargo owners must abide by the contracts they made.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">[561 U.S. 112]</p>\n<p id=\"pAWe\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"27\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARMAAAAbAQAAAAB39lbMAAAAkklEQVR4nM3TMQrCQBCF4X+H1JIDCXozPYyHsPAwmxSpYycoPss82YE0QZzue8zA7C5bxFoNsdoC/9jzdbQEAbzPFifYah8k7e9aqkUN0OgjCQLKPC9xhgCuk81mkPQ42AotagDd0UYTBDB5nCCAS2dxBkm7wVZoUQPU93YlGSTdnjbaoiLpdbK4Rd3q3csP/9cH9/PIeMo9gEgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"275\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">SEPARATE OPINION</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b490-8\">Justice Sotomayor,</author>\n<p id=\"AMXn\">with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Gins-burgjoin, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">In my view, the Carmack Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA or Act), \u00a7 7, 34 Stat. 595, plainly applies to the inland leg of a multimodal shipment traveling on an international through bill of lading. Unless they have permissibly contracted around Carmack\u2019s requirements, rail carriers in the United States such as petitioner Union Pacific are subject to those requirements, even though ocean carriers such as petitioner \u201cK\u201d Line are not. To avoid this simple conclusion, the Court contorts the statute and our cases, misreads the statutory history, and ascribes to Congress a series of policy choices that Congress manifestly did not make. Because I believe Carmack provides the default legal regime for rail transportation of cargo within the United States, regardless of whether the shipment originated abroad, I would reach the second question presented: whether Union Pacific was free to opt out of Carmack under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10709, or whether Union Pacific first had to offer \u201cK\u201d Line, its contractual counterparty, Carmack-compliant terms under \u00a7 10502. As to that question, I would hold that opt-out under \u00a7 10709 was not available and would remand to the District Court to consider in the first instance whether Union Pacific satisfied its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>obligations under \u00a7 10502.

Two provisions guide my conclusion that Carmack provides the default legal regime for the inland leg of a multi-modal shipment traveling on an international through bill of lading: \u00a7 11706(a), which outlines the basic requirements for liability under Car-mack, and \u00a7 10501(a), which defines the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB or Board), the successor to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), see <em>ante, </em>at 97, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 435. Section 11706(a) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-10\">\u201cA rail carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part shall issue a receipt or bill of lading for property it receives for transportation under this part. That rail carrier and any other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part are liable to the person entitled to recover under the receipt or bill of lading. The liability imposed under this subsection is for the actual loss or injury to the property caused by\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">\u201c(1) the receiving rail carrier;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">\u201c(2) the delivering rail carrier; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-13\">\u201c(3) another rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-15\">\u201cFailure to issue a receipt or bill of lading does not affect the liability of a rail carrier. A delivering rail carrier is deemed to be the rail carrier performing the line-haul transportation nearest the destination but does not include a rail carrier providing only a switching service at the destination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-16\">[561 U.S. 114]</p>\n<p id=\"b491-17\">With respect to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, \u00a7 10501(a) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-18\">\u201c(1) Subject to this chapter, the Board has jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier that is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-19\">\u201c(A) only by railroad; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-20\">\u201c(B) by railroad and water, when the transportation is under common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-21\">\u201c(2) Jurisdiction under paragraph (1) applies only to transportation in the United States between a place in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-22\">\u201c(A) a State and a place in the same or another State as part of the interstate rail network;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA8yN\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"31\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAArEAAAAfAQAAAADYKKg3AAAAgklEQVR4nGP8z0AL0MhEE2MZGEbNHTV31NxRc/GY+w+L8B8sYj+IFPsANfd3A6bcVyzqXxEpdgVqLk470cADIsUOQM2lCWBiYODAIiyARUyBSDEHBgYGBsb/DP+wuPkPC6bYDywOwCb2QQBSD2ELCizGYvUXTr8OwXwxau6ouUPWXADRwBdV6uyosQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"689\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-23\">\u201c(E) the United States and another place in the United States through a foreign country; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-24\">\u201c(F) the United States and a place in a foreign country.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-25\">\u201cA simple, straight-forward reading of [these provisions] practically compels the conclusion that the Carmack Amendment applies in a typical mul-timodal carriage case with inland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>damage.\u201d Sturley, Maritime Cases About Train Wrecks: Applying Maritime Law to the Inland Damage of Ocean Cargo, 40 J. Maritime L. &amp; Comm. 1, 13 (2009) (hereinafter Train Wrecks). The first sentence of \u00a7 11706(a) sets forth the circumstances in which a receiving rail carrier must issue a bill of lading: when property is first \u201creceive [d]\u201d for domestic transportation. This sentence does not define the full scope of Carmack liability, however, as the penultimate sentence of \u00a7 11706(a) makes the absence of a bill of lading ultimately immaterial to the question of Carmack liability. Instead, the second sentence of \u00a7 11706(a) establishes Carmack\u2019s expansive scope, explaining which carriers are subject to Car-mack liability: not only the rail carrier that receives the property, but also \u201cany other carrier that delivers the property and is providing transportation or service subject</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">[561 U.S. 115]</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">to the jurisdiction of the Board under this part.\u201d Critically, that a rail carrier\u2019s provision of \u201ctransportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board\u201d is the criterion that establishes liability under Carmack demonstrates that Carmack\u2019s scope must be considered in tandem with the provision describing the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over rail carriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Under that provision, the Board has authority \u201cover transportation by rail carrier,\u201d either when that transportation is \u201conly by railroad\u201d or when it is \u201cby railroad and water, when the transportation is under common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment.\u201d \u00a7 10501(a)(1). Board jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier \u201capplies only to transportation in the United States,\u201d not to transportation abroad. \u00a7 10501(a)(2). Within the United States, however, Board jurisdiction exists broadly whenever that transportation is \u201cbetween,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca place in ... a State and a place in the same or another State as part of the interstate rail network,\u201d \u201ca place in . . . the United States and another place in the United States through a foreign country,\u201d or \u201ca place in . . . the United States and a place in a foreign country.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 10501(a)(2)(A), (E), (F).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">With the jurisdictional framework in mind, I return to the final sentences of Carmack, \u00a7 11706. The third sentence clarifies that liability under Carmack is imposed upon (1) \u201cthe receiving rail carrier\u201d (which, under the first sentence of \u00a7 11706(a) and the definition of the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over domestic rail carriage in \u00a7 10501(a), is the rail carrier that first receives the property for transportation in the United States); (2) \u201cthe delivering rail carrier\u201d (which, under the last sentence of \u00a7 11706(a) and the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over domestic rail carriage in \u00a7 10501(a), is the final rail carrier providing the long-distance transportation \u201cnearest the destination\u201d in the United States); and (3) \u201canother rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in</p>\n<p id=\"AKo9\">[561 U.S. 116]</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">the United States or from a place in the United States to a place in an adjacent foreign country when transported under a through bill of lading.\u201d \u00a7 11706(a). This last phrase in \u00a7 11706(a)(3) serves two functions. It ensures that, where the entire rail transportation is \u201c[with]in the United States,\u201d any connecting rail carrier between the point at which the goods were received and the point at which the goods were delivered is liable under Carmack. It also ensures that, where the final destination of the goods is in Canada or Mexico, such that there is no domestic \u201cdelivering\u201d carrier, a connecting carrier taking on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the goods in the United States will remain subject to Carmack as it travels toward its foreign destination while still in the United States. (As noted, the jurisdictional provision, incorporated by reference in \u00a7 11706(a), is limited to \u201ctransportation in the United States,\u201d \u00a7 10501(a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">The language of Carmack thus announces an expansive intent to provide the liability regime for rail carriage of property within the United States. Once a first domestic rail carrier subject to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction receives property in the United States, Carmack attaches, regardless of where the property originated. Car-mack then applies to any other rail carrier subject to the Board\u2019s jurisdiction in the chain of transportation, no matter whether the ultimate destination of the property is in the United States or elsewhere, for the period the carrier is traveling within the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">It seems to me plain that, under these broadly inclusive provisions, Carmack governs rail carriers such as Union Pacific for any transportation of cargo within the United States, whether or not their domestic transportation is part of a multimodal international shipment, and whether or not they actually issued a domestic bill of lading. There is no question that Union Pacific is a \u201crail carrier\u201d that is \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the Board.\u201d \u00a7 11706(a). It \u201creceive[d]\u201d the cargo, <em>ibid., </em>in California for domestic transportation to four different domestic inland <em>locations\u2014i.e., </em>\u201cbetween a</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">[561 U.S. 117]</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">place in ... a State and a place in . . . another State,\u201d \u00a7 10501(a)(2)(A)\u2014while the shipment itself was transported \u201cbetween a place in . . . the United States and a place in a foreign country,\u201d \u00a7 10501(a)(2)(F). Union Pacific should have issued a bill of lading for the cargo it received, but its failure to do so does not shield it from liability, as \u00a7 11706(a) makes clear. Carmack therefore provides the legal regime governing Union Pacific\u2019s rail transportation in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Carmack does not, however, govern ocean carriers such as \u201cK\u201d Line, because such carriers are not \u201crail carrier [s] providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Board.\u201d \u00a7 11706(a). The ICA defines a \u201crail carrier\u201d as \u201ca person providing common carrier railroad transportation for compensation.\u201d \u00a7 10102(5). To resolve whether \u201cK\u201d Line meets this definition, I would apply the STB\u2019s well-established test and ask whether it \u201cconduct [s] rail operations\u201d and \u201c \u2018hold[s] out\u2019 that service to the public.\u201d <em>Association of P &amp; C Dock Longshoremen </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh &amp; Conneaut Dock Co., </em>8 I. C. C. 2d 280, 290 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Respondents\u2014the owners of cargo that was allegedly damaged during Union Pacific\u2019s train derailment in Oklahoma, <em>ante, </em>at 93-95, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 433-434\u2014primarily contend that \u201cK\u201d Line conducted rail operations by using containers to transport the cargo from China to the United States in conjunction with Union Pacific\u2019s subsequent carriage of those same containers. Brief for Respondents 82-83 (noting that the statutory definition of \u201crailroad\u201d includes \u201c \u2018intermodal equipment used [by or] in connection with a railroad,\u2019 \u201d \u00a7 10102(6)(A)). This interpretation goes too far. Read so literally, the statute would render a truck a railroad simply because the truck transported containers during a journey in which the containers also traveled by rail. Such a reading would gut the separate provisions of the IC A govern - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>ing motor carriage in Subtitle IV, Part B, of Title 49. The ICA\u2019s broad description of what the term \u201crailroad\u201d \u201cincludes,\u201d \u00a7 10102(6), is better read as ensuring that all services a rail carrier conducts are</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">[561 U.S. 118]</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">regulated under the Act \u201cto prevent overcharges and dis-criminations from being made under the pretext of performing such additional services.\u201d <em>Cleveland, C., C. &amp; St. L.

Ed. 453 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">At oral argument, respondents focused on a separate argument, contending that \u201cK\u201d Line should be considered a rail carrier because it conducts substantial rail operations at its depot facility in Long Beach, California. Tr. of Oral Arg. 37 (describing transportation between Port of Los Angeles, where \u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s private chassis transport the containers on the port\u2019s train tracks to the Los Angeles train depot, where the containers are loaded onto Union Pacific trains for inland transportation). I agree with the Board, however, that \u201c \u2018ownership and operation of private terminal facilities, including rail yards,\u2019 \u201d is not sufficient to bring a shipper within the definition of \u201c \u2018a rail carrier subject to [Board] jurisdiction\u2019 \u201d where the \u201c \u2018terminal is maintained for [the ocean common carrier\u2019s] exclusive use in interchanging cargo with rail and motor carriers providing inland transportation.\u2019\u201d <em>Joint Application of CSX Corp. &amp; Sea-Land Corp.

C. 2d 512, 519 (1987).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The jurisdictional provisions of the ICA and the Shipping Act of 1984, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 40101 <em>et seq., </em>confirm my view that \u201cK\u201d Line is not a rail carrier \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the Board,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11706(a), under Carmack. The STB\u2019s jurisdiction over transportation by rail carriers is \u201cexclusive,\u201d \u00a7 10501(b), while ocean carriers are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 40102; see also 46 CFR \u00a7 520.1 (2009). In addition, the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over water carriage is limited to domestic water carriage. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13521(a)(3). The Board itself has concluded that ocean carriers providing intermodal</p>\n<p id=\"AZEj\">[561 U.S. 119]</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">transportation jointly with inland rail and motor carriers are subject to the FMC\u2019s jurisdiction rather than its own. See <em>Improvement of TOFC / COFC Regulations, </em>3 I. C. C. 2d 869, 883 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">For these reasons, Carmack governs Union Pacific but not \u201cK\u201d Line for the inland transportation at issue in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">In finding Carmack inapplicable to the inland transportation in these cases, the majority relies on the fact that Carmack does not govern ocean carriers such as \u201cK\u201d Line. While I agree that \u201cK\u201d Line is not a rail carrier, the majority places too much weight on that determination. That the ocean carrier \u201cK\u201d Line is not subject to Carmack does not affect the determination that the rail carrier Union Pacific is, for the textual reasons I have explained. The majority\u2019s contrary reading of the statute reflects four fundamental errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">First, the majority reads the term \u201creceiving rail carrier\u201d in \u00a7 11706(a) too narrowly. There is simply no basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>in the text of the statute to support the majority\u2019s conclusion that Car-mack applies only when the first rail carrier in the chain of transportation accepted the cargo at the shipment\u2019s point of origin. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 101, 103, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 437-438, 439. The two cases the majority cites for this proposition are inapposite, as neither addresses an international, multi-modal shipment in which the first leg of the trip was by ocean.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>St. Louis, I. M. &amp; S. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Starbird, </em>243 U.S. 592, 594, 37 S. Ct. 462, 61 L. Ed. 917 (1917), the entire shipment was by rail from Arkansas to New York City. And in <em>Mexican Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas Mexican R. Co., </em>331 U.S. 731, 732, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779 (1947), the entire shipment was by rail from Pennsylvania to Mexico. Given that the first rail carrier was in each case the carrier that received the goods from the shipper and</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">[561 U.S. 120]</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">issued a through bill of lading, it is unsurprising that the Court, applying Carmack, described that carrier as the \u201cinitial carrier.\u201d 243 U.S., at 595, 37 S. Ct. 462, 61 L. Ed. 917; 331 U.S., at 733, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779. But nothing in these cases, and nothing in Carmack itself, requires that the \u201creceiving carrier\u201d take the goods from the shipper at the shipment\u2019s point of origin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">Instead, these cases are compatible with my view that the \u201creceiving carrier\u201d is any rail carrier that first receives cargo for transportation in the United States. Union Pacific, which is unquestionably a \u201crail carrier\u201d in the normal sense of those words, is also the \u201creceiving carrier\u201d subject to liability under Carmack.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our opinion in <em>Reider </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>339 U.S. 113, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698 (1950), further supports this reading. There we explained that the test for Carmack applicability \u201cis not where the shipment originated, but where the obligation of the carrier as receiving carrier originated.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 117, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698. Because Carmack applies to domestic rail transport, and the domestic rail carrier\u2019s obligation in that case arose in New Orleans where the rail carrier received the goods, it did not matter that the shipment began overseas in Buenos Aires. Similarly, in the instant cases, because Union Pacific\u2019s obligations to transport by rail originated in California, it does not matter that the shipment began overseas in China.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>[561 U.S. 121]</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Second, the majority errs in suggesting that the issuance of an international through bill of lading precludes the applicability of Carmack. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 101-102, 104-105, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 437-438, 439-440. The cases on which the majority relies do not stand for this proposition. In <em>Reider, </em>the Court found Carmack applicable when the first domestic rail carrier issued a bill of lading from New Orleans to Boston. Although we observed in that opinion that there was no through bill of lading from Buenos Aires to Boston, 339 U.S., at 117, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698, we did not say, and it is not a necessary corollary, that the presence of such a bill of lading would have commanded a different result. The observation is better read as indicating that no law other than Carmack could possibly have applied in that case: Because \u201cthe shipment . . . could not have moved an inch beyond New Orleans under the ocean bill,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 118, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698, a new domestic bill of lading for domestic transportation was required, and as to that transportation, we held, Carmack unquestionably applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">For its part, <em>Mexican Light </em>held only that, where the first rail carrier in the chain of transportation issued a bill of lading, a subsequent bill of lading issued by a later rail carrier was void because Carmack contemplates one through bill of lading governing the entire journey by rail. 331 U.S., at 734, 67 S. Ct. 1440, 91 L. Ed. 1779. A subsequent bill of lading by a connecting rail carrier, however, can be void under Carmack without requiring the conclusion that an international through bill of lading involving</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">[561 U.S. 122]</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">initial transportation by ocean carrier would void a subsequent bill of lading issued in the United States by the first rail carrier in the domestic chain of transportation. Because the text of Carmack expressly requires a bill of lading to be issued for property \u201creceive [d] for transportation under this part,\u201d and Union Pacific first received the property for rail transportation in the United States, it should have issued a bill of lading. Of course, its failure to do so did not affect its liability under Car-mack (or that of a subsequent connecting or delivering carrier), as \u00a7 11706(a) explicitly states.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Third, the majority errs in giving weight to the difference in scope between Carmack liability and the jurisdiction of the Board. <em>Ante, </em>at 105, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 440. I agree with the majority that Carmack\u2019s reach is narrower than the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. The Board\u2019s jurisdiction extends over transportation by rail carrier \u201cin the United States between a place in . . . the United States and a place in a foreign country,\u201d \u00a7 10501(a)(2)(F), which indicates that it does not matter whether the movement of the transportation is from the United States to the foreign country or from the foreign country to the United States.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In contrast, Carmack applies only when a rail carrier first receives property in the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>\u00a7 11706(a), and therefore would not apply to a rail carrier originating in Canada and delivering in the United</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-_\">[561 U.S. 123]</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">States without transferring the property to a domestic rail carrier.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As long as there is a receiving rail carrier in the United States, however, Carmack attaches. Because the property at issue in these cases was received in the United States for domestic transportation by Union Pacific, Carmack governs the rail carrier\u2019s liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Finally, the majority misunderstands the role I believe Carmack liability plays in international shipments to the United States. My reading of the statute would not \u201coutlaw through shipments under a single bill of lading.\u201d Ante, at 104, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 439. To the contrary, an overseas ocean carrier like \u201cK\u201d Line can still issue a through bill of lading governing the entire international trip to an American destination. That bill of lading reflects the ocean carrier\u2019s agreement with and obligations to the original shipper of the cargo. As the ocean carrier has no independent Car-mack obligations of its own, the ocean carrier and the shipper are free to select whatever liability terms they wish to govern their relationship during the entire shipment. See <em>infra, </em>at 131, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 456. Carmack simply requires an American \u201creceiving rail carrier\u201d like Union Pacific to issue a bill of lading to the party from whom it received the goods for shipment\u2014here, \u201cK\u201d Line. See <em>Norfolk Southern R. Co. </em>v. <em>James N. Kirby, Pty Ltd., </em>543 U.S. 14, 33, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (2004) (\u201cWhen an intermediary contracts with a carrier to transport goods, the cargo owner\u2019s recovery against the carrier is limited by the liability limitation to which the intermediary and carrier agreed\u201d); <em>Great Northern R. Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>232 U.S. 508, 514-515, 34 S. Ct. 380, 58 L. Ed. 703 (1914) (holding that a railroad company is entitled to treat the intermediary forwarder as the shipper). As to that bill of lading, Carmack provides the legal regime and defines the relationship between the contracting parties (unless they have agreed to contract out of Carmack, see <em>infra, </em>at 134-137, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 458-460). The issuance of this second bill of lading, however, in no way undermines</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">[561 U.S. 124]</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">the efficiency of the through bill of lading between the ocean carrier and the original shipper, nor does it require that those parties bind themselves to apply Carmack to the inland leg.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In addition to misreading the text, the Court\u2019s opinion misapplies Car-mack\u2019s statutory history. The Court states that no version of Carmack has ever applied to imports originating overseas on a through bill of lading. <em>Ante, </em>at 107, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 441. The Court further asserts that, because Congress stated that the 1978 recodification of the ICA effected no \u201csubstantive change,\u201d Carmack should be read consistently with this historical practice. <em>Ante, </em>at 108, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 441-442. There are three problems with this analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">First, if \u201cCongress intended no substantive change\u201d to Carmack in the 1978 recodification, \u201cthat would mean only that the present text is the best evidence of what the law</p>\n<p id=\"Aj6J\">[561 U.S. 125]</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">has always meant, and that the language of the prior version cannot be relied upon to support a different reading.\u201d <em>Keene Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>508 U.S. 200, 221, 113 S. Ct. 2035, 124 L. Ed. 2d 118 (1993) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Because the present text of Carmack indicates that it applies to the domestic inland rail transportation of a multimodal international shipment, there is no reason to rely on Congress\u2019 statement in the recodification.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Second, there is no necessary conflict between the pre-1978 version of Carmack and my reading of the current text. The pre-1978 text referred to a carrier \u201creceiving property for transportation from a point in one State or Territory or the District of Columbia to a point in another State, Territory, [or the] District of Columbia, or from any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign country.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11) (1976 ed.).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A rail carrier like Union Pacific that receives property in California for transportation to locations in the American Midwest \u201creceives] property from a point in one State . . . to a point in another State,\u201d regardless of whether the property originated in California or China. The geographical restriction \u201cfrom any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign country\u201d simply reflected agreements between the ICC and its Canadian counterpart to respect each other\u2019s regulation of rail carriage originating in that country. See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>17-18 (hereinafter Brief for United States). It does not indicate any rejection of Carmack\u2019s applicability to imports as a whole or exports to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>nonadjacent foreign country.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, the \u201cadjacent foreign country\u201d provision</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">[561 U.S. 126]</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">was expansive rather than limiting, ensuring that Carmack would apply where a shipment traveled by rail from New York City through to Montreal without stopping at the border of Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Third, to the extent there are meaningful differences between the pre-1978 text of Carmack and its current text, it is the current text that we should interpret, regardless of Congress\u2019 general hortatory statement in the 1978 Public Law applicable to the entire ICA. As we have often observed, \u201c[a] specific provision controls one of more general application.\u201d <em>Gozlon-Peretz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 395, 407, 111 S. Ct. 840, 112 L. Ed. 2d 919 (1991). The general statement that Congress intended no change to the ICA should not require us to ignore what the current text of the specific Carmack provision says, as both Union Pacific and \u201cK\u201d Line explicitly ask us to do. See Brief for Petitioner in No. 08-1554, p. 20 (\u201cThe Pre-1978 Statutory Language Controls This Case\u201d); Brief for Petitioners in No. 08-1553, pp. 41-49 (arguing for reliance on pre-1978 text). Petitioners\u2019 view of statutory interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">[561 U.S. 127]</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">would give rise to an unwieldy\u2014and unjust\u2014system. I would have thought it beyond cavil that litigants are entitled to rely on the currently applicable version of enacted statutes to determine their rights and obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">In the final analysis, the meaning of the pre-1978 language is murky, and Congress\u2019 instruction that the 1978 recodification effected no substantive change provides no meaningful guidance. The current text does not restrict Carmack\u2019s coverage to trade with adjacent foreign countries, and it makes no distinction between imports and exports. Carmack\u2019s ambiguous history cannot justify reading such atextual limitations into the statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>[561 U.S. 128]</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The Court\u2019s suggestion that its interpretation properly effectuates the goals of Carmack and \u201cattains the most consistency between Carmack and [the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA)],\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 108, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 442, reflects its fundamental misunderstanding of these statutes and the broader legal context in which the international shipping industry functions. As the mandatory default regime governing the relationship between an American receiving rail carrier and its direct contracting partner (here an overseas ocean carrier), Carmack permits the shippers who contract for a through bill of lading with the ocean carrier to receive the benefit of Carmack through that once-removed relationship. Such a legal regime is entirely consistent with COGSA and industry practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">As noted, the Court\u2019s position as to Carmack rests on its erroneous belief that the \u201creceiving carrier\u201d must receive the goods at the point of the shipment\u2019s origin. <em>Ante, </em>at 103-106, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 439-441. Because Carmack provides that suit against the receiving rail carrier \u201cmay only be brought ... in the judicial district in which the point of origin is located,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11706(d)(2)(A)(i), and defines \u201cjudicial district\u201d as only a federal or state court, \u00a7 11706(d)(2)(B), the Court mistakenly concludes that were Carmack to apply to inland transportation of international shipments, \u201cthere would often be no venue in which to sue the receiving carrier\u201d because that carrier would have received the goods in a foreign country where no federal or state court exists, <em>ante, </em>at 105-106, 108, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 440-441, 442. Contrary to the Court\u2019s suggestion, however, the proper venue in which to sue a receiving carrier under Carmack is the location in which the first domestic rail carrier received the goods for domestic transportation. <em>Supra, </em>at 115-116, 120, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 446-447, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Nor is it true that Carmack\u2019s focus is on providing a single through bill of lading for an entire shipment. <em>Ante, </em>at 108, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 442. Carmack\u2019s purpose in \u00a7 11706 is to ensure that a single bill</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">[561 U.S. 129]</p>\n<p id=\"ARvL\">of lading, with a single protective liability regime, governs an entire shipment by rail carrier within the United States.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It does not require the rail carrier to offer Carmack-compliant terms to anyone but the party with whom the rail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>carrier contracts when it receives the goods. It does not place obligations on the relationship between any overseas carrier and any overseas shipper that operate under their own bill of lading. That Congress expected different liability regimes to govern ocean and rail carriers can be inferred from the different regulatory oversight provided for each type of carrier\u2014the FMC for the former, the STB for the latter, see <em>supra, </em>at 118-119, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Moreover, that Carmack provides certain greater protections than does COGSA demonstrates that one of Car-mack\u2019s purposes\u2014beyond simply the fact of a single bill of lading governing all rail transportation\u2014was to specify a protective liability regime for that part of the shipment only. As compared to COGSA, Carmack provides heightened liability rules for rail transportation, compare COGSA \u00a7 4, 49 Stat. 1209, note following 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30701, p. 1179, with 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11706(a)-(c); stricter venue requirements, compare <em>Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. </em>v. <em>M/V Sky Reefer, </em>515 U.S. 528, 535, 115 S. Ct. 2322, 132 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1995), with \u00a7 11706(d); and more generous time allowances for filing suit, compare COGSA \u00a7 3(6), at 1179, with \u00a7 11706(e). Congress is evidently wary of creating broad exemptions from Carmack\u2019s regime: While Congress has given expansive authority to the STB to deregulate carriers from the requirements of the ICA, it has precluded the STB from excusing carriers from complying with Carmack. See <em>infra, </em>at 136, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 459 (discussing \u00a7 10502). By taking Carmack\u2019s protections out of the picture for goods that travel by rail in the United States whenever the goods first traveled by ocean liner, it is the Court that \u201cundermine[s] Carmack\u2019s purposes,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">[561 U.S. 130]</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\"><em>ante, </em>at 108, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 442. Cf. <em>Reider, </em>339 U.S., at 119, 70 S. Ct. 499, 94 L. Ed. 698 (applying Carmack to domestic rail transportation of goods, even where the goods originated overseas, in order to avoid \u201cimmuniz[ing] from the beneficial provisions of the [Carmack] Amendment all shipments originating in a foreign country when reshipped via the very transportation chain with which the Amendment was most concerned\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The Court\u2019s suggestion that its interpretation best comports with the goals of COGSA fares no better. The Court is correct, <em>ante, </em>at 99, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 436, that Congress has permitted parties contractually to extend COGSA, which, by its own terms, applies only to the period \u201cfrom the time when the goods are loaded on to the time when they are discharged from the ship.\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 1(e), 7, at 1178, 1180. But the Court ignores that COGSA specifically contemplates that there may be \u201cother law\u201d that manda-torily governs the inland leg, and makes clear that contractual extension of COGSA does not trump this law. \u00a7 12, at 1180 (\u201cNothing in [COGSA] shall be construed as superseding . . . any other law which would be applicable in the absence of [COGSA], insofar as they relate to the duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of the ship or carrier prior to the time when the goods are loaded on or after the time they are discharged from the ship\u201d); see also Sturley, Freedom of Contract and the Ironic Story of Section 7 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 4 Benedict\u2019s Maritime Bull. 201, 202 (2006) (\u201cIt is highly ironic to suggest that section 7 was intended to facilitate the extension of COGSA [inland]. The unambiguous history demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>strates that section 7 was specifically designed to accomplish exactly the opposite result\u201d). Notably, when it wants to do so, Congress knows how to specify that a contractual extension of COGSA supersedes other law: COGSA elsewhere defines a limited circumstance\u2014the carriage of goods by sea between ports of the United States\u2014in which a contractual extension of COGSA has the force of law. \u00a7 13, at 1180 (providing that</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">[561 U.S. 131]</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">such bills of lading \u201cshall be subjected hereto as fully as if subject hereto by the express provisions of [COGSA] \u201d). That Congress did not make the same provision for inland travel is powerful evidence that it meant for Carmack to remain the default regime on land governing the relationship between an inland rail carrier and an overseas carrier with which it directly contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The Court is also wrong that its interpretation avoids the risk that two sets of rules will apply to the same shipment at different times.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>at 108-109, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 442-443. Even under the Court\u2019s interpretation, two sets of rules may govern, because the parties need not extend COGSA to the inland leg\u2014 they may agree on any terms they choose to cover that transportation. \u00a7 7, at 1180 (permitting the parties to \u201cente[r] into <em>any agreement </em>... as to the responsibility and liability of the carrier or the ship\u201d for the period before the goods are loaded on and after they are discharged from the ship (emphasis added)); see also Train Wrecks 23 (\u201c[C]arriers regularly include clauses in their bills of lading to limit their liability [for inland travel] in ways that COGSA prohibits\u201d); 1 T. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law \u00a7 10-4, pp. 599-600 (4th ed. 2004) (describing typical non-COGSA liability rules parties select for the inland leg). In these cases, for example, \u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s bills of lading include certain terms governing the inland leg that differ from the terms governing the ocean carriage. See, <em>e.g., </em>App. 147 (providing different timeframes within which suit must be brought depending on whether the actionable conduct \u201coccurred during other than Water Carriage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The Court relies heavily on <em>Kirby </em>as identifying the relevant policy consideration in these cases, but it takes the</p>\n<p id=\"AQ9E\">[561 U.S. 132]</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">wrong lesson from <em>Kirby. </em>In that case, we were concerned about displacing a single federal law, COGSA, with 50 varying state liability regimes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 543 U.S., at 28-29, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283. The rule the Court establishes today creates even greater practical difficulties than the regime we criticized in <em>Kirby </em>by displacing Carmack with as many liability rules as there are bills of lading. It would even permit different liability rules to apply to different lawsuits arising out of the same inland accident depending on where each piece of cargo originated. Contrary to the Court\u2019s view, then, the value of uniformity articulated in <em>Kirby </em>is best promoted by application of Carmack to the obligations of the rail carrier during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>inland leg in these cases. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 99-100, 108-109, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 436-437, 442-443.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Finally, while purporting to effectuate the contractual choices of the parties in the international multimodal shipping industry, <em>ante, </em>at 108-111, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 442-444, the Court ignores the realities of the industry\u2019s operation. The industry has long been accustomed to drafting bills of lading that encompass two legal regimes, one governing ocean transportation and another governing inland transportation, given mandatory law governing road and rail carriage in most of Europe and in certain countries in Asia and North Africa. See generally Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road, May 19, 1956, 399 U. N. T. S. 189; Uniform Rules Concerning the Contract for International Carriage of Goods by Rail, App. B to the Convention Concerning International Carriage by Rail, May 9, 1980, 1397 U. N. T. S. 112, as amended by Protocol for the Modification of the Convention Concerning International Carriage of Rail of May 9, 1980, June 3, 1999. Indeed, \u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s own bills of lading</p>\n<p id=\"a8j-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 133]</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">evidence this practice, providing that, where an \u201capplicable international convention or national law\u201d exists, \u201ccannot be departed from,\u201d and \u201cwould have applied\u201d if a separate contract for inland carriage had been made between the merchant and the inland carrier, those laws govern \u201cK\u201d Line\u2019s liability. Brief for Respondents 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The recently signed United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, also known as the \u201cRotterdam Rules,\u201d provided an opportunity for the international community to adopt rules for multimodal shipments that would be uniform for both the ocean and inland legs. See generally Train Wrecks 36-39. Instead, the final version of the Rotterdam Rules retained the current system in which the inland leg may be governed by a different legal regime than the ocean leg. See United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, G. A. Res. 63/122, art. 26, A/RES/63/122 (Dec. 11, 2008). The Association of American Railroads and the United States, among others, advocated for this outcome.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See Proposal of the United States of America on the Definition of \u201cMaritime Performing Party,\u201d U. N. Doc. A/CN.9/WG.III/WP.84, \u00b6\u00b61-2 (Feb. 28, 2007); Proposal by the United States of America, U. N. Doc.

A/CN.9/WG.III/ WP.28, pp. 32-34, 43 (Jan. 31, 2003) (comments on behalf of the Association of American Railroads and the IRU). Thus, the Court\u2019s mistaken interpretation not only upsets domestic law but also</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">[561 U.S. 134]</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">disregards industry practice as evidenced by carefully calibrated international negotiations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Because, in my view, Carmack provides the default legal regime governing the relationship between the rail carrier and the ocean carrier during the inland leg of a multimodal shipment traveling on a through bill of lading, I would reach the second question presented by these cases: whether the parties validly contracted out of Carmack. I would hold that where, as here, the STB has exempted rail carriers from Part A of the ICA pursuant to its authority as set forth in 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502, such rail carriers may not use \u00a7 10709 to opt out of Carmack entirely. Instead, such rail carriers must first offer their contractual counterparties Carmack-compliant terms for liability and claims, as \u00a7 10502(e) requires. Having reached that conclusion, I would remand for consideration of whether the requirements of \u00a7 10502(e) were met in these cases. I set forth these views only briefly, as the Court\u2019s determination that Carmack does not apply at all makes resolution of these questions moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-448, 94 Stat. 1895, Congress set forth a national policy of \u201callow[ing], to the maximum extent possible, competition and the demand for services to establish reasonable rates for transportation by rail\u201d and \u201cminimiz [ing] the need for Federal regulatory</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">[561 U.S. 135]</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">control\u201d of the railroad industry. \u00a7 101, <em>id., </em>at 1897. Consistent with these goals, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10502 and 10709 provide two options for contracting around the requirements of the ICA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Section 10502(a) provides that when certain conditions are met, the Board \u201cshall exempt,\u201d \u201cto the maximum extent consistent with this part,\u201d \u201ca person, class of persons, or a transaction or service\u201d from either a particular provision of Part A of the ICA or the entirety of that Part. Section 10502(f) specifies that \u201c[t]he Board may exercise its authority under this section to exempt transportation that is provided by a rail carrier as part of a continuous intermodal movement.\u201d Acting pursuant to this authority, the Board has broadly exempted such transportation \u201cfrom the requirements of [the ICA].\u201d 49 CFR \u00a7 1090.2 (2009). The authority to issue broad exemptions, however, is not unlimited. Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502(e), \u201c[n]o exemption order issued pursuant to this section shall operate to relieve any rail carrier from an obligation to provide contractual terms for liability and claims which are consistent with the provisions of [Carmack],\u201d although, at the same time, \u201c[n]othing . . . shall prevent rail carriers from offering alternative terms.\u201d Section 10502(g) further limits the Board from exempting rail carriers from their obligations to comply with certain employee protections under Part A of the ICA.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">In turn, under \u00a7 10709(a), \u201c[o]ne or more rail carriers providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Board . . . may enter into a contract with one or more purchasers of rail services to provide specified services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>under specified rates and conditions.\u201d Having signed such a contract, a rail carrier \u201cshall have no duty in connection with services provided under such contract other than those duties specified by the terms of the contract.\u201d \u00a7 10709(b). Once such a contract is made, that contract, \u201cand transportation under such contract, shall not be subject to this part, and may not be subsequently challenged before the Board or in any court on</p>\n<p id=\"AaIb\">[561 U.S. 136]</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">the grounds that such contract violates a provision of [Part A of the ICA].\u201d \u00a7 10709(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">According to Union Pacific, \u00a7 10502(e) limits only the Board\u2019s exemption ability; it does not place any affirmative obligation on rail carriers to offer Carmack-compliant terms. Rail carriers, Union Pacific contends, may opt out of Carmack entirely simply by entering into a contract under \u00a7 10709, thus escaping any duty imposed by Part A of the ICA. I disagree. I am persuaded by the Government\u2019s view that because the Board\u2019s order in 49 CFR \u00a7 1090.2 exempted inter-modal rail transportation from all of Part A of the ICA, which includes 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10709, \u201cUnion Pacific could not properly enter into a contract under Section 10709 to relieve it of its obligations under Section 10502(e).\u201d Brief for United States 31. Those obligations require \u201ca rail carrier providing exempt transportation [to] offer the shipper the option of contractual terms for liability and claims consistent with Carmack, presumably at a higher rate,\u201d and they permit such a rail carrier to \u201center into a contract with different terms only if the shipper does not select that option.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Observing that the Board\u2019s exemption order relieves intermodal rail transportation from the \u201crequirements\u201d of Part A, Union Pacific contends that \u00a7 10709 is not a requirement but a privilege and therefore is not included within the exemption. In clarifying its order, however, the Board has described the exemption as one from \u201cregulation\u201d under the ICA or \u201capplication\u201d of that Act. See, <em>e.g., Improvement of TOFC/COFC Regulations, </em>3 I. C. C. 2d, at 869-870. Especially in light of this clarification, there seems little reason to ascribe significance to the Board\u2019s use of the word \u201crequirements,\u201d instead of the statutory term \u201cprovision,\u201d in the exemption order.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The Government aptly describes the policy concerns that justify this reading of the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 10502 and 10709. Brief for United States 31-32. Because a rail carrier\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">[561 U.S. 137]</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">counterparty to a \u00a7 10709 contract can ordinarily require a rail carrier to comply with common carriage rates and terms under Part A (including Carmack), such counterparties possess considerable bargaining power. But rail carriers the Board has exempted from Part A under \u00a7 10502 lack any obligation to comply with that Part. If exempt carriers could escape Carmack\u2019s obligations under \u00a7 10709, their counterparties would be at a significant disadvantage as compared to counterparties to contracts with non exempt carriers. Such a disadvantage cannot be squared with Congress\u2019 evident intent, as expressed in \u00a7 10502(e), to ensure that no carrier may be automatically exempted from Carmack.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">This interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 10502 and 10709 imposes no unfairness on exempt rail carriers. As the Court of Appeals explained, \u201ccarriers providing exempt transportation gain the benefits of deregulation, but lose the opportunity to contract for preferable terms under \u00a7 10709 without first of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>fering Carmack terms.\u201d 557 F.3d 985, 1002 (CA9 2009). Given rail carriers\u2019 ability to charge higher rates for full Carmack coverage, see <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Nothnagle, </em>346 U.S. 128, 135, 73 S. Ct. 986, 97 L. Ed. 1500 (1953), and the likelihood that some counterparties will agree to reject Carmack-compliant terms in favor of a lower price, such a tradeoff makes eminent sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Whether Union Pacific properly contracted out of Carmack under \u00a7 10502(e) requires a factual determination better suited for resolution by the District Court in the first instance. Accordingly, I would remand for consideration of that issue. Cf. 557 F.3d, at 1003. Union Pacific also raises a related legal argument not decided by the courts below: that the forum selection clause at issue in these cases is valid because venue is not encompassed within the phrase \u201ccontractual terms for liability and claims\u201d in \u00a7 10502(e). To the extent this argument is not waived, it would also be properly considered on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">[561 U.S. 138]</p>\n<p id=\"pATsE\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"31\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAS4AAAAgAQAAAACERqgqAAAAw0lEQVR4nO3UPQoCMRAF4JewjZVaCIKCi4cQwWY9lZZ2ipVH0s5jbC0WNmqQSZ7dJpApFrSwcLpvMpn8EGKIFuFtmyrgX/ZBmaQZp8ECwCMduWr4/t68PcfEqzgosABkl8x79lSQlMWWTbhVN4cYAhgXddOA884xgwdJ1kzipEAsAPTTQ01VkOQ+bTBQICAZRsmuZTbJIRZAKNdxGVneFBQApKriiNsMFRgCvEu803BxZQZvAZgQq2ClVPDdF2J++A95A6YUvZDCkRJ+AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"302\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In endorsing a strained reading of the text, history, and purpose of Car-mack, the Court is evidently concerned with a perceived need to enforce the COGSA-based contracts that the \u201csophisticated cargo owners\u201d here made with \u201cK\u201d Line. <em>Ante, </em>at 109, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 442. But these cases do not require the Court to interpret or examine the contract between the cargo owners and \u201cK\u201d Line. The Court need consider only the legal relationship between Union Pacific and \u201cK\u201d Line as its direct contracting party. As to that relationship, it bears emphasizing that industry actors on all sides are sophisticated and can easily adapt to a regime in which Carmack provides the default rule governing the rail carrier\u2019s liability during the inland leg of a multimodal shipment traveling on an international through bill of lading. See, <em>e.g., </em>Train Wrecks 40 (describing how ocean and rail carriers have drafted their contracts to account for\u2014and permissibly escape\u2014Carmack\u2019s applicability); cf. <em>Kirby, </em>543 U.S., at 36, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (recognizing that \u201cour decision does no more than provide a legal backdrop against which future bills of lading will be negotiated\u201d). In disregarding Congress\u2019 commands in both Carmack and COGSA and in discounting the practical realities reflected in the Rotterdam Rules and other international conventions governing the carriage of goods, the Court ignores what we acknowledged in <em>Kirby: </em>\u201cIt is not... this Court\u2019s task to structure the international shipping industry.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-14\">. Because I do not think that \u201cK\u201d Line conducts rail operations at all, I would not reach the question whether \u201cK\u201d Line holds itself out as offering rail common carriage.

The majority seems to find it troubling that my view \u201cwould require two bills of lading.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ante, </em>at 104, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 439. But international shipments frequently contain more than one bill of lading. See, <em>e.g., Kirby, </em>543 U.S., at 30-33, 125 S. Ct. 385, 160 L. Ed. 2d 283 (interpreting the parties\u2019 obligations under two bills of lading, one between a shipper and a freight forwarding company to which the shipper originally delivered its goods, and one between the freight forwarding company and the ocean carrier to which the freight forwarder delivered the shipper\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>goods). The majority also suggests that an original shipper might not be able to sue Union Pacific under the terms of Union Pacific\u2019s bill with \u201cK\u201d Line. <em>Ante, </em>at 104-105, 177 L.

In <em>Kirby, </em>however, we took as a given that the shipper could sue the inland rail carrier, even though the shipper was not a party to the rail carrier\u2019s bill of lading with an intermediary. Indeed, we held that in an action against the rail carrier, the shipper was bound to the terms of the bill of lading governing the rail carrier\u2019s transportation, even though those terms were less generous than the terms in the shipper\u2019s through bill of lading with the freight forwarder with which it originally contracted. 543 U.S., at 33-34, 125 S.

In light of this analysis, I see no reason to doubt a shipper\u2019s ability to sue an American rail carrier under Carmack, even though its bill of lading with an overseas ocean carrier is not governed by Carmack.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AJqr\">.

The Court ignores a further reason to believe that prior to 1978, Carmack could be understood to apply to imports as well as exports. Even assuming (contrary to my view) that the relevant language in Carmack governing any international commercial exchange was the phrase \u201cfrom any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign country,\u2019\u2019 the seemingly unidirectional \u201cfrom . . . to\u2019\u2019 could reasonably have been interpreted as also encompassing \u201cto . . . from\u2019\u2019 in light of our decision in <em>Galveston, H. &amp; S.

In that case, this Court interpreted similar \u201cfrom . . . to\u2019\u2019 language in the jurisdictional section of the ICA as conferring jurisdiction on the ICC over all transportation <em>between </em>such countries. <em>Id., </em>at 359-360, 41 S.

The United States, as <em>amicus </em>in support of \u201cK\u201d Line and Union Pacific, makes an effort to find such limitations in the current statutory text. See Brief for United States 21; see also Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 08-1554, p. 10 (agreeing with the United States\u2019 interpretation). This argument is unpersuasive. The United States observes that \u00a7 11706(a)(3) describes the liability of \u201canother rail carrier over whose line or route the property is transported in the United States or <em>from </em>a place in the United States <em>to </em>a place in an <em>adjacent foreign country </em>when transported under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>a through bill of lading.\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to the United States, \u201c[t]hat textual limitation, when read in light of Carmack\u2019s purpose, reflects Congress\u2019s continued intent to restrict Carmack to the carriage of goods between places in the United States and for export to an adjacent foreign country.\u201d Brief for United States 21. As I have already explained, however, once a domestic rail carrier first receives property for transportation within the United States, regardless of where the property itself originated, Carmack applies. <em>Supra, </em>at 114-117, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 445-447. Section 11706(a)(3) simply ensures that when a connecting carrier that neither received the property in the United States nor delivered it in the United States transports the property from the United States to either Canada or Mexico, that connecting carrier remains subject to Carmack liability during the part of the transportation that is in the United States. Further, as I explain below, see <em>infra, </em>at 128-131, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 454-456, Carmack\u2019s purpose would be better effectuated by applying its provisions inland as the default rule. In any event, the \u201cadjacent foreign country\u201d provision in \u00a7 11706(a)(3) has no bearing on the rail transportation provided in these cases by Union Pacific as \u201creceiving rail carrier,\u201d \u00a7 11706(a), from California to four locations in the American Midwest. To this transportation, Carmack plainly applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b500-11\">.

Nor would my interpretation of the statute necessarily require that two different regimes apply to each shipment, given the parties\u2019 ability to contract around Carmack as long as they follow appropriate procedures, <em>infra, </em>at 136-137, 177 L.
