The suit alleged that the companies defrauded the plaintiff class by \u201cdistort[ing] the entire body of public knowledge\u201d about the addictive effects of nicotine. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>American Tobacco Co., </em>2004-2095, p. 14 (La. App. 2/7/07), 949 So. 2d 1266, 1277. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal of Louisiana granted relief on that theory, and entered a judgment requiring applicants to pay $241,540,488 (plus accumulated in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>terest of about</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">[561 U.S. 1302]</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">$29 million) to fund a 10-year smoking-cessation program for the benefit of the members of the plaintiff class. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>American Tobacco Co., </em>2009-0461, pp. 21-23 (5/5/10), 36 So. 3d 1046, 1059-1060. (Still to be determined are the allowable attorney\u2019s fees, which will likely be requested in the tens of millions of dollars.) The Supreme Court of Louisiana declined review. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>American Tobacco Co., </em>2010-1361 (9/3/10), 44 So. 3d 707. Applicants have asked me, in my capacity as Circuit Justice for the Fifth Circuit, to stay the judgment until this Court can act on their intended petition for a writ of certio-rari.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">A single Justice has authority to enter such a stay, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(f), but the applicant bears a heavy burden. It is our settled practice to grant a stay only when three conditions are met: First, there must be a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted (or probable jurisdiction noted). Second, there must be a significant possibility that the judgment below will be reversed. And third, assuming the applicant\u2019s position on the merits is correct, there must be a likelihood of irreparable harm if the judgment is not stayed. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital Medical &amp; Surgical Ins. Plan, </em>501 U.S. 1301, 1302, 112 S. Ct. 1, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1087 (1991) (Scalia, J., in chambers). I conclude that this standard is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">Applicants complain of many violations of due process, including (among others) denial of the opportunity to cross-examine the named representatives of the class, factually unsupported estimations of the number of class members entitled to relief, and constant revision of the legal basis for respondents\u2019 claim during the course of litigation. Even though the judgment that is the alleged consequence of these claimed errors is massive\u2014 more than $250 million\u2014I would not be inclined to believe that this Court would grant certiorari to consider these fact-bound contentions that may have no effect on other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">But one asserted error in particular (and perhaps some of the others as well) implicates constitutional constraints on</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-10\">[561 U.S. 1303]</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-11\">the allowable alteration of normal process in class actions. This is a fraud case, and  in Louisiana the tort of fraud normally requires proof that the plaintiff detrimentally relied on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations. 949 So. 2d, at 1277. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal indicated that members of the plaintiff class who wish to seek individual damages, rather than just access to smoking-cessation measures, would have to establish their own reliance on the alleged distortions. <em>Ibid. </em>But the Court of Appeal held that this element need <em>not </em>be proved insofar as the class seeks payment into a fund that will <em>benefit </em>individual plaintiffs, since applicants are guilty of a \u201cdistort[ion of] the entire body of public knowledge\u201d on which the \u201cclass as a whole\u201d has relied. <em>Id., </em>at 1277-1278. Thus, the court eliminated any need for respondents to prove, and denied any opportunity for applicants to contest, that any particular plaintiff who benefits from the judgment (much less all of them) believed applicants\u2019 distortions and continued to smoke as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-12\">Applicants allege that this violates their due-process right to \u201can opportunity to present every available defense.\u201d <em>Lindsey </em>v. <em>Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 66, 92 S. Ct. 862, 31 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1972) (quoting <em>American Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>287 U.S. 156, 168, 53 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>S. Ct. 98, 77 L. Ed. 231 (1932); internal quotation marks omitted). Respondents concede that due process requires such an opportunity, but they contend that the intermediate state court\u2019s pronouncement means that, as a matter of Louisiana\u2019s substantive law, applicants <em>have </em>no non-reliance defense. That response may ultimately prove persuasive, but at this stage it serves to describe the issue rather than resolve it. The apparent consequence of the Court of Appeal\u2019s holding is that individual plaintiffs who could not recover had they sued separately <em>can </em>recover only because their claims were aggregated with others\u2019 through the procedural device of the class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\">The extent to which class treatment may constitutionally reduce the normal requirements of due process is an important question. National concern over abuse of the class-action</p>\n<p id=\"AVZu\">[561 U.S. 1304]</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">device induced Congress to permit removal of most major class actions to federal court, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d), where they will be subject to the significant limitations of the Federal Rules. Federal removal jurisdiction has not been accorded, however, over many class actions in which more than two-thirds of the plaintiff class are citizens of the forum State. See \u00a7 1332(d)(4). Because the class here was drawn to include only residents of Louisiana, this suit typifies the sort of major class action that often will not be removable, and in which the constraints of the Due Process Clause will be the only federal protection. There is no conflict between federal courts of appeals or between state supreme courts on the principal issue I have described; but the former seems impossible, since by definition only state class actions are at issue; and the latter seems implausible, unless one posits the unlikely case where the novel approach to class-action liability is a legislative rather than judicial creation, or the creation of a lower state court disapproved by the state supreme court on federal constitutional grounds. This constitutional issue ought not to be permanently beyond our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">Given those considerations, I conclude applicants have satisfied the prerequisites for a stay. I think it reasonably probable that four Justices will vote to grant certiorari, and significantly possible that the judgment below will be reversed. As for irreparable harm: Normally the mere payment of money is not considered irreparable, see <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>415 U.S. 61, 90, 94 S. Ct. 937, 39 L. Ed. 2d 166 (1974), but that is because money can usually be recovered from the person to whom it is paid. If expenditures cannot be recouped, the resulting loss may be irreparable. See, <em>e.g., Mori </em>v. <em>Boilermakers, </em>454 U.S. 1301, 1303, 102 S. Ct. 1046, 70 L. Ed. 2d 370 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers). Here it appears that, before this Court will be able to consider and resolve applicants\u2019 claims, a substantial portion of the fund established by their payment will be irrevocably expended. Funds spent to provide antismoking counseling and devices</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">[561 U.S. 1305]</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-10\">will not likely be recoverable; nor, it seems, will the $11,501,928 fee immediately payable toward administrative expenses in setting up the funded program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-11\">That does not end the matter.  A stay will not issue simply because the necessary conditions are satisfied. Rather, \u201csound equitable discretion will deny the stay when \u2018a decided balance of convenience\u2019 \u201d weighs against it. <em>Barnes, </em>501 U.S., at 1304-1305, 112 S. Ct. 1, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1087 (Scalia, J., in chambers) (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number><em>Magnum Import Co. </em>v. <em>Coty, </em>262 U.S. 159, 164, 43 S. Ct. 531, 67 L. Ed. 922 (1923)). Here, however, the equities favor granting the application. Refusing a stay may visit an irreversible harm on applicants, but granting it will apparently do no permanent injury to respondents. Applicants allege that similar smoking-cessation measures are freely and readily available from other sources in Louisiana, and respondents have not disputed that. Under those circumstances, the equitable balance favors issuance of the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">The application for a stay of the execution of the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Fourth Circuit, is granted pending applicants\u2019 timely filing, and this Court\u2019s disposition, of a petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
