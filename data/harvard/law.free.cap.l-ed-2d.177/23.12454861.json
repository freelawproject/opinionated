Unlike debtors who file under Chapter 7 and must liquidate their nonexempt assets in order to pay creditors, see \u00a7\u00a7 704(a)(1), 726, Chapter 13 debtors are permitted to keep their property, but they must agree to a court-approved plan under which they pay creditors out of their future income, see \u00a7\u00a7 1306(b), 1321, 1322(a)(1), 1328(a). A bankruptcy trustee oversees the filing and execution of a Chapter 13 debtor\u2019s plan. \u00a7 1322(a)(1); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 586(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Section 1325 of Title 11 specifies circumstances under which a bankruptcy court \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmay not\u201d confirm a plan. \u00a7\u00a7 1325(a), (b). If an unsecured creditor or the bankruptcy trustee objects to confirmation, \u00a7 1325(b)(1) requires</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">[560 U.S. 509]</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">the debtor either to pay unsecured creditors in full or to pay all \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to be received by the debtor over the duration of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">We granted certiorari to decide how a bankruptcy court should calculate a debtor\u2019s \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d Some lower courts have taken what the parties term the \u201cmechanical approach,\u201d while most have adopted what has been called the \u201cforward-looking approach.\u201d We hold that the \u201cforward-looking approach\u201d is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b76-14\">As previously noted,  \u00a7 1325 provides that if a trustee or an unsecured creditor objects to a Chapter 13 debt- or\u2019s plan, a bankruptcy court may not approve the plan unless it provides for the full repayment of unsecured claims or \u201cprovides that all of the debtor\u2019s projected disposable income to be received\u201d over the duration of the plan \u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d in accordance with the terms of the plan. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(1); see also \u00a7 1325(b)(1) (2000 ed.). Before the enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, the Bankruptcy Code (Code) loosely defined \u201cdisposable income\u201d as \u201cincome which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d for the \u201cmaintenance or support of the debtor,\u201d for qualifying charitable contributions, or for business expenditures. \u00a7\u00a7 1325(b)(2)(A), (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">The Code did not define the term \u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d and in most cases, bankruptcy courts used a mechanical approach in calculating projected disposable income. That is, they first multiplied monthly income by the number of months in the plan and then determined what portion of the result was \u201cexcess\u201d or \u201cdisposable.\u201d See 2 K. Lundin, Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \u00a7 164.1, p. 164-1, and n. 4 (3d ed. 2000) (hereinafter Lundin (2000 ed.)) (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-16\">In exceptional cases, however, bankruptcy courts took into account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>foreseeable changes in a debtor\u2019s income or expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">[560 U.S. 510]</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">See <em>In re Heath, </em>182 B.R. 557, 559-561 (Bkrtcy.

See \u00a7 101(10A)(A)(i).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The phrase \u201camounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d in \u00a7 1325(b)(2) is also newly defined. For a debtor whose income is below the median for his or her State, the phrase includes the full amount needed for \u201cmaintenance or support,\u201d see \u00a7 1325(b)(2)(A)(i), but for a debtor with income that exceeds the state median, only certain specified expenses are included,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> see \u00a7\u00a7 707(b)(2) (2006 ed. and Supp. II), 1325(b)(3)(A) (2006 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">[560 U.S. 511]</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Respondent had $36,793.36 in unsecured debt when she filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 2006. In the six months before her filing, she received a one-time buyout from her former employer, and this payment greatly inflated her gross income for April 2006 (to $11,990.03) and for May 2006 (to $15,356.42). App. 84, 107. As a result of these payments, respondent\u2019s current monthly income, as averaged from April through October 2006, was $5,343.70\u2014a figure that exceeds the median income for a family of one in Kansas. See <em>id., </em>at 78. Respondent\u2019s monthly expenses, calculated pursuant to \u00a7 707(b)(2), were $4,228.71. <em>Id., </em>at 83. She reported a monthly \u201cdisposable income\u201d of $1,114.98 on Form 22C. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">On the form used for reporting monthly income (Schedule I), she reported income from her new job of $1,922 per month\u2014which is below the state median. <em>Id., </em>at 66; see also <em>id., </em>at 78. On the form used for reporting monthly expenses (Schedule J), she reported actual monthly expenses of $1,772.97. <em>Id., </em>at 68. Subtracting the Schedule J figure from the Schedule I figure resulted in monthly disposable income of $149.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Respondent filed a plan that would have required her to pay $144 per month for 36 months. See <em>id., </em>at 93. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Petitioner, a private Chapter 13 trustee, objected to confirmation of the plan because the amount respondent proposed to pay was less than the full amount of the claims against her, see \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(A), and because, in petitioner\u2019s view, respondent was not committing all of her \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to the repayment of creditors, see \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B). According to petitioner, the proper way to calculate projected disposable income was simply to multiply disposable income, as calculated on Form 22C, by the number of months in the commitment period. Employing this mechanical approach,</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">[560 U.S. 512]</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">petitioner calculated that creditors would be paid in full if respondent made monthly payments of $756 for a period of 60 months. <em>Id., </em>at 108. There is no dispute that respondent\u2019s actual income was insufficient to make payments in that amount. Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Bankruptcy Court endorsed respondent\u2019s proposed monthly payment of $144 but required a 60-month plan period. <em>In re Lanning, </em>No. 06-41037 etc., 2007 WL 1451999, *8 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Kan. 2007). The court agreed with the majority view that the word \u201cprojected\u201d in \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B) requires courts \u201cto consider at confirmation the debtor\u2019s <em>actual </em>income as it is reported on Schedule I.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at *5 (emphasis added). This conclusion was warranted by the text of \u00a7 1325(b)(1), the Bankruptcy Court reasoned, and was necessary to avoid the absurd result of denying bankruptcy protection to individuals with deteriorating finances in the six months before filing. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Petitioner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which affirmed. <em>In re Lanning, </em>380 B.R. 17, 19 (2007). The panel noted that, although Congress redefined \u201cdisposable income\u201d in 2005, it chose not to alter the pre-existing term \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 24. Thus, the panel concluded, there was no reason to believe that Congress intended to alter the pre-BAPCPA practice under which bankruptcy courts determined projected disposable income by reference to Schedules I and J but considered other evidence when there was reason to believe that the schedules did not reflect a debtor\u2019s actual ability to pay. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">The Tenth Circuit affirmed. <em>In re Lanning, </em>545 F.3d 1269, 1270 (2008). According to the Tenth Circuit, a court, in calculating \u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d should begin with the \u201cpresumption\u201d that the figure yielded by the mechanical approach is correct, but the court concluded that</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">[560 U.S. 513]</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">this figure may be rebutted by evidence of a substantial change in the debtor\u2019s circumstances. <em>Id., </em>at 1278-1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">This petition followed, and we granted certiorari. 558 U.S. 989, 130 S. Ct. 487, 175 L. Ed. 2d 343 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b78-16\">The parties differ sharply in their interpretation of \u00a7 1325\u2019s reference to \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d Petitioner, advocating the mechanical approach, contends that \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d means past average monthly disposable income multiplied by the number of months in a debtor\u2019s plan. Respondent, who favors the forward-looking approach, agrees that  the method outlined by petitioner should be determinative in most cases, but she argues that in exceptional cases, where significant changes in a debtor\u2019s financial cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>cumstances are known or virtually certain, a bankruptcy court has discretion to make an appropriate adjustment. Respondent has the stronger argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">First, respondent\u2019s argument is supported by the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cprojected.\u201d  \u201cWhen terms used in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Asgrow Seed Co. </em>v. <em>Winterboer, </em>513 U.S. 179, 187, 115 S. Ct. 788, 130 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1995). Here, the term \u201cprojected\u201d is not defined, and in ordinary usage future occurrences are not \u201cprojected\u201d based on the assumption that the past will necessarily repeat itself. For example, projections concerning a company\u2019s future sales or the future cashflow from a license take into account anticipated events that may change past trends. See, <em>e.g., Tellabs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>551 U.S. 308, 316, 127 S. Ct. 2499, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179 (2007) (describing adjustments to \u201cprojected sales\u201d in light of falling demand); <em>Innovair Aviation, Ltd. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>83 Fed. Cl. 498, 502, 504-506 (2008) (calculating projected cashflow and noting that past sales are \u201cnot necessarily the number of sales\u201d that will be made in the future). On the night of an election, experts do not \u201cproject\u201d the percentage</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">[560 U.S. 514]</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">of the votes that a candidate will receive by simply assuming that the candidate will get the same percentage as he or she won in the first few reporting precincts. And sports analysts do not project that a team\u2019s winning percentage at the end of a new season will be the same as the team\u2019s winning percentage last year or the team\u2019s winning percentage at the end of the first month of competition. While a projection takes past events into account, adjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the final outcome. See <em>In re Kibbe, </em>361 B.R. 302, 312, n. 9 (Bkrtcy. App. Panel CA1 2007) <em>(per curiam) </em>(contrasting \u201cmultiplied,\u201d which \u201crequires only mathematical acumen,\u201d with \u201cprojected,\u201d which requires \u201cmathematic acumen adjusted by deliberation and discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Second, the word \u201cprojected\u201d appears in many federal statutes, yet Congress rarely has used it to mean simple multiplication. For example, the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 defined \u201cprojected national yield,\u201d \u201cprojected county yield,\u201d and \u201cprojected farm yield\u201d as entailing historical averages \u201cadjusted for abnormal weather conditions,\u201d \u201ctrends in yields,\u201d and \u201cany significant changes in production practices.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1301(b)(8)(B), (13)(J),(K).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">By contrast, we need look no further than the Bankruptcy Code to see that when Congress wishes to mandate simple multiplication, it does so unambiguously\u2014most commonly by using the term \u201cmultiplied.\u201d See, <em>e.g., </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(3) (\u201ccurrent monthly income, when multiplied by</p>\n<p id=\"A0\">[560 U.S. 515]</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">12\u201d); \u00a7\u00a7 704(b)(2), 707(b)(6), (7)(A) (same); \u00a7\u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(i), (B)(iv) (\u201cmultiplied by 60\u201d). Accord, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 58(b)(1)(B) (\u201cmultiplied by the num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ber of months in such year\u201d); 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8415(a) (\u201cmultiplied by such individual\u2019s total service\u201d); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(f)(3) (\u201cmultiplied by the number of months in such year\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Third, pre-BAPCPA case law points in favor of the \u201cforward-looking\u201d approach. Prior to BAPCPA, the general rule was that courts would multiply a debtor\u2019s current monthly income by the number of months in the commitment period as the first step in determining projected disposable income. See, <em>e.g., In re Killough, </em>900 F.2d 61, 62-63 (CA5 1990) <em>(per curiam); In re Anderson, </em>21 F.3d 355, 357 (CA9 1994); <em>In re Solomon, </em>67 F.3d 1128, 1132 (CA4 1995). See 2 Lundin \u00a7 164.1, at 164-1 (2000 ed.) (\u201cMost courts focus on the debtor\u2019s current income and extend current income (and expenditures) over the life of the plan to calculate projected disposable income\u201d). But courts also had discretion to account for known or virtually certain changes in the debtor\u2019s income. See <em>Heath, </em>182 B.R., at 559-561; <em>Richardson, </em>283 B.R., at 799; <em>In re James, </em>260 B.R. 498, 514-515 (Bkrtcy. Ct.

Ct. Colo. 1985) (\u201cSince there are no changes in income which can be clearly foreseen, the Court must simply multiply the debtor\u2019s current disposable income by 36 in order to determine his \u2018projected\u2019 income\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">[560 U.S. 516]</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">This judicial discretion was well documented in contemporary bankruptcy treatises. See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 1325.08[4][a], p. 1325-50 (rev. 15th ed. 2004) (hereinafter Collier) (\u201cAs a practical matter, <em>unless there are changes which can be clearly foreseen, </em>the court must simply multiply the debtor\u2019s current monthly income by 36 and determine whether the amount to be paid under the plan equals or exceeds that amount\u201d (emphasis added)); 3 W. Norton, Bankruptcy Law and Practice \u00a7 75.10, p. 64 (1991) (\u201cIt has been held that the court should focus upon present monthly income and expenditures and, <em>absent extraordinary circumstances, </em>project these current amounts over the life of the plan to determine projected disposable income\u201d (emphasis added)); 2 Lundin \u00a7 164.1, at 164-28 to 164-31 (2000 ed.)

Indeed, petitioner concedes that courts possessed this discretion prior to BAPCPA.

Congress did not amend the term \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d in 2005, and pre-BAPCPA bankruptcy practice reflected a widely acknowledged and well-documented view that courts may take into account known or virtually certain changes to debtors\u2019 income or expenses when projecting disposable income. In light of this historical practice, we would expect that, had Congress intended for \u201cprojected\u201d to carry a specialized\u2014and indeed, unusual\u2014meaning in Chapter 13, Congress would have said so expressly. Cf., <em>e.g., </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 279(c)(3)(A), (B) (expressly defining \u201cprojected earnings\u201d as reflecting a 3-year historical average).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">The mechanical approach also clashes repeatedly with the terms of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">First,  \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B)\u2019s reference to projected disposable income \u201cto be received in the applicable commitment period\u201d strongly favors the forward-looking approach. There is no dispute that respondent would in fact receive far less than $756 per month in disposable income during the plan period, so petitioner\u2019s projection does not accurately reflect \u201cincome</p>\n<p id=\"AVle\">[560 U.S. 518]</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">to be received\u201d during that period. See <em>In re Nowlin, </em>576 F.3d 258, 263 (CA5 2009). The mechanical approach effectively reads this phrase out of the statute when a debtor\u2019s current disposable income is substantially higher than the income that the debtor predictably will receive during the plan period. See <em>Kawaauhau </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>523 U.S. 57, 62, 118 S. Ct. 974, 140 L. Ed. 2d 90 (1998) (  \u201c[W]e are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">Second,  \u00a7 1325(b)(1) directs courts to determine projected disposable income \u201cas of the effective date of the plan,\u201d which is the date on which the plan is confirmed and becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>binding, see \u00a7 1327(a). Had Congress intended for projected disposable income to be nothing more than a multiple of disposable income in all cases, we see no reason why Congress would not have required courts to determine that value as of the <em>filing </em>date of the plan. See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3015(b) (requiring that a plan be filed within 14 days of the filing of a petition). In the very next section of the Code, for example, Congress specified that  a debtor shall commence payments \u201cnot later than 30 days after the <em>date of the filing of the plan.\u201d </em>\u00a7 1326(a)(1) (emphasis added). Congress\u2019 decision to require courts to measure projected disposable income \u201cas of the <em>effective </em>date of the plan\u201d is more consistent with the view that Congress expected courts to consider postfiling information about the debt- or\u2019s financial circumstances. See 545 F.3d, at 1279 (\u201c[D]etermining whether or not a debtor has committed all projected disposable income to repayment of the unsecured creditors \u2018as of the effective date of the plan\u2019 suggests consideration of the debtor\u2019s actual financial circumstances as of the effective date of the plan\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Third, the requirement that projected disposable income \u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d is most naturally read to contemplate that the debtor will actually pay creditors</p>\n<p id=\"AC1\">[560 U.S. 519]</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">in the calculated monthly amounts. \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B). But when, as of the effective date of a plan, the debtor lacks the means to do so, this language is rendered a hollow command.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The arguments advanced in favor of the mechanical approach are unpersuasive. Noting that the Code now provides a detailed and precise definition of \u201cdisposable income,\u201d proponents of the mechanical approach maintain that any departure from this method leaves that definition \u201c \u2018with no apparent purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Kagenveama, </em>541 F.3d 868, 873 (CA9 2008). This argument overlooks the important role that the statutory formula for calculating \u201cdisposable income\u201d plays under the forward-looking approach. As the Tenth Circuit recognized in this case,  a court taking the forward-looking approach should begin by calculating disposable income, and in most cases, nothing more is required. It is only in unusual cases that a court may go further and take into account other known or virtually certain information about the debtor\u2019s future income or expenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Petitioner faults the Tenth Circuit for referring to a rebuttable \u201cpresumption\u201d that the figure produced by the mechanical approach accurately represents a debtor\u2019s \u201cprojected disposable income.\u201d See 545 F.3d, at 1278-1279. Petitioner notes that the Code makes no reference to any such presumption but that related Code provisions expressly create other re-buttable presumptions. See \u00a7\u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(i) and (B)(i). He thus suggests that the Tenth Circuit improperly supplemented the text of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">The Tenth Circuit\u2019s analysis, however, simply heeds the ordinary mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ing of the term \u201cprojected.\u201d As noted, a person making a projection uses past occurrences as a starting point, and that is precisely what the Tenth Circuit prescribed. See, <em>e.g., Nowlin, supra, </em>at 260, 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">[560 U.S. 520]</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Petitioner argues that only the mechanical approach is consistent with \u00a7 1129(a)(15)(B), which refers to \u201cprojected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section 1325(b)(2)).\u201d This cross-reference, petitioner argues, shows that Congress intended for the term \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d to incorporate, presumably in all contexts, the defined term \u201cdisposable income.\u201d It is evident that  \u00a7 1129(a)(15)(B) refers to the defined term \u201cdisposable income,\u201d see \u00a7 1325(b)(2), but that fact offers no insight into the meaning of the word \u201cprojected\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B). We fail to see how that word acquires a specialized meaning as a result of this cross-reference\u2014particularly where both \u00a7\u00a7 1129(a)(15)(B) and 1325(b)(1)(B) refer to projected disposable income \u201cto be received\u201d during the relevant period. See <em>supra, </em>at 517-518, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Petitioner also notes that \u00a7 707 allows courts to take \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d into consideration, but that \u00a7 1325(b)(3) incorporates \u00a7 707 only with respect to calculating expenses. See <em>In re Wilson, </em>397 B.R. 299, 314-315 (Bkrtcy. Ct. MDNC 2008). Thus, he argues, a \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception should not be inferred with respect to the debtor\u2019s income.  We decline to infer from \u00a7 1325\u2019s incorporation of \u00a7 707 that Congress intended to eliminate, <em>sub silentio, </em>the discretion that courts previously exercised when projecting disposable income to account for known or virtually certain changes. Accord, <em>In re Liverman, </em>383 B.R. 604, 613, and n. 15 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NJ 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">In cases in which a debtor\u2019s disposable income during the 6-month look-back period is either substantially lower or higher than the debtor\u2019s disposable income during the plan period, the mechanical approach would produce senseless results that we do not think Congress intended. In cases in which the debtor\u2019s disposable income is higher during the plan period, the mechanical approach would deny creditors payments that the debtor could easily make. And where, as in the present case, the debtor\u2019s disposable income during</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">[560 U.S. 521]</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">the plan period is substantially lower, the mechanical approach would deny the protection of Chapter 13 to debtors who meet the chapter\u2019s main eligibility requirements. Here, for example, respondent is an \u201cindividual whose income is sufficiently stable and regular\u201d to allow her \u201cto make payments under a plan,\u201d \u00a7 101(30), and her debts fall below the limits set out in \u00a7 109(e). But if the mechanical approach were used, she could not file a confirmable plan. Under \u00a7 1325(a)(6), a plan cannot be confirmed unless \u201cthe debtor will be able to make all payments under the plan and to comply with the plan.\u201d And as petitioner concedes, respondent could not possibly make the payments that the mechanical approach prescribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">In order to avoid or at least to mitigate the harsh results that the mechanical approach may produce for debtors, petitioner advances several possible escape strategies. He proposes no comparable strategies for creditors harmed by the mechanical approach, and in any event none of the maneuvers that he proposes for debtors is satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Petitioner first suggests that a debtor may delay filing a petition so as to place any extraordinary income outside the 6-month lookback period. We see at least two problems with this proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">First, delay is often not a viable option for a debtor sliding into bankruptcy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">\u201cPotential Chapter 13 debtors typically find a lawyer\u2019s office when they are one step from financial Armageddon: There is a foreclosure sale of the debtor\u2019s home the next day; the debtor\u2019s only car was mysteriously repossessed in the dark of last night; a garnishment has reduced the debtor\u2019s take-home pay below the ordinary requirements of food and rent.

See  11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(7) (requiring, as a condition of confirmation, that \u201cthe action of the debtor in filing the petition was in good faith\u201d); see also, <em>e.g., In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007) (citing \u201c \u2018the timing of the petition\u2019 \u201d as a factor to be considered in assessing a debtor\u2019s compliance with the good-faith requirement).

We see little merit in this convoluted strategy. If the Code required the use of the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy would improperly undermine what the Code demands. And if, as we believe, the Code does not insist upon rigid adherence to the mechanical approach in all cases, this strategy is not needed. In any event, even if this strategy were allowed, it would not help all debtors whose disposable income during the plan period is sharply lower than their previous disposable income.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">[560 U.S. 523]</p>\n<p id=\"b84-15\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b84-16\">Petitioner suggests that a debtor can dismiss the petition and refile at a later, more favorable date. But petitioner offers only the tepid assurance that courts \u201cgenerally\u201d do not find this practice to be abusive. Brief for Petitioner 53. This questionable stratagem plainly circumvents the statutory limits on a court\u2019s ability to shift the lookback period, see <em>supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>522, 177 L.

The availability of Chapter 7 to debtors like respondent who have above-median incomes is limited. In respondent\u2019s case, a presumption of abuse would attach under \u00a7 707(b)(2)(A)(i) because her disposable income, \u201cmultiplied by 60,\u201d exceeds the amounts specified in subclauses (I) and (II). See also \u00a7 707(b)(1) (allowing a court to dismiss a petition filed by a debtor \u201cwhose debts are primarily consumer debts ... if it finds that the granting of relief would be an abuse of the provisions of this chapter\u201d); App. 86-88 (\u201cNotice to Individual Consumer Debtor under \u00a7 342(b) of the Bankruptcy Code\u201d; \u201cIf your income is greater than the median income for your state of residence and family size, in some cases, creditors have the</p>\n<p id=\"AV2\">[560 U.S. 524]</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">right to file a motion requesting that the court dismiss your case under \u00a7 707(b) of the Code\u201d). Nevertheless, petitioner argues, respondent might have been able to overcome this presumption by claiming that her case involves \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 707(b)(2)(B)(i). Section 707 identifies as examples of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d a \u201cserious medical condition or a call or order to active duty in the Armed Forces,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>and petitioner directs us to no authority for the proposition that a prepetition decline in income would qualify as a \u201cspecial circumstance.\u201d In any event, the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exception is available only to the extent that \u201cthere is no reasonable alternative,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>a proposition we reject with our interpretation of \u00a7 1325(b)(1) today.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">In sum, each of the strategies that petitioner identifies for mitigating the anomalous effects of the mechanical approach is flawed.

Consistent with the text of \u00a7 1325 and pre-BAPCPA practice, we hold that  when a bankruptcy court calculates a debtor\u2019s projected disposable income, the court may account for changes in the debtor\u2019s income or expenses that are known or virtually certain at the time of confirmation.

When pre-BAPCPA courts declined to make adjustments based on possible changes in a debtor\u2019s future income or expenses, they did so because the changes were not sufficiently foreseeable, not because they concluded that they lacked discretion to depart from a strictly mechanical approach.

The Code does not define \u201cprojected disposable income,\u201d but it does define \u201cdisposable income.\u201d The next paragraph of \u00a7 1325(b) provides that \u201c[flor purposes of this subsection, the term \u2018disposable income\u2019 means current monthly income received by the debtor,\u201d excluding certain payments received for child support, \u201cless amounts reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d on three categories of expenses. \u00a7 1325(b)(2). The Code in turn defines \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d as \u201cthe average monthly income from all sources that the debtor receives . . . derived during the 6-month period ending on\u201d one of two dates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 101(10A)(A).

Cf. \u00a7 1129(a)( 15)(B) (referring to \u201cthe projected disposable income of the debtor (as defined in section 1325(b)(2))\u201d). The puzzle is what to make of the word \u201cprojected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-15\">In the Court\u2019s view, this modifier makes all the difference. Projections, it explains, ordinarily account for later developments, not just past data. <em>Ante, </em>at 513-514, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 32-33. Thus, the Court concludes, in determining \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d a bankruptcy court may depart from \u00a7 1325(b)(2)\u2019s inflexible formula, at least in \u201cexceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>cases,\u201d to account for \u201csignificant changes\u201d in the debtor\u2019s circumstances, either actual or anticipated. <em>Ante, </em>at 513, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">That interpretation runs aground because it either renders superfluous text Congress included or requires adding text Congress did not. It would be pointless to define disposable income in such detail, based on data during a specific 6-month period, if a court were free to set the resulting figure aside whenever it appears to be a poor predictor. And since \u201cdisposable income\u201d appears nowhere else in \u00a7 1325(b), then unless \u00a7 1325(b)(2)\u2019s definition applies to \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d in \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B), it does not apply at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Court insists its interpretation does not render \u00a7 1325(b)(2)\u2019s incorporation of \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d a nullity: A bankruptcy court must still <em>begin </em>with that figure, but is simply free to fiddle with it if a \u201csignificant\u201d change in</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">[560 U.S. 527]</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">the debtor\u2019s circumstances is \u201cknown or virtually certain.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 513, 519, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 32, 36. That construction conveniently avoids superfluity, but only by utterly abandoning the text the Court purports to construe. Nothing in the text supports treating the definition of disposable income Congress supplied as a suggestion. And even if the word \u201cprojected\u201d did allow (or direct) a court to disregard \u00a7 1325(b)(2)\u2019s fixed formula and to consider other data, there would be no basis in the text for the restrictions the Court reads in, regarding when and to what extent a court may (or must) do so. If the statute authorizes estimations, it authorizes them in <em>every </em>case, not just those where changes to the debtor\u2019s income are both \u201csignificant\u201d and either \u201cknown or virtually certain.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>If the evidence indicates it is merely more likely than not that the debtor\u2019s income will increase by some minimal amount, there is no reading of the word \u201cprojected\u201d that permits (or requires) a court to ignore that change. The Court, in short, can arrive at its compromise construction only by rewriting the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The only reasonable reading that avoids deleting words Congress enacted, or adding others it did not, is this: Setting aside expenses excludable under \u00a7 1325(b)(2)(A) and (B), which are not at issue here, a court must calculate the debtor\u2019s \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d by multiplying his current monthly income by the number of months in the \u201capplicable commitment period.\u201d The word \u201cprojected\u201d in this context, I agree, most sensibly refers to a calculation, prediction, or estimation of future events, see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>12-13 (collecting dictionary definitions); see also Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 1978 (2d ed. 1954). But one assuredly can calculate, predict, or estimate future figures based on the past. And here Congress has commanded that a specific historical figure shall be the basis for the projection.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">[560 U.S. 528]</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">The Court rejects this reading as unrealistic. A projection, the Court explains, may be based in <em>part </em>on past data, but \u201cadjustments are often made based on other factors that may affect the final outcome.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 514, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 33. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. No gambler would bet the farm using \u201cprojections]\u201d that are based only on a football team\u2019s play <em>before </em>its star quarterback was injured. And no pundit would keep his post if he \u201cprojected\u201d election results <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>relying only on prior cycles, ignoring recent polls. So too, the Court appears to reason, it makes no sense to say a court \u201cproject[s]\u201d a debtor\u2019s \u201cdisposable income\u201d when it considers only what he earned in a specific 6-month period in the past. <em>Ante, </em>at 513-514, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">Such analogies do not establish that carrying current monthly income forward to determine a debtor\u2019s future ability to pay is not a \u201cprojection.\u201d They show only that relying exclusively on past data for the projection may be a bad idea. One who is asked to predict future results, but is armed with no other information than prior performance, can still make a projection; it may simply be off the mark. Congress, of course, could have tried to prevent that possibility by prescribing, as it has done in other contexts, that a debtor\u2019s projected disposable income be determined based on the \u201cbest available evidence,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1364(c)(2), or \u201cany . . . relevant information,\u201d 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2009(c)(1). But it included no such prescription here, and instead identified the data a court should consider. Perhaps Congress concluded that other information a bankruptcy court might consider is too uncertain or too easily manipulated. Or perhaps it thought the cost of considering such information outweighed the benefits. Cf. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(b)(13)(J)-(M) (requiring national and local \u201cprojected\u201d yields of various crops to be adjusted only for abnormal weather, trends in yields, and production practices, apparently to the exclusion of other presumably relevant variables such as a sudden increase or decrease in the number of producers, farm subsidies, etc.). In all events, neither the reasons for nor the wisdom of the</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">[560 U.S. 529]</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">projection method Congress chose has any bearing on what the statute means.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The Court contends that if Congress really meant courts to multiply a static figure by a set number of months, it would have used the word \u201cmultiplied,\u201d as it has done elsewhere\u2014indeed, elsewhere in the same subsection, see, <em>e.g., </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(b)(3)\u2014instead of the word \u201cprojected.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Ante, at 514-515, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 33-34. I do not dispute that, as a general matter, we should presume that Congress does not ordinarily use two words in the same context to denote the same thing. But if forced to choose between (1) assuming Congress enacted text that serves no purpose at all, (2) ascribing an unheard-of meaning to the word \u201cprojected\u201d (loaded with made-to-order restrictions) simply to avoid undesirable results, or (3) assuming Congress employed synonyms to express a single idea, the last is obviously the least evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">In any event, we are not put to that choice here. While under my reading a court must determine the <em>income </em>half of the \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d equation by multiplying a fixed number, that is not necessarily true of the <em>expenses </em>excludable under \u00a7 1325(b)(2)(A) and (B). Unlike the debtor\u2019s current monthly income, none of the three types of expenses\u2014 payments for the support of the debtor and his dependents, charitable contributions, and expenses to keep an existing business above water\u2014is explicitly defined in terms of historical figures (at least for debtors with incomes below the state median). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>first of those cannot possibly (in many cases) be determined based on the same 6-month period from which current monthly income is derived,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">[560 U.S. 530]</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">texts of the other two are consistent with determining expenses based on expectations. See \u00a7 1325(b)(2)(A)(ii) (charitable expenses to qualified entities limited to \u201c15 percent of gross income of the debtor for the year in which the contributions are made\u201d); \u00a7 1325(b)(2)(B) (\u201cexpenditures necessary for the continuation, preservation, and operation\u201d of a business in which the debtor is engaged).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In short, a debtor\u2019s projected disposable income consists of two parts: one (current monthly income) that is fixed once for all based on historical data, and another (the enumerated expenses) that at least arguably depends on estimations of the debtor\u2019s future circumstances. The statute thus requires the court to predict the difference between two figures, each of which depends on the duration of the commitment period, and one of which also turns partly on facts besides historical data. In light of all this, it seems to me not at all unusual to describe this process as projection, not merely multiplication.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The Court\u2019s remaining arguments about the statute\u2019s meaning are easily dispatched. A \u201cmechanical\u201d reading of projected disposable income, it contends, renders superfluous the phrase \u201cto be received in the applicable commitment period\u201d in \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B). <em>Ante, </em>at 517, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 35. Not at all. That phrase defines the period for which a debtor\u2019s disposable income must be calculated <em>(i.e., </em>the period over which the projection extends), and thus the amount the debtor must ultimately pay his unsecured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Similarly insubstantial is the Court\u2019s claim regarding the requirement that the plan provide that the debtor\u2019s projected disposable income \u201cwill be applied to make payments\u201d toward unsecured creditors\u2019 claims, \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B). The Court says this requirement makes no sense unless the</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">[560 U.S. 531]</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">debtor is actually able to pay an amount equal to his projected disposable income. <em>Ante, </em>at 518-519, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 35-36. But it makes no sense only if one assumes that the debtor is entitled to confirmation in the first place; and that assumption is wrong. The requirement that the debtor pay at least his projected disposable income is a <em>prerequisite </em>to confirmation. The \u201cwill be applied\u201d proviso does not require a debtor to pay what he cannot; it simply withholds Chapter 13 relief when he cannot pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">The Court also argues that \u00a7 1325(b)(1)\u2019s directive to determine projected disposable income \u201cas of the effective date of the plan\u201d makes no sense if mere multiplication of existing numbers is required. <em>Ante, </em>at 518, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 35-36. As I have explained, however, \u201cprojected disposable income\u201d may in some cases require more than multiplication (as to expenses), and the estimations involved may vary from the date of the plan\u2019s filing until the date it takes effect. Moreover, the provision also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>applies to the alternative avenue to confirmation in \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(A), which requires that \u201cthe value of the property to be distributed under the plan\u201d to an unsecured creditor equals or exceeds the creditor\u2019s claim. As to that requirement, the effective-date requirement makes perfect sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Text aside, the Court also observes that Circuit practice prior to the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA), 119 Stat. 23, aligns with the atextual approach the Court adopts today. <em>Ante, </em>at 515-517, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 33-35. That is unsurprising, since the prior version of the relevant provisions was completely consistent with that approach. The Court is correct that BAPCPA \u201cdid not amend the term \u2018projected disposable income,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 517, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 35. But it <em>did </em>amend the <em>definition </em>of that term. Before 2005, \u00a7 1325(b)(2) defined \u201cdisposable income\u201d simply as \u201cincome which is received by the debtor and which is not reasonably necessary to be expended\u201d on the same basic types of expenses excluded by the current statute. \u00a7 1325(b)(2) (2000</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">[560 U.S. 532]</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">ed.). Nothing in that terse definition compelled a court to rely exclusively on past data, let alone a specific 6-month period. But in BAPCPA\u2014the same Act in which Congress defined \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d in \u00a7 101(10A)(A)\u2014Congress redefined \u201cdisposable income\u201d in \u00a7 1325(b)(2) to incorporate that backward-looking definition. See Pub. L. 109-8, \u00a7 102(b), (h), 119 Stat. 32-34. Given these significant changes, the fact that the Court\u2019s approach conforms with pre-BAPCPA practice not only does not recommend it, see, <em>e.g., Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>495 U.S. 552, 563-564, 110 S. Ct. 2126, 109 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1990), but renders it suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">Unable to assemble a compelling case based on what the statute says, the Court falls back on the \u201csenseless results\u201d it would produce\u2014results the Court \u201cdo[es] not think Congress intended.\u201d Ante, at 520, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 37. Even if it were true that a \u201cmechanical\u201d reading resulted in undesirable outcomes, that would make no difference. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Chicago, ante, </em>at 217, 130 S. Ct. 2191, 176 L. Ed. 2d 967. For even assuming (though I do not believe it) that we could know which results Congress thought it was achieving (or avoiding) apart from the only congressional expression of its thoughts, the text, those results would be entirely irrelevant to what the statute means.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">In any event, the effects the Court fears are neither as inevitable nor as \u201csenseless\u201d as the Court portrays. The Court\u2019s first concern is that if actual or anticipated changes in the debtor\u2019s earnings are ignored, then a debtor whose income increases after the critical 6-month window will not be required to pay all he can afford. <em>Ante, </em>at 520, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 37. But as Lanning points out, Brief for Respondent 22-23, Chapter 13 authorizes the Bankruptcy Court, at the request of unsecured creditors, to modify the plan \u201c [a]t any time after confirmation\u201d to \u201cincrease . . . the amount of payments\u201d on a class of claims or \u201creduce the time for such payments.\u201d \u00a7 1329(a)(1)\u2014(2) (2006 ed.). The Court offers no explanation</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">[560 U.S. 533]</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">of why modification would not be available in such instances, and sufficient to resolve the concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">The Court also cringes at the prospect that a debtor whose income sud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>denly <em>declines </em>after the 6-month window or who, as in this case, receives a one-off windfall during that window, will be barred from Chapter 13 relief because he will be unable to devote his \u201cdisposable income\u201d (which turns on his prior earnings) to paying his unsecured creditors going forward. <em>Ante, </em>at 520-521, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 37-38. At least for debtors whose circumstances deteriorate <em>after </em>confirmation, however, the Code already provides an answer. Just as a creditor can request an upward modification in light of postconfirmation developments, so too can a debtor ask for a downward adjustment. \u00a7 1329(a). Cf. \u00a7 1329(b)(1) (requiring that modifications meet requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 1322(a)-(b), 1323(c), and 1325(a), but not \u00a7 1325(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Moreover, even apart from the availability of modification it requires little imagination to see why Congress might want to withhold relief from debtors whose situations have suddenly deteriorated (after or even toward the end of the 6-month window), or who in the midst of dire straits have been blessed (within the 6-month window) by an influx of unusually high income. Bankruptcy protection is not a birthright, and Congress could reasonably conclude that those who have just hit the skids do not yet need a reprieve from repaying their debts; perhaps they will recover. And perhaps the debtor who has received a one-time bonus will thereby be enabled to stay afloat. How long to wait before throwing the debtor a lifeline is inherently a policy choice. Congress confined the calculation of current monthly income to a 6-month period (ordinarily ending before the case is commenced), but it could have picked 2 or 12 months (or a different end date) instead. Whatever the wisdom of the window it chose, we should not assume it did not know what it was doing and accordingly refuse to give effect to its words.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">[560 U.S. 534]</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Even if one insists on making provision for such debtors, the Court is wrong to write off four alternative strategies the trustee suggests, Brief for Petitioner 50-54:</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">\u2022 Presumably some debtors whose income has only recently been reduced, or who have just received a jolt that causes a temporary uptick in their average income, can delay filing a Chapter 13 petition until their \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d catches up with their present circumstances. The Court speculates that delay might \u201cgiv[e] the appearance of bad faith,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 522, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 38 (citing \u00a7 1325(a)(7)), but it offers no explanation of why that is so, and no authority supporting it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\u2022 Even if bad faith were a real worry, or if it were essential to a debtor\u2019s prospects that he invoke \u00a7 362\u2019s automatic stay immediately, the debtor might ask the bankruptcy court to excuse him from filing a statement of current income, so that it determines his \u201ccurrent monthly income\u201d at a later date. See \u00a7 101(10A)(A)(ii). The Court dismisses this alternative, explaining that if the Code requires a mechanical approach this solution would \u201cimproperly undermine\u201d it, and if the Code allows exceptions for changed circumstances the solution is unnecessary. <em>Ante, </em>at 522, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 38. The second premise is correct, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the first is not. Congress does not pursue its purposes at all costs. <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>480 U.S. 522, 525-526, 107 S. Ct. 1391, 94 L. Ed. 2d 533 (1987) <em>(per curiam). </em>Here it may have struck the very balance the Court thinks critical by creating a fixed formula but leaving leeway as to the time to which it applies.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">[560 U.S. 535]</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u2022 A debtor who learns after filing that he will be unable to repay his full projected disposable income might also be able to dismiss his case and refile it later. \u00a7 1307(b). The Court worries that this alternative also might be deemed abusive, again with no pertinent authority for the speculation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Its concern is based primarily on its belief that this \u201ccircumvents the statutory limits on a court\u2019s ability to shift the lookback period.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 523, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 38. That belief is mistaken, both because the Court exaggerates the statutory limitations on adjusting the lookback period, and because, just as it does not defeat the disposable-income formula\u2019s rigidity to allow adjustments regarding the time of determining that figure, it would not undermine the limitations on adjustment applicable in a pending case to allow the debtor to dismiss and refile.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">[560 U.S. 536]</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u2022 A debtor unable to pursue any of these avenues to Chapter 13 might still seek relief under Chapter 7. The Court declares this cold comfort, noting that some debtors\u2014including Lanning\u2014will have incomes <em>too high </em>to qualify for Chapter 7. <em>Ante, </em>at 523-524, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 38-39. Some such debtors, however, may be able to show \u201cspecial circumstances,\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(B), and still take advantage of Chapter 7. Aside from noting the absence of authority on the issue, the Court\u2019s answer is unsatisfyingly circular: It notes that the special-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>circumstances exception is available only if the debtor has \u201cno reasonable alternative,\u201d \u00a7 707(b)(2)(B)(i), which will not be true after today given the Court\u2019s holding that bankruptcy courts can consider changes in a debt- or\u2019s income. As for those who cannot establish special circumstances, it is hard to understand why there is cause for concern. Congress has evidently concluded that such debtors do not need the last-ditch relief of liquidation, and that they are not suitable candidates for repaying their debts (at least in part) under Chapter 13\u2019s protective umbrella. We have neither reason nor warrant to second-guess either determination.</p>\n<p id=\"pAar\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"38\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQkAAAAmAQAAAAD/nlOeAAAAkklEQVR4nOXTsQ3CMBQE0POlCCUFA2SQDJA9WIAR8G6UZIcUDEAbRbIp/0mc5BQUCH73Tqev78KpojGZrQbwr5WiNiCwaWrwqVtqfgQdiHLTAw0ILossNSDS5R6pA4HzU5YbpIq1l/QdmcB8ldSAwHSQ1ICoxzFCB6IMQ6QORDeeInXY96LW7Kvoaocv+yQ/VnkB5U83nUf27jEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"265\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Underlying the Court\u2019s interpretation is an understandable urge: Sometimes the best reading of a text yields results that one thinks must be a mistake, and bending that reading just a little bit will allow all the pieces to fit together. But taking liberties with text in light of outcome makes sense only if we assume that we know better than Congress which outcomes are mistaken. And by refusing to hold that Congress meant what it said, but see <em>Connecticut Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 253-254, 112 S. Ct. 1146, 117 L. Ed. 2d 391(1992), we deprive it of the</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">[560 U.S. 537]</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">ability to say what it means in the future. It may be that no interpretation of \u00a7 1325(b)(1)(B) is entirely satisfying. But it is in the hard cases, even more than the easy ones, that we should faithfully apply our settled interpretive principles, and trust that Congress will correct the law if what it previously prescribed is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-16\">. If the debtor files a schedule of current income, as ordinarily required by \u00a7 521(a)(1)(B)(ii), then the 6-month period ends on the last day of the month preceding the date the case is commenced, \u00a7 101(10A)(A)(i)\u2014that is, when the petition is filed, \u00a7\u00a7 301(a), 302(a), 303(b). If the debtor does not file such a schedule on time\u2014which the bankruptcy court apparently may excuse him from doing, \u00a7 521(a)(1)(B)(ii)\u2014the 6-month period ends on the date the bankruptcy court determines the debtor\u2019s current income. \u00a7 101(10A)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b88-9\">. Of course, since the number of months in the commitment period may vary, Congress could not simply have substituted a single word, but would have had to write \u201cdisposable income multiplied by the number of months in the applicable commitment period\u2019\u2019 or some such phrase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-14\">.

Neither of the two Court of Appeals cases the Court <em>cites\u2014In re Myers, </em>491 F.3d 120, 125 (CA3 2007), and <em>Neufeld </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>794 F.2d 149, 153 (CA4 1986)\u2014involved a debtor\u2019s delaying his petition until his circumstances would permit the court to confirm a repayment plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\">. The Court observes that not every debtor will benefit from this exception, <em>ante, </em>at 522, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 38, and n. 6, since \u00a7 52l(i)(3) provides that a bankruptcy court may not grant a request (which may be made <em>after </em>the deadline for filing the current-income schedule) for an extension of more than 45 days to file such a schedule. But the statute appears to assume that a court may excuse the filing of such a schedule altogether: A debtor is required to file a schedule in the first instance <em>\u201cunless </em>the court orders otherwise,\u201d \u00a7 521(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). And \u00a7 101(10A)(A)(ii)\u2019s provision of a method for calculating current monthly income \u201cif the debtor does not file the schedule of current income required by section 521(a)(1)(B)(ii)\u201d makes little sense unless a court can excuse the failure to do so, since an <em>unexcused </em>failure to do so would be a basis for dismissing the case, see \u00a7 521(i). Allowing courts to excuse such schedules does not render superfluous \u00a7 521(i)(3)\u2019s authorization for limited extensions, since that applies to extensions sought up to 45 days <em>after </em>the filing deadline, whereas \u00a7 521(a)(1)(B) seems to apply only <em>before </em>the deadline.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b92-10\">. The sole authority the Court supplies\u2014a single Bankruptcy Court decision predating BAPCPA\u2014provides no support. See <em>In re Glenn, </em>288 B.R. 516, 519-521 (ED Term. 2002). Although acknowledging that \u201c[m]ultiple filings by a debtor are not, in and of themselves, improper,\u201d the court did note that \u201cwhether this is the first or subsequent filin[g]\u201d by the debtor is one among the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d to be considered in a good-faith analysis. <em>Id., </em>at 520 (internal quotation marks omitted). The debtor in the case at hand had filed three previous Chapter 13 petitions, \u201ceach on the eve of a scheduled foreclosure,\u201d and according to the court \u201cnever had any intention of following through with any of the Chapter 13 cases,\u201d but had used the bankruptcy process \u201cto hold [his creditor] hostage, while remaining in his residence without paying for it.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 520-521.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\">. The Court also notes that the Code precludes a debtor who has had a case pending in the last 180 days from refiling if his prior case was dismissed because he willfully failed to obey the court\u2019s orders or to appear before the court, \u00a7 109(g)(1), or if he voluntarily dismissed the prior suit \u201cfollowing the filing of a request for relief from the automatic stay\u201d under \u00a7 362, \u00a7 109(g)(2). <em>Ante, </em>at 523, n. 7, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 39. But the Court does not explain why these barriers have any bearing on whether refiling for bankruptcy would be abusive when the barriers <em>do not apply.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
