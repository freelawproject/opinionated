In June 2005, the District Court accepted respondent\u2019s plea and adjudged him delinquent. The court sentenced respondent to two years\u2019 official detention and juvenile delinquent supervision until his 21st birthday. The court also ordered respondent to spend the first six months of his juvenile supervision in a prere-lease center and to abide by the center\u2019s conditions of residency.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-20\">In 2006, Congress enacted the Sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 120 Stat. 590, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 16901 <em>et seq. </em>With respect to juvenile offenders, SORNA requires individuals who have been adjudicated delinquent for certain serious sex offenses to register and to keep their registrations current in each jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school. \u00a7\u00a7 16911(8); 16913. In February 2007, the Attorney General issued an interim rule specifying that SORNA\u2019s requirements \u201capply to all sex offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required prior to the enactment of [SORNA].\u201d 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR \u00a772.3 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In July 2007, the District Court revoked respondent\u2019s juvenile supervision, finding that respondent had failed to comply with the requirements of the prerelease program. The court sentenced respondent to an additional 6-month term of official detention, to be followed by a period of supervision until his 21st birthday. The Government, invoking SORNA\u2019s juvenile registration provisions, argued that respondent should be required to register as a sex offender, at</p>\n<p id=\"ACR\">[560 U.S. 560]</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">least for the duration of his juvenile supervision. As \u201cspecial conditions\u201d of his supervision, the court ordered respondent to register as a sex offender and to keep his registration current. App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The Ninth Circuit vacated the sex-offender-registration requirements of the District Court\u2019s order. 590 F.3d 924 (2010). The Court of Appeals determined that \u201cretroactive application of SORNA\u2019s provision covering individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents because of the commission of certain sex offenses before SORNA\u2019s passage violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 927. The court thus held that \u201cSORNA\u2019s juvenile registration provision may not be applied retroactively to individuals adjudicated delinquent under the [FJDA].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The United States asks us to grant certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit\u2019s determination that SORNA violates the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause as applied to individuals who were adjudicated juvenile delinquents under the FJDA prior to SORNA\u2019s enactment. Before we can address that question, however, we must resolve a threshold issue of mootness. Before the Ninth Circuit, respondent challenged only the conditions of his juvenile supervision requiring him to register as a sex offender. But on May 2, 2008, respondent\u2019s term of supervision expired, and thus he no longer is subject to those sex-offender-registration conditions. As such, this case likely is moot unless respondent can show that a decision invalidating the sex-offender-registration conditions of his juvenile supervision would be sufficiently likely to redress \u201ccollateral consequences adequate to meet Article Ill\u2019s injury-in-fact requirement.\u201d <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 14, 118 S. Ct. 978, 140 L. Ed. 2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Perhaps the most likely potential \u201ccollateral consequenc[e]\u201d that might be remedied by a judgment in respondent\u2019s favor is the requirement that respondent remain registered</p>\n<p id=\"anl-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 561]</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">as a sex offender under Montana law. (\u201cBy the time of the court of appeals\u2019 decision, respondent had become registered as a sex offender in Montana, where he continues to be registered today.\u201d Pet. for Cert. 29.) We thus must know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>whether a favorable decision in this case would make it sufficiently likely that respondent \u201ccould remove his name and identifying information from the Montana sex offender registry.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, we certify the following question to the Supreme Court of Montana, pursuant to Montana Rule of Appellate Procedure 15 (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">Is respondent\u2019s duty to remain registered as a sex offender under Montana law contingent upon the validity of the conditions of his now-expired federal juvenile-supervision order that required him to register as a sex offender, see Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-502(6)(b), 41\u20145\u20141513(1)(c) (2005); <em>State </em>v. <em>Villanueva, </em>328 Mont. 135, 138-140, 118 P.3d 179, 181-182 (2005); see also \u00a7 46-23-502(9)(b) (2009), or is the duty an independent requirement of Montana law that is unaffected by the validity or invalidity of the federal juvenile-supervision conditions, see \u00a7 46-23-502(10) (2009); 2007 Mont. Laws ch. 483, \u00a7 31, p. 2185?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We respectfully request that the Montana Supreme Court accept our certified question. The court\u2019s answer to this question will help determine whether this case presents a live case or controversy, and there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision, or statute on point. Mont. Rule App. Proc. 15(3). We understand that the Montana Supreme Court may wish to reformulate the certified question. Rule 15(6)(a)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The Clerk of this Court is directed to transmit to the Supreme Court of Montana a copy of this opinion, the briefs filed in this Court in this case, and a list of the counsel appearing in this matter along with their names and addresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">[560 U.S. 562]</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">See Rules 15(5) and (6)(a)(iv). Further proceedings in this case are reserved pending our receipt of a response from the Supreme Court of Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
