Congress has provided an exception to that rule \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In those circumstances, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes a court to reduce the term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>imprisonment \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with\u201d applicable Commission policy statements. The policy statement governing \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings instructs courts not to reduce a term of imprisonment below the minimum of an amended sentencing range except to the extent the original term of imprisonment was below the range then applicable. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) (Nov. 2009) (USSG). This case presents the question whether our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005), which rendered the Guidelines advisory to remedy the Sixth Amendment problems associated with a mandatory sentencing regime, requires treating \u00a7 1B1.10(b) as nonbinding. We conclude that <em>Booker </em>does not demand that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">[560 U.S. 820]</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA or Act), 98 Stat. 1987, established the Sentencing Commission and authorized it to promulgate Sentencing Guidelines and to issue policy statements regarding the Guidelines\u2019 application. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 991, 994(a). The Act also charged the Commission with periodically reviewing and revising the Guidelines. See \u00a7 994(o). When a revision reduces the Guidelines range for a given offense, the Commission must determine \u201cin what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.\u201d \u00a7 994(u).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">As enacted, the SRA made the Sentencing Guidelines binding. See <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S., at 233-234, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Except in limited circumstances, district courts lacked discretion to depart from the Guidelines range. See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>United States, </em>501 U.S. 129, 133, 111 S. Ct. 2182, 115 L. Ed. 2d 123 (1991). Under that regime, facts found by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence often increased the mandatory Guidelines range and permitted the judge to impose a sentence greater than that supported by the facts established by the jury verdict or guilty plea. See <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S., at 235, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. We held in <em>Booker </em>that treating the Guidelines as mandatory in these circumstances violated the Sixth Amendment right of criminal defendants to be tried by a jury and to have every element of an offense proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id., </em>at 243-244, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">To remedy the constitutional problem, we rendered the Guidelines advisory by invalidating two provisions of the SRA: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which generally required a sentencing court to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range, and \u00a7 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which prescribed the standard of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of Guidelines departures. 543 U.S., at 259, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. \u201cWith these two sections excised (and statutory cross-references to the two sections consequently invalidated),\u201d we held that \u201cthe remainder of the Act</p>\n<p id=\"a6m-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 821]</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">satisfies the Court\u2019s constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>Ibid. Booker </em>thus left intact other provisions of the SRA, including those giving the Commission authority to revise the Guidelines, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o) (2006 ed.), and to determine when and to what extent a revision will be retroactive, \u00a7 994(u).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">With respect to drug-trafficking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>offenses, the Sentencing Guidelines establish a defendant\u2019s base offense level according to the type and weight of the drug. See USSG \u00a7\u00a72D1.1(a), (c). When the Commission first promulgated the Guidelines in 1987, it adopted the 100-to-l ratio selected by Congress in setting mandatory minimum sentences in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 3207. Under that framework, the Commission \u201ctreated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of 100 grams of powder cocaine.\u201d <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 96, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481 (2007). The Commission later sought to alleviate the disparity produced by this ratio. After several failed attempts at reform, see <em>id., </em>at 99, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481, the Commission in 2007 amended the Guidelines to reduce by two levels the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack cocaine. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (effective Nov. 1, 2007). In 2008, the Commission made that amendment retroactive. See <em>id., </em>Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">When the Commission makes a Guidelines amendment retroactive, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes a district court to reduce an otherwise final sentence that is based on the amended provision. Any reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. The relevant policy statement, USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, instructs courts proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to substitute the amended Guidelines range while \u201cleavfing] all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">[560 U.S. 822]</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a court may then grant a reduction within the amended Guidelines range if it determines that one is warranted \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Except in limited circumstances, however, \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) forecloses a court acting under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) from reducing a sentence \u201cto a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">A jury convicted petitioner Percy Dillon in 1993 of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute more than 500 grams of powder cocaine and more than 50 grams of crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, possession with the intent to distribute more than 500 grams of powder cocaine in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1), and use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). Dillon\u2019s convictions exposed him to a statutory sentencing range of 10 years to life for the conspiracy, 5 to 40 years for cocaine possession, and a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for the firearm offense, to be served consecutively to the sentence for the drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>At sentencing, the District Court made additional findings of fact and concluded that Dillon was responsible for 1.5 kilograms of crack and 1.6 kilograms of powder cocaine. Under USSG \u00a7 2D 1.1, those drug quantities produced a base offense level of 38. After offsetting adjustments for acceptance of</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">[560 U.S. 823]</p>\n<p id=\"AGP\">responsibility, \u00a7 3E1.1, and reckless endangerment during flight, \u00a7 3C1.2, Dillon\u2019s total offense level remained 38. Coupled with a criminal-history category of II,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that offense level produced a then-mandatory Guidelines range of 262 to 327 months\u2019 imprisonment for the drug counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The court sentenced Dillon at the bottom of the Guidelines range for those counts, followed by a mandatory 60-month sentence for the firearm count, for a total sentence of 322 months\u2019 imprisonment. At Dillon\u2019s sentencing, the court described the term of imprisonment as \u201centirely too high for the crime [Dillon] committed.\u201d App. 13. Perceiving no basis for departing from the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, the District Court felt constrained to impose a sentence within the prescribed range. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed Dillon\u2019s convictions and sentence on appeal. See 100 F.3d 949 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">After the Sentencing Commission made the amendment to the crack-cocaine Guidelines retroactive in 2008, Dillon filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In the motion, Dillon asked the court to grant not just the two-level reduction authorized by the amendment but also a further reduction consistent with the sentencing factors found in \u00a7 3553(a). Based largely on his postsentencing conduct, including his determined pursuit of educational and community-outreach opportunities, Dillon contended that a variance from the amended Guidelines range was warranted in his case. He further urged that, after <em>Booker, </em>the court was authorized to grant such a variance because the amended Guidelines range was advisory notwithstanding any contrary statement in \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The District Court reduced Dillon\u2019s sentence to 270 months\u2014the term at the bottom of the revised Guidelines</p>\n<p id=\"A0CA\">[560 U.S. 824]</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">range.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But the court declined to go further. Concluding that the sentencing proceedings at issue in <em>Booker </em>are readily distinguishable from those under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the court found <em>Booker\u2019s </em>holdings inapplicable to the instant proceeding and accordingly held that it lacked authority to impose a sentence inconsistent with \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The Third Circuit affirmed. 572 F.3d 146, 150 (2009). The court noted that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is codified in a different section than the provisions invalidated in <em>Booker </em>and contains no cross-reference to those provisions. Finding no other indication that <em>Booker </em>\u201cobviate [d] the congressional directive in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) that a sentence reduction pursuant to that section be consistent with Sentencing Commission policy statements,\u201d 572 F.3d, at 149, the Third Circuit held that \u00a7 1B1.10 is binding. It therefore agreed that the District Court lacked authority to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>duce Dillon\u2019s sentence below the amended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">We granted certiorari to consider Booker\u2019s applicability to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. 558 U.S. 1076, 130 S. Ct. 797, 175 L. Ed. 2d 559 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u201c[A] judgment of conviction that includes [a sentence of imprisonment] constitutes a final judgment\u201d and may not be modified by a district court except in limited circumstances. \u00a7 3582(b). Section 3582(c)(2) establishes an exception to the general rule of finality \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o)\u201d and made retroactive pursuant to \u00a7 994(u). In such cases, Congress has authorized courts to \u201creduce the term of imprisonment,</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">[560 U.S. 825]</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">Characterizing proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as \u201cresentencing\u201d proceedings, Dillon contends that \u201c[t]here is no practical or functional difference between a resentencing pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and any other resentencing.\u201d Brief for Petitioner 18. Accordingly, Dillon urges, the same principles that govern other sentencing proceedings likewise govern \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, and courts have authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to vary from the revised Guidelines range consistent with \u00a7 3553(a), see <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S., at 101, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481. Dillon cites as support for this view \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s instruction to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in determining whether a sentence reduction is warranted. Under Dillon\u2019s approach, <em>Booker </em>would preclude the Commission from issuing a policy statement that generally forecloses below-Guidelines sentences at \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, as USSG \u00a7 IB 1.10 purports to do. Dillon thus asks us to excise the mandatory language of \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A) and treat that provision as advisory, just as we did the offending statutory provisions in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">The language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) belies Dillon\u2019s characterization of proceedings under that section.  By its terms, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a sentencing or resentencing proceeding. Instead, it provides for the \u201cmodif[ication of] a term of imprisonment\u201d by giving courts the power to \u201creduce\u201d an otherwise final sentence in circumstances specified by the Commission. Compare 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(2)(C) (referring to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as a \u201csentence modification provisio[n]\u201d) with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(f) (authorizing courts of appeals to remand \u201cfor further sentencing\u201d upon a finding of error) and \u00a7 3742(g) (establishing the terms of \u201csentencing upon remand\u201d and describing the proceeding as a \u201cresentencing]\u201d (capitalization omitted)). It is also notable that the provision applies only to a limited class of prisoners\u2014namely,</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">[560 U.S. 826]</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">those whose sentence was based on a sentencing range subsequently lowered by the Commission. Section 3582(c)(2)\u2019s text, together with its narrow scope, shows that Congress intended to authorize only a limited adjustment to an otherwise final sentence and not a plenary resentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The substantial role Congress gave the Commission with respect to sentence-modification proceedings further supports this conclusion. The SRA charges the Commission both with deciding whether to amend the Guidelines, \u00a7 994(o), and with determining whether and to what extent an amendment will be retroactive, \u00a7 994(u).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n                   A court\u2019s power under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) thus depends in the first instance on the Commission\u2019s decision not just to amend the Guidelines but to make the amendment retroactive. The court is also constrained by the Commission\u2019s statements dictating \u201cby what amount\u201d the sentence of a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment affected by the amendment \u201cmay be reduced.\u201d \u00a7 994(u); see also <em>Braxton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>500 U.S. 344, 348, 111 S. Ct. 1854, 114 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1991) (noting that the Commission implemented that power through \u00a7 1B1.10).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Read in this context, \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2019s reference to \u00a7 3553(a) does not undermine our narrow view of proceedings under the former provision.  Section 3582(c)(2) instructs a district court to \u201cconside[r] the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d but it authorizes a reduction on that basis only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d\u2014 namely, \u00a7 1B1.10. The statute thus establishes a two-step inquiry. A court must first determine that a reduction is consistent with \u00a7 1B1.10 before it may consider whether the authorized reduction is warranted, either in whole or in part, according to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">[560 U.S. 827]</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Following this two-step approach, a district court proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not impose a new sentence in the usual sense. At step one, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) requires the court to follow the Commission\u2019s instructions in \u00a7 1B1.10 to determine the prisoner\u2019s eligibility for a sentence modification and the extent of the reduction authorized. Specifically, \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1) requires the court to begin by \u201cdeterminting] the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant\u201d had the relevant amendment been in effect at the time of the initial sentencing. \u201cIn making such determination, the court shall substitute only the amendments listed in subsection (c) for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Consistent with the limited nature of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) also confines the extent of the reduction authorized. Courts generally may \u201cnot reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) ... to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range\u201d produced by the substitution. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). Only if the sentencing court originally imposed a term of imprisonment below the Guidelines range does \u00a7 1B1.10 authorize a court proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to impose a term \u201ccomparably\u201d below the amended range. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">At step two of the inquiry, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) instructs a court to consider any applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determine whether, in its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tion, the reduction authorized by reference to the policies relevant at step one is warranted in whole or in part under the particular circumstances of the case. Because reference to \u00a7 3553(a) is appropriate only at the second step of this circumscribed inquiry, it cannot serve to transform the proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) into plenary resentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">This understanding of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) as a narrow exception to the rule of finality finds further support outside the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">[560 U.S. 828]</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 requires that a defendant be present at \u201csentencing,\u201d see Rule 43(a)(3), but it excludes from that requirement proceedings that \u201cinvolv[e] the correction or reduction of sentence under Rule 35 or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c),\u201d Rule 43(b)(4). Like \u00a7 3582(c)(2), Rule 35 delineates a limited set of circumstances in which a sentence may be corrected or reduced. Specifically, it authorizes a court to \u201ccorrect a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d within 14 days after sentencing, Rule 35(a), and it authorizes a reduction for substantial assistance on the Government\u2019s motion, Rule 35(b). Rule 43 therefore sets the proceedings authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Rule 35 apart from other sentencing proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Given the limited scope and purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we conclude that proceedings under that section do not implicate the interests identified in <em>Booker. </em>Notably, the sentence-modification proceedings authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not constitutionally compelled. We are aware of no constitutional requirement of retroactivity that entitles defendants sentenced to a term of imprisonment to the benefit of subsequent Guidelines amendments. Rather, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) represents a congressional act of lenity intended to give prisoners the benefit of later enacted adjustments to the judgments reflected in the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Viewed that way,  proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) do not implicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a judge at a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding do not serve to increase the prescribed range of punishment; instead, they affect only the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion within that range. \u201c[J]udges in this country have long exercised discretion of this nature in imposing sentence <em>within [established] limits </em>in the individual case,\u201d and the exercise of such discretion does not</p>\n<p id=\"amq-dedup-0\">[560 U.S. 829]</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">contravene the Sixth Amendment even if it is informed by judge-found facts. <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 481, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000) (emphasis in original). Because \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings give judges no more than this circumscribed discretion, \u201c[t]here is no encroachment here by the judge upon facts historically found by the jury, nor any threat to the jury\u2019s domain as a bulwark at trial between the State and the accused.\u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Ice, </em>555 U.S. 160, 169, 129 S. Ct. 711, 172 L. Ed. 2d 517 (2009). Accordingly, Dillon\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the District Court\u2019s adherence to the instruction in \u00a7 1B1.10 to consider a reduction only within the amended Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Dillon contends that, even if \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not implicate the constitutional rights vindicated in Booker\u2014something the dissent ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>pears to concede\u2014the remedial aspect of the Court\u2019s decision applies to proceedings under that section and requires that the Guidelines be treated as advisory in such proceedings just as they are in other sentencing proceedings. In support of his position, Dillon invokes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>472 F.3d 1167, 1170 (2007).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Relying on our rejection in <em>Booker </em>of a remedy that would have made the Guidelines advisory only in certain cases\u2014 namely, when treating them as binding would run afoul of the Sixth Amendment, see 543 U.S., at 265-267, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621\u2014the Ninth Circuit held that <em>Booker </em>precludes treating the Guidelines as mandatory for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and advisory in other contexts, see <em>Hicks, </em>472 F.3d, at 1171-1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">This argument is unpersuasive. The incomplete remedy we rejected in <em>Booker </em>would have required courts to treat the Guidelines differently in similar proceedings, leading potentially to unfair results and considerable administrative</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">[560 U.S. 830]</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">challenges. See 543 U.S., at 266, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. As already explained,  the sentence-modification proceedings authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are readily distinguishable from other sentencing proceedings. Given the substantially different purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the circumscribed nature of proceedings under that section, requiring courts to honor \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)\u2019s instruction not to depart from the amended Guidelines range at such proceedings will create none of the confusion or unfairness that led us in <em>Booker </em>to reject the Government\u2019s argument for a partial fix.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The dissent\u2019s contrary conclusion rests on two erroneous premises. First, the dissent ignores the fundamental differences between sentencing and sentence-modification proceedings and asserts without explanation that \u201c[n]othing turns on\u201d the distinction between them. <em>Post, </em>at 841, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 293. For the reasons stated above, the statutory differences between the proceedings are highly significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Second, the dissent gives short shrift to the fact that, after <em>Booker, </em>the Commission retains at least some authority to bind the courts.  Through \u00a7 994(u), Congress charged the Commission with determining \u201cin what circumstances and by what amount\u201d the sentences of prisoners affected by Guidelines amendments \u201cmay be reduced.\u201d No one disputes that the Commission\u2019s retroactivity determinations made pursuant to the first part of that authorization are binding. See <em>post, </em>at 846-847, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 296-297, and n. 8. This aspect of the Commission\u2019s power emphatically undermines the dissent\u2019s insistence that the Guidelines after <em>Booker </em>are \u201ccompletely advisory.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 839, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 292. Moreover, while the dissent criticizes our approach for leaving the Commission with only \u201cthe tiniest sliver of lawmaking power,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 841, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 293, the dissent would leave the Commission with an even smaller and less explicable sliver by dissecting the authority granted by \u00a7 994(u).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">For all of these reasons, we conclude that neither <em>Booker\u2019s </em>constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>tional nor remedial holding requires the result that Dillon urges.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">[560 U.S. 831]</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Dillon additionally contends that the District Court erred in failing to correct two mistakes in his original sentence. Under his view of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court is required to recalculate a defendant\u2019s sentence. Thus, any mistakes committed at the initial sentencing are imposed anew if they are not corrected. According to Dillon, the District Court in the instant proceeding should have corrected the <em>Booker </em>error that resulted from the initial sentencing court\u2019s treatment of the Guidelines as mandatory, and it should have adjusted his criminal-history category, which he now contends was erroneously inflated.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Dillon\u2019s arguments in this regard are premised on the same misunderstanding of the scope of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings dispelled above. As noted,  \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a resentencing. Instead, it permits a sentence reduction within the narrow bounds established by the Commission. The relevant policy statement instructs that a court proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cshall substitute\u201d the amended Guidelines range for the initial range \u201cand shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\u201d \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). Because the aspects of his sentence that Dillon seeks to correct were not affected by the Commission\u2019s amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1, they are outside the scope of the proceeding authorized by \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and the District Court properly declined to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"pAYm\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"30\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAT4AAAAeAQAAAACdmE8fAAAAkUlEQVR4nGP8z0AU+MtEnDoGBtop/IcsiI0DU/gbWQ4bh2Zu/N/4BCGGlQNV+O8IkmasHKhCpgcPkGzBxoEqZCw4g5DDyoF5JvkDknXYOIzQRPGTHUkOCweeKM42IMlh48AUenAgyWHjwMJRwAYhhZUDC0cFBYQcVg5UIbONCEIOK4dkXxMERCtkHEK5cDArBACgiTrnrfUS8wAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"318\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">Justice Alito took no part in the decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-10\">.

Bound by a sentencing regime that was mandatory at the time, the judge had no choice but to sentence Dillon to 322 months of imprisonment\u2014nearly 27 years behind bars. The judge later explained that, were it within his discretion, he would have sentenced Dillon to five years of imprisonment. <em>Id., </em>at 62. Had Dillon been sentenced after our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2005), the judge would have had substantially more discretion. Instead, the District Court was compelled to mete out a punishment that it believed to be grossly disproportionate to the offense and, therefore, \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to meet the goals of our criminal justice system, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-18\">The punishment Dillon received was so high, in part, because at the time of his conviction our drug laws punished crack cocaine offenses 100 times more severely than powder cocaine offenses. In 2007, as the Court explains, see <em>ante, </em>at 821, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 280-281, the United States Sentencing Commission pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>posed a partial fix to this disparity, lowering its Guidelines Manual<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ranges for crack cocaine offenses to as high as a 20:1 ratio. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual Supp. App. C, Amdt. 706 (Nov. 2009) (USSG) (effective Nov. 1, 2007). Pursuant to its congressional mandate, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(u), the Commission made this change retroactive for those individuals, like Dillon, who were still serving sentences for crack cocaine offenses. See USSG Supp. App. C, Amdt. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">[560 U.S. 833]</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Although Dillon does not have a constitutional right to obtain the benefit of the Commission\u2019s change, it is undisputed that he has a statutory right to do so. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a federal prisoner \u201cwho has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d by the Commission may seek a sentence reduction, but only after the court \u201cconsider[s] the factors set forth in section 3553(a),\u201d and only \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Dillon sought such relief. His 322-month sentence was reduced to a 270-month sentence\u2014still 17 years more than the sentencing judge thought necessary as an initial matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, Dillon alleged that his circumstances warranted an additional reduction in light of the fact that his sentence was \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to effectuate the goals of our sentencing system, \u00a7 3553(a). He also emphasized that he has been a model inmate during his 17 years in federal prison. Once again, however, the District Court felt that its hands were tied, this time because USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) purports to place a mandatory limit on the extent of any sentence reduction that a court may order pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). And so, giving the Commission\u2019s statement the effect of law, the District Court denied Dillon further relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Today, the Court holds that in this one limited nook of sentencing law, the Commission retains the power to bind judges that we struck down in <em>Booker. </em>In my view, the Court\u2019s decision to treat the Commission\u2019s policy statement as a mandatory command rather than an advisory recommendation is unfaithful to <em>Booker. </em>It is also on dubious constitutional footing, as it permits the Commission to exercise a barely constrained form of lawmaking authority. And it is manifestly unjust. I would therefore hold that in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence modification proceeding, the</p>\n<p id=\"A0d\">[560 U.S. 834]</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">District Court may consider, but is not bound by, any applicable policy statements promulgated by the Commission. In other words, I would apply Booker\u2019s remedial holding to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b334-12\">Although I did not join Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion for the Court in <em>Booker, </em>it is nevertheless clear to me that its scope applies to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>As an initial matter, it is of no moment that the <em>Booker </em>Court did not excise any portion of \u00a7 3582 when crafting its remedy. At the time, there was nothing in \u00a7 3582(c)(2)\u2014separate and apart from the Guidelines\u2019 general mandatory nature\u2014that would have limited the District Court\u2019s discretion in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. There was, consequently, nothing that needed excising. Relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is available if it is \u201cconsistent with\u201d the Commission\u2019s related policy statement. And when we decided <em>Booker, </em>the particular policy statement at issue, \u00a7 1B1.10(b), had no explicit binding effect.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Prior to our decision in <em>Booker, </em>the Guidelines were mandatory only by virtue of congressional mandate, and not by</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">[560 U.S. 835]</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">virtue of Commission decree. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1). Following <em>Booker, </em>the Commission\u2019s policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10 took effect in March 2008. That statement, I will explain more fully in Part II, <em>infra, </em>is now the only source of binding authority in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, as it purports to have the effect of reinstating a mandatory Guidelines regime within the context of a sentence modification proceeding. It is now the Commission\u2019s <em>policy statement, </em>and not an explicit congressional mandate, that makes the Guidelines ranges binding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">As a matter of textual analysis, divorced from judicial precedent, it is certainly reasonable for the Court to find that the Commission can set mandatory limits on sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). But it is a mistake, in my view, to take such a narrow approach to the question presented by this case. The Court has turned a blind eye to the fundamental sea change that was our decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">It is useful to put <em>Booker </em>in context. During the deliberations that led to the enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 <em>et seq., </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991 <em>et seq., </em>Congress considered\u2014and rejected\u2014a proposal that would have made the Guidelines only advisory. See <em>Mistretta </em>v. <em>United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 387, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1989). Ultimately, the decision to authorize the Commission to issue rules that \u201chave the force and effect of laws\u201d generated a serious debate over the constitutionality of the Commission itself. See <em>id., </em>at 413, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">While we resolved that constitutional debate in the Commission\u2019s favor in <em>Mistretta, </em>it became apparent during the next two decades that the mandatory character of the Guidelines, coupled with the practice of judicial factfinding, not only produced a host of excessively severe sentences but also created an unacceptable risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of depriving defendants of longsettled constitutional protections. See, <em>e.g., Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S. Ct. 2348, 147 L. Ed. 2d 435 (2000) (holding that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases</p>\n<p id=\"AtS\">[560 U.S. 836]</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Ring </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 602, 122 S. Ct. 2428, 153 L. Ed. 2d 556 (2002) (holding that \u201c[i]f a State makes an increase in a defendant\u2019s authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact\u2014no matter how the State labels it\u2014must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d); <em>Blakely </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 304, 124 S. Ct. 2531, 159 L. Ed. 2d 403 (2004) (holding that \u201c[w]hen a judge inflicts punishment that the jury\u2019s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts \u2018which the law makes essential to the punishment,\u2019 and the judge exceeds his proper authority\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Over a series of cases, we arrived at our present understanding of determinate sentencing schemes: They are constitutionally infirm if they mandate enhanced punishments based on facts found only by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence. By restoring the principles outlined in landmark cases such as <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny fundamentally changed the landscape of modern sentencing law,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and in so doing paved the way for <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The <em>Booker </em>Court considered whether the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s mandatory determinate sentencing scheme infringed the jury-trial right. In the first of two opinions, we held that the two applications of the Guidelines before us violated the Sixth Amendment because the sentencing judge in each case imposed a more severe sentence than the facts found by the jury warranted. 543 U.S., at 235, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. We recognized that if the Guidelines \u201ccould be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">[560 U.S. 837]</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\"><em>Id., </em>at 233, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. But we rejected such an advisory reading of the Guidelines, as they then stood. <em>Id., </em>at 234, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. To satisfy constitutional guarantees, we explained that any fact that has the effect of increasing the mandatory range must be \u201cestablished by a plea of guilty or . . . must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 244, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Otherwise, the sentence would violate the Sixth (and the Fifth) Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">In light of the potential for mandatory Guidelines sentences to violate the Constitution, the Court had to elect among possible remedies. As I explained in my dissent from the Court\u2019s second <em>Booker </em>opinion (the remedial one), there was no need to find <em>any </em>constitutional infirmity in <em>any </em>provision of the Sentencing Reform Act to provide relief for the defendants in <em>Booker, </em>or to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Guidelines in a mandatory fashion in future cases\u2014so long as juries were allowed to decide the factual issues raised by requests for enhanced sentences. See <em>id., </em>at 272-303, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621 (opinion dissenting in part). Notwithstanding the fact that the Court <em>could </em>have retained the Guidelines\u2019 mandatory prescriptive effect in a manner consonant with the jury-trial right, the Court nevertheless adopted a broad remedy that recast the Guidelines in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">That change did not respond to a determination that the mandatory Guidelines regime itself violated the Sixth Amendment. Neither my opinion for the Court with respect to our constitutional holding, nor Justice Breyer\u2019s remedial opinion, contained any such determination. Instead, the Court\u2019s decision to make the Guidelines discretionary rested entirely on the majority\u2019s judgment that Congress would have preferred that result to either an increase in the jury\u2019s role in making factual findings or a decision invalidating the entire regime. <em>Id., </em>at 249, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. When Congress was wrestling with the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, it did not foresee <em>Apprendi, Ring, </em>and <em>Blakely. </em>The Court made a policy-based prediction that, were Congress to have had such</p>\n<p id=\"AnG\">[560 U.S. 838]</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">foresight, it would not have elected\u2014in any respect\u2014a mandatory sentencing regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The Court openly acknowledged this methodology:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201cIn essence, in what follows, we explain both (1) why Congress would likely have preferred the total invalidation of the Act to an Act with the Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment requirement engrafted onto it, and (2) why Congress would likely have preferred the excision of some of the Act, namely the Act\u2019s mandatory language, to the invalidation of the entire Act. That is to say, in light of today\u2019s holding, we compare maintaining the Act as written with jury factfinding added (the dissenters\u2019 proposed remedy) to the total invalidation of the statute, and conclude that Congress would have preferred the latter. We then compare our own remedy to the total invalidation of the statute, and conclude that Congress would have preferred our remedy.\u201d 543 U.S., at 249, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Thus, rather than \u201cmaintaining the Act as written with jury factfinding added,\u201d <em>ibid.., </em>the Court opted to alter the Commission\u2019s power in a more fundamental way: It did away with a fixed, determinate sentencing regime based on mandatory Guidelines. Henceforth the Commission would guide and advise federal courts in the exercise of their sentencing authority. But the Commission would not bind.</p>\n<p id=\"A0_S\">The Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u201cWe answer the question of remedy by finding the provision of the federal sentencing statute that makes the Guidelines mandatory, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (Supp. IV), incompatible with today\u2019s constitutional holding. We conclude that this provision must be severed and excised, as must one other statutory section, \u00a7 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which depends upon the Guidelines\u2019 mandatory nature. So modified, the federal sentencing statute, see Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Sentencing Act), as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551 <em>et seq.,</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">[560 U.S. 839]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 991 <em>et seq., </em>makes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Guidelines effectively advisory. It requires a sentencing court to consider Guidelines ranges, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) (Supp. IV), but it permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well, see \u00a7 <em>3553(a).\u201dId., </em>at 245-246, 125 S.

Nothing turns on whether the proceeding is best understood as a resentencing or as a sentence modification procedure. Nor is it relevant that Dillon has no right to be present at a proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), <em>ante, </em>at 828, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 285, or that a sentence reduction proceeding may not be \u201cconstitutionally compelled,\u201d <em>ibid. </em>The Court\u2019s general reliance on <em>Booker </em>in this case, see <em>ante, </em>at 830, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 286-287, is odd because the <em>Booker </em>Court explained its belief \u201cthat Congress would not have authorized a mandatory system in some cases and a nonmandatory system in others,\u201d 543 U.S., at 266, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621. Yet, this is precisely the system the Court approves today.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Approaching this case as the <em>Booker </em>Court did, one must ask whether it is likely that a fully informed Congress would have created this kind of Commission: one endowed with vast responsibilities for drafting <em>advisory </em>Guidelines and policy statements, but also with the tiniest sliver of lawmaking power to tie the hands of a district court\u2019s exercise of grace under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). I think the answer is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">My understanding of the scope of the <em>Booker </em>remedy is reinforced by an additional consideration: The Commission\u2019s policy statement, to which the Court today allows binding effect, may exceed the scope of the Commission\u2019s powers. No one disputes that Congress could have rejected the Court\u2019s remedial holding in <em>Booker </em>if it so wished. Instead, it is the Commission that has rejected <em>Booker\u2019s </em>application to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), by purporting to give mandatory force to its own policy statement. That action presses the bounds of the authority Congress validly gave the Commission in 1984, for it is not clear that Congress has authorized the Commission</p>\n<p id=\"AGO\">[560 U.S. 842]</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">to create this type of policy statement or to circumvent a decision such as <em>Booker </em>on its own accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">We have been quite permissive of congressional delegations in our separation-of-powers jurisprudence. \u201cSo long as Congress \u2018shall lay down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [exercise the delegated authority] is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power.\u2019 <em>\u201d Mistretta, </em>488 U.S., at 372, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (quoting <em>J. W. Hampton, Jr., &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>276 U.S. 394, 409, 48 S. Ct. 348, 72 L. Ed. 624 (1928)). Few legislative actions have been found to offend this principle. 488 U.S., at 373, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">More than 20 years ago, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the Commission\u2019s work from just such an attack in <em>Mistretta. </em>We took sanctuary then in the fact that, in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act and creating the Commission, Congress had \u201cse[t] forth more than merely an \u2018intelligible principle\u2019 or minimal standard]\u201d for the exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion, and had \u201c \u2018explain [ed] what the Commission should do and how it should do it, and se[t] out specific directives to govern particular situations.\u2019\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 379, 109 S.

Ed. 2d 714; specified the \u201c \u2018purposes of sentencing,\u2019 \u201d <em>ibid.; </em>\u201cprescribed the specific tool\u201d\u2014\u201cthe guidelines system\u201d\u2014the Commission was to use in its work, <em>ibid.; </em>set limits on the appropriate Guidelines ranges the Commission was to promulgate, <em>id., </em>at 375, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714; and set forth \u201cseven factors\u201d and \u201c11 factors,\u201d respectively, to assist the Commission with \u201cits formulation of offense categories\u201d and its establishment of \u201ccategories of defendants\u201d for sentencing purposes, <em>id., </em>at 375-376, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We explained that \u201calthough Congress granted the Commission substantial discretion in formulating guidelines, in actuality it legislated a full hierarchy of punishment\u2014from near maximum imprisonment, to substantial imprisonment, to some imprisonment, to alternatives\u2014and stipulated the</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">[560 U.S. 843]</p>\n<p id=\"A5o\">most important offense and offender characteristics to place defendants within these categories.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 377, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714. There was, accordingly, no \u201cconcern of encroachment and aggrandizement that has animated our separation-of-powers jurisprudence and aroused our vigilance against the \u2018hydraulic pressure inherent within each of the separate Branches to exceed the outer limits of its power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 382, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (quoting <em>INS </em>v. <em>Chadha, </em>462 U.S. 919, 951, 103 S. Ct. 2764, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Justice Scalia disagreed. He argued forcefully that Congress\u2019 creation of the Commission was itself \u201ca pure delegation of legislative power\u201d and therefore an abuse of separation of powers. 488 U.S., at 420, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (dissenting opinion). \u201cCongress\u2019 commitment of such broad policy responsibility to any institution,\u201d in Justice Scalia\u2019s view, violated a core principle of our governing system: that \u201cbasic policy decisions governing society are to be made by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 415, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Although we acknowledged in <em>Mistretta </em>that Congress had permissibly granted substantial powers to the Commission to set law and policy on sentencing generally, we had no occasion to consider whether it had spoken with sufficient clarity respecting the Commission\u2019s authority to prescribe sentence reductions. That question has now reared its head, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>in my view it raises separation-of-powers concerns significantly more difficult than those presented in <em>Mis-tretta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">First, I am doubtful that Congress authorized the type of \u201cpolicy statement\u201d we find in USSG \u00a7 1B1.10. Congress instructed the Commission to promulgate \u201cgeneral policy statements regarding application of the guidelines or any other aspect of sentencing or sentence implementation that in the view of the Commission would further the purposes set forth in section 3553(a)(2) of title 18 . . . including the appropriate use of,\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>various \u201csentence modification provisions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(2). As envisioned by the Sentencing Reform Act, the role of policy statements was merely to inform the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion within</p>\n<p id=\"ATR\">[560 U.S. 844]</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">an otherwise mandatory Guidelines regime. See S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 167 (1983) (explaining that the \u201csentencing judge is required to take the policy statements into account in deciding what sentence to impose,\u201d but that departure from a policy statement is not itself grounds for appeal); see also <em>id., </em>at 166 (identifying potential use of policy statement to \u201coffe[r] recommendations as to how\u201d to \u201ctrea[t]\u201d \u201cin the future\u201d \u201cexisting disparities which are not adequately cured by the guidelines\u201d). Congress reserved binding effect for the Commission\u2019s \u201cguidelines,\u201d which the Commission was to promulgate pursuant to a distinct statutory provision, \u00a7 994(a)(1). The Sentencing Reform Act thus drew a basic distinction: Guidelines would bind; policy statements would advise.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Given that distinction, it is significant that Congress elected to use the Commission\u2019s policy-statement power to set limitations on the sentencing modification procedures, rather than invoking the Commission\u2019s Guidelines power. The Commission is now trying to use a policy statement to have the mandatory effect of a guideline\u2014inverting the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s original design. I find no provision within \u00a7 994(a)(2) that would authorize the Commission, via a policy statement, to create a binding Guidelines regime. With respect to the type of action the Commission has taken, there is certainly no provision that even approximates the detailed prescriptions on the Commission\u2019s power we considered in <em>Mistretta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Moreover, not only does nothing in \u00a7 994(a)(2) appear to authorize this type of policy statement, but there is also nothing that appears to authorize the Commission, by its own fiat, to limit the effect of our decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">How to respond to <em>Booker, </em>and whether to retain mandatory Guidelines, was a decision for Congress\u2014 and Congress alone. <em>Booker </em>expressly left \u201c[t]he ball\u201d \u201cin Congress\u2019 court,\u201d explaining that \u201c[t]he National Legislature is equipped to devise and install, long term, the sentencing system,</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">[560 U.S. 845]</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">compatible with the Constitution, that Congress judges best for the federal system of justice.\u201d 543 U.S., at 265, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621; see also <em>supra, </em>at 834-835, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 288-289. That Congress has declined to disturb <em>Booker </em>in the five years since its issuance demonstrates not only that Justice Breyer is more clairvoyant than I am, but also that Congress has acquiesced to a discretionary Guidelines regime. Congress\u2019 silence has deprived the Commission of any \u201cintelligible principle [s],\u201d <em>J. W. Hampton, </em>276 U.S., at 409, 48 S. Ct. 348, 72 L. Ed. 624, by which to steer its consideration of the appropriate response to <em>Booker. </em>And without such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>guidance, I fear that, in promulgating USSG \u00a7 1B1.10, the Commission may have made the type of \u201cbasic policy decisio[n]\u201d that Justice Scalia reminded us is the province of the Legislature, <em>Mistretta, </em>488 U.S., at 415, 109 S. Ct. 647, 102 L. Ed. 2d 714 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Prior to the Commission\u2019s 2008 overhaul of its policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10\u2014and even under the applicable policy statement in effect when the Court decided Booker\u2014nothing in the Guidelines, see <em>supra, </em>at 834-835, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 289, and n. 2, as understood in light of <em>Booker, </em>would have precluded Dillon from obtaining the type of discretionary sentence reduction he now seeks (assuming he was so eligible). Standing in Dillon\u2019s way presently are two provisions of \u00a7 1B1.10, revised contemporaneously with the Commission\u2019s decision to make its amendments to the crack cocaine offense Guidelines retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">There can be no question that the purpose of the Commission\u2019s amendments to its policy statement in \u00a7 IB 1.10 was to circumvent the <em>Booker </em>remedy. See Brief for Federal Public and Community Defenders et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>3-9 (describing history of promulgation of current version of \u00a7 1B1.10). To this end, the Commission disclaimed that proceedings under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cconstitute a full resentencing of the defendant.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3). And it advised that \u201cthe court shall not reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and this policy statement to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range determined\u201d under the new range.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">[560 U.S. 846]</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A). In other words, the Commission told federal courts that its Guidelines, at least in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, remain mandatory and binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Had the Commission taken it upon itself, by issuance of a general policy statement, to make its Guidelines mandatory but subject to jury findings in all cases, we would either strike down such an act on separation-of-powers grounds or apply the same remedy we did in <em>Booker </em>to render the statement advisory. It makes little difference, in my view, that the Commission has only rejected the <em>Booker </em>remedy in this single procedure. The encroachment is the same, if only more subtle. Any legislative response to <em>Booker </em>was a decision for Congress to make\u2014not the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Separate from the arguments noted above, the Court\u2019s decision today may reflect a concern that a contrary holding would discourage the Commission from issuing retroactive amendments to the Guidelines, owing to a fear of burdening the district courts. In what might be described as a subtle threat, the Commission has highlighted this point in its <em>amicus </em>brief supporting the Government. The brief explains that holding for Dillon would introduce uncertainty into the Commission\u2019s \u201cassessments about the effects of retroactivity decisions,\u201d making these decisions \u201cvery difficult\u201d and \u201cweighting] against making Guideline amendments retroactive in the future.\u201d Brief for United States Sentencing Commission as <em>Amicus Curiae 21.</em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Even if that explanation were accu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>rate, it should not influence our assessment of the legal question before us. The Commission has a statutory obligation to review and amend</p>\n<p id=\"AK3\">[560 U.S. 847]</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Guidelines ranges. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o). And Congress has commanded that the Commission \u201cshall specify in what circumstances\u201d an amendment is retroactive, indicating that most, if not all, substantial amendments are to receive some type of retroactive effect. \u00a7 994(u); see also S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 180 (\u201cIt should be noted that the Committee does not expect that the Commission will recommend adjusting existing sentences under [\u00a7 3582(c)(2)] when guidelines are simply refined in a way that might cause isolated instances of existing sentences falling above the old guidelines or when there is only a minor downward adjustment in the guidelines\u201d). In other words, while Congress has left the retroactivity decision to the Commission\u2019s discretion, it has done so with the presumption that some form of retroactive relief is appropriate when a Guidelines amendment is nontrivial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> I cannot accept that the Commission would ignore its obligations, and would withhold retroactive application of a Guidelines reduction, simply because a judge would</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">[560 U.S. 848]</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">have discretion to enter a below-Guidelines sentence in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Undoubtedly, discretionary application of the Guidelines in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings would impose a greater burden on the district courts. Such a process would require case-specific evaluations rather than the rote, two-level reductions the Commission envisioned when it made Amendment 706 retroactive. But it is important to remember that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) already requires the district court to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it determines whether to grant a reduction, as well as the extent of the reduction. And any additional consideration of evidence proffered to justify a downward departure need not create a great deal of work. Indeed, it need not create any particular adversarial process at all: The Commission could simply advise the district courts to review paper submissions, including the original presentence report and objections, as well as any new submissions. By now, courts are intimately familiar with our post <em>-Booker </em>sentencing regime and the discretionary application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The facts of Dillon\u2019s case show why any additional burden on the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>caused by applying <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding likely pales in comparison to the benefit of achieving more tailored, proportionate sentences for those individuals currently serving terms of imprisonment that exceed what is \u201cnecessary\u201d to meet the goals of our sentencing system, \u00a7 3553(a). Dillon was 23 years old when he was sentenced to nearly 27 years\u2019 imprisonment for his drug crimes. His attorney urged the District Court to enter a below-Guidelines sentence because of, <em>inter alia, </em>the gross disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine offenses. App. 8-9. It would take another 14 years for this Court to agree, finally, in <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S. Ct. 558, 169 L. Ed. 2d 481, that sentencing courts could consider this unjust disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">But the District Court, constrained by the then-mandatory Guidelines, increased Dillon\u2019s sentence based on judge-found</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">[560 U.S. 849]</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">facts by more than 10 years over the sentence authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict. See Brief for Petitioner 2, and n. 2. The court could only lament: \u201cI personally don\u2019t believe that you should be serving 322 months. But I feel I am bound by those Guidelines and I don\u2019t feel there is any grounds for . . . depart [ing] from those Guidelines.\u201d App. 12-13. The court acknowledged: \u201cI don\u2019t say to you that these penalties are fair. I don\u2019t think they are fair.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13. The court also implored Dillon to make something of the hand he had dealt himself: \u201cI hope that while you are in prison . . . that you will take some time to consider the direction that your life will take when you do return to society.... It is only through people like you if you spread the word that other young men of your age will hesitate to get involved in [dealing drugs].\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Dillon has done just that. He has participated in outreach efforts in the communities in which he has been imprisoned, doing extensive work with adolescents to steer them away from a life of drugs and crime. Brief for Petitioner 5-6. Working with two universities, he has facilitated the initiation of an African-American Studies program at Hunters Point Family, a bay area organization devoted to assisting at-risk youth. He has also played a large role in initiating a similar program at his prison facility. Berkeley\u2019s Prison Outreach Coordinator stated to the District Court that \u201cwithout [Dillon\u2019s] insight and advice, our project would not have succeeded and grown the way it has.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Dillon has also prepared himself for a successful life once he returns to society. He has obtained his general equivalency diploma (GED), taken vocational classes in property management, and has job prospects awaiting him upon release. <em>Id., </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">The Government concedes that Dillon has undertaken \u201csignificant institutional rehabilitation and education.\u201d Brief for United States 11. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that \u201c [i]f <em>Booker </em>did apply in proceedings pursuant to</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">[560 U.S. 850]</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">\u00a7 3582, Dillon would likely be an ideal candidate for a non-Guidelines sentence.\u201d 572 F.3d 146, 147 (CA3 2009). And yet, now, the Government will continue to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>spend more than $25,000 a year to keep Dillon behind bars until his release date.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Given the circumstances of his case, I can scarcely think of a greater waste of this Nation\u2019s precious resources. Cf. <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Thomas, ante, </em>at 494, 130 L. Ed. 2d 2499, 177 L. Ed. 2d 1 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cAnd if the only way to call attention to the human implications of this case is to speak in terms of economics, then it should be noted that the Court\u2019s interpretation comes at a cost to the taxpayers of untold millions of dollars\u201d).

The Guidelines Manual itself contains two types of provisions: guidelines, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(1), and policy statements, see \u00a7 994(a)(2). I use \u201cGuidelines\u201d in this opinion to refer to both the guidelines as described in \u00a7 994(a)(1), as well as more generally to all of the provisions in the Guidelines Manual.

Prom 1989 to 1994, the policy statement in \u00a7 IB 1.10 also contained what could be described fairly as a limitation on the \u201camount\u201d of an available sentence reduction. See USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c)(2) (Nov. 1990) (\u201c[A] reduction in a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment . . . may, in no event, exceed the number of months by which the maximum of the guideline range applicable to the defendant . . . has been lowered\u201d). In 1994, as part of Amendment 504 to the Guidelines Manual, the Commission deleted this provision, explaining that this \u201crather complex subsection\u201d was an \u201cunnecessary restriction on the court\u2019s consideration of a revised sentence.\u201d USSG App. C, Arndt. 504 (effective Nov. 1, 1994). Later, in an \u201cApplication Note,\u201d the Commission indicated that \u201cthe amended guideline range\u201d \u201climit [s] the extent to which an eligible defendant\u2019s sentence may be reduced.\u201d Id., Amdt. 548 (effective Nov. 1, 1997). The bottom line is that it was the Guidelines\u2019 mandatory nature, and not the effect of a policy statement, that made the Guidelines ranges binding in an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\">.

It seems, however, that at least one additional provision of the Sentencing Reform Act should have been excised, but was not, in order to accomplish the Court\u2019s remedy.

The Government\u2019s argument along these lines is less subtle: \u201cTo forbid the Sentencing Commission from limiting the scope of Section 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction proceedings to the scope of the amendments themselves would inevitably discourage the Sentencing Commission from ever authorizing sentence reductions.\u2019\u2019 Brief for United States 37.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\">. As the Court notes, I do agree that \u00a7 994(u) authorizes the Commission to determine the retroactive effect of sentence reductions. <em>Ante, </em>at 830, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 286. I understand \u00a7 994(u) as directing the Commission to prescribe the retroactive effect, if any, of its Guidelines amendments. The power to make retroactivity determinations is meaningfully different, however, from the other power the Court claims for the Commission. In granting the former power, Congress has instructed the Commission to perform a gatekeeping function by determining which individuals are eligible for relief pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). By contrast, the other power the Court claims for the Commission today is the type of mandatory sentencing authority at issue in <em>Booker. </em>Contrary to the Court\u2019s conclusion, the Commission after <em>Booker </em>does not have the power to bind the district court in setting a particular sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">I also cannot accept the Court\u2019s broad understanding of the power the Commission derives from \u00a7 994(u), see <em>ante, </em>at 826, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 284, because it suffers from the same delegation concerns I discussed above, see <em>supra, </em>at 841-846, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 293-296. I do not think the Commission\u2019s authority encompasses the ability to promulgate binding Guidelines via policy statements. And this matter is separate from its power to promulgate Guidelines\u2014a power unaffected by our decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b345-9\">.
