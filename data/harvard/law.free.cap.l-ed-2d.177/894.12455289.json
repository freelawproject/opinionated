Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008), we held that  the Second Amendment protects the</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">[561 U.S. 750]</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense, and we struck down a District of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the home. The city of Chicago (Chicago or City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chicago suburb, have laws that are similar to the District of Columbia\u2019s, but Chicago and Oak Park argue that their laws are constitutional because the Second Amendment has no application to the States. We have previously held that  most of the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply with full force to both the Federal Government and the States. Applying the standard that is well established in our case law, we hold that  the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b949-17\">Otis McDonald, Adam Orlov, Colleen Lawson, and David Lawson (Chicago petitioners) are Chicago residents who would like to keep handguns in their homes for self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>defense but are prohibited from doing so by Chicago\u2019s firearms laws. A City ordinance provides that \u201c[n]o person shall . . . possess . . . any firearm unless such person is the holder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.\u201d Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a7 8-20-040(a) (2009). The Code then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus effectively banning handgun possession by almost all private citizens who reside in the City. \u00a7 8-20-050(c). Like Chicago, Oak Park makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to possess ... any firearm,\u201d a term that includes \u201cpistols, revolvers, guns and small arms . . . commonly known as handguns.\u201d Oak Park, Ill., Village Code \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-1 (2007), 27-1-1 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents \u201cfrom the loss of property and injury or death from firearms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">[561 U.S. 751]</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the City Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago petitioners and their <em>amici, </em>however, argue that the handgun ban has left them vulnerable to criminals. Chicago Police Department statistics, we are told, reveal that the City\u2019s handgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban was enacted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that Chicago residents now face one of the highest murder rates in the country and rates of other violent crimes that exceed the average in comparable cities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">Several of the Chicago petitioners have been the targets of threats and violence. For instance, Otis McDonald, who is in his late seventies, lives in a high-crime neighborhood. He is a community activist involved with alternative policing strategies, and his efforts to improve his neighborhood have subjected him to violent threats from drug dealers. App. 16-17; Brief for State Firearm Associations as <em>Amici Curiae </em>20-21; Brief for State of Texas et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>7-8. Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resident whose home has been targeted by burglars. \u201cIn Mrs. Lawson\u2019s judgment, possessing a handgun in Chicago would decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or death should she ever be threatened again in her home.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> McDonald, Lawson, and the other Chicago petitioners own handguns that they store outside of the city limits, but they would like to keep their handguns in their homes for protection. See App. 16-19, 43-44 (McDonald), 20-24 (C. Lawson), 19, 36 (Orlov), 20-21, 40 (D. Lawson).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">[561 U.S. 752]</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">After our decision in <em>Heller, </em>the Chicago petitioners and two groups<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed suit against the City in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. They sought a declaration that the handgun ban and several related Chicago ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Another action challenging the Oak Park law was filed in the same District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and two Oak Park residents. In addition, the NRA and others filed a third action challenging the Chicago ordinances. All three cases were assigned to the same District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">The District Court rejected plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Chicago and Oak Park laws are unconstitutional. See App. 83-84; <em>NRA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oak Park, </em>617 F. Supp. 2d 752, 754 (ND Ill. 2008). The court noted that the Seventh Circuit had \u201csquarely upheld the constitutionality of a ban on handguns a quarter century ago,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 753 (citing <em>Quilici </em>v. <em>Morton Grove, </em>695 F.2d 261 (CA7 1982)), and that <em>Heller </em>had explicitly refrained from \u201copin[ing] on the subject of incorporation vel non of the Second Amendment,\u201d <em>NRA, </em>617 F. Supp. 2d, at 754. The court observed that a district judge has a \u201cduty to follow established precedent in the Court of Appeals to which he or she is beholden, even though the logic of more recent caselaw may point in a different direction.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th-century cases\u2014 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruikshank, </em>92 U.S. 542, 23 L. Ed. 588 (1876), <em>Presser </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>116 U.S. 252, 6 S. Ct. 580, 29 L. Ed. 615 (1886), and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>153 U.S. 535, 14 S. Ct. 874, 38 L. Ed. 812 (1894)\u2014that were decided in the wake of this Court\u2019s interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>16 Wall. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 (1873). The Seventh Circuit described the rationale of those cases as \u201cdefunct\u201d and recognized that they did not consider the question whether the</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">[561 U.S. 753]</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">F ourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause incorporates the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. <em>NRA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>567 F.3d 856, 857, 858 (2009). Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit observed that it was obligated to follow Supreme Court precedents that have \u201cdirect application,\u201d and it declined to predict how the Second Amendment would fare under this Court\u2019s modern \u201cselective incorporation\u201d approach. <em>Id., </em>at 857-858 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">We granted certiorari. 557 U.S. 965, 130 S. Ct. 48, 174 L. Ed. 2d 632 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">Petitioners argue that the Chicago and Oak Park laws violate the right to keep and bear arms for two reasons. Petitioners\u2019 primary submission is that this right is among the \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\u201d and that the narrow interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause adopted in the <em>Slaughter-House Cases, supra, </em>should now be rejected. As a secondary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \u201cincorporates\u201d the Second Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-14\">Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the States only if that right is an indispensable attribute of <em>any </em>\u201c \u2018civilized\u2019 \u201d legal system. Brief for Municipal Respondents 9. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that does not recognize the right, the municipal respondents tell us, then that right is not protected by due process. <em>Ibid-Paid </em>since there are civilized countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the municipal respondents maintain that due process does not preclude such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>measures. <em>Id., </em>at 21-23. In light of the parties\u2019 far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting this Court\u2019s analysis over the years of the relationship between the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">[561 U.S. 754]</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally applied only to the Federal Government. In <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan </em>v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore, </em>7 Pet. 243, 8 L. Ed. 672 (1833), the Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, explained that this question was \u201cof great importance\u201d but \u201cnot of much difficulty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 247, 8 L. Ed. 672. In less than four pages, the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the first eight Amendments operate as limitations on the States, holding that they apply only to the Federal Government. See also <em>Lessee of Livingston </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>7 Pet. 469, 551-552, 8 L. Ed. 751 (1833) (\u201c[I]t is now settled that those amendments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">The constitutional Amendments adopted in the aftermath of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country\u2019s federal system. The provision at issue in this case,  \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other things, that a State may not abridge \u201cthe privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\u201d or deprive \u201cany person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court was asked to interpret the Amendment\u2019s reference to \u201cthe privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d The <em>Slaughter-House Cases, supra, </em>involved challenges to a Louisiana law permitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the butchering of animals within the city of New Orleans. Justice Samuel Miller\u2019s opinion for the Court concluded that  the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only those rights \u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 79, 21 L. Ed. 394. The Court held that other fundamental rights\u2014 rights that predated the creation of the Federal Government and that \u201cthe State governments were created to establish and secure\u201d\u2014were not protected by the Clause. <em>Id., </em>at 76, 21 L. Ed. 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">[561 U.S. 755]</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of federal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two principal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause spoke of \u201cthe privileges or immunities of <em>citizens of the United. States,\u201d </em>and the Court contrasted this phrasing with the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, both of which refer to <em>state </em>citizenship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Second, the Court stated that a contrary reading would \u201cradically chang[e] the whole theory of the relations of the State and Federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people,\u201d and the Court refused to con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>elude that such a change had been made \u201cin the absence of language which expresses such a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 78, 21 L. Ed. 394. Finding the phrase \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\u201d lacking by this high standard, the Court reasoned that the phrase must mean something more limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Under the Court\u2019s narrow reading, the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects such things as the right</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-5\">\u201cto come to the seat of government to assert any claim [a citizen] may have upon that government, to transact any business he may have with it, to seek its protection, to share its offices, to engage in administering its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State of the Union by a <em>bona fide </em>residence therein, with the same rights as other citizens of that State.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 79-80, 21 L. Ed. 394 (internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-6\">[561 U.S. 756]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Finding no constitutional protection against state intrusion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the Court upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Justice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices Swayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause to \u201ca vain and idle enactment, which accomplished nothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the people on its <em>passage.\u201dId., </em>at 96, 21 L. Ed. 394; see also <em>id., </em>at 104, 21 L. Ed. 394. Justice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects rights that are \u201cin their nature . . . fundamental,\u201d including the right of every man to pursue his profession without the imposition of unequal or discriminatory restrictions. <em>Id., </em>at 96-97, 21 L. Ed. 394 (internal quotation marks omitted). Justice Bradley\u2019s dissent observed that \u201cwe are not bound to resort to implication ... to find an authoritative declaration of some of the most important privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States. It is in the Constitution itself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 118, 21 L. Ed. 394. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges or Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated in the Constitution as well as some un-enumerated rights. <em>Id., </em>at 119, 21 L. Ed. 394. Justice Swayne described the majority\u2019s narrow reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as \u201cturn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 129, 21 L. Ed. 394 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of the narrow <em>Slaughter-House </em>interpretation. See, <em>e.g., Saenz </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>526 U.S. 489, 522, n. 1, 527, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1999) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment agree \u201cthat the Clause does not mean what the Court said it meant in 1873\u201d); Amar, Substance and Method in the Year 2000, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 601, 631, n. 178 (2001) (\u201cVirtually no serious modern scholar\u2014 left, right, and center\u2014thinks that this [interpretation] is a plausible reading of the Amendment\u201d); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as <em>Amici Curiae </em>33 (claiming an \u201coverwhelming consensus among leading constitutional</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">[561 U.S. 757]</p>\n<p id=\"Arsv\">scholars\u201d that the opinion is \u201cegregiously wrong\u201d); C. Black, A New Birth of Freedom 74-75 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Three years after the decision in the <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>the Court decided <em>Cruikshank, </em>the first of the three 19th-century cases on which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>Seventh Circuit relied. 92 U.S. 542, 23 L. Ed. 588. In that case, the Court reviewed convictions stemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisiana on Easter Sunday 1873. Dozens of blacks, many unarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white men.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed African-American prisoners through the streets and then had them summarily executed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ninety-seven men were indicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine went to trial. Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges; the remaining three were acquitted of murder but convicted under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for banding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of various constitutional rights, including the right to bear arms.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">The Court reversed all of the convictions, including those relating to the deprivation of the victims\u2019 right to bear arms. <em>Cruikshank, </em>92 U.S., at 553, 559, 23 L. Ed. 588. The Court wrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose \u201cis not a right granted by the Constitution\u201d and is not \u201cin any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 553, 23 L. Ed. 588. \u201cThe second amendment,\u201d the Court continued, \u201cdeclares that it shall not be infringed; but this . . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cOur later decisions in <em>Presser </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>116 U.S. 252, 265 [6 S. Ct. 580, 29 L. Ed. 615]</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">[561 U.S. 758]</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">(1886), and <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>153 U.S. 535, 538 [14 S. Ct. 874, 38 L. Ed. 812] (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment applies only to the Federal Government.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 620, n. 23, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that <em>Cruikshank, Presser, </em>and <em>Miller </em>doomed petitioners\u2019 claims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue, however, that we should overrule those decisions and hold that the right to keep and bear arms is one of the \u201cprivileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d In petitioners\u2019 view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as well as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15-21, but petitioners are unable to identify the Clause\u2019s full scope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6, 8-11. Nor is there any consensus on that question among the scholars who agree that the <em>Slaughter-House Cases\u2019 </em>interpretation is flawed. See <em>Saenz, supra, </em>at 522, n. 1, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here. For many decades, the question of the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement has been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that Amendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities Clause. We therefore decline to disturb the <em>Slaughter-House </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">At the same time, however, this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Cruikshank, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number><em>Presser, </em>and <em>Miller </em>do not preclude us from considering whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right binding on the States. See <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 620, n. 23, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. None of those cases \u201cengage[d] in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by our later cases.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>As explained more fully below, <em>Cruikshank, Presser, </em>and <em>Miller </em>all preceded the era in which the Court began the process of \u201cselective incorporation\u201d under the Due Process Clause, and we have never previously addressed the question whether the</p>\n<p id=\"A1-p\">[561 U.S. 759]</p>\n<p id=\"b955-4\">right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Indeed, <em>Cruikshank </em>has not prevented us from holding that other rights that were at issue in that case are binding on the States through the Due Process Clause. In <em>Cruikshank, </em>the Court held that the general \u201cright of the people peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,\u201d which is protected by the First Amendment, applied only against the Federal Government and not against the States. See 92 U.S., at 551-552, 23 L. Ed. 588. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the Court held that the right of peaceful assembly was a \u201cfundamental righ [t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>De Jonge </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>299 U.S. 353, 364, 57 S. Ct. 255, 81 L. Ed. 278 (1937). We follow the same path here and thus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms applies to the States under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider whether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884) (due process does not require grand jury indictment); <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>166 U.S. 226, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979 (1897) (due process prohibits States from taking of private property for public use without just compensation). Five features of the approach taken during the ensuing era should be noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">First,  the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national citizenship. See <em>Twining </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>211 U.S. 78, 99, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97 (1908).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Second, the Court explained that the only rights protected against state infringement by the Due Process Clause were those rights \u201cof such a nature that they are included in the conception of due process of law.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See also, <em>e.g., Adamson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">[561 U.S. 760]</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">v. <em>California, </em>332 U.S. 46, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (1947); <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>316 U.S. 455, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 86 L. Ed. 1595 (1942); <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288 (1937); <em>Grosjean </em>v. <em>American Press Co., </em>297 U.S. 233, 56 S. Ct. 444, 80 L. Ed. 660 (1936); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932). While it was \u201cpossible that some of the personal rights safeguarded by the first eight Amendments against National action [might] also be safeguarded against state action,\u201d the Court stated, this was \u201cnot because those rights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.\u201d <em>Twining, </em>211 U.S., at 99, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">The Court used different formula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>tions in describing the boundaries of due process. For example, in <em>Twining, </em>the Court referred to \u201cimmutable principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government which no member of the Union may <em>disregard.\u201dId., </em>at 102, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97 (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S. Ct. 330, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934), the Court spoke of rights that are \u201cso rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u201d And in <em>Palko, </em>the Court famously said that due process protects those rights that are \u201cthe very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty\u201d and essential to \u201ca fair and enlightened system of justice.\u201d 302 U.S., at 325, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court \u201ccan be seen as having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.\u201d <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 149, n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968). Thus, in holding that due process prohibits a State from taking private property without just compensation, the Court described the right as \u201ca principle of natural equity, recognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and universal sense of its justice.\u201d <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., supra, </em>at 238, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979. Similarly, the Court found that due process did not provide a right against compelled incrimination in part because this right \u201chas no place in the jurisprudence of civilized and free</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">[561 U.S. 761]</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">countries outside the domain of the common law.\u201d <em>Twining, supra, </em>at 113, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to hold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to meet the test for inclusion within the protection of the Due Process Clause. The Court found that some such rights qualified. See, <em>e.g., Gitlow </em>v. <em>New York, </em>268 U.S. 652, 666, 45 S. Ct. 625, 69 L. Ed. 1138 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); <em>Near </em>v. <em>Minnesota ex rel. Olson, </em>283 U.S. 697, 51 S. Ct. 625, 75 L. Ed. 1357 (1931) (same); <em>Powell, supra </em>(assistance of counsel in capital cases); <em>De Jonge, supra </em>(freedom of assembly); <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 60 S. Ct. 900, 84 L. Ed. 1213 (1940) (free exercise of religion). But others did not. See, <em>e.g., Hurtado, supra </em>(grand jury indictment requirement); <em>Twining, supra </em>(privilege against self-incrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights was held to fall within the conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded against state infringement sometimes differed from the protection or remedies provided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To give one example, in <em>Betts </em>the Court held that, although the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant was unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause required appointment of counsel in state criminal proceedings only where \u201cwant of counsel in [the] particular case . . . resulted] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental fairness.\u201d 316 U.S., at 473, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 86 L. Ed. 1595. Similarly, in <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>338 U.S. 25, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782 (1949), the Court held that the \u201ccore of the Fourth Amendment\u201d was implicit in the concept of ordered liberty and thus \u201cenforceable against the States through the Due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Process Clause\u201d but that the exclusionary rule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the States. <em>Id., </em>at 27-28, 33, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">An alternative theory regarding the relationship between the Bill of Rights and \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment was</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">[561 U.S. 762]</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">championed by Justice Black. This theory held that \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, <em>e.g., Adamson, supra, </em>at 71-72, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (Black, J., dissenting); <em>Duncan, supra, </em>at 166, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 l. Ed. 2d 491 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black noted, the chief congressional proponents of the Fourteenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amendment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and, in so doing, overruled this Court\u2019s decision in Barron.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Adamson, supra, </em>at 72, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (dissenting opinion).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nonetheless,</p>\n<p id=\"AWTL\">[561 U.S. 763]</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">the Court never has embraced Justice Black\u2019s \u201ctotal incorporation\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>3</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">While Justice Black\u2019s theory was never adopted, the Court eventually moved in that direction by initiating what has been called a process of \u201cselective incorporation,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the Court began to hold that  the Due Process Clause fully incorporates particular rights contained in the first eight Amendments. See, <em>e.g., Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 341, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963); <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 5-6, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964); <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 403-404, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965); <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>388 U.S. 14, 18, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967); <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 147-148, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491; <em>Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">[561 U.S. 764]</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">The decisions during this time abandoned three of the previously noted characteristics of the earlier period.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court made it clear that the governing standard is not whether <em>any </em>\u201ccivilized system [can] be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 149, n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491. Instead, the Court inquired whether a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to <em>our </em>scheme of ordered liberty and system of justice. <em>Id., </em>at 149, and n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491; see also <em>id., </em>at 148, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (referring to those \u201cfundamental principles of liberty and justice which he at the base of all <em>our </em>civil and political institutions\u201d (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court eventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-11\">[561 U.S. 765]</p>\n<p id=\"b958-12\">Only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>handful of the Bill of Rights protections remain unincorporated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\">Finally,  the Court abandoned \u201cthe notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,\u201d stating that it would be \u201cincongruous\u201d to apply different standards \u201cdepending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court.\u201d <em>Malloy, </em>378 U.S., at 10-11, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the Court decisively held that incorporated Bill of Rights protections \u201care all to be enforced against the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 10, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653; see also <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655-656, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081 (1961); <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 33-34, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726 (1963);</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">[561 U.S. 766]</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\"><em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 110, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964); <em>Pointer, </em>380 U.S., at 406, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923; <em>Duncan, supra, </em>at 149, 157-158, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491; <em>Benton, </em>395 U.S., at 794-795, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707; <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Jaffree, </em>472 U.S. 38, 48-49, 105 S. Ct. 2479, 86 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1985).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">Employing this approach, the Court overruled earlier decisions in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>had held that particular Bill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States. See, <em>e.g., Mapp, supra </em>(overruling in part <em>Wolf, </em>338 U.S. 25, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782); <em>Gideon, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (overruling <em>Betts, </em>316 U.S. 455, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 86 L. Ed. 1595); <em>Malloy, supra </em>(overruling <em>Adamson, </em>332 U.S. 46, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903, and <em>Twining, </em>211 U.S. 78, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97); <em>Benton, </em>395 U.S., at 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (overruling <em>Palko, </em>302 U.S. 319, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">[561 U.S. 767]</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">With this framework in mind, we now turn directly to the question whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is incorporated in the concept of due process. In answering that question, as just explained, we must decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental to <em>our </em>scheme of ordered liberty, <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 149, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491, or as we have said in a related context, whether this right is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Our decision in <em>Heller </em>points unmistakably to the answer.  Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and in <em>Heller, </em>we held that individual self-defense is \u201cthe <em>central </em>component\u201d of the Second Amendment right. 554 U.S., at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; see also <em>id., </em>at 628, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (stating that the \u201cinherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d). Explaining that \u201cthe need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\u201d in the home, <em>ibid., </em>we found that this right applies to handguns because they are \u201cthe most preferred firearm in the nation to \u2018keep\u2019 and use for protection of one\u2019s home and family,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 628-629, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (some internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>id., </em>at 628, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (noting that handguns are \u201coverwhelmingly chosen by American society for [the] lawful purpose\u201d of self-defense); <em>id., </em>at 629, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (\u201c[T]he American people have considered the handgun to be the quintessential self-defense weapon\u201d). Thus, we concluded,</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">[561 U.S. 768]</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">citizens must be permitted \u201cto use [handguns] for the core lawful purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>self-defense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 630, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><em>Heller </em>makes it clear that this right is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d <em>Glucksberg, supra, </em>at 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Heller </em>explored the right\u2019s origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of Rights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self-defense, 554 U.S., at 592-593, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637, and that by 1765, Blackstone was able to assert that the right to keep and bear arms was \u201cone of the fundamental rights of Englishmen,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 594, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Blackstone\u2019s assessment was shared by the American colonists. As we noted in <em>Heller, </em>King George Ill\u2019s attempt to disarm the colonists in the 1760\u2019s and 1770\u2019s \u201cprovoked polemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as Englishmen to keep arms.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.; </em>see also L. Levy, Origins of the Bill of Rights 137-143 (1999) (hereinafter Levy).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The right to keep and bear arms was considered no less fundamental by those who drafted and ratified the Bill of Rights. \u201cDuring the 1788 ratification debates, the fear that the federal government would disarm the people in order to impose rule through a standing army or select militia was pervasive in Antifederalist rhetoric.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>at 598, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (citing Letters from The Federal Farmer III (Oct. 10, 1787), in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist 234, 242 (H. Storing ed. 1981)); see also Federal Farmer: An Additional Number of Letters to the Republican, Letter XVIII (Jan. 25, 1788), in 17 Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 360, 362-363 (J. Kaminski &amp; G. Sala-dino eds. 1995); S. Halbrook, The Founders\u2019 Second Amendment 171-278</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">[561 U.S. 769]</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">(2008). Federalists responded, not by arguing that the right was insufficiently important to warrant protection but by contending that the right was adequately protected by the Constitution\u2019s assignment of only limited powers to the Federal Government. <em>Heller, supra, </em>at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike agreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the newly formed system of government. See Levy 143-149; J. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right 155-164 (1994). But those who were fearful that the new Federal Government would infringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and bear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a condition for ratification of the Constitution. See 1 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327-331 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1854); 3 <em>id., </em>at 657-661; 4 <em>id., </em>at 242-246, 248-249; see also Levy 26-34; 1 A. Kelly, W. Harbison, &amp; H. Belz, The American Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>tion: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th ed. 1991). This is surely powerful evidence that the right was regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">This understanding persisted in the years immediately following the ratification of the Bill of Rights. In addition to the four States that had adopted Second Amendment analogues before ratification, nine more States adopted state constitutional provisions protecting an individual right to keep and bear arms between 1789 and 1820. <em>Heller, supra, </em>at 600-603, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. F ounding-era legal commentators confirmed the importance of the right to early Americans. St. George Tucker, for example, described the right to keep and bear arms as \u201cthe true palladium of liberty\u201d and explained that prohibitions on the right would place liberty \u201con the brink of destruction.\u201d 1 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, Editor\u2019s App. 300 (S. Tucker ed. 1803); see also W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the United States of America 125-126 (2d ed. 1829); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">[561 U.S. 770]</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">the United States \u00a7 1890, p. 746 (1833) (\u201cThe right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">By the 1850\u2019s, the perceived threat that had prompted the inclusion of the Second Amendment in the Bill of Rights\u2014the fear that the National Government would disarm the universal militia\u2014had largely faded as a popular concern, but the right to keep and bear arms was highly valued for purposes of self-defense. See M. Doubler, Civilian in Peace, Soldier in War 87-90 (2003); Amar, Bill of Rights 258-259. Abolitionist authors wrote in support of the right. See L. Spooner, The Unconstitutionality of Slavery 66 (1860); J. Tiffany, A Treatise on the Unconstitutionality of American Slavery 117-118 (1849). And when attempts were made to disarm \u201cFree-Soilers\u201d in \u201cBloody Kansas,\u201d Senator Charles Sumner, who later played a leading role in the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, proclaimed that \u201c[n]ever was [the rifle] more needed in just self-defense than now in Kansas.\u201d The Crime Against Kansas: The Apologies for the Crime: The True Remedy, Speech of Hon. Charles Sumner in the Senate of the United States 64-65 (1856). Indeed, the 1856 Republican Party Platform protested that in Kansas the constitutional rights of the people had been \u201cfraudulently and violently taken from them\u201d and the \u201cright of the people to keep and bear arms\u201d had been \u201cinfringed.\u201d National Party Platforms 1840-1972, p. 27 (D. Johnson &amp; K. Porter comp. 5th ed. 1973).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">[561 U.S. 771]</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">After the Civil War, many of the over 180,000 African-Americans who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>served in the Union Army returned to the States of the old Confederacy, where systematic efforts were made to disarm them and other blacks.

The laws of some States formally prohibited African-Americans from possessing firearms.

In the first session of the 39th Congress, Senator Henry Wilson told his colleagues: \u201cIn Mississippi rebel State forces, men who were in the rebel armies, are traversing the State, visiting the freedmen, disarming them, perpetrating murders and outrages upon them; and the same things are done in other sections of the country.\u201d 39th Cong. Globe 40 (1865). The Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction\u2014which was widely reprinted in the press and distributed by Members of the 39th Congress to their constituents shortly after Congress approved the Fourteenth Amendment<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\u2014contained numerous examples of such abuses.

As Senator Wilson put it during the debate on a failed proposal to disband Southern militias: \u201cThere is one unbroken chain of testimony from all people that are loyal to this country, that the greatest outrages are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>perpetrated by armed men who go up and down the country searching houses, disarming people, committing outrages of every kind and description.\u201d 39th Cong.

Its efforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms demonstrate that the right was still recognized to be fundamental.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">The most explicit evidence of Congress\u2019 aim appears in \u00a7 14 of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of 1866, which provided that \u201cthe right ... to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal, <em>including the constitutional right to bear </em>arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all the citizens . . . without respect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.\u201d 14 Stat. 176-177 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that \u201call the citizens,\u201d black and white, would have \u201cthe constitutional right to bear arms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">[561 U.S. 774]</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which was considered at the same time as the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act, similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to keep and bear arms.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act guaranteed the \u201cfull and equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This language was virtually identical to language in \u00a7 14 of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act, 14 Stat. 176 (\u201cthe right ... to have full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal\u201d). And as noted, the latter provision went on to explain that one of the \u201claws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal\u201d was \u201cthe constitutional right to bear arms.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Representative Bingham believed that the Civil Rights Act protected the same rights as enumerated in the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau bill, which of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep</p>\n<p id=\"Auz-\">[561 U.S. 775]</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">and bear arms. 39th Cong. Globe 1292. The unavoidable conclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act, aimed to protect \u201cthe constitutional right to bear arms\u201d and not simply to prohibit discrimination. See also Amar, Bill of Rights 264-265 (noting that one of the \u201ccore purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the Fourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances\u201d of freedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to \u201caffirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self-defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative remedies insufficient. Southern resistance, Presidential vetoes, and this Court\u2019s pre-Civil-War precedent persuaded Congress that a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide full protection for the rights of blacks.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Today, it is generally accepted that  the Fourteenth Amendment was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil Rights Act of 1866. See <em>General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>458 U.S. 375, 389, 102 S. Ct. 3141, 73 L. Ed. 2d 835 (1982); see also Amar, Bill of Rights 187; Calabresi &amp; Fine, Two Cheers for Professor Balkin\u2019s Originalism, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 663, 669-670 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">In debating the Fourteenth Amendment, the 39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fundamental right deserving of protection. Senator Samuel Pomeroy described three \u201cindispensable\u201d \u201csafeguards of liberty under our form of Government.\u201d 39th Cong. Globe 1182. One of these, he said, was the right to keep and bear arms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-9\">\u201cEvery man . . . should have the right to bear arms for the defense of himself and family and his homestead. And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken open</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZlT\">[561 U.S. 776]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-10\">and the intruder enters for purposes as vile as were known to slavery, then should a well-loaded musket be in the hand of the occupant to send the polluted wretch to another world, where his wretchedness will forever remain complete.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>Even those who thought the Fourteenth Amendment unnecessary believed that blacks, as citizens, \u201chave equal right to protection, and to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1073 (Sen. James Nye); see also Foner 258-259.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Evidence from the period immediately following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment only confirms that the right to keep and bear arms was considered fundamental. In an 1868 speech addressing the disarmament of freedmen, Representative Stevens emphasized the necessity of the right: \u201cDisarm a community and you rob them of the means of defending life. Take away their weapons of defense and you take away the inalienable right of defending liberty.\u201d \u201cThe fourteenth amendment, now so happily adopted, settles the whole question.\u201d Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967. And in debating the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to the right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued disarmament of blacks in the South. See Halbrook, Freedmen 120-131. Finally, legal commentators from the period emphasized the fundamental nature of the right. See, <em>e.g., </em>T. Farrar, Manual of the Constitution of the United States of America \u00a7 118, p. 145 (1867);</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">[561 U.S. 777]</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional Law of the United States \u00a7 239, pp. 152-153 (3d ed. 1875).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">The right to keep and bear arms was also widely protected by state constitutions at the time when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1868, 22 of the 37 States in the Union had state constitutional provisions explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms. See Calabresi &amp; Agudo, Individual Rights Under State Constitutions When the Fourteenth Amendment Was Ratified in 1868: What Rights Are Deeply Rooted in American History and Tradition? 87 Texas L. Rev. 7, 50 (2008).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Quite a few of these state constitutional guarantees, moreover, explicitly protected the right to keep and bear arms as an individual right to self-defense. See Ala. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 28 (1868); Conn. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 17 (1818); Ky. Const., Art. XIII, \u00a7 25 (1850); Mich. Const., Art. XVIII, \u00a7 7 (1850); Miss. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 15 (1868); Mo. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8 (1865); Tex. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 13 (1869); see also Mont. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 13 (1889); Wash. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 24 (1889); Wyo. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 24 (1889); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McAdams, </em>714 P.2d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986). What is more, state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruction era by former Confederate States included a right to keep and bear arms. See, <em>e.g., </em>Ark. Const., Art. I, \u00a75 (1868); Miss. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 15 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 13 (1869). A clear majority of the States in 1868, therefore, recognized the right to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>and bear arms as being among the foundational rights necessary to our system of government.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\">[561 U.S. 778]</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">In sum, it is clear that  the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents contend that Congress, in the years immediately following the Civil War, merely sought to outlaw \u201cdiscriminatory measures taken against freedmen, which it addressed by adopting a non-discrimination principle\u201d and that even an outright ban on the possession of firearms was regarded as acceptable, \u201cso long as it was not done in a discriminatory manner.\u201d Brief for Municipal Respondents 7. They argue that Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cas an antidiscrimination rule,\u201d and they cite statements to the effect that the section would outlaw discriminatory measures. <em>Id., </em>at 64. This argument is implausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">First, while \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains \u201can antidis-crimination rule,\u201d namely, the Equal Protection Clause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that \u00a7 1 does no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were so, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States, would not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the rights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the Fourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not prohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only discriminatory searches and seizures\u2014and so on. We assume that this is not municipal respondents\u2019 view, so what they must mean is that the Second Amendment should be singled out for</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">[561 U.S. 779]</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">special\u2014and specially unfavorable\u2014treatment. We reject that suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">Second, municipal respondents\u2019 argument ignores the clear terms of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act of 1866, which acknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms. If that law had used language such as \u201cthe equal benefit of laws concerning the bearing of arms,\u201d it would be possible to interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimination. But \u00a7 14 speaks of and protects \u201cthe constitutional right to bear arms,\u201d an unmistakable reference to the right protected by the Second Amendment. And it protects the \u201cfull and equal benefit\u201d of this right in the States. 14 Stat. 176-177. It would have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a constitutional right that does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude, African-Americans in the South would likely have remained vulnerable to attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>by many of their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace officers. In the years immediately following the Civil War, a law banning the possession of guns by all private citizens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the formal sense. Any such law\u2014like the Chicago and Oak Park ordinances challenged here\u2014presumably would have permitted the possession of guns by those acting under the authority of the State and would thus have left firearms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers. And as the Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction revealed, see <em>supra, </em>at 772, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 917-918, those groups were widely involved in harassing blacks in the South.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Fourth, municipal respondents\u2019 purely antidiscrimination theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the plight of whites in the South who opposed the Black Codes. If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had simply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the bearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have been left without</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">[561 U.S. 780]</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">the means of self-defense\u2014as had abolitionists in Kansas in the 1850\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Fifth, the 39th Congress\u2019 response to proposals to disband and disarm the Southern militias is instructive. Despite recognizing and deploring the abuses of these militias, the 39th Congress balked at a proposal to disarm them. See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Hal-brook, Freedmen 20-21. Disarmament, it was argued, would violate the members\u2019 right to bear arms, and it was ultimately decided to disband the militias but not to disarm their members. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \u00a7 6, 14 Stat. 487; Halbrook, Freedmen 68-69; Cramer 858-861. It cannot be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">Municipal respondents\u2019 remaining arguments are at war with our central holding in <em>Heller, </em>that the Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense within the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us to treat the right recognized in <em>Heller </em>as a second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be incorporated into the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Municipal respondents\u2019 main argument is nothing less than a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation precedent and return (presumably for this case only) to a bygone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due Process Clause protects only those rights \u201c \u2018recognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and universal sense of [their] justice.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Municipal Respondents 9 (quoting <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co., </em>166 U.S., at 238, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979). According to municipal respondents, if it is possible to imagine <em>any </em>civilized legal system that does not recognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause does not make that right binding</p>\n<p id=\"AXB9\">[561 U.S. 781]</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">on the States. Brief for Municipal Respondents 9. Therefore, municipal respondents continue, because such countries as England, Canada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit handgun ownership, it must follow that no right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>possess such weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id., </em>at 21-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the long-established standard we apply in incorporation cases. See <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 149, and n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491. And the present-day implications of municipal respondents\u2019 argument are stunning. For example, many of the rights that our Bill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal offenses are virtually unique to this country.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> If <em>our </em>understanding of the right to a jury trial, the right against self-incrimination,</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">[561 U.S. 782]</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">and the right to counsel were necessary attributes of <em>any </em>civilized country, it would follow that the United States is the only civilized Nation in the world.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Municipal respondents attempt to salvage their position by suggesting that their argument applies only to substantive as opposed to procedural rights. Brief for Municipal Respondents 10, n. 3. But even in this trimmed form, municipal respondents\u2019 argument flies in the face of more than a half century of precedent. For example, in <em>Everson </em>v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing, </em>330 U.S. 1, 8, 67 S. Ct. 504, 91 L. Ed. 711 (1947), the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Yet several of the countries that municipal respondents recognize as civilized have established state churches.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> If we were to adopt municipal respondents\u2019 theory, all of this Court\u2019s Establishment Clause precedents involving actions taken by state and local governments would go by the boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>Municipal respondents maintain that the Second Amendment differs from all of the other provisions of the Bill of Rights because it concerns the right to possess a deadly implement and thus has implications for public safety. Brief for Municipal Respondents 11. And they note that there is intense disagreement on the question whether the private</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">[561 U.S. 783]</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">possession of guns in the home increases or decreases gun deaths and injuries. <em>Id., </em>at 11, 13-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">The right to keep and bear arms, however, is not the only constitutional right that has controversial public safety implications. All of the constitutional provisions that impose restrictions on law enforcement and on the prosecution of crimes fall into the same category. See, <em>e.g., Hudson </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 591, 126 S. Ct. 2159, 165 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2006) (\u201cThe exclusionary rule generates \u2018substantial social costs,\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 907 [104 S. Ct. 3405, 82 L. Ed. 2d 677] (1984), which sometimes include setting the guilty free and the dangerous at large\u201d); <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 522, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972) (reflecting on the serious consequences of dismissal for a speedy trial violation, which means \u201ca defendant who may be guilty of a serious crime will go free\u201d); <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 517, 86 S.

Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081. Municipal respondents cite no case in which we have refrained from holding that a provision of the Bill of Rights is binding on the States on the ground that the right at issue has disputed public safety implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">We likewise reject municipal respondents\u2019 argument that we should depart from our established incorporation methodology on the ground that making the Second Amendment binding on the States and their subdivisions is inconsistent with principles of federalism and will stifle experimentation. Municipal respondents point out\u2014quite correctly\u2014 that conditions and problems differ from locality to locality and that citizens in different jurisdictions have divergent views on the issue of gun control. Municipal respondents therefore urge us to allow state and local governments to enact any gun control law that they deem to be reasonable, including a complete ban on the possession of handguns in the home for self-defense. Brief for Municipal Respondents 18-20, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">[561 U.S. 784]</p>\n<p id=\"b970-10\">There is nothing new in the argument that, in order to respect federalism and allow useful state experimentation, a federal constitutional right should not be fully binding on the States. This argument was made repeatedly and eloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the concept of incorporation and urged retention of the two-track approach to incorporation. Throughout the era of \u201cselective incorporation,\u201d Justice Harlan in particular, invoking the values of federalism and state experimentation, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the two-track approach. See, <em>e.g., Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 500-503, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1498 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result in part and dissenting in part); <em>Mapp, supra, </em>at 678-680, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L.

Unless we turn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test applicable only to the Second Amendment, municipal respondents\u2019 argument must be rejected. Under our precedents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an American perspective, then, unless <em>stare decisis </em>counsels otherwise,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AkHz\">[561 U.S. 785]</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">that guarantee is fully binding on the States and thus <em>limits </em>(but by no means eliminates) their ability to devise solutions to social problems that suit local needs and values. As noted by the 38 States that have appeared in this case as <em>amici </em>supporting petitioners, \u201c[s\u00edtate and local experimentation with reasonable firearms regulations will continue under the Second Amendment.\u201d Brief for State of Texas et al. 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">Municipal respondents and their <em>amici </em>complain that incorporation of the Second Amendment right will lead to extensive and costly litigation, but this argument applies with even greater force to constitutional rights and remedies that have already been held to be binding on the States. Consider the exclusionary rule. Although the exclusionary rule \u201cis not an individual right,\u201d <em>Herring </em>v. <em>United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 141, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496 (2009), but a \u201cjudicially created rule,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 139, 129 S. Ct. 695, 172 L. Ed. 2d 496, this Court made the rule applicable to the States. <em>See Mapp, supra, </em>at 660, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081. The exclusionary rule is said to result in \u201ctens of thousands of contested suppression motions each year.\u201d Stuntz, The Virtues and Vices of the Exclusionary Rule, 20 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 443, 444 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Municipal respondents assert that, although most state constitutions protect firearms rights, state courts have held that these rights are subject to \u201cinterest-balancing\u201d and have sustained a variety of restrictions. Brief for Municipal Respondents 23-31. In <em>Heller, </em>however, we expressly rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>the argument that the scope of the Second Amendment right should be determined by judicial interest balancing, 554 U.S., at 633-635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637, and this Court decades ago</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">[561 U.S. 786]</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">abandoned \u201cthe notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights,\u201d <em>Malloy, supra, </em>at 10-11, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">As evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment has not historically been understood to restrict the authority of the States to regulate firearms, municipal respondents and supporting <em>amici </em>cite a variety of state and local firearms laws that courts have upheld. But what is most striking about their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining bans comparable to those at issue here and in <em>Heller. </em>Municipal respondents cite precisely one case (from the late 20th century) in which such a ban was sustained. See Brief for Municipal Respondents 26-27 (citing <em>Kalodimos </em>v. <em>Morton Grove, </em>103 Ill. 2d 483, 470 N.E.2d 266 (1984)); see also Reply Brief for Respondent NRA et al. 23, n. 7 (asserting that no other court has ever upheld a complete ban on the possession of handguns). It is important to keep in mind that <em>Heller, </em>while striking down a law that prohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recognized that the right to keep and bear arms is not \u201ca right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\u201d 554 U.S., at 626, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. We made it clear in <em>Heller </em>that our holding did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory measures as \u201cprohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\u201d \u201claws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 626-627, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d at 678. We repeat those assurances here. Despite municipal respondents\u2019 doomsday proclamations, incorporation does not imperil every law regulating firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to keep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in the first eight Amendments \u201cbecause the reason for codifying the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs from the</p>\n<p id=\"A5cn\">[561 U.S. 787]</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in self-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Brief for Municipal Respondents 36-37. Municipal respondents suggest that the Second Amendment right differs from the rights heretofore incorporated because the latter were \u201cvalued for [their] own sake.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 33. But we have never previously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on whether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value, and quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorporated\u2014for example the right to counsel and the right to confront and subpoena witnesses\u2014are clearly instrumental by any measure. Moreover, this contention repackages one of the chief arguments that we rejected in <em>Heller, i.e., </em>that the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined by the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that right in the Bill of Rights. In <em>Heller, </em>we recognized that the codification of this right was prompted by fear that the Federal Government would disarm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>and thus disable the militias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was valued only as a means of preserving the militias. 554 U.S., at 598-599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. On the contrary, we stressed that the right was also valued because the possession of firearms was thought to be essential for self-defense. As we put it, self-defense was \u201cthe <em>central component </em>of the right itself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">We turn, finally, to the two dissenting opinions. Justice Stevens\u2019 eloquent opinion covers ground already addressed, and therefore little need be added in response. Justice Stevens would \u201c \u2018ground the prohibitions against state action squarely on due process, without intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amendments.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>at 865, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 974 (quoting <em>Malloy, </em>378 U.S., at 24, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (Harlan, J., dissenting)). The question presented in this case, in his view, \u201cis whether the particular</p>\n<p id=\"AUYD\">[561 U.S. 788]</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">right asserted by petitioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 883, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 986. He would hold that \u201c [t]he rights protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause need not be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected against Federal Government infringement by the various provisions of the Bill of Rights.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 866, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">As we have explained, the Court, for the past half century, has moved away from the two-track approach. If we were now to accept Justice Stevens\u2019 theory across the board, decades of decisions would be undermined. We assume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged instead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for the individual right that <em>Heller </em>recognized, over vigorous dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">The relationship between the Bill of Rights\u2019 guarantees and the States must be governed by a single, neutral principle. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Brennan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as \u201cthe notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.\u201d <em>Malloy, supra, </em>10-11, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">Justice Breyer\u2019s dissent makes several points to which we briefly respond. To begin, while there is certainly room for disagreement about <em>Heller\u2019s </em>analysis of the history of the right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since <em>Heller </em>persuades us to reopen the question there decided. Few other questions of original meaning have been as thoroughly explored.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">Justice Breyer\u2019s conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate the right to keep and bear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First, \u201cthere is no popular consensus\u201d that the right is fundamental, <em>post, </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">[561 U.S. 789]</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">920, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1009; second, the right does not protect minorities or persons neglected by those holding political power, <em>post, </em>at 921-922, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1009-1010; third, incorporation of the Second Amendment right would \u201camount to a significant incursion on a traditional and important area of state concern, alter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>ing the constitutional relationship between the States and the Federal Government\u201d and preventing local variations, <em>ibid.; </em>and fourth, determining the scope of the Second Amendment right in cases involving state and local laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical questions regarding matters that are outside their area of expertise, <em>post, </em>at 922-927, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1010-1013. Even if we believed that these factors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of these factors undermines the case for incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of Rights applies to the States only if there is a \u201cpopular consensus\u201d that the right is fundamental, and we see no basis for such a rule. But in this case, as it turns out, there is evidence of such a consensus. An <em>amicus </em>brief submitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members of the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the right to keep and bear arms is fundamental. See Brief for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchi-son et al. 4. Another brief submitted by 38 States takes the same position. Brief for State of Texas et al. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Second, petitioners and many others who live in high-crime areas dispute the proposition that the Second Amendment right does not protect minorities and those lacking political clout. The plight of Chicagoans living in high-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illinois legislators representing Chicago districts called on the Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to patrol the City\u2019s streets.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The legislators noted that the number of Chicago homicide victims during the current year equaled the number of</p>\n<p id=\"AkGT\">[561 U.S. 790]</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">American soldiers killed during that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that 80% of the Chicago victims were black.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Amici </em>supporting incorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend that the right is especially important for women and members of other groups that may be especially vulnerable to violent crime.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If, as petitioners believe, their safety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the community would be enhanced by the possession of handguns in the home for self-defense, then the Second Amendment right protects the rights of minorities and other residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not being met by elected public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Third, Justice Breyer is correct that incorporation of the Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the legislative freedom of the States, but this is always true when a Bill of Rights provision is incorporated. Incorporation always restricts experimentation and local variations, but that has not stopped the Court from incorporating virtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. \u201c[T]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 636, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. This conclusion is no more remarkable with respect to the Second Amendment than it is with respect to all the other limitations on state power found in the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Finally, Justice Breyer is incorrect that incorporation will require judges to assess the costs and benefits of firearms</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">[561 U.S. 791]</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical judgments in an area in which they lack expertise. As we have noted, while his opinion in <em>Heller </em>recommended an interest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that suggestion. See <em>supra, </em>at 785-786, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 925-926. \u201cThe very enumeration of the right takes out of the hands of government\u2014even the Third Branch of Government\u2014the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is <em>really worth </em>insisting upon.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>at 634, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"pA_k-\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"42\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAR8AAAAqAQAAAACi7GJKAAAAmElEQVR4nO2UMQpCMRBEJ8HCTi8gXkQ8mzcSO8tfeADPYGcldhaSZ/ERB3bhW4hVtnvDTLK7hBQ0WdRpj9RN3fQ2DS4lAMAaqwDtxz2dV7uPkkCVpKPJGVRJ2jxNzwDgfrB5IjQBtIXpEcYVlKXdkAHAY2/hCONJ12LhBKokXeY2dgJVkk4zC2cAcNtaGxHan19B6T/dV6YXzx3mJP0ujcgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"286\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">In <em>Heller, </em>we held that the Second Amendment protects the right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose of self-defense. Unless considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>counsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights that protects a right that is fundamental from an American perspective applies equally to the Federal Government and the States. See <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 149, and n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491. We therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right recognized in <em>Heller. </em>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-14\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-11\">.

Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated that the Amendment protected all of \u201cthe personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.\u2019\u2019 Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong. Globe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text of \u00a7 1, said that the Amendment would \u201carm the Congress . . . with the power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today.\u2019\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 1088; see also <em>id., </em>at 1089-1090; A. Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill of Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained the view that the rights guaranteed by \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201care chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\u2019\u2019 Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84 (1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader of the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that \u201cthe Constitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation on the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.\u2019\u2019 39th Cong. Globe 2459; see also M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights 112 (1986) (counting at least 30 statements during the debates in Congress interpreting \u00a7 1 to incorporate the Bill of Rights); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as <em>Amici Curiae </em>20 (collecting authorities and stating that \u201c[n]ot a single senator or representative disputed [the incorporationist] understanding\u2019\u2019 of the Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b957-11\">. The municipal respondents and some of their <em>amici </em>dispute the significance of these statements.

They question whether there is sound evidence of \u201c \u2018any strong public awareness of nationalizing the <em>entire </em>Bill of Rights.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Brief for Municipal Respondents 69 (quoting Wildenthal, Nationalizing the Bill of Rights: Revisiting the Original Understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866-67, 68 Ohio St. L. J. 1509, 1600 (2007)). Scholars have also disputed the total incorporation theory. See, <em>e.g., </em>Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949); Berger, Incorporation of the Bill of Rights in the Fourteenth Amendment: A Nine-Lived Cat, 42 Ohio St. L. J. 435 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">Proponents of the view that \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment makes all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States respond that the terms privileges, immunities, and rights were used interchangeably at the time, see, <em>e.g., </em>Curtis, <em>supra, </em>at 64-65, and that the position taken by the leading congressional proponents of the Amendment was widely publicized and understood, see, <em>e.g., </em>Wildenthal, <em>supra, </em>1564-1565, 1590; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of 1866-1868, 30 Whittier L.

There is one exception to this general rule. The Court has held that although the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unanimous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a unanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials. See <em>Apodaca </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>406 U.S. 404, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972); see also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unanimous jury verdicts in state criminal trials). But that ruling was the result of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement of the two-track approach to incorporation. In <em>Apodaca, </em>eight Justices agreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the Federal Government and the States. See <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 395, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Justices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unanimous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, <em>Apodaca, </em>406 U.S., at 406, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the view that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in federal and state criminal trials, <em>id., </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>414-415, 92 S.

Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded that the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not state, cases. <em>Apodaca, </em>therefore, does not undermine the well-established rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply identically to the States and the Federal Government. See <em>Johnson, supra, </em>at 395-396, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L.

Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008). I can find no other explanation for such certitude except that Justice Stevens, despite his forswearing of \u201cpersonal and private notions,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 878, 177 L.

The ability of omnidirectional guideposts to constrain is inversely proportional to their number. But even individually, each lodestar or limitation he lists either is incapable of restraining judicial whimsy or cannot be squared with the precedents he seeks to preserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">He begins with a brief nod to history, <em>post, </em>at 877-878, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 982-983, but as he has just made clear, he thinks historical inquiry unavailing, <em>post, </em>at 875-877, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 980-982. Moreover, trusting the meaning of the Due Process Clause to what has historically been protected is circular, see <em>post, </em>at 875-876, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 980-981, since that would mean no <em>new </em>rights could get in.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Justice Stevens moves on to the \u201cmost basic\u201d constraint on subjectivity his theory offers: that he would \u201cesche[w] attempts to provide any all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of \u2018liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>at 878, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 982. The notion that the absence of a coherent theory of the Due Process Clause will somehow <em>curtail </em>judicial caprice is at war with reason. Indeterminacy means opportunity for courts to impose whatever rule they like; it is the problem, not the solution. The idea that interpretive pluralism would <em>reduce </em>courts\u2019 ability to impose their will on the ignorant masses is not merely naive, but absurd. If there are no right answers, there are no wrong answers either.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Justice Stevens also argues that requiring courts to show \u201crespect for the democratic process\u201d should serve as a constraint. <em>Post, </em>at 880, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 983. That is true, but Justice Stevens would have them show respect in an extraordinary manner. In his view, if a right \u201cis already being given careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In other words, a right, such as the right to keep and bear arms, that has long been recognized but on which the States are considering restrictions, apparently deserves <em>less </em>protection, while a privilege the political branches (instruments of the democratic process) have withheld entirely and continue to withhold, deserves <em>more. </em>That topsy-turvy approach</p>\n<p id=\"A8N\">[561 U.S. 796]</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">conveniently accomplishes the objective of ensuring that the rights this Court held protected in <em>Casey, Lawrence, </em>and other such cases fit the theory\u2014 but at the cost of insulting rather than respecting the democratic process.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">The next constraint Justice Stevens suggests is harder to evaluate. He describes as \u201can important tool for guiding judicial discretion\u201d \u201csensitivity to the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of contemporary society.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 880, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 984. I cannot say whether that sensitivity will really guide judges because I have no idea what it is. Is it some sixth sense instilled in judges when they ascend to the bench? Or does it mean judges are more constrained when they agonize about the cosmic conflict between liberty and its potentially harmful consequences? Attempting to give the concept more precision, Justice Stevens explains that \u201csensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the need to approach our work with humility and caution.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 881, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 984. Both traits are undeniably admirable, though what relation they bear to sensitivity is a mystery. But it makes no difference, for the first case Justice Stevens cites in support, see <em>ibid.., Casey, </em>505 U.S., at 849, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674, dispels any illusion that he has a meaningful form of judicial modesty in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Justice Stevens offers no examples to illustrate the next constraint: <em>stare decisis, post, </em>at 881, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 984. But his view of it is surely not very confining, since he holds out as a \u201ccanonical\u201d exemplar of the proper approach, see <em>post, </em>at 873, 909, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 979, 1002, <em>Lawrence, </em>which overruled a case decided a mere 17 years earlier, <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1986), see 539 U.S., at 578, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (it \u201cwas not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today\u201d). Moreover, Justice Stevens would apply that constraint unevenly: He ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>parently approves those Warren Court cases that adopted jot-for-jot incorporation of procedural protections for criminal defendants, <em>post, </em>at 868, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 976, but would abandon those Warren Court rulings that undercut his</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">[561 U.S. 797]</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">approach to substantive rights, on the basis that we have \u201ccut back\u201d on cases from that era before, <em>post, </em>at 869, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 977.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Justice Stevens also relies on the requirement of a \u201ccareful description of the asserted fundamental liberty interest\u201d to limit judicial discretion. <em>Post, </em>at 882, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 985 (internal quotation marks omitted). I certainly agree with that requirement, <em>see Reno </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1993), though some cases Justice Stevens approves have not applied it seriously, see, <em>e.g., Lawrence, supra, </em>at 562, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (\u201cThe instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions\u201d). But if the \u201ccareful description\u201d requirement is used in the manner we have hitherto employed, then the enterprise of determining the Due Process Clause\u2019s \u201cconceptual core,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 879, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 983, is a waste of time. In the cases he cites we sought a careful, specific description of the right at issue in order to determine <em>whether that right, thus narrowly defined, was fundamental. See, e.g., Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 722-728, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772; <em>Reno, supra, </em>at 302-306, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 125-129, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1992); <em>Cruzan </em>v. <em>Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, </em>497 U.S. 261, 269-279, 110 S. Ct. 2841, 111 L. Ed. 2d 224 (1990); see also <em>Vacco </em>v. <em>Quill, </em>521 U.S. 793, 801-808, 117 S. Ct. 2293, 138 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1997). The threshold step of defining the asserted right with precision is entirely unnecessary, however, if (as Justice Stevens maintains) the \u201cconceptual core\u201d of the \u201cliberty clause,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 879, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 983, includes a number of capacious, hazily defined categories. There is no need to define the right with much precision in order to conclude that it pertains to the plaintiffs \u201cability independently to define [his] identity,\u201d his \u201cright to make certain unusually important decisions that will affect his own, or his family\u2019s, destiny,\u201d or some aspect of his \u201c[s] elf-determination, bodily integrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political equality, dignity [or] respect.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 879, 880, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 983, 984. (internal quotation marks omitted). Justice Stevens must therefore have in mind some other use for the careful-description</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">[561 U.S. 798]</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">requirement\u2014perhaps just as a means of ensuring that courts \u201cprocee[d] slowly and incrementally,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 881, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 984. But that could be achieved just as well by having them draft their opinions in longhand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">If Justice Stevens\u2019 account of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>constraints of his approach did not demonstrate that they do not exist, his application of that approach to the case before us leaves no doubt. He offers several reasons for concluding that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not fundamental enough to be applied against the States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> None is persuasive, but more pertinent to my purpose, each is either intrinsically indeterminate, would preclude incorporation of rights we have already held incorporated, or both. His approach</p>\n<p id=\"A-GB\">[561 U.S. 799]</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">therefore does nothing to stop a judge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Justice Stevens begins with the odd assertion that \u201cfirearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship to liberty,\u201d since sometimes they are used to cause (or sometimes accidentally produce) injury to others. <em>Post, </em>at 891, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 990. The source of the rule that only nonam-bivalent liberties deserve due process protection is never explained\u2014proof that judges applying Justice Stevens\u2019 approach can add new elements to the test as they see fit. The criterion, moreover, is inherently manipulable. Surely Justice Stevens does not mean that the Clause covers only rights that have <em>zero </em>harmful effect on <em>anyone. </em>Otherwise even the First Amendment is out. Maybe what he means is that the right to keep and bear arms imposes <em>too great </em>a risk to others\u2019 physical well-being. But as the plurality explains, <em>ante, </em>at 782-783, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 924, other rights we have already held incorporated pose similarly substantial risks to public safety. In all events, Justice Stevens supplies neither a standard for how severe the impairment on others\u2019 liberty must be for a right to be disqualified, nor (of course) any method of measuring the severity.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Justice Stevens next suggests that the Second Amendment right is not fundamental because it is \u201cdifferent in kind\u201d from other rights we have recognized. <em>Post, </em>at 893, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 992. In one respect, of course, the right to keep and bear arms <em>is </em>different from some other rights we have held the Clause protects and he would recognize: It is deeply grounded in our Nation\u2019s history and tradition. But Justice Stevens has a different distinction in mind: Even though he does \u201cnot doubt for a moment that many Americans . . . see [firearms] as critical to their way of life as well as to their security,\u201d he pronounces that owning a handgun is not \u201ccritical to leading a life of autonomy, dignity, or political equality.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">[561 U.S. 800]</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">Who says? Deciding what is essential to an enlightened, liberty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>filled life is an inherently political, moral judgment\u2014the antithesis of an objective approach that reaches conclusions by applying neutral rules to verifiable evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">No determination of what rights the Constitution of the United States covers would be complete, of course, without a survey of what <em>other </em>countries do. <em>Post, </em>at 895-896, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 993-994. When it comes to guns, Justice Stevens explains, our Nation is <em>already </em>an outlier among \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d; not even our \u201coldest allies\u201d protect as robust a right as we do, and we should not widen the gap. <em>Ibid. </em>Never mind that he explains neither which countries qualify as \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d nor why others are irrelevant. For there is an even clearer indication that this criterion lets judges pick which rights States must respect and those they can ignore: As the plurality shows, <em>ante, </em>at 781-782, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 923, and nn. 28-29, this follow-the-foreign-crowd requirement would foreclose rights</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">[561 U.S. 801]</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">that we have held (and Justice Stevens accepts) are incorporated, but that other\u201cadvanced\u201d nations do not recognize\u2014from the exclusionary rule to the Establishment Clause. Ajudge applying Justice Stevens\u2019 approach must either throw all of those rights overboard or, as cases Justice Stevens approves have done in considering unenumerated rights, simply ignore foreign law when it undermines the desired conclusion, see, <em>e.g., Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (making no mention of foreign law).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Justice Stevens also argues that since the right to keep and bear arms was <em>codified </em>for the purpose of \u201cprevent [ing] elimination of the militia,\u201d it should be viewed as \u201c \u2018a federalism provision\u2019 \u201d logically incapable of incorporation. <em>Post, </em>at 897, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 994 (quoting <em>Elk Grove Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Newdow, </em>542 U.S. 1, 45, 124 S. Ct. 2301, 159 L. Ed. 2d 98 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); some internal quotation marks omitted). This criterion, too, evidently applies only when judges want it to. The opinion Justice Stevens quotes for the \u201cfederalism provision\u201d principle, Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence in <em>Newdow, </em>argued that incorporation of the Establishment Clause \u201cmakes little sense\u201d because that Clause was originally understood as a limit on congressional interference with state establishments of religion. <em>Id., </em>at 49-51, 124 S. Ct. 2301, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>159 L. Ed. 2d 98. Justice Stevens, of course, has no problem with applying the Establishment Clause to the States. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 8, n. 4, 124 S. Ct. 2301, 159 L. Ed. 2d 98 (opinion for the Court by Stevens, J.) (acknowledging that the Establishment Clause \u201capplies] to the States by incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d). While he insists <em>that </em>Clause is not a \u201cfederalism provision,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 897, n. 40, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 995, he does not explain why <em>it </em>is not, but the right to keep and bear arms <em>is </em>(even though only the latter refers to a \u201cright of the people\u201d). The \u201cfederalism\u201d argument prevents the incorporation of only <em>certain </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Justice Stevens next argues that even if the right to keep and bear arms is \u201cdeeply rooted in some important senses,\u201d the roots of States\u2019 efforts to regulate guns run just as deep. <em>Post, </em>at 899, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 996 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">[561 U.S. 802]</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">But this too is true of other rights we have held incorporated. No fundamental right\u2014not even the First Amendment\u2014is absolute. The traditional restrictions go to show the scope of the right, not its lack of fundamental character. At least that is what they show (Justice Stevens would agree) for <em>other </em>rights. Once again, principles are applied selectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">Justice Stevens\u2019 final reason for rejecting incorporation of the Second Amendment reveals, more clearly than any of the others, the game that is afoot. Assuming that there is a \u201cplausible constitutional basis\u201d for holding that the right to keep and bear arms is incorporated, he asserts that we ought not to do so <em>for prudential reasons. Post, </em>at 902, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 997. Even if we had the authority to withhold rights that are within the Constitution\u2019s command (and we assuredly do not), two of the reasons Justice Stevens gives for abstention show just how much power he would hand to judges. The States\u2019 \u201cright to experiment\u201d with solutions to the problem of gun violence, he says, is at its apex here because \u201cthe best solution is far from clear.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 902-903, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 998 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is true of most serious social problems\u2014 whether, for example, \u201cthe best solution\u201d for rampant crime is to admit confessions unless they are affirmatively shown to have been coerced, but see <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444-445, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), or to permit jurors to impose the death penalty without a requirement that they be free to consider \u201cany relevant mitigating factor,\u201d see <em>Eddings </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. 104, 112, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982), which in turn leads to the conclusion that defense counsel has provided inadequate defense if he has not conducted a \u201creasonable investigation\u201d into potentially mitigating factors, see, <em>e.g., Wiggins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 534, 123 S. Ct. 2527, 156 L. Ed. 2d 471 (2003), inquiry into which question tends to destroy any prospect of prompt justice, see, <em>e.g., Wong </em>v. <em>Belmontes, </em>558 U.S. 15, 130 S. Ct. 383, 175 L. Ed. 2d 328 (2009) <em>(per curiam) </em>(reversing grant of habeas relief for sentencing on a crime committed in 1981). The obviousness of the optimal answer is</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">[561 U.S. 803]</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">in the eye of the beholder. The implication of Justice Stevens\u2019 call for abstention is that if We The Court conclude that They The People\u2019s answers to a problem are silly, we are free to \u201cinterven [e],\u201d <em>post, </em>at 902, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 997, but if we too are uncertain of the right answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>or merely think the States may be on to something, we can loosen the leash.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">A second reason Justice Stevens says we should abstain is that the States have shown they are \u201ccapable\u201d of protecting the right at issue, and if anything have protected it too much. <em>Post, </em>at 904, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 999. That reflects an assumption that judges can distinguish between a <em>proper </em>democratic decision to leave things alone (which we should honor), and a case of democratic market failure (which we should step in to correct). I would not\u2014and no judge should\u2014presume to have that sort of omniscience, which seems to me far more \u201carrogant,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 896, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 994, than confining courts\u2019 focus to our own national heritage.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Justice Stevens\u2019 response to this concurrence, <em>post, </em>at 906-911, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1000-1003, makes the usual rejoinder of \u201cliving Constitution\u201d advocates to the criticism that it empowers judges to eliminate or expand what the people have prescribed: The traditional, historically focused method, he says, reposes discretion in judges as well.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Historical analysis can be difficult; it sometimes requires resolving threshold questions, and making nuanced</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">[561 U.S. 804]</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">judgments about which evidence to consult and how to interpret it.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">I will stipulate to that.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But the question to be decided is not whether the historically focused method is a <em>perfect means </em>of restraining aristocratic judicial Constitution-writing; but whether it is the <em>best means available </em>in an imperfect world. Or indeed, even more narrowly than that: whether it is demonstrably much better than what Justice Stevens proposes. I think it beyond all serious dispute that it is much less subjective, and intrudes much less upon the democratic process. It is less subjective because it depends upon a body of evidence susceptible of reasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague ethico-political First Principles whose combined conclusion can be found to point in any direction the judges favor.

Justice Stevens\u2019 approach, on the other hand, deprives the people of that power, since whatever the Constitution and laws may say, the list of protected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be. After all, he notes, the people have been wrong before, <em>post, </em>at 910, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1002, and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future.

The First Amendment freedom of speech is incorporated\u2014not the freedom to speak on Fridays, or to speak about philosophy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b980-12\">. Justice Stevens goes a step further still, suggesting that the right to keep and bear arms is not protected by the \u201cliberty clause\u201d because it is not really a liberty at all, but a \u201cproperty right.\u201d <em>Post, </em>at 894, 177 L.

Never mind that the right to bear arms sounds mighty like a liberty; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>and never mind that the \u201cliberty clause\u2019\u2019 is really a Due Process Clause which explicitly protects \u201cproperty,\u2019\u2019 see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlton, </em>512 U.S. 26, 41-42, 114 S.

Justice Stevens\u2019 theory cannot explain why the Takings Clause, which unquestionably protects property, has been incorporated, see <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>166 U.S. 226, 241, 17 S. Ct. 581, 41 L. Ed. 979 (1897), in a decision he appears to accept, <em>post, </em>at 871, n. 14, 177 L.

But that inquiry provides infinitely less scope for judicial invention when conducted under the Court\u2019s approach, since the field of candidates is <em>immensely </em>narrowed by the prior requirement that a right be rooted in this country\u2019s traditions. Justice Stevens, on the other hand, is free to scan the universe for rights that he thinks \u201cimplicit in the concept,\u2019\u2019 etc. The point Justice Stevens makes here is merely one example of his demand that a historical approach to the Constitution prove itself, not merely much better than his in restraining judicial invention, but utterly perfect in doing so. See Part III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b983-10\">. Justice Stevens also asserts that his approach is \u201cmore faithful to this Nation\u2019s constitutional history\u2019\u2019 and to \u201cthe values and commitments of the American people, as they stand today,\u2019\u2019 <em>post, </em>at 909, 177 L.

Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. The question in this case is whether the Constitution protects that right against abridgment by the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">As the Court explains, if this case were litigated before the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption in 1868, the answer to that question would be simple. In <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan </em>v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore, </em>7 Pet. 243, 8 L. Ed. 672 (1833), this Court held that the Bill of Rights applied only to the Federal Government. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall recalled that the founding generation added the first eight Amendments to the Constitution in response to An-tifederalist concerns regarding the extent of federal\u2014not state\u2014power, and held that if \u201cthe framers of these amendments [had] intended them to be limitations on the powers of the state governments,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">[561 U.S. 807]</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">\u201cthey would have declared this purpose in plain and intelligible <em>language.\u201dId., </em>at 250, 8 L. Ed. 751. Finding no such language in the Bill of Rights, Chief Justice Marshall held that it did not in any way restrict state authority. <em>Id., </em>at 248-250, 8 L. Ed. 751; see <em>Lessee of Livingston </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>7 Pet. 469, 551-552, 8 L. Ed. 751 (1833) (reaffirming <em>Barron\u2019s </em>holding); <em>Permoli </em>v. <em>Municipality No. 1 of New Orleans, </em>3 How. 589, 609-610, 11 L. Ed. 739 (1845) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Nearly three decades after <em>Barron, </em>the Nation was splintered by a civil war fought principally over the question of slavery. As was evident to many throughout our Nation\u2019s early history, slavery, and the measures designed to protect it, were irreconcilable with the principles of equality, government by consent, and inalienable rights proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence and embedded in our constitutional structure. See, <em>e.g., </em>3 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 212 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (remarks of Luther Martin) (\u201c[S]lavery is inconsistent with the genius of republicanism, and has a tendency to destroy those principles on which it is supported, as it lessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind\u201d (emphasis deleted)); A. Lincoln, Speech at Peoria, Ill. (Oct. 16, 1854), reprinted in 2 The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln 266 (R. Basler ed. 1953) (\u201c[N]o man is good enough to govern another man, <em>without that other\u2019s consent. </em>I say this is the leading principle\u2014the sheet anchor of American republicanism. ... Now the relation of masters and slaves is, <em>pro tanto, </em>a total violation of this principle\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">After the war, a series of constitutional amendments were adopted to repair the Nation from the damage slavery had caused. The provision at issue here, \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, significantly altered our system of government. The first sentence of that section provides that \u201c[a] 11 persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>wherein they reside.\u201d This unambiguously overruled this Court\u2019s contrary holding in <em>Dred Scott </em>v. <em>Sandford,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">[561 U.S. 808]</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">19 How. 393, 15 L. Ed. 691 (1857), that the Constitution did not recognize black Americans as citizens of the United States or their own State. <em>Id., </em>at 405-406, 15 L. Ed. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The meaning of \u00a7 l\u2019s next sentence has divided this Court for many years. That sentence begins with the command that \u201c[n]o State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d On its face, this appears to grant the persons just made United States citizens a certain collection of rights\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>privileges or immunities\u2014attributable to that status.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">This Court\u2019s precedents accept that point, but define the relevant collection of rights quite narrowly. In the <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>16 Wall. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394 (1873), decided just five years after the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption, the Court interpreted this text, now known as the Privileges or Immunities Clause, for the first time. In a closely divided decision, the Court drew a sharp distinction between the privileges and immunities of state citizenship and those of federal citizenship, and held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected only the latter category of rights from state abridgment. <em>Id., </em>at 78, 21 L. Ed. 394. The Court defined that category to include only those rights \u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 79, 21 L. Ed. 394. This arguably left open the possibility that certain individual rights enumerated in the Constitution could be considered privileges or immunities of federal citizenship. See <em>ibid- </em>(listing \u201c[t]he right to peaceably assemble\u201d and \u201cthe privilege of the writ of <em>ha-beas </em>corpus\u201d as rights potentially protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause). But the Court soon rejected that proposition, interpreting the Privileges or Immunities Clause even more narrowly in its later cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Chief among those cases is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruikshank, </em>92 U.S. 542, 23 L. Ed. 588 (1876). There, the Court held that members of a white militia who had brutally murdered as many as 165 black Louisianians congregating outside a courthouse had</p>\n<p id=\"AtsK\">[561 U.S. 809]</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">not deprived the victims of their privileges as American citizens to peaceably assemble or to keep and bear arms. <em>Ibid.; </em>see L. Keith, The Colfax Massacre 109 (2008). According to the Court, the right to peaceably assemble codified in the First Amendment was not a privilege of United States citizenship because \u201c [t]he right . . . existed long <em>before </em>the adoption of the Constitution.\u201d 92 U.S., at 551, 23 L. Ed. 588 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Court held that the right to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of United States citizenship because it was not \u201cin any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 553, 23 L. Ed. 588. In other words, the reason the Framers codified the right to bear arms in the Second Amendment\u2014its nature as an inalienable right that preexisted the Constitution\u2019s adoption\u2014 was the very reason citizens could not enforce it against States through the Fourteenth.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-11\">That circular reasoning effectively has been the Court\u2019s last word on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>Privileges or Immunities Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the intervening years, the Court has held that the Clause prevents state abridgment of only a handful of rights, such as the right to travel, see <em>Saenz </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>526 U.S. 489, 503, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689 (1999), that are not readily described as essential to liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">As a consequence of this Court\u2019s marginalization of the Clause, litigants seeking federal protection of fundamental rights turned to the remainder of \u00a7 1 in search of an alternative fount of such rights. They found one in a most curious place\u2014 that section\u2019s command that every State guarantee \u201cdue process\u201d to any person before depriving him of \u201clife, liberty, or property.\u201d At first, litigants argued that this Due Process Clause \u201cincorporated\u201d certain procedural rights codified in the Bill of Rights against the States. The Court</p>\n<p id=\"Azzs\">[561 U.S. 810]</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">generally rejected those claims, however, on the theory that the rights in question were not sufficiently \u201cfundamental\u201d to warrant such treatment. See, <em>e.g., Hurtado </em>v. <em>California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884) (grand jury indictment requirement); <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>176 U.S. 581, 20 S. Ct. 448, 44 L. Ed. 597 (1900) (12-person jury requirement); <em>Twining </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>211 U.S. 78, 29 S. Ct. 14, 53 L. Ed. 97 (1908) (privilege against self-incrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">That changed with time. The Court came to conclude that certain Bill of Rights guarantees <em>were </em>sufficiently fundamental to fall within \u00a7 l\u2019s guarantee of \u201cdue process.\u201d These included not only procedural protections listed in the first eight Amendments, see, <em>e.g., Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969) (protection against double jeopardy), but substantive rights as well, see, <em>e.g., Gitlow </em>v. <em>New York, </em>268 U.S. 652, 666, 45 S. Ct. 625, 69 L. Ed. 1138 (1925) (right to free speech); <em>Near </em>v. <em>Minnesota ex rel. Olson, </em>283 U.S. 697, 707, 51 S. Ct. 625, 75 L. Ed. 1357 (1931) (same). In the process of incorporating these rights against the States, the Court often applied them differently against the States than against the Federal Government on the theory that only those \u201cfundamental\u201d aspects of the right required Due Process Clause protection. See, <em>e.g., Betts </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>316 U.S. 455, 473, 62 S. Ct. 1252, 86 L. Ed. 1595 (1942) (holding that the Sixth Amendment required the appointment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant was unable to retain an attorney, but that the Due Process Clause required appointment of counsel in state criminal cases only where \u201cwant of counsel . . . resulted] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental fairness\u201d). In more recent years, this Court has \u201cabandoned the notion\u201d that the guarantees in the Bill of Rights apply differently when incorporated against the States than they do when applied to the Federal Government. <em>Ante, </em>at 765, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 926 (opinion of the Court) (internal quotation marks omitted). But our cases continue to adhere to the view that a right is incorporated through the Due Process Clause only if it is sufficiently \u201cfundamental,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number><em>ante, </em>at 784-785, 789-791, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 925, 928 (plurality opinion)\u2014a term the Court has long struggled to define.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">[561 U.S. 811]</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">While this Court has at times concluded that a right gains \u201cfundamental\u201d status only if it is essential to the American \u201cscheme of ordered liberty\u201d or \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 767, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 914 (opinion of the Court) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S., at 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772), the Court has just as often held that a right warrants Due Process Clause protection if it satisfies a far less measurable range of criteria, see <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 562, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003) (concluding that the Due Process Clause protects \u201cliberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more transcendent dimensions\u201d). Using the latter approach, the Court has determined that the Due Process Clause applies rights against the States that are not mentioned in the Constitution at all, even without seriously arguing that the Clause was originally understood to protect such rights. See, <em>e.g., Lochner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>198 U.S. 45, 25 S. Ct. 539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (1905); <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705, 35 L. Ed. 2d 147 (1973); <em>Lawrence, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">All of this is a legal fiction. The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only \u201cprocess\u201d before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words. Moreover, this fiction is a particularly dangerous one. The one theme that links the Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents together is their lack of a guiding principle to distinguish \u201cfundamental\u201d rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental rights that do not. Today\u2019s decision illustrates the point. Replaying a debate that has endured from the inception of the Court\u2019s substantive due process jurisprudence, the dissents laud the \u201cflexibility\u201d in this Court\u2019s substantive due process doctrine, <em>post, </em>at 871, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 978 (opinion of Stevens, J.); see <em>post, </em>at 918-919, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1007-1008 (opinion of Breyer, J.), while the plurality makes yet another effort to impose principled restraints on its exercise, see <em>ante, </em>at 780-787, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 922-927. But neither side argues that the meaning they attribute to the Due Process Clause was consistent with public understanding at the time of its ratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">[561 U.S. 812]</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">To be sure, the plurality\u2019s effort to cabin the exercise of judicial discretion under the Due Process Clause by focusing its inquiry on those rights deeply rooted in American history and tradition invites less opportunity for abuse than the alternatives. See <em>post, </em>at 918, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1008 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (arguing that rights should be incorporated against the States through the Due Process Clause if they are \u201cwell suited to the carrying out of . . . constitutional promises\u201d); <em>post, </em>at 878, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 982 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (warning that there is no \u201call-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of \u2018liberty\u2019 \u201d protected by the Due Process Clause). But any serious argument over the scope of the Due Process Clause must acknowledge that neither its text nor its history suggests that it protects the many substantive rights this Court\u2019s cases now claim it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">I cannot accept a theory of constitutional interpretation that rests on such tenuous footing. This Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>substantive due process framework fails to account for both the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the history that led to its adoption, filling that gap with a jurisprudence devoid of a guiding principle. I believe the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alternative, and that a return to that meaning would allow this Court to enforce the rights the Fourteenth Amendment is designed to protect with greater clarity and predictability than the substantive due process framework has so far managed.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">I acknowledge the volume of precedents that have been built upon the substantive due process framework, and I further acknowledge the importance of <em>stare decisis </em>to the stability of our Nation\u2019s legal system. But <em>stare decisis </em>is only an \u201cadjunct\u201d of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means. <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 963, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). It is not \u201can inexorable command.\u201d <em>Lawrence, supra, </em>at 577, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508. Moreover, as judges, we interpret the Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">[561 U.S. 813]</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">one case or controversy at a time. The question presented in this case is not whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised, but only whether, and to what extent, a particular Clause in the Constitution protects the particular right at issue here. With the inquiry appropriately narrowed, I believe this case presents an opportunity to reexamine, and begin the process of restoring, the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment agreed upon by those who ratified it.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">\u201cIt cannot be presumed that any clause in the constitution is intended to be without effect.\u201d <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137, 174, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.). Because the Court\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause precedents have presumed just that, I set them aside for the moment and begin with the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">The Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment declares that \u201c[n]o State . . . shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d In interpreting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional provisions are \u201c \u2018written to be understood by the voters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 576, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>282 U.S. 716, 731, 51 S. Ct. 220, 75 L. Ed. 640 (1931)). Thus, the objective of this inquiry is to discern what \u201cordinary citizens\u201d at the time of ratification would have understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean. 554 U.S., at 577, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">At the time of Reconstruction, the terms \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d had an established meaning as synonyms for \u201crights.\u201d The two words, standing alone or paired together, were used interchangeably with the words \u201crights,\u201d \u201cliberties,\u201d and \u201cfreedoms,\u201d and had been since the time of Blackstone. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *129 (describing</p>\n<p id=\"Ac6a\">[561 U.S. 814]</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">the \u201crights and liberties\u201d of Englishmen as \u201cprivate immunities\u201d and \u201ccivil privileges\u201d). A number of antebellum judicial decisions used the terms in this manner. See, <em>e.g., Magill </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number><em>Brown, </em>16 F. Cas. 408, 428 (No. 8,952) (CC ED Pa. 1833) (Baldwin, J.) (\u201cThe words \u2018privileges and immunities\u2019 relate to the rights of persons, place or property; a privilege is a peculiar right, a private law, conceded to particular persons or places\u201d). In addition, dictionary definitions confirm that the public shared this understanding. See, <em>e.g., </em>2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 1039 (C. Goodrich &amp; N. Porter rev. 1865) (defining \u201cprivilege\u201d as \u201ca right or immunity not enjoyed by others or by all\u201d and listing among its synonyms the words \u201cimmunity,\u201d \u201cfranchise,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d); 1 <em>id., </em>at 661 (defining \u201cimmunity\u201d as \u201c[f]reedom from an obligation\u201d or \u201cparticular privilege\u201d); 2 <em>id., </em>at 1140 (defining \u201cright\u201d as \u201c[privilege or immunity granted by authority\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The fact that a particular interest was designated as a \u201cprivilege\u201d or \u201cimmunity,\u201d rather than a \u201cright,\u201d \u201cliberty,\u201d or \u201cfreedom,\u201d revealed little about its substance. Blackstone, for example, used the terms \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d to describe both the inalienable rights of individuals and the positive-law rights of corporations. See 1 Commentaries, at *129 (describing \u201cprivate immunities\u201d as a <em>\u201cresiduum </em>of natural liberty,\u201d and \u201ccivil privileges\u201d as those \u201cwhich society hath engaged to provide, in lieu of the natural liberties so given up by individuals\u201d); <em>id., </em>at *468 (stating that a corporate charter enables a corporation to \u201cestablish</p>\n<p id=\"A_bG\">[561 U.S. 815]</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">rules and orders\u201d that serve as \u201cthe privileges and immunities ... of the corporation\u201d). Writers in this country at the time of Reconstruction followed a similar practice. See, <em>e.g., Racine &amp; Mississippi R. Co. </em>v. <em>Farmers\u2019 Loan &amp; Trust Co., </em>49 Ill. 331, 334 (1868) (describing agreement between two railroad companies in which they agreed \u201c \u2018to fully merge and consolidate the[ir] capital stock, powers, privileges, immunities and franchises\u2019 \u201d); <em>Hathorn </em>v. <em>Calef, </em>53 Me. 471, 483-484 (1866) (concluding that a statute did not \u201cmodify any power, privileges, or immunity, pertaining to the franchise of any corporation\u201d). The nature of a privilege or immunity thus varied depending on the person, group, or entity to whom those rights were assigned. See Lash, The Origins of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, Part I: \u201cPrivileges and Immunities\u201d as an Antebellum Term of Art, 98 Geo. L. J. 1241, 1256-1257 (2010) (surveying antebellum usages of these terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">The group of rights-bearers to whom the Privileges or Immunities Clause applies is, of course, \u201ccitizens.\u201d By the time of Reconstruction, it had long been established that both the States and the Federal Government existed to preserve their citizens\u2019 inalienable rights, and that these rights were considered \u201cprivileges\u201d or \u201cimmunities\u201d of citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">This tradition begins with our country\u2019s English roots. Parliament declared the basic liberties of English citizens in a series of documents ranging from the Magna Carta to the Pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>tition of Right and the English Bill of Rights. See 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History 8-16, 19-21, 41-46 (1971) (hereinafter Schwartz). These fundamental rights, according to the English tradition, belonged to all people but became legally enforceable only when recognized in legal texts, including acts of Parliament and the decisions of common-law judges. See B. Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution 77-79 (1967). These rights included many that later would be set forth in our</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">[561 U.S. 816]</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Federal Bill of Rights, such as the right to petition for redress of grievances, the right to a jury trial, and the right of \u201cProtestants\u201d to \u201chave arms for their de-fence.\u201d English Bill of Rights (1689), reprinted in 1 Schwartz 41, 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">As English subjects, the colonists considered themselves to be vested with the same fundamental rights as other Englishmen. They consistently claimed the rights of English citizenship in their founding documents, repeatedly referring to these rights as \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cimmunities.\u201d For example, a Maryland law provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-8\">\u201c [A] 11 the Inhabitants of this Province being Christians (Slaves excepted) Shall have and enjoy all such <em>rights liberties immunities priviledges and free customs </em>within this Province as any naturall born subject of England hath or ought to have or enjoy in the Realm of England . . . .\u201d Md. Act for the Liberties of the People (1639), in <em>id.., </em>at 68 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-9\">[561 U.S. 817]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">As tensions between England and the Colonies increased, the colonists adopted protest resolutions reasserting their claim to the inalienable rights of Englishmen. Again, they used the terms \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d to describe these rights. As the Massachusetts Resolves declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-11\">\u201cResolved, That there are certain essential Rights of the <em>British </em>Constitution of Government, which are founded in the Law of God and Nature, and are the common Rights of Mankind\u2014Therefore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA7qh\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"26\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAo4AAAAaAQAAAAARHeAxAAAAaElEQVR4nGP8z0Bl8JeJ2iYyMIwaOWrk4DTyAxbRBkyhP1iU4dD6//B/DPBPHlPsA6YQdq1/mBgOYNr0j0gXYddKk7B0wCaICQSwiGHXysSggynOmIApxo3FSOxaGUfLy1EjR40kEwAAiPddjKr9m20AAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"654\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-12\">\u201cResolved, That no Man can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>justly take the Property of another without his Consent: And that upon this <em>original </em>Principle the Right of Representation ... is evidently founded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-4\"><em>\u201cResolved, </em>That this <em>inherent </em>Right, together with all other, essential <em>Rights, Liberties, Privileges and Immunities </em>of the People of <em>Great Britain, </em>have been fully confirmed to them by <em>Magna Charta.\u201d </em>The Massachusetts Resolves (Oct. 29, 1765), reprinted in Prologue to Revolution: Sources and Documents on the Stamp Act Crisis, 1764-1766, p. 56 (E.

Ford ed. 1904). In an address delivered to the inhabitants of Quebec that same year, the Congress described those rights as including the \u201cgreat\u201d \u201cright[s]\u201d of \u201ctrial by jury,\u201d \u201cHabeas Corpus,\u201d and \u201cfreedom of the press.\u201d Address of the Continental Congress to the Inhabitants of Quebec (1774), reprinted in 1 Schwartz 221-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">After declaring their independence, the newly formed States replaced their colonial charters with constitutions and state bills of rights, almost all of which guaranteed the same fundamental rights that the former colonists previously had claimed by virtue of their English heritage. See, <em>e.g., </em>Pa. Declaration of Rights (1776), reprinted in 5 Thorpe 3081-3084 (declaring that \u201call men are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent and inalienable rights,\u201d including the \u201cright to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences\u201d and the \u201cright to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Several years later, the Founders amended the Constitution to expressly protect many of the same fundamental rights against interference by the Federal Government. Consistent with their English heritage, the founding generation generally did not consider many of the rights identified in these amendments as new entitlements, but as inalienable rights of all men, given legal effect by their codification in the Constitution\u2019s text. See, <em>e.g., </em>1 Annals of Cong. 431-432, 436-437, 440-442 (1789) (statement of Rep. Madison)</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">[561 U.S. 819]</p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">(proposing Bill of Rights in the First Congress); The Federalist No. 84, pp. 531-533 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton); see also <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 592, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (\u201c[I]t has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number><em>pre-existing </em>right\u201d). The Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Barron, </em>however, made plain that the codification of these rights in the Bill of Rights made them legally enforceable only against the Federal Government, not the States. See 7 Pet., at 247, 8 L. Ed. 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Even though the Bill of Rights did not apply to the States, other provisions of the Constitution did limit state interference with individual rights. Article IV, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, provides that \u201c[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.\u201d The text of this provision resembles the Privileges or Immunities Clause, and it can be assumed that the public\u2019s understanding of the latter was informed by its understanding of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Article IV, \u00a7 2, was derived from a similar clause in the Articles of Confederation, and reflects the dual citizenship the Constitution provided to all Americans after replacing that \u201cleague\u201d of separate sovereign States. <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em>9 Wheat. 1, 187, 6 L. Ed. 23 (1824); see 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1800, p. 675 (1833). By virtue of a person\u2019s citizenship in a particular State, he was guaranteed whatever rights and liberties that State\u2019s constitution and laws made available. Article IV, \u00a7 2, vested citizens of each State with an additional right: the assurance that they would be afforded the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d of citizenship in any of the several States in the Union to which they might travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">What were the \u201cPrivileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States\u201d? That question was answered perhaps most famously by Justice Bushrod Washington sitting as Circuit</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">[561 U.S. 820]</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">Justice in <em>Corfield </em>v. <em>Coryell, </em>6 F. Cas. 546, 551-552 (No. 3,230) (CC ED Pa. 1825). In that case, a Pennsylvania citizen claimed that a New Jersey law prohibiting nonresidents from harvesting oysters from the State\u2019s waters violated Article IV, \u00a7 2, because it deprived him, as an out-of-state citizen, of a right New Jersey availed to its own citizens. <em>Id., </em>at 550. Justice Washington rejected that argument, refusing to \u201caccede to the proposition\u201d that Article IV, \u00a7 2, entitled \u201ccitizens of the several states . . . to participate in <em>all </em>the rights which belong exclusively to the citizens of any other particular state.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 552 (emphasis added). In his view, Article IV, \u00a7 2, did not guarantee equal access to all public benefits a State might choose to make available to its citizens. See <em>id., </em>at 552. Instead, it applied only to those rights \u201cwhich are, in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right, to the citizens of all free governments.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 551 (emphasis added). Other courts generally agreed with this principle. See, <em>e.g., Abbot </em>v. <em>Bayley, </em>23 Mass. 89, 92-93 (1827) (noting that the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d of citizens in the several States protected by Article IV, \u00a7 2, are \u201cqualified and not absolute\u201d because they do not grant a traveling citizen the right of \u201csuffrage or of eligibility to office\u201d in the State to which he travels).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-11\">When describing those \u201cfundamental\u201d rights, Justice Washington thought it \u201cwould perhaps be more tedious than difficult to enumerate\u201d them all, but suggested that they could \u201cbe all comprehended under\u201d a broad list of \u201cgeneral heads,\u201d such as \u201c[protection by the government,\u201d \u201cthe enjoyment of life and liberty, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>right to acquire and possess property of every kind,\u201d \u201cthe benefit of the writ of habeas corpus,\u201d and the right of access to \u201cthe courts of the state,\u201d among others.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Corfield, supra, </em>at 551-552.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">[561 U.S. 821]</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Notably, Justice Washington did not indicate whether Article IV, \u00a7 2, <em>required </em>States to recognize these fundamental rights in their own citizens and thus in sojourning citizens alike, or whether the Clause simply prohibited the States from discriminating against sojourning citizens with respect to whatever fundamental rights state law happened to recognize. On this question, the weight of legal authorities at the time of Reconstruction indicated that Article IV, \u00a7 2, prohibited States from discriminating against sojourning citizens when recognizing fundamental rights, but did not require States to recognize those rights and did not prescribe their content. The highest courts of several States adopted this view, see, <em>e.g., Livingston </em>v. <em>Van Ingen, </em>9 Johns. *507, *561 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1812) (Yates, J.); <em>id., </em>at *577 (Kent, C. J.); <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>3 H. &amp; McH. 535, 553-554 (Md. Gen. Ct. 1797) (Chase, J.), as did several influential treatise writers, see T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 15-16, and n. 3 (1868) (describing Article IV, \u00a7 2, as designed \u201cto prevent discrimination by the several States against the citizens and public proceedings of other States\u201d); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law 35 (11th ed. 1867) (stating that Article IV, \u00a7 2, entitles sojourning citizens \u201cto the privileges that persons of the same description are entitled to in the state to which the removal is made, and to none other\u201d). This Court adopted the same conclusion in a unanimous opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">[561 U.S. 822]</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">just one year after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. See <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>8 Wall. 168, 180, 19 L.

First, \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d were synonyms for \u201crights.\u201d Second, both the States and the Federal Government had long recognized the inalienable rights of their citizens. Third, Article IV, \u00a7 2, of the Constitution protected traveling citizens against state discrimination with respect to the fundamental rights of state citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">Two questions still remain, both provoked by the textual similarity between \u00a7 l\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause and Article IV, \u00a7 2. The first involves the nature of the rights at stake: Are the privileges or immuni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>ties of \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d recognized by \u00a7 1 the same as the privileges and immunities of \u201cCitizens in the several States\u201d to which Article IV, \u00a7 2, refers? The second involves the restriction imposed on the States: Does \u00a7 1, like Article IV, \u00a7 2, prohibit only discrimination with respect to certain rights <em>if </em>the State chooses to recognize them, or does it require States to recognize those rights? I address each question in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">I start with the nature of the rights that \u00a7 l\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause protects. Section 1 overruled <em>Dred Scott\u2019s </em>holding that blacks were not citizens of either the United States or their own State and, thus, did not enjoy \u201cthe privileges and immunities of citizens\u201d embodied in the Constitution. 19 How., at 417, 15 L. Ed. 691. The Court in <em>Dred Scott </em>did not distinguish between privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States and citizens in the several States, instead referring to the rights of citizens generally. It did, however, give examples of what the rights of citizens were\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">[561 U.S. 823]</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">the constitutionally enumerated rights of \u201cthe full liberty of speech\u201d and the right \u201cto keep and carry arms.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Section 1 protects the rights of citizens \u201cof the United States\u201d specifically. The evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the privileges and immunities of such citizens included individual rights enumerated in the Constitution, including the right to keep and bear arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">Nineteenth-century treaties through which the United States acquired territory from other sovereigns routinely promised inhabitants of the newly acquired Territories that they would enjoy all of the \u201crights,\u201d \u201cprivileges,\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d of United States citizens. See, <em>e.g., </em>Treaty of Amity, Settlement, and Limits, Art. 6, Feb. 22, 1819, 8 Stat. 256-258, T. S. No. 327 (entered into force Feb. 19, 1821) (cession of Florida) (\u201cThe inhabitants of the territories which his Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States, by this Treaty, shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States, as soon as may be consistent with the principles of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the enjoyment of <em>all the privileges, rights, and. immunities, of the citizens of the United. States\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">[561 U.S. 824]</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">Commentators of the time explained that the rights and immunities of \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d recognized in these treaties \u201cundoubtedly mean[t] those privileges that are common to all the citizens of this republic.\u201d Marcus, An Examination of the Expediency and Constitutionality of Prohibiting Slavery in the State of Missouri 17 (1819). It is therefore altogether unsurprising that several of these trea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>ties identify liberties enumerated in the Constitution as privileges and immunities common to all United States citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">For example, the Louisiana Cession Act of 1803, which codified a treaty between the United States and France culminating in the Louisiana Purchase, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-5\">\u201cThe inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States, and admitted as soon as possible, according to the principles of the Federal constitution, to the enjoyment of <em>all the rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United. States; </em>and in the mean time they shall be maintained and protected in <em>the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and. the religion which they profess.\u201d </em>Treaty Between the United States of America and the French Republic, Art. III, Apr. 30, 1803, 8 Stat. 202, T. S. No. 86 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">[561 U.S. 825]</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">The Louisiana Cession Act reveals even more about the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship because it provoked an extensive public debate on the meaning of that term. In 1820, when the Missouri Territory (which the United States acquired through the Cession Act) sought to enter the Union as a new State, a debate ensued over whether to prohibit slavery within Missouri as a condition of its admission. Some Congressmen argued that prohibiting slavery in Missouri would deprive its inhabitants of the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d they had been promised by the Cession Act. See, <em>e.g., </em>35 Annals of Cong. 1083 (1820) (remarks of Kentucky Rep. Hardin). But those who opposed slavery in Missouri argued that the right to hold slaves was merely a matter of state property law, not one of the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship guaranteed by the Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-9\">Daniel Webster was among the leading proponents of the antislavery position. In his \u201cMemorial to Congress,\u201d Webster argued that \u201c [t]he rights, advantages and immunities here spoken of [in the Cession Act] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>must... be such as are recognized or communicated by the Constitution of the United States,\u201d not the \u201crights, advantages and immunities, derived exclusively from the <em>State </em>governments . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\">[561 U.S. 826]</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">D. Webster, A Memorial to the Congress of the United States, on the Subject of Restraining the Increase of Slavery in New States To Be Admitted Into the Union 15 (Dec. 15, 1819) (emphasis added). \u201cThe obvious meaning\u201d of the Act, in Webster\u2019s view, was that <em>\u201cthe rights derived under the federal Constitution </em>shall be enjoyed by the inhabitants of [the Territory].\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 15-16 (emphasis added). In other words, Webster articulated a distinction between the rights of United States citizenship and the rights of state citizenship, and argued that the former included those rights \u201crecognized or communicated by the Constitution.\u201d Since the right to hold slaves was not mentioned in the Constitution, it was not a right of federal citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">Webster and his allies ultimately lost the debate over slavery in Missouri, and the Territory was admitted as a slave State as part of the now-famous Missouri Compromise. Missouri Enabling Act of Mar. 6, 1820, ch. 22, \u00a7 8, 3 Stat. 548. But their arguments continued to inform public understanding of the privileges and immunities of United States citizenship. In 1854, Webster\u2019s Memorial was republished in a pamphlet discussing the Nation\u2019s next major debate on slavery\u2014the proposed repeal of the Missouri Compromise through the Kansas-Nebraska Act, see The Nebraska Question: Comprising Speeches in the United States Senate: Together With the History of the Missouri Compromise 9-12 (1854). It was published again in 1857 in a collection of famous American speeches. See Political Text-Book, or Encyclopedia: Containing Everything Necessary for the Reference of the Politicians and Statesmen of the United States 601-604 (M. Cluskey ed. 1857); see also Lash, 98 Geo. L. J., at 1294-1296 (describing Webster\u2019s arguments and their influence).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Evidence from the political branches in the years leading to the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption demonstrates broad public understanding that the privileges and immunities</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">[561 U.S. 827]</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">of United States citizenship included rights set forth in the Constitution, just as Webster and his allies had argued. In 1868, President Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation granting amnesty to former Confederates, guaranteeing \u201cto all and to every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion, a full pardon and amnesty for the offence of treason . . . with restoration of <em>all rights, privileges, and immunities under the Constitution </em>and the laws which have been made in pursuance thereof.\u201d 15 Stat. 712 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-13\">Records from the 39th Congress further support this understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-14\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b997-15\">After the Civil War, Congress established the Joint Committee on Reconstruction to investigate circumstances in the Southern States and to determine whether, and on what conditions, those States should be readmitted to the Union. See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 6, 30 (1865) (hereinafter 39th Cong. Globe); M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of Rights 57 (1986) (hereinafter Curtis). That Committee would ulti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>mately recommend the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, justifying its recommendation by submitting a report to Congress that extensively catalogued the abuses of civil rights in the former slave States and argued that \u201cadequate security for future peace and safety . .. can only be found in such changes of the organic law as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of all citizens in all parts of the republic.\u201d See Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, S. Rep. No. 112, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 15 (1866); H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., p. XXI (1866).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">As the Court notes, the Committee\u2019s Report \u201cwas widely reprinted in the press and distributed by Members of the 39th Congress to their constituents.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 772, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 917; B. Kendrick, Journal of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction 264-265 (1914) (noting that 150,000 copies of the</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">[561 U.S. 828]</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Report were printed and that it was widely distributed as a campaign document in the election of 1866). In addition, newspaper coverage suggests that the wider public was aware of the Committee\u2019s work even before the Report was issued. For example, the Fort Wayne Daily Democrat (which appears to have been unsupportive of the Committee\u2019s work) paraphrased a motion instructing the Committee to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-8\">\u201cenquire into [the] expediency of amending the Constitution of the United States so as to declare with greater certainty the power of Congress to enforce and determine by appropriate legislation all the guarantees contained in <em>that instru</em>ment.\u201d The Nigger Congress! Fort Wayne Daily Democrat, Feb. 1, 1866, p. 4 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-9\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b998-10\">Statements made by Members of Congress leading up to, and during, the debates on the Fourteenth Amendment point in the same direction. The record of these debates has been combed before. See <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U.S. 46, 92-110, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (1947) (appendix to dissenting opinion of Black, J.) (concluding that the debates support the conclusion that \u00a7 1 was understood to incorporate the Bill of Rights against the States); <em>ante, </em>at 762, n. 9, 774, n. 23, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 911, 918-919 (opinion of the Court) (counting the debates among other evidence that \u00a7 1 applies the Second Amendment against the States). Before considering that record here, it is important to clarify its relevance. When interpreting constitutional text, the goal is to discern the most likely public understanding of a particular provision at the time it was adopted. Statements by legislators can assist in this process to the extent they demonstrate the manner in which the public used or understood a particular word or phrase. They can further assist to the extent there is evidence that these statements were disseminated to the public. In other words, this evidence is useful not because</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">[561 U.S. 829]</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">it demonstrates what the draftsmen of the text may have been thinking, but only insofar as it illuminates what the public understood the words chosen by the draftsmen to mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-13\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">Three speeches stand out as particularly significant. Representative John Bingham, the principal draftsman of \u00a7 1, delivered a speech on the floor of the House in February 1866 introducing his first draft of the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>vision. Bingham began by discussing <em>Barron </em>and its holding that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the States. He then argued that a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide \u201can express grant of power in Congress to enforce by penal enactment these great canons of the supreme law, securing to all the citizens in every State all the privileges and immunities of citizens, and to all the people all the sacred rights of person.\u201d 39th Cong. Globe 1089-1090 (1866). Bingham emphasized that \u00a7 1 was designed \u201cto arm the Congress of the United States, by the consent of the people of the United States, with the power to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution today. It \u2018hath that extent\u2014no more.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">Bingham\u2019s speech was printed in pamphlet form and broadly distributed in 1866 under the title, \u201cOne Country, One Constitution, and One People,\u201d and the subtitle, \u201cIn Support of the Proposed Amendment to Enforce the Bill of Rights.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Newspapers also reported his proposal, with the New York Times providing particularly extensive coverage,</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">[561 U.S. 830]</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">including a full reproduction of Bingham\u2019s first draft of \u00a7 1 and his remarks that a constitutional amendment to \u201cen-forc[e]\u201d the \u201cimmortal bill of rights\u201d was \u201cabsolutely essential to American nationality.\u201d N. Y. Times, Feb. 27, 1866, p. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Bingham\u2019s first draft of \u00a7 1 was different from the version ultimately adopted. Of particular importance, the first draft granted Congress the \u201cpower to make all laws . . . necessary and proper to secure\u201d the \u201ccitizens of each State all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States,\u201d rather than restricting state power to \u201cabridge\u201d the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 39th Cong. Globe 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">That draft was met with objections, which the Times covered extensively. A front-page article hailed the \u201cClear and Forcible Speech\u201d by Representative Robert Hale against the draft, explaining\u2014and endorsing\u2014Hale\u2019s view that Bingham\u2019s proposal would \u201cconfer upon Congress all the rights and power of legislation now reserved to the States\u201d and would \u201cin effect utterly obliterate State rights and State authority over their own internal affairs.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> N. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, p. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">[561 U.S. 831]</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">Critically, Hale did <em>not </em>object to the draft insofar as it purported to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>constitutional liberties against state interference. Indeed, Hale stated that he believed (incorrectly in light of <em>Barron) </em>that individual rights enumerated in the Constitution were already enforceable against the States. See 39th Cong. Globe 1064 (\u201cI have, somehow or other, gone along with the impression that there is that sort of protection thrown over us in some way, whether with or without the sanction of a judicial decision that we are so protected\u201d); see N. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, at 1. Hale\u2019s misperception was not uncommon among members of the Reconstruction generation. See <em>infra, </em>at 842-843, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 960-961. But that is secondary to the point that the Times\u2019 coverage of this debate over \u00a7 l\u2019s meaning suggests public awareness of its main <em>contours\u2014i.e., </em>that \u00a7 1 would, at a minimum, enforce constitutionally enumerated rights of United States citizens against the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Bingham\u2019s draft was tabled for several months. In the interim, he delivered a second well-publicized speech, again arguing that a constitutional amendment was required to give Congress the power to enforce the Bill of Rights against the States. That speech was printed in pamphlet form, see Speech of Hon. John A. Bingham, of Ohio, on the Civil Rights Bill, Mar. 9, 1866 (Cong. Globe); see 39th Cong. Globe 1837 (remarks of Rep. Lawrence) (noting that the speech was \u201cextensively published\u201d), and the New York Times covered the speech on its front page. Thirty-Ninth Congress, N. Y. Times, Mar. 10, 1866, p. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">By the time the debates on the Fourteenth Amendment resumed, Bingham had amended his draft of \u00a7 1 to include the text of the Privileges or Immunities Clause that was ultimately adopted. Senator Jacob Howard introduced the new draft on the floor of the Senate in the third speech relevant here. Howard explained that the Constitution recognized \u201ca mass of privileges, immunities, and rights, some of them secured by the second section of the fourth article of the</p>\n<p id=\"AQd7\">[561 U.S. 832]</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Constitution, . . . some by the first eight amendments of the Constitution,\u201d and that \u201cthere is no power given in the Constitution to enforce and to carry out any of these guarantees\u201d against the States. 39th Cong. Globe 2765. Howard then stated that \u201c[t]he great object\u201d of \u00a7 1 was to \u201crestrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 2766. Section 1, he indicated, imposed \u201ca general prohibition upon all the States, as such, from abridging the privileges and immunities of the citizens of the United States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 2765.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">In describing these rights, Howard explained that they included \u201cthe privileges and immunities spoken of\u2019 in Article IV, \u00a7 2. <em>Id., </em>at 2765. Although he did not catalogue the precise \u201cnature\u201d or \u201cextent\u201d of those rights, he thought \u201cCorfield <em>vs. </em>Cory-ell\u201d provided a useful description. Howard then submitted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-9\">\u201c [t] o these privileges and immunities, whatever they may be\u2014 . . . should be added <em>the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitu</em>tion.; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>dress of grievances, [and] . . . <em>the right to keep and to bear arms.\u201d Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">News of Howard\u2019s speech was carried in major newspapers across the country, including the New York Herald, see N. Y. Herald, May 24, 1866, p. 1, which was the best selling paper in the Nation at that time, see A. Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 187 (1998) (hereinafter Amar).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The New York Times carried the speech as well,</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">[561 U.S. 833]</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">reprinting a lengthy excerpt of Howard\u2019s remarks, including the statements quoted above. N. Y. Times, May 24, 1866, p. 1. The following day\u2019s Times editorialized on Howard\u2019s speech, predicting that \u201c[t]o this, the first section of the amendment, the Union party throughout the country will yield a ready acquiescence, and the South could offer no justifiable resistance,\u201d suggesting that Bingham\u2019s narrower second draft had not been met with the same objections that Hale had raised against the first. N. Y. Times, May 25, 1866, p. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">As a whole, these well-circulated speeches indicate that \u00a7 1 was understood to enforce constitutionally declared rights against the States, and they provide no suggestion that any language in the section other than the Privileges or Immunities Clause would accomplish that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">When read against this backdrop, the civil rights legislation adopted by the 39th Congress in 1866 further supports this view. Between passing the Thirteenth Amendment\u2014which outlawed slavery alone\u2014and the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress passed two significant pieces of legislation. The first was the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which provided that \u201call persons born in the United States\u201d were \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d and that \u201csuch citizens, of every race and color, . . . shall have the same right\u201d to, among other things, \u201cfull and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.\u201d \u00a7 1, 14 Stat. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">Both proponents and opponents of this Act described it as providing the \u201cprivileges\u201d of citizenship to freedmen, and defined those privileges to include constitutional rights, such as the right to keep and bear arms. See 39th Cong. Globe 474 (remarks of Sen. Trumbull) (stating that \u201cthe late slaveholding</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">[561 U.S. 834]</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-16\">States\u201d had enacted laws \u201cdepriving persons of African descent of privileges which are essential to freemen,\u201d including \u201cprohibit[ing] any negro or mulatto from having fire-arms\u201d and stating that \u201c [t]he purpose of the bill under consideration is to destroy all these discriminations\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 1266-1267 (remarks of Rep. Raymond) (opposing the Act, but recognizing that to \u201c[m]ake the colored man a citizen of the United States\u201d would guarantee to him, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca defined <em>status </em>... a right to defend himself and his wife and children; a right to bear arms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-17\">Three months later, Congress passed the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act, which also entitled all citizens to the \u201cfull and equal benefit of all laws and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>proceedings concerning personal liberty\u201d and \u201cpersonal security.\u201d Act of July 16, 1866, \u00a7 14, 14 Stat. 176. The Act stated expressly that the rights of personal liberty and security protected by the Act \u201cinclud[ed] the constitutional right to bear arms.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">There is much else in the legislative record. Many statements by Members of Congress corroborate the view that the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforced constitutionally enumerated rights against the States. See Curtis 112 (collecting examples). I am not aware of any statement that directly refutes that proposition. That said, the record of the debates\u2014like most legislative history\u2014is less than crystal clear. In particular, much ambiguity derives from the fact that at least several Members described \u00a7 1 as protecting the privileges and immunities of citizens \u201cin the several States,\u201d harkening back to Article IV, \u00a7 2. See <em>supra, </em>at 832-833, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 954-955 (describing Sen. Howard\u2019s speech). These statements can be read to support the view that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects some or all the fundamental rights of \u201ccitizens\u201d described in <em>Cor-field. </em>They can also be read to support the view that the Privileges or Immunities Clause, like Article IV, \u00a7 2, prohibits only state discrimination with</p>\n<p id=\"atci-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 835]</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">respect to those rights it covers, but does not deprive States of the power to deny those rights to all citizens equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">I examine the rest of the historical record with this understanding. But for purposes of discerning what the public most likely thought the Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean, it is significant that the most widely publicized statements by the legislators who voted on \u00a7 1\u2014Bingham, Howard, and even Hale\u2014point unambiguously toward the conclusion that the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforces at least those fundamental rights enumerated in the Constitution against the States, including the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment in the period immediately following its ratification help to establish the public understanding of the text at the time of its adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Some of these interpretations come from Members of Congress. During an 1871 debate on a bill to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, Representative Henry Dawes listed the Constitution\u2019s first eight Amendments, including \u201cthe right to keep and bear arms,\u201d before explaining that after the Civil War, the country \u201cgave the most grand of all these rights, privileges, and immunities, by one single amendment to the Constitution, to four millions of American citizens\u201d who formerly were slaves. Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 475-476 (1871). \u201cIt is all these,\u201d Dawes explained, \u201cwhich are comprehended in the words \u2018American citizen.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 476; see also <em>id., </em>at 334 (remarks of Rep. Hoar) (stating that the Privileges or Immunities Clause referred to those rights \u201cdeclared to belong to the citizen by the Constitution itself\u2019). Even opponents of Fourteenth Amendment enforcement legislation acknowledged that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected constitutionally enumerated individual rights. See 2 Cong. Rec. 384-385 (1874) (remarks</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">[561 U.S. 836]</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">of Rep. Mills) (opposing enforcement law, but acknowledging, in referring to the Bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>of Rights, that \u201c[t]hese first amendments and some provisions of the Constitution of like import embrace the \u2018privileges and immunities\u2019 of citizenship as set forth in article 4, section 2, of the Constitution <em>and in the fourteenth </em>amendment\u201d (emphasis added)); see Curtis 166-170 (collecting examples).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\">Legislation passed in furtherance of the Fourteenth Amendment demonstrates even more clearly this understanding. For example, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, which was titled in pertinent part \u201cAn Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\u201d and which is codified in the still-existing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. That statute prohibits state officials from depriving citizens of \u201cany rights, privileges, or immunities <em>secured by the Constitution.\u201d </em>Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (emphasis added). Although the Judiciary ignored this provision for decades after its enactment, this Court has come to interpret the statute, unremarkably in light of its text, as protecting constitutionally enumerated rights. <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U.S. 167, 171, 81 S. Ct. 473, 5 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">A Federal Court of Appeals decision written by a future Justice of this Court adopted the same understanding of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. See, <em>e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>26 F. Cas. 79, 82 (No. 15,282) (CC SD Ala. 1871) (Woods, J.) (\u201cWe think, therefore, that the . . . rights enumerated in the first eight articles of amendment to the constitution of the United States, are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States\u201d). In addition, two of the era\u2019s major constitutional treatises reflected the understanding that \u00a7 1 would protect constitutionally enumerated rights from state abridgment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A third such treatise unambiguously</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">[561 U.S. 837]</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">indicates that the Privileges or Immunities Clause accomplished this task. G. Paschal, The Constitution of the United States 290 (1868) (explaining that the rights listed in \u00a7 1 had \u201calready been guarantied\u201d by Article IV and the Bill of Rights, but that \u201c[t]he new feature declared\u201d by \u00a7 1 was that these rights, \u201cwhich had been construed to apply only to the national government, are thus imposed upon the States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">Another example of public understanding comes from United States Attorney Daniel Corbin\u2019s statement in an 1871 Ku Klux Klan prosecution. Corbin cited <em>Barron </em>and declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-10\">\u201c[T]he fourteenth amendment changes all that theory, and lays the same restriction upon the States that before lay upon the Congress of the United States\u2014that, as Congress heretofore could not interfere with the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms, now, after the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, the State cannot interfere with the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms. The right to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>and bear arms is included in the fourteenth amendment, under \u2018privileges and immunities.\u2019 \u201d Proceedings in the Ku Klux Trials at Columbia, S. C., in the United States Circuit Court, November Term, 1871, p. 147 (1872).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pADKE\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"50\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARMAAAAyAQAAAABXVQIyAAAAs0lEQVR4nGP8z0AIPGQiqISBYVTNkFPTgMRFSQX/4Wr+H0AS/teAhUMt9zD8n1fxHwFsPmJyHjAxFCJreISNw8RQ8QMhzPjhAxYOE0PMZyS9O55h4/z/I4/khB/2mJwHTAxMCkhaWRywcJgYPiOreeaAhcPEcAk5iJawYOEwMRzhRxLukMPCYWLo4ECI/hcQwMJhYjjPihBmnMeFjfP/H7J3/9Rjch5QK94ZR8ufUTWDQA0AXNiH/mZIcjYAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"274\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">This evidence plainly shows that the ratifying public understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to keep</p>\n<p id=\"axc-dedup-2\">[561 U.S. 838]</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">and bear arms. As the Court demonstrates, there can be no doubt that \u00a7 1 was understood to enforce the Second Amendment against the States. See <em>ante, </em>at 770-780, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 916-922. In my view, this is because the right to keep and bear arms was understood to be a privilege of American citizenship guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">The next question is whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause merely prohibits States from discriminating among citizens if they recognize the Second Amendment\u2019s right to keep and bear arms, or whether the Clause requires States to recognize the right. The municipal respondents, Chicago and Oak Park, argue for the former interpretation. They contend that the Second Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth, authorizes a State to impose an outright ban on handgun possession such as the ones at issue here so long as a State applies it to all citizens equally.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court explains why this antidiscrimination-only reading of \u00a7 1 as a whole is \u201cimplausible.\u201d Ante, at 778, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 921 (citing Brief for Municipal Respondents 64). I agree, but because I think it is the Privileges or Immunities Clause that applies this right to the States, I must explain why this Clause in particular protects against more than just state discrimination, and in fact establishes a minimum baseline of rights for all American citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">[561 U.S. 839]</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-12\">I begin, again, with the text. The Privileges or Immunities Clause opens with the command that <em>\u201cNo State </em>shall\u201d abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. Amdt. 14, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added). The very same phrase opens Article I, \u00a7 10, of the Constitution, which prohibits the States from \u201cpass-ting] any Bill of Attainder\u201d or \u201cex post facto Law,\u201d among other things. Article I, \u00a7 10, is one of the few constitutional provisions that limits state authority. In <em>Barron, </em>when Chief Justice Marshall interpreted the Bill of Rights as lacking \u201cplain and intelligible language\u201d restricting state power to infringe upon individual liberties, he pointed to Article I, \u00a7 10, as an example of text that would have accomplished that task. 7 Pet., at 250, 8 L. Ed. 672. Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall would later describe Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>I, \u00a7 10, as \u201ca bill of rights for the people of each state.\u201d <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>6 Cranch 87, 138, 3 L. Ed. 162 (1810). Thus, the fact that the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the command \u201c[n]o State shall\u201d\u2014which Article IV, \u00a7 2, does not\u2014strongly suggests that the former imposes a greater restriction on state power than the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">This interpretation is strengthened when one considers that the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the verb \u201cabridge,\u201d rather than \u201cdiscriminate,\u201d to describe the limit it imposes on state authority. The Webster\u2019s dictionary in use at the time of Reconstruction defines the word \u201cabridge\u201d to mean \u201c[t]o deprive; to cut off;... as, to <em>abridge </em>one of his rights.\u201d 1 Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language, at 6. The Clause is thus best understood to impose a limitation on state power to infringe upon pre-existing substantive rights. It raises no indication that the Framers of the Clause used the word \u201cabridge\u201d to prohibit only discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">This most natural textual reading is underscored by a well-publicized revision to the Fourteenth Amendment that the Reconstruction Congress rejected. After several</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6U\">[561 U.S. 840]</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">Southern States refused to ratify the Amendment, President Johnson met with their Governors to draft a compromise. N. Y. Times, Feb. 5, 1867, p. 5. Their proposal eliminated Congress\u2019 power to enforce the Amendment (granted in \u00a7 5), and replaced the Privileges or Immunities Clause in \u00a7 1 with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States, and of the States in which they reside, and the Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all <em>the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.\u201d </em>Draft reprinted in 1 Documentary History of Reconstruction 240 (W. Fleming ed. 1950) (hereinafter Fleming) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">Significantly, this proposal removed the \u201c[n]o State shall\u201d directive and the verb \u201cabridge\u201d from \u00a7 1, and also changed the class of rights to be protected from those belonging to \u201ccitizens of the United States\u201d to those of the \u201ccitizens in the several States.\u201d This phrasing is materially indistinguishable from Article IV, \u00a7 2, which generally was understood as an anti-discrimination provision alone. See <em>supra, </em>at 819-822, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 947-948. The proposal thus strongly indicates that at least the President of the United States and several Southern Governors thought that the Privileges or Immunities Clause, which they unsuccessfully tried to revise, prohibited more than just state-sponsored discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">The argument that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits no more than discrimination often is followed by a claim that public discussion of the Clause, and of \u00a7 1 generally, was not extensive. Because of this, the argument goes, \u00a7 1 must not have been understood to accomplish such a significant task as subjecting States to federal enforcement of a minimum baseline of rights. That argument overlooks</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">[561 U.S. 841]</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">critical aspects of the Nation\u2019s history that underscored the need for, and wide agreement upon, federal enforcement of constitutionally enumerated rights against the States, including the right to keep and bear arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>a</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">I turn first to public debate at the time of ratification. It is true that the congressional debates over \u00a7 1 were relatively brief. It is also true that there is little evidence of extensive debate in the States. Many state legislatures did not keep records of their debates, and the few records that do exist reveal only modest discussion. See Curtis 145. These facts are not surprising.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">First, however consequential we consider the question today, the nationalization of constitutional rights was not the most controversial aspect of the Fourteenth Amendment at the time of its ratification. The Nation had just endured a tumultuous civil war, and \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, and 4\u2014which reduced the representation of States that denied voting rights to blacks, deprived most former Confederate officers of the power to hold elective office, and required States to disavow Confederate war debts\u2014were far more polarizing and consumed far more political attention. See Wilden-thal 1600; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of 1866-1868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695, 699 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Second, the congressional debates on the Fourteenth Amendment reveal that many Representatives, and probably many citizens, believed that the Thirteenth Amendment, the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, or some combination of the two, had already enforced constitutional rights against the States. Justice Black\u2019s dissent in <em>Adamson </em>chronicles this point in detail. 332 U.S., at 107-108, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (appendix to dissenting opinion). Regardless of whether that understanding was accurate as a matter of constitutional law, it helps to explain why</p>\n<p id=\"ApGc\">[561 U.S. 842]</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-8\">Congressmen had little to say during the debates about \u00a7 1. See <em>ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Third, while <em>Barron </em>made plain that the Bill of Rights was not legally enforceable against the States, see <em>supra, </em>at 806-807, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 939, the significance of that holding should not be overstated. Like the Framers, see <em>supra, </em>at 818-819, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 946-947, many 19th-century Americans understood the Bill of Rights to declare inalienable rights that pre-existed all government. Thus, even though the Bill of Rights technically applied only to the Federal Government, many believed that it declared rights that no legitimate government could abridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">Chief Justice Henry Lumpkin\u2019s decision for the Georgia Supreme Court in <em>Nunn </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Ga. 243 (1846), illustrates this view. In assessing state power to regulate firearm possession, Lumpkin wrote that he was \u201caware that it has been decided, that [the Second Amendment], like other amendments adopted at the same time, is a restriction upon the government of the United States, and does not extend to the individual States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 250. But he still considered the right to keep and bear arms as \u201can unalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free government,\u201d and thus found the States bound to honor it. <em>Ibid. </em>Other state courts adopted similar positions with respect to the right to keep and bear arms and other enumerated rights.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Some courts even suggested that the protections in the Bill of Rights were legally enforce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>able against the States, <em>Barron </em>notwithstanding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A prominent treatise of the era took the same position. W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of the</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-4\">[561 U.S. 843]</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">United States of America 124-125 (2d ed. 1829) (arguing that certain of the first eight Amendments \u201cappl[y] to the state legislatures\u201d because those Amendments \u201cform parts of the declared rights of the people, of which neither the state powers nor those of the Union can ever deprive them\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 125-126 (describing the Second Amendment \u201cright of the people to keep and bear Arms\u201d as \u201ca restraint on both\u201d Congress and the States); see also <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 607, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (describing Rawle\u2019s treatise as \u201cinfluential\u201d). Certain abolitionist leaders adhered to this view as well. Lysander Spooner championed the popular abolitionist argument that slavery was inconsistent with constitutional principles, citing as evidence the fact that it deprived black Americans of the \u201cnatural right of all men \u2018to keep and bear arms\u2019 for their personal defence,\u201d which he believed the Constitution \u201cprohibit[ed] both Congress and the State governments from infringing.\u201d The Unconstitutionality of Slavery 98 (1860).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">In sum, some appear to have believed that the Bill of Rights <em>did </em>apply to the States, even though this Court had squarely rejected that theory. See, <em>e.g., supra, </em>at 830-831, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 953-954 (recounting Rep. Hale\u2019s argument to this effect). Many others believed that the liberties codified in the Bill of Rights were ones that no State <em>should, </em>abridge, even though they understood that the Bill technically did not apply to States. These beliefs, combined with the fact that most state constitutions recognized many, if not all, of the individual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, made the need for federal enforcement of constitutional liberties against the States an afterthought. See <em>ante, </em>at 777, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 920 (opinion of the Court) (noting that, \u201c[i]n 1868, 22 of the 37 States in the Union had state constitutional provisions explicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms\u201d). That changed with the national conflict over slavery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">b</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">In the contentious years leading up to the Civil War, those who sought to retain the institution of slavery found that to</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-10\">[561 U.S. 844]</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-11\">do so, it was necessary to eliminate more and more of the basic liberties of slaves, free blacks, and white abolitionists. Congressman To-bias Plants explained that slaveholders \u201ccould not hold [slaves] safely where dissent was permitted,\u201d so they decided that \u201call dissent must be suppressed by the strong hand of power.\u201d 39th Cong. Globe 1013. The measures they used were ruthless, repressed virtually every right recognized in the Constitution, and demonstrated that preventing only discriminatory state firearms restrictions would have been a hollow assurance for liberty. Public reaction indicates that the American people understood this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">The overarching goal of proslavery forces was to repress the spread of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>abolitionist thought and the concomitant risk of a slave rebellion. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate the extent to which fear of a slave uprising gripped slaveholders and dictated the acts of Southern legislatures. Slaves and free blacks represented a substantial percentage of the population and posed a severe threat to Southern order if they were not kept in their place. According to the 1860 Census, slaves represented one quarter or more of the population in 11 of the 15 slave States, nearly half the population in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana, and <em>more </em>than 50% of the population in Mississippi and South Carolina. Statistics of the United States (Including Mortality, Property, &amp; c.,) in 1860, The Eighth Census 336-350 (1866).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The Southern fear of slave rebellion was not unfounded. Although there were others, two particularly notable slave uprisings heavily influenced slaveholders in the South. In 1822, a group of free blacks and slaves led by Denmark Vesey planned a rebellion in which they would slay their masters and flee to Haiti. H. Aptheker, American Negro Slave Revolts 268-270 (1983). The plan was foiled, leading to the swift arrest of 130 blacks, and the execution of 37, including Vesey. <em>Id., </em>at 271. Still, slaveowners took notice\u2014it was reportedly feared that as many as 6,600 to 9,000 slaves and</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">[561 U.S. 845]</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">free blacks were involved in the plot. <em>Id., </em>at 272. A few years later, the fear of rebellion was realized. An uprising led by Nat Turner took the lives of at least 57 whites before it was suppressed. <em>Id., </em>at 298-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">The fear generated by these and other rebellions led Southern legislatures to take particularly vicious aim at the rights of free blacks and slaves to speak or to keep and bear arms for their defense. Teaching slaves to read (even the Bible) was a criminal offense punished severely in some States. See K. Stampp, The Peculiar Institution: Slavery in the Antebellum South 208, 211 (1956). Virginia made it a crime for a member of an \u201cabolition\u201d society to enter the State and argue \u201cthat the owners of slaves have no property in the same, or advocate or advise the abolition of slavery.\u201d 1835-1836 Va. Acts ch. 66, p. 44. Other States prohibited the circulation of literature denying a master\u2019s right to property in his slaves and passed laws requiring postmasters to inspect the mails in search of such material. C. Eaton, The Freedom-of-Thought Struggle in the Old South 118-143, 199-200 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">Many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting slaves from carrying firearm<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to apply the prohibition to free blacks as well. See, <em>e.g., </em>Act of Dec. 23, 1833, \u00a7 7, 1833 Ga. Acts pp. 226, 228 (declaring that \u201cit shall not be lawful for any free person of colour in this state, to own, use, or carry fire arms of any description whatever\u201d); H. Aptheker, Nat Turner\u2019s Slave Rebellion 74-76, 83-94 (1966) (discussing similar Maryland and Virginia statutes); see also Act of Mar. 15,</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">[561 U.S. 846]</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-11\">1852, ch. 206, 1852 Miss. Laws p. 328 (repealing laws allowing free blacks to obtain firearms licenses); Act of Jan. 31, 1831, 1831 Fla. Acts p. 30 (same). Florida made it the \u201cduty\u201d of white citizen \u201cpatrol [s] to search negro houses or other sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>pected places, for fire arms.\u201d Act of Feb. 17, 1833, ch. 671, 1833 Fla. Acts pp. 26, 30. If they found any firearms, the patrols were to take the offending slave or free black \u201cto the nearest justice of the peace,\u201d whereupon he would be \u201csever [ely] punished\u201d by \u201cwhipping on the bare back, not exceeding thirty-nine lashes,\u201d unless he could give a \u201cplain and satisfactory\u201d explanation of how he came to possess the gun. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">Southern blacks were not alone in facing threats to their personal liberty and security during the antebellum era. Mob violence in many Northern cities presented dangers as well. Cottrol &amp; Diamond, The Second Amendment: Toward an Afro-Ameri-canist Reconsideration, 80 Geo. L. J. 309, 340 (1991) (hereinafter Cottrol) (recounting a July 1834 mob attack against \u201cchurches, homes, and businesses of white abolitionists and blacks\u201d in New York that involved \u201cupwards of twenty thousand people and required the intervention of the militia to suppress\u201d); <em>ibid, </em>(noting an uprising in Boston nine years later in which a confrontation between a group of white sailors and four blacks led \u201ca mob of several hundred whites\u201d to \u201cattac[k] and severely beat every black they could find\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">After the Civil War, Southern anxiety about an uprising among the newly freed slaves peaked. As Representative Thaddeus Stevens is reported to have said, \u201c \u2018[w]hen it was first proposed to free the slaves, and arm the blacks, did not half the nation tremble? The prim conservatives, the snobs, and the male waiting-maids in Congress, were in hysterics.\u2019 \u201d K. Stampp, The Era of Reconstruction, 1865-1877, p. 104 (1965) (hereinafter Era of Reconstruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">[561 U.S. 847]</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">As the Court explains, this fear led to \u201csystematic efforts\u201d in the \u201cold Confederacy\u201d to disarm the more than 180,000 freedmen who had served in the Union Army, as well as other free blacks. See <em>ante, </em>at 771, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 917. Some States formally prohibited blacks from possessing firearms. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting 1865 Miss. Laws p. 165, \u00a7 1, reprinted in 1 Fleming 289). Others enacted legislation prohibiting blacks from carrying firearms without a license, a restriction not imposed on whites. See, <em>e.g., </em>La. Statute of 1865, reprinted in <em>id., </em>at 280. Additionally, \u201c[t]hroughout the South, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Confederate soldiers serving in the state militias, forcibly took firearms from newly freed slaves.\u201d Ante, at 772, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-9\">As the Court makes crystal clear, if the Fourteenth Amendment \u201chad outlawed only those laws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude, African-Americans in the South would likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace officers.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 779, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 921. In the years following the Civil War, a law banning firearm possession outright \u201cwould have been nondiscriminatory only in the formal sense,\u201d for it would have \u201cleft firearms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">Evidence suggests that the public understood this at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. The publicly circulated Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction extensively detailed these abuses, see <em>ante, </em>at 772, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 917 (collecting examples), and statements by citizens indicate that they looked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>to the Committee to provide a federal solution to this problem, see, <em>e.g., </em>39th Cong. Globe 337 (remarks of Rep. Sumner) (introducing \u201ca memorial from the colored citizens of the State of South Carolina\u201d asking for, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cconstitutional protection in keeping arms, in holding public assemblies, and in complete liberty of speech and of the press\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">One way in which the Federal Government responded was to issue military orders countermanding Southern arms legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">[561 U.S. 848]</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">See, <em>e.g., </em>Jan. 17, 1866, order from Major General D. E. Sickles, reprinted in E. McPherson, The Political History of the United States of America During the Period of Reconstruction 37 (1871) (\u201cThe constitutional rights of all loyal and well-disposed inhabitants to bear arms will not be infringed\u201d). The significance of these steps was not lost on those they were designed to protect. After one such order was issued, The Christian Recorder, published by the African Methodist Episcopal Church, published the following editorial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-7\">\u201c \u2018We have several times alluded to the fact that the Constitution of the United States, guaranties to every citizen the right to keep and bear arms. . . . All men, without the distinction of color, have the right to keep arms to defend their homes, families, or themselves.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-8\">\u201cWe are glad to learn that [the] Commissioner for this State . . . has given freedmen to understand that they have as good a right to keep fire arms as any other citizens.

We answer <em>certainly </em>you have the <em>same </em>right to own and carry fire arms that <em>other </em>citizens have.

See, <em>e.g., </em>J. Tiffany, Treatise on the Unconstitutionality of American Slavery 56 (1849) (\u201cpledg[ing] ... to see that all the rights, privileges, and immunities, granted by the constitution of the United States, are extended to all\u201d); <em>id., </em>at 99 (describing the \u201cright to keep and bear arms\u201d as one of those rights secured by \u201cthe constitution of the United States\u201d). The problem abo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>litionists sought to remedy was that, under <em>Dred Scott, </em>blacks were not entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens under the Federal Constitution and that, in many States, whatever inalienable rights state law recognized did not apply to blacks. See, <em>e.g., Cooper </em>v. <em>Savannah, </em>4 Ga. 68, 72 (1848) (deciding, just two years after Chief Justice Lumpkin\u2019s opinion in <em>Nunn </em>recognizing the right to keep and bear arms, see <em>supra, </em>at 842, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 960, that \u201c[f]ree persons of color have never been recognized here as citizens; they are not entitled to bear arms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">Section 1 guaranteed the rights of citizenship in the United States and in the several States without regard to race. But it was understood that liberty would be assured little protection if \u00a7 1 left each State to decide which privileges or immunities of United States citizenship it would protect. As Frederick Douglass explained before \u00a7 l\u2019s adoption, \u201cthe Legislatures of the South can take from him the right to keep and bear arms, as they can\u2014they would not allow a negro to walk with a cane where I came from, they would not allow five of them to assemble together.\u201d In</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">[561 U.S. 850]</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">What New Skin Will the Old Snake Come Forth? An Address Delivered in New York, New York, on May 10, 1865, reprinted in 4 The Frederick Douglass Papers 79, 83-84 (J. Blassingame &amp; J. McKivigan eds. 1991) (footnote omitted). \u201cNotwithstanding the provision in the Constitution of the United States that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged,\u201d Douglass explained that \u201cthe black man has never had the right either to keep or bear arms.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 84. Absent a constitutional amendment to enforce that right against the States, he insisted that \u201cthe work of the Abolitionists [wa]s not finished.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">This history confirms what the text of the Privileges or Immunities Clause most naturally suggests: Consistent with its command that \u201c[n]o State shall . . . abridge\u201d the rights of United States citizens, the Clause establishes a minimum baseline of federal rights, and the constitutional right to keep and bear arms plainly was among them.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">My conclusion is contrary to this Court\u2019s precedents, which hold that the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not a privilege of United States citizenship. See <em>Cruikshank, </em>92 U.S., at 548-549, 551-553, 23 L. Ed. 588. I must, therefore, consider whether <em>stare decisis </em>requires retention of those precedents. As mentioned at the outset, my inquiry is limited to the right at issue here. Thus, I do not endeavor to decide in this case whether, or to what extent, the Privileges or Immunities Clause applies any other rights enumerated</p>\n<p id=\"ATyM\">[561 U.S. 851]</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">in the Constitution against the States.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nor do I suggest that the <em>stare decisis </em>considerations surround<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>ing the application of the right to keep and bear arms against the States would be the same as those surrounding another right protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause. I consider <em>stare decisis </em>only as it applies to the question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">This inquiry begins with the <em>Slaughter-House Cases. </em>There, this Court upheld a Louisiana statute granting a monopoly on livestock butchering in and around the city of New Orleans to a newly incorporated company. 16 Wall. 36, 21 L. Ed. 394. Butchers excluded by the monopoly sued, claiming that the statute violated the Privileges or Immunities Clause because it interfered with their right to pursue and \u201cexercise their trade.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 60, 21 L. Ed. 394. This Court rejected the butchers\u2019 claim, holding that their asserted right was not a privilege or immunity of American citizenship, but one governed by the States alone. The Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected only rights of <em>federal </em>citizenship\u2014those \u201cwhich owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 79, 21 L. Ed. 394\u2014and did not protect <em>any </em>of the rights of state citizenship,</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">[561 U.S. 852]</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\"><em>id., </em>at 74, 21 L. Ed. 394. In other words, the Court defined the two sets of rights as mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">After separating these two sets of rights, the Court defined the rights of state citizenship as \u201cembrac[ing] nearly every civil right for the establishment and protection of which organized government is instituted\u201d\u2014 that is, all those rights listed in <em>Corfield. </em>16 Wall., at 76, 21 L. Ed. 394 (referring to \u201cthose rights\u201d that \u201cJudge Washington\u201d described). That left very few rights of federal citizenship for the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect. The Court suggested a handful of possibilities, such as the \u201cright of free access to [federal] seaports,\u201d protection of the Federal Government while traveling \u201con the high seas,\u201d and even two rights listed in the Constitution. <em>Id., </em>at 79, 21 L. Ed. 394 (noting \u201c[t]he right to peaceably assemble\u201d and \u201cthe privilege of the writ of <em>habeas corpus\u201d); </em>see <em>supra, </em>at 808, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 940. But its decision to interpret the rights of state and federal citizenship as mutually exclusive led the Court in future cases to conclude that constitutionally enumerated rights were excluded from the Privileges or Immunities Clause\u2019s scope. See <em>Cruikshank, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">I reject that understanding. There was no reason to interpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause as putting the Court to the extreme choice of interpreting the \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d of federal citizenship to mean either all those rights listed in <em>Corfield, </em>or almost no rights at all. 16 Wall., at 76, 21 L. Ed. 394. The record is scant that the public understood the Clause to make the Federal Government \u201ca perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States\u201d as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number><em>Slaughter-House </em>majority feared. <em>Id., </em>at 78, 21 L. Ed. 394. For one thing, <em>Corfield </em>listed the \u201celective franchise\u201d as one of the privileges and immunities of \u201ccitizens of the several states,\u201d 6 F. Cas., at 552, yet Congress and the States still found it necessary to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment\u2014which protects \u201c [t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote\u201d\u2014two years after the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s passage. If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were understood to protect every</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">[561 U.S. 853]</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">conceivable civil right from state abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have been redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The better view, in light of the States and Federal Government\u2019s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable rights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immunities of state and federal citizenship overlap. This is not to say that the privileges and immunities of state and federal citizenship are the same. At the time of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s ratification, States performed many more functions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely that, simply by referring to \u201cprivileges or immunities,\u201d the Framers of \u00a7 1 meant to transfer every right mentioned in <em>Corfield </em>to congressional oversight. As discussed, \u201cprivileges\u201d and \u201cimmunities\u201d were understood only as synonyms for \u201crights.\u201d See <em>supra, </em>at 813-815, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 943-944. It was their attachment to a particular group that gave them content, and the text and history recounted here indicate that the rights of United States citizens were not perfectly identical to the rights of citizens \u201cin the several States.\u201d Justice Swayne, one of the dissenters in <em>SlaughterHouse, </em>made the point clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-7\">\u201cThe citizen of a State has the <em>same </em>fundamental rights as a citizen of the United States, <em>and. also certain others, </em>local in their character, arising from his relation to the State, and in addition, those which belong to the citizen of the United States, he being in that relation also. There may thus be a double citizenship, each having some rights peculiar to itself. It is only over those which belong to the citizen of the United States that the category here in question throws the shield of its protection.\u201d 16 Wall., at 126, 21 L. Ed. 394 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">Because the privileges and immunities of American citizenship include rights enumerated in the Constitution, they overlap to at least some extent with the privileges and immunities traditionally recognized in citizens in the several States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">[561 U.S. 854]</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">A separate question is whether the privileges and immunities of American citizenship include any rights besides those enumerated in the Constitution. The four dissenting Justices in <em>Slaughter-House </em>would have held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the unenumerated right that the butchers in that case asserted. See <em>id., </em>at 83, 21 L. Ed. 394 (opinion of Field, J.); <em>id., </em>at 111, 21 L. Ed. 394 (opinion of Bradley, J.); <em>id., </em>at 124, 21 L. Ed. 394 (opinion of Swayne, J.). Because this case does not involve an unenumerated right, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether the Clause protects such rights, or whether the Court\u2019s judgment in <em>Slaughter-House </em>was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">Still, it is argued that the mere possibility that the Privileges or Immunities Clause may enforce unenu-merated rights against the States creates \u201c \u2018special hazards\u2019 \u201d that should prevent this Court from returning to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>the original meaning of the Clause.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Post, </em>at 860, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 971 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Ironically, the same objection applies to the Court\u2019s substantive due process jurisprudence, which illustrates the risks of granting judges broad discretion to recognize individual constitutional rights in the absence of textual or historical guideposts. But I see no reason to assume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Immunities Clause. The mere fact that the Clause does not expressly list the rights it protects does not render it incapable of principled judicial application. The Constitution contains many provisions that require an examination of more than just constitutional text to determine whether a particular act is within Congress\u2019 power or is otherwise prohibited. See, <em>e.g., </em>Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">[561 U.S. 855]</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">Unusual Punishments Clause). When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying era understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean, interpreting it should be no more \u201chazardous\u201d than interpreting these other constitutional provisions by using the same approach. To be sure, interpreting the Privileges or Immunities Clause may produce hard questions. But they will have the advantage of being questions the Constitution asks us to answer. I believe those questions are more worthy of this Court\u2019s attention\u2014and far more likely to yield discernible answers\u2014than the substantive due process questions the Court has for years created on its own, with neither textual nor historical support.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Finding these impediments to returning to the original meaning overstated, I reject <em>Slaughter-House </em>insofar as it precludes any overlap between the privileges and immunities of state and federal citizenship. I next proceed to the <em>stare decisis </em>considerations surrounding the precedent that expressly controls the question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">Three years after <em>Slaughter-House, </em>the Court in <em>Cruikshank </em>squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby overturning the convictions of militia members responsible for the brutal Colfax Massacre. See <em>supra, </em>at 808-809, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 940. <em>Cruikshank </em>is not a precedent entitled to any respect. The flaws in its interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause are made evident by the preceding evidence of its original meaning, and I would reject the holding on that basis alone. But, the consequences of <em>Cruikshank </em>warrant mention as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Cruikshank\u2019s holding that blacks could look only to state governments for protection of their right to keep and bear arms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of local governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and their descendants through a wave of private violence designed to drive blacks from the voting booth and force them</p>\n<p id=\"AH_t\">[561 U.S. 856]</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">into peonage, an effective return to slavery. Without federal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and bear arms, these militias and mobs were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>tragically successful in waging a campaign of terror against the very people the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-4\">Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876. There, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a troop of black militiamen for no other reason than that they had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July parade through their mostly black town. The white militia commander, \u201cPitchfork\u201d Ben Tillman, later described this massacre with pride: \u201c[T]he leading white men of Edgefield\u201d had decided \u201cto seize the first opportunity that the negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach the negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate their superiority by killing as many of them as was justifiable.\u201d S. Kantrowitz, Ben Tillman &amp; the Reconstruction of White Supremacy 67 (2000) (ellipsis, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). None of the perpetrators of the Hamburg murders was ever brought to justice.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Organized terrorism like that perpetuated by Tillman and his cohorts proliferated in the absence of federal enforcement of constitutional rights. Militias such as the Ku Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the White Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the \u201976 Association spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by breaking up Republican meetings, threatening political leaders, and whipping black militiamen. Era of Reconstruction 199-200; Curtis</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">[561 U.S. 857]</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">156. These groups raped, murdered, lynched, and robbed as a means of intimidating, and instilling pervasive fear in, those whom they despised. A. Trelease, White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction 28-46 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">Although Congress enacted legislation to suppress these activities,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Klan tactics remained a constant presence in the lives of Southern blacks for decades. Between 1882 and 1968, there were at least 3,446 reported lynchings of blacks in the South. Cottrol 351-352. They were tortured and killed for a wide array of alleged crimes, without even the slightest hint of due process. Emmit Till, for example, was killed in 1955 for allegedly whistling at a white woman. S. Whitfield, A Death in the Delta: The Story of Emmett Till 15-31 (1988). The fates of other targets of mob violence were equally depraved. See, <em>e.g., </em>Lynched Negro and Wife Were First Mutilated, Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post, Feb. 8, 1904, reprinted in R. Ginzburg, 100 Years of Lynchings 63 (1988); Negro Shot Dead for Kissing His White Girlfriend, Chicago Defender, Feb. 31, 1915, in <em>id., </em>at 95 (reporting incident in Florida); La. Negro Is Burned Alive Screaming \u201cI Didn\u2019t Do It,\u201d Cleveland Gazette, Dec. 13, 1914, in <em>id., </em>at 93 (reporting incident in Louisiana).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">The use of firearms for self-defense was often the only way black citizens <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>could protect themselves from mob violence. As Eli Cooper, one target of such violence, is said to have explained, [t]he \u201c \u2018Negro has been run over for fifty years, but it must stop now, and pistols and shotguns are the only weapons to stop a mob.\u2019 \u201d Church Burnings Follow Negro Agitator\u2019s Lynching, Chicago Defender, Sept. 6, 1919, in <em>id., </em>at 124. Sometimes, as in Cooper\u2019s case, self-defense did not succeed. He was dragged from his home by a mob and</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">[561 U.S. 858]</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">killed as his wife looked on. <em>Ibid. </em>But at other times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob violence to survive. One man recalled the night during his childhood when his father stood armed at a jail until morning to ward off lynchers. See Cottrol 354. The experience left him with a sense, \u201cnot \u2018of powerlessness, but of the \u201cpossibilities of salvation\u201d \u2019 \u201d that came from standing up to intimidation. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era public understood\u2014just as the Framers of the Second Amendment did\u2014that the right to keep and bear arms was essential to the preservation of liberty. The record makes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary to include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that the Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the wake of the war over slavery. There is nothing about Cruikshank\u2019s contrary holding that warrants its retention.</p>\n<p id=\"pAE8o\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"30\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQUAAAAeAQAAAAANizbQAAAAr0lEQVR4nNXTMQrCQBAF0L9DQLt4AfUiIt7M2NnpDTyDnWUKC0tLCwtJFSsJCG5A8y13nAUtlIDTvc9nGXZZR7yfWj4UgPYaJx3kEUguqGZo4H+0R5lOgvf9zECAoypgk1kIMGhUOLpHIP1BbV+tDTxIdlTYpAZeAMzVwa5nIcBjp8J6aSHAdab2PzsYCFAleQiLbmYgQKHvdZtEIG+raVj/MuYrfDtv6/7qN3zbeAIlcLt/PttEwAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"261\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">I agree with the Court that the Second Amendment is fully applicable to the States.

Our decisions construing that Clause to ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>der various procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights enforceable against the States likewise tell us little about the meaning of the word \u201cliberty\u201d in the Clause or about the scope of its protection of nonprocedural rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">This is a substantive due process case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment decrees that no State shall \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d The Court has filled thousands of pages expounding that spare text.

To the contrary, the historical evidence suggests that, at least by the time of the Civil War if not much earlier, the phrase \u201cdue process of law\u201d had acquired substantive content as a term of art within the legal community.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This understanding is</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">[561 U.S. 863]</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">consonant with the venerable \u201cnotion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>that governmental authority has implied limits which preserve private autonomy,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a notion which predates the founding and which finds reinforcement in the Constitution\u2019s Ninth Amendment, see <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 486-493, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Due Process Clause cannot claim to be the source of our basic freedoms\u2014no legal document ever could, see <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 230, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1976) (Stevens, J., dissenting)\u2014but it stands as one of their foundational guarantors in our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-4\">If text and history are inconclusive on this point, our precedent leaves no doubt: It has been \u201csettled\u201d for well over a century that the Due Process Clause \u201capplies to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure.\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>California, </em>274 U.S. 357, 373, 47 S. Ct. 641, 71 L. Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brand\u00e9is, J., concurring). Time and again, we have recognized that in the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Fifth, the \u201cDue Process Clause guarantees more than fair process, and the \u2018liberty\u2019 it protects includes more than the absence of physical restraint.\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 719, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772. \u201cThe Clause also includes a substantive component that \u2018provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Troxel </em>v. <em>Granville, </em>530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 147 L. Ed. 2d 49 (2000) (plurality opinion of O\u2019Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Ginsburg and Breyer, JJ.) (quoting <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 720, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772). Some of our most enduring precedents, accepted today by virtually everyone, were substantive due process decisions. See, <em>e.g., Loving </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010 (1967) (recognizing due-process- as well as equal-protection-based right to marry person of another race); <em>Bolling </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>347 U.S. 497, 499-500, 74 S. Ct. 693, 98 L. Ed. 884 (1954) (outlawing racial segregation in District of Columbia</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">[561 U.S. 864]</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">public schools); <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U.S. 510, 534-535, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070 (1925) (vindicating right of parents to direct upbringing and education of their children); <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 399-403, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042 (1923) (striking down prohibition on teaching of foreign languages).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">\n<em>Liberty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">The second principle woven through our cases is that substantive due process is fundamentally a matter of personal liberty. For it is the liberty clause of the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>Amendment that grounds our most important holdings in this field. It is the liberty clause that enacts the Constitution\u2019s \u201cpromise\u201d that a measure of dignity and self-rule will be afforded to all persons. <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>505 U.S. 833, 847, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1992). It is the liberty clause that reflects and renews \u201cthe origins of the American heritage of freedom [and] the abiding interest in individual liberty that makes certain state intrusions on the citizen\u2019s right to decide how he will live his own life intolerable.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Porter Memorial Hospital, </em>523 F.2d 716, 720 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.). Our substantive due process cases have episodically invoked values such as privacy and equality as well, values that in certain contexts may intersect with or complement a subject\u2019s liberty interests in profound ways. But as I have observed on numerous occasions, \u201cmost of the significant [20th-century] cases raising Bill of Rights issues have, in the final analysis, actually interpreted the word \u2018liberty\u2019 in the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">It follows that the term \u201cincorporation,\u201d like the term \u201cunenumerated rights,\u201d is something of a misnomer. Whether an asserted substantive due process interest is explicitly</p>\n<p id=\"ahb-dedup-2\">[561 U.S. 865]</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">named in one of the first eight Amendments to the Constitution or is not mentioned, the underlying inquiry is the same: We must ask whether the interest is \u201ccomprised within the term liberty.\u201d <em>Whitney, </em>274 U.S., at 373, 47 S. Ct. 641, 71 L. Ed. 1095 (Brand\u00e9is, J., concurring). As the second Justice Harlan has shown, ever since the Court began considering the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the States, \u201cthe Court\u2019s usual approach has been to ground the prohibitions against state action squarely on due process, without intermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amendments.\u201d <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1, 24, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964) (dissenting opinion); see also Frankfurter, Memorandum on \u201cIncorporation\u201d of the Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, 78 Harv. L. Rev. 746, 747-750 (1965). In the pathmarking case of <em>Gitlow </em>v. <em>New York, </em>268 U.S. 652, 666, 45 S. Ct. 625, 69 L. Ed. 1138 (1925), for example, both the majority and dissent evaluated petitioner\u2019s free speech claim not under the First Amendment but as an aspect of \u201cthe fundamental personal rights and \u2018liberties\u2019 protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">[561 U.S. 866]</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">In his own classic opinion in <em>Gris</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number><em>wold, </em>381 U.S., at 500, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510 (opinion concurring in judgment), Justice Harlan memorably distilled these precedents\u2019 lesson: \u201cWhile the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands ... on its own bottom.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Inclusion in the Bill of Rights is neither necessary nor sufficient for an interest to be judicially enforceable under the Fourteenth Amendment. This Court\u2019s \u201c \u2018selective incorporation\u2019 \u201d doctrine, <em>ante, </em>at 763, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 912, is not simply \u201crelated\u201d to substantive due process, <em>ante, </em>at 767, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 914; it is a subset thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\">\n<em>Federal/State Divergence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The third precept to emerge from our case law flows from the second: The rights protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause need not be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected against Federal Government infringement by the various provisions of the Bill of Rights. As drafted, the Bill of Rights directly constrained only the Federal Government. See <em>Barron ex rel. Tiernan </em>v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore, </em>7 Pet. 243, 8 L. Ed. 672 (1833). Although the enactment of the Fourteenth</p>\n<p id=\"aje-dedup-2\">[561 U.S. 867]</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Amendment profoundly altered our legal order, it \u201cdid not unstitch the basic federalist pattern woven into our constitutional fabric.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 133, 90 S. Ct. 1893, 26 L. Ed. 2d 446 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Nor, for that matter, did it expressly alter the Bill of Rights. The Constitution still envisions a system of divided sovereignty, still \u201cestablishes a federal republic where local differences are to be cherished as elements of liberty\u201d in the vast run of cases, <em>National Rifle Assn. of Am. Inc. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>567 F.3d 856, 860 (CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C. J.), still allocates a general \u201cpolice power ... to the States and the States alone,\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Comstock, </em>560 U.S. 126, 153, 130 S. Ct. 1949, 176 L. Ed. 2d 878 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). Elementary considerations of constitutional text and structure suggest there may be legitimate reasons to hold state governments to different standards than the Federal Government in certain areas.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>It is true, as the Court emphasizes, <em>ante, </em>at 763-766, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 912-914, that we have made numerous provisions of the Bill of Rights fully applicable to the States. It is settled, for instance, that the Governor of Alabama has no more power than the President of the United States to authorize unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Ker </em>v. <em>California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 10 L. Ed. 2d 726 (1963). But we have never accepted a \u201c \u2018total incorporation\u2019 \u201d theory of the Fourteenth Amendment, whereby the Amendment is deemed to subsume the provisions of the Bill of Rights en masse. See <em>ante, </em>at 763, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 911. And we have declined to apply several provisions to the States in any measure. See, <em>e.g., Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis R. Co. </em>v. <em>Bombolis, </em>241 U.S. 211, 36 S. Ct. 595, 60 L. Ed. 961 (1916) (Seventh Amendment); <em>Hurtado </em>v. <em>California, </em>110 U.S. 516, 4 S. Ct. 111, 28 L. Ed. 232 (1884) (Grand Jury Clause). We have, moreover, resisted a uniform approach to the Sixth Amendment\u2019s criminal jury guarantee, demanding 12-member panels and unanimous</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">[561 U.S. 868]</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-5\">verdicts in federal trials, yet not in state trials. See <em>Apodaca </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>406 U.S. 404, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972); <em>Williams, </em>399 U.S. 78, 90 S. Ct. 1893, 26 L. Ed. 2d 446. In recent years, the Court has repeatedly declined to grant certiorari to review that disparity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While those denials have no precedential significance, they confirm the proposition that the \u201cincorporation\u201d of a provision of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment does not, in itself, mean the provision must have precisely the same meaning in both contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">It is true, as well, that during the 1960\u2019s the Court decided a number of cases involving procedural rights in which it treated the Due Process Clause as if it transplanted language from the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment. See, <em>e.g., Benton </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>395 U.S. 784, 795, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); <em>Pointer </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 406, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (1965) (Confrontation Clause). \u201cJot-for-jot\u201d incorporation was the norm in this expansionary era. Yet at least one subsequent opinion suggests that these precedents require perfect state/federal congruence only on matters \u201c \u2018at the core\u2019 \u201d of the relevant constitutional guarantee. <em>Crist </em>v. <em>Bretz, </em>437 U.S. 28, 37, 98 S. Ct. 2156, 57 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1978); see also <em>id., </em>at 52-53, 98 S. Ct. 2156, 57 L. Ed. 2d 24 (Powell, J., dissenting). In my judgment, this line of cases is best understood as having concluded that, to ensure a criminal trial satisfies essential standards of fairness, some procedures should be the same in state and federal courts: The need for certainty and uniformity is more pressing, and the margin for error slimmer, when criminal justice is at issue. That principle has little relevance to the question whether a non\u2014procedural rule set forth in the Bill of Rights qualifies</p>\n<p id=\"AjhA\">[561 U.S. 869]</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">as an aspect of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in <em>Malloy, </em>378 U.S., at 10-11, 84 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653, it is therefore an overstatement to say that the Court has \u201cabandoned,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 764, 765, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 912, 913 (majority opinion), 786, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 926 (plurality opinion), a \u201ctwo-track approach to incorporation,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 784, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 924 (plurality opinion). The Court moved away from that approach in the area of criminal procedure. But the Second Amendment differs in fundamental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill of Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, <em>infra; </em>and if some 1960\u2019s opinions purported to establish a general method of incorporation, that hardly binds us in this case. The Court has not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court excesses in more areas than I can count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-4\">I do not mean to deny that there can be significant practical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights symmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Governments. Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may entail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore greater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorporation may also yield greater clarity about the contours of the legal rule. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 384-388, 92 S. Ct. 1620, 32 L. Ed. 2d 152 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting); <em>Pointer, </em>380 U.S., at 413-414, 85 S. Ct. 1065, 13 L. Ed. 2d 923 (Goldberg, J., concurring). In a federalist system such as ours, however, this approach can carry substantial costs. When a federal court insists that state and local authorities follow its dictates on a matter not critical to personal liberty or procedural justice, the latter may be prevented from engaging in the kind of beneficent \u201cexperimentation in things social and economic\u201d that ultimately redounds to the benefit of all Americans. <em>New State Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Liebmann, </em>285 U.S. 262, 311, 52 S. Ct. 371, 76 L. Ed. 747 (1932) (Brand\u00e9is, J., dissenting). The costs of federal courts\u2019 imposing a uniform national standard may be especially high when the relevant regulatory interests vary</p>\n<p id=\"AhBQ\">[561 U.S. 870]</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">significantly across localities, and when the ruling implicates the States\u2019 core police powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">Furthermore, there is a real risk that, by demanding the provisions of the Bill of Rights apply identically to the States, federal courts will cause those provisions to \u201cbe watered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.\u201d <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 182, n. 21, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting). When one legal standard must prevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs and customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed standard. This watering-down risk is particularly acute when we move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure and into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights. So long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are always and everywhere respected, it is not clear that greater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a provision of the Bill of Rights to the States. Indeed, it is far from clear that proponents of an individual right to keep and bear arms ought to celebrate today\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>[561 U.S. 871]</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">So far, I have explained that substantive due process analysis generally requires us to consider the term \u201cliberty\u201d in the Fourteenth Amendment, and that this inquiry may be informed by, but does not depend upon, the content of the Bill of Rights. How should a court go about the analysis, then? Our precedents have established, not an exact methodology, but rather a framework for deci-sionmaking. In this respect, too, the Court\u2019s narrative fails to capture the continuity and flexibility in our doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">The basic inquiry was described by Justice Cardozo more than 70 years ago. When confronted with a substantive due process claim, we must ask whether the allegedly unlawful practice violates values \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288 (1937).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If the practice in question lacks any \u201coppressive and arbitrary\u201d character, if judicial enforcement of the asserted right would not materially contribute to \u201ca fair and enlightened system of justice,\u201d then the claim is unsuitable for substantive due process protection. <em>Id., </em>at 327, 325, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288. Implicit in Justice Cardozo\u2019s test is a recognition that the postulates of liberty have a universal character. Liberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that prevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations of a certain group, or the personal preferences of their champions, may be valid claims in some sense; but they are not of constitutional stature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">[561 U.S. 872]</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Whether conceptualized as a \u201crational continuum\u201d of legal precepts, <em>Poe, </em>367 U.S., at 543, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (Harlan, J., dissenting), or a seamless web of moral commitments, the rights embraced by the liberty clause transcend the local and the particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">Justice Cardozo\u2019s test undeniably requires judges to apply their own reasoned judgment, but that does not mean it involves an exercise in abstract philosophy. In addition to other constraints I will soon discuss, see Part III, <em>infra, </em>historical and empirical data of various kinds ground the analysis. Textual commitments laid down elsewhere in the Constitution, judicial precedents, English common law, legislative and social facts, scien-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>tifie and professional developments, practices of other civilized societies,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and, above all else, the \u201c \u2018traditions and conscience of our people,\u2019 \u201d <em>Palko, </em>302 U.S., at 325, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288 (quoting <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 105, 54 S. Ct. 330, 78 L. Ed. 674 (1934)), are critical variables. They can provide evidence about which rights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur to judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">The Court errs both in its interpretation of <em>Palko </em>and in its suggestion that later cases rendered Palko\u2019s methodology defunct. Echoing <em>Duncan, </em>the Court advises that Justice Cardozo\u2019s test will not be satisfied \u201c \u2018if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 760, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 910 (quoting 391 U.S., at 149, n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491). <em>Palko </em>does contain some language that could be read to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process recognition, reserving it for practices without which \u201cneither liberty nor justice would exist.\u201d 302 U.S., at 326, 58 S. Ct. 149, 82 L. Ed. 288. But in view of Justice Cardozo\u2019s broader analysis, as well as the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims under the <em>Palko </em>standard, such readings are plainly overreadings. We have never applied <em>Palko </em>in such a draconian manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">[561 U.S. 873]</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Nor, as the Court intimates, see <em>ante, </em>at 764, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 912, did <em>Duncan </em>mark an irreparable break from <em>Palko, </em>swapping out liberty for history. <em>Duncan </em>limited its discussion to \u201cparticular procedural safeguard [s]\u201d in the Bill of Rights relating to \u201ccriminal processes,\u201d 391 U.S., at 149, n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 it did not purport to set a standard for other types of liberty interests. Even with regard to procedural safeguards, <em>Duncan </em>did not jettison the <em>Palko </em>test so much as refine it: The judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a practice \u201cis fundamental . . . [to] ordered liberty,\u201d within the context of the \u201cAnglo-American\u201d system. <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 149-150, n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491. Several of our most important recent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive due process analysis\u2014from which, once again, \u201cincorporation\u201d analysis derives\u2014must not be wholly backward looking. See, <em>e.g., Lawrence </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>539 U.S. 558, 572, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (2003) (\u201c[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but not in all cases the ending point of the substantive due process inquiry\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Michael H. </em>v. <em>Gerald D., </em>491 U.S. 110, 127-128, n. 6, 109 S.

The Court hinges its entire decision on one mode of intellectual history, culling selected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and 19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">[561 U.S. 874]</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Relying on <em>Duncan </em>and <em>Glucksberg, </em>the principal opinion suggests that only interests that have proved \u201cfundamental from an American perspective,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 784-791, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 924-929 (plurality opinion), or \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 767, 177 L.

Ed. 2d 772), to the Court\u2019s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment. To the extent the principal opinion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a right is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its status under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seriously mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most basically, because our substantive due process doctrine has never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even predominantly, historical terms. Wflien the Court applied many of the <em>procedural </em>guarantees in the Bill of Rights to the States in the 1960\u2019s, it often asked whether the guarantee in question was \u201cfundamental in the context of the criminal processes maintained by the American States.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 150, n. 14, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491. That inquiry could extend back through time, but it was focused not so much on historical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional significance within the States\u2019 regimes. This contextualized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any given trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It is only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes with other procedures and practices in a criminal justice system that its relationship to \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d can be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to recognize rights distinct from the trial context\u2014rights relating to the primary conduct of free individuals\u2014Justice Cardozo\u2019s test has been our guide. The right to free speech, for</p>\n<p id=\"a9u-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 875]</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-10\">instance, has been safeguarded from state infringement not because the States have always honored it, but because it is \u201cessential to free government\u201d and \u201cto the maintenance of democratic institutions\u201d\u2014that is, because the right to free speech is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 95, 96, 60 S.

As the question before us indisputably concerns such an interest, the answer cannot be found in a granular inspection of state constitutions or congressional debates.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\">More fundamentally, a rigid historical methodology is unfaithful to the Constitution\u2019s command. For if it were really the case that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of liberty embraces only those rights \u201cso rooted in our history, tradition, and practice as to require special protection,\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 721, n. 17, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772, then the guarantee would serve little function, save to ratify those rights that state actors have <em>already </em>been according the most extensive protection.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 183, 88 S.

It is judicial abdication in the guise of judicial modesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">No, the liberty safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment is not merely preservative in nature but rather is a \u201cdynamic concept.\u201d Stevens, The Bill of Rights: A Century of Progress, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 13, 38 (1992). Its dynamism provides a central means through which the Framers enabled the Constitution to \u201cendure for ages to come,\u201d <em>McCulloch </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>4 Wheat. 316, 415, 4 L. Ed. 579 (1819), a central example of how they \u201cwisely spoke in general language and left to succeeding generations the task of applying that language to the unceasingly changing environment in which they would live,\u201d Rehnquist, The Notion of a Living Constitution, 54 Texas L. Rev. 693, 694 (1976). \u201cThe task of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>giving concrete meaning to the term \u2018liberty,\u2019 \u201d I have elsewhere explained at some length, \u201cwas apart of the work assigned to future generations.\u201d Stevens, The Third Branch of Liberty, 41 U.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">[561 U.S. 877]</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">Miami L. Rev. 277, 291 (1986).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The judge who would outsource the interpretation of \u201cliberty\u201d to historical sentiment has turned his back on a task the Constitution assigned to him and drained the document of its intended vitality.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">At this point a difficult question arises. In considering such a majestic term as \u201cliberty\u201d and applying it to present circumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call and its open texture\u2014and to the grant of interpretive discretion the latter embodies\u2014without injecting excessive subjectivity or unduly restricting the States\u2019 \u201cbroad latitude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems of vital local concern,\u201d <em>Whalen </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>429 U.S. 589, 597, 97 S. Ct. 869, 51 L. Ed. 2d 64(1977)? One part of the answer, already discussed, is that we must ground the analysis in historical experience and reasoned</p>\n<p id=\"AuT_\">[561 U.S. 878]</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">judgment, and never on \u201cmerely personal and private notions.\u201d <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 170, 72 S. Ct. 205, 96 L. Ed. 183 (1952). Our precedents place a number of additional constraints on the decisional process. Although \u201cguideposts for responsible decision-making in this unchartered area are scarce and open-ended,\u201d <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1992), significant guideposts do exist.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">The most basic is that we have eschewed attempts to provide any all-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of \u201cliberty.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> That project is bound to end in failure or worse. The Framers did not express a clear understanding of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated <em>Lochner </em>line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial overconfidence in using substantive due process to advance a broad theory of the right or the good. See, <em>e.g., Lochner </em>v. <em>New York, </em>198 U.S. 45, 25 S. Ct. 539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (1905). In its most durable precedents, the Court</p>\n<p id=\"aqxy-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 879]</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">\u201chas not attempted to define with exactness the liberty . . . guaranteed\u201d by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Meyer, </em>262 U.S., at 399, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042; see also, <em>e.g., Bolling, </em>347 U.S., at 499, 74 S. Ct. 693, 98 L. Ed. 884. By its very nature, the meaning of liberty cannot be \u201creduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by reference to any code.\u201d <em>Poe, </em>367 U.S., at 542, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Yet while \u201cthe \u2018liberty\u2019 specially protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d is \u201cperhaps not capable of being fully clarified,\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 722, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772, it is capable of being refined and delimited. We have insisted that only certain types of especially significant personal interests may qualify for especially heightened protection. Ever since \u201cthe deviant economic due process cases [were] repudiated,\u201d <em>id., </em>at 761, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment), our doctrine has steered away from \u201claws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions,\u201d <em>Griswold, </em>381 U.S., at 482, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510, and has instead centered on \u201cmatters relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education,\u201d <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 713, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976). These categories are not exclusive. Government action that shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled expectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or life choices without adequate justification, perpetrates gross injustice, or simply lacks a rational basis will always be vulnerable to judicial invalidation. Nor does the fact that an asserted right falls within one of these categories end the inquiry. More fundamental rights may receive more robust judicial protection, but the strength of the individual\u2019s liberty interests and the State\u2019s regulatory interests must always be assessed and compared. No right is absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">Rather than seek a categorical understanding of the liberty clause, our precedents have thus elucidated a conceptual core. The clause safeguards, most basically, \u201cthe ability independently to define one\u2019s identity,\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 619, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1984), \u201cthe individual\u2019s right to make certain unusually important decisions that will</p>\n<p id=\"A8HW\">[561 U.S. 880]</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">affect his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>own, or his family\u2019s, destiny,\u201d <em>Fitzgerald, </em>523 F.2d, at 719, and the right to be respected as a human being. Self-determination, bodily integrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political equality, dignity and respect\u2014these are the central values we have found implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Another key constraint on substantive due process analysis is respect for the democratic process. If a particular liberty interest is already being given careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate. When the Court declined to establish a general right to physician-assisted suicide, for example, it did so in part because \u201cthe States [were] currently engaged in serious, thoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and other similar issues,\u201d rendering judicial intervention both less necessary and potentially more disruptive. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 719, 735, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772. Conversely, we have long appreciated that more \u201csearching\u201d judicial review may be justified when the rights of \u201cdiscrete and insular minorities\u201d\u2014groups that may face systematic barriers in the political system\u2014are at stake. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carolene Products Co., </em>304 U.S. 144, 153, n. 4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234 (1938). Courts have a \u201ccomparative . . . advantage\u201d over the elected branches on a limited, but significant, range of legal matters. <em>Post, </em>at 919, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step. It takes that right, to a considerable extent, \u201coutside the arena of public debate and legislative action.\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 720, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772. Sometimes that momentous step must be taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dignity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and demand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to the interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of contemporary society provides an important tool for guiding judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">[561 U.S. 881]</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the need to approach our work with humility and caution. Because the relevant constitutional language is so \u201cspacious,\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>391 U.S., at 148, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491, I have emphasized that \u201c [t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>503 U.S., at 125, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L. Ed. 2d 261. Many of my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same point, some with great eloquence. See, <em>e.g., Casey, </em>505 U.S., at 849, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674 <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 502-503, 97 S. Ct. 1932, 52 L. Ed. 2d 531 (1977) (plurality opinion); <em>Poe, </em>367 U.S., at 542-545, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (Harlan, J., dissenting); <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>California, </em>332 U.S. 46, 68, 67 S. Ct. 1672, 91 L. Ed. 1903 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Historical study may discipline as well as enrich the analysis. But the inescapable reality is that no serious theory of \u00a7 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in every case, and \u201c[n]o formula could serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and restraint.\u201d <em>Poe, </em>367 U.S., at 542, 81 S. Ct. 1752, 6 L. Ed. 2d 989 (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such restraint. In the substantive due process field as in others, the Court has applied both the doctrine of <em>stare </em>decisis\u2014adhering to precedents, respecting reliance interests, prizing stability and order in the law\u2014and the common-law method\u2014 taking cases and controversies as they present themselves, proceeding slowly and incrementally, building on what came before. This restrained methodology was evident even in the heyday of \u201cincorporation\u201d during the 1960\u2019s. Although it would have been much easier for the Court simply to declare certain Amendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States <em>in toto, </em>the Court took care to parse each Amendment into its component guarantees, evaluating them one by one. This piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize more closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reducing both the risk and the cost of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">[561 U.S. 882]</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an abstract plane, the Court has \u201crequired in substantive-due-process cases a \u2018careful description\u2019 of the asserted fundamental liberty interest.\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (quoting <em>Reno </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1993); <em>Collins, </em>503 U.S., at 125, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L.

And just as we have required such careful description from the litigants, we have required of ourselves that we \u201cfocus on the allegations in the complaint to determine how petitioner describes the constitutional right at stake.\u201d <em>Collins, </em>503 U.S., at 125, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L. Ed. 2d 261; see also Stevens, Judicial Restraint, 22 San Diego L. Rev. 437, 446-448 (1985). This does not mean that we must define the asserted right at the most specific level, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a moral force it might otherwise have.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It means, simply, that we must pay close attention to the precise liberty interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">Our holdings should be similarly tailored. Even if the most expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for substantive due process recognition, particular components of the claim might. Just because there may not be a categorical</p>\n<p id=\"Axct\">[561 U.S. 883]</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">right to physician-assisted suicide, for example, does not \u201c \u2018foreclose the possibility that an individual plaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose assistance was sought, could prevail in a more particularized challenge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 735, n. 24, 117 S.

Even if a State\u2019s interest in regulating a certain matter must be permitted, in the general course, to trump the individual\u2019s countervailing liberty interest, there may still be situations in which the latter \u201cis entitled to constitutional protection.\u201d <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 742, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgments).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">As this discussion reflects, to acknowledge that the task of construing the liberty clause requires judgment is not to say that it is a license for unbridled judicial lawmaking. To the contrary, only an honest reckoning with our discretion allows for honest argumentation and meaningful accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">The question in this case, then, is not whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms (whatever that right\u2019s precise contours) applies to the States because the Amendment has been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment. It has not been. The question, rather, is whether the particular right asserted by petitioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment itself, standing on its own bottom. And to answer that question, we need to determine, first, the nature of the right that has been asserted and, second, whether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment \u201cliberty.\u201d Even accepting the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Heller, </em>it remains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear arms identified in that opinion</p>\n<p id=\"al_-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 884]</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">is not judicially enforceable against the States, or that only part of the right is so enforceable.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It is likewise possible for the Court to find in this case that some part of the <em>Heller </em>right applies to the States, and then to find in later cases that other parts of the right also apply, or apply on different terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">As noted at the outset, the liberty interest petitioners have asserted is the \u201cright to possess a functional, personal firearm, including a handgun, within the home.\u201d Complaint \u00b634, App. 23. The city of Chicago allows residents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are registered, but it generally prohibits the possession of handguns, sawed-off shotguns, ma-chineguns, and short-barreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a7 8-20-050 (2009).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Petitioners\u2019 complaint centered on their desire to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>a handgun at their domicile\u2014it references the \u201chome\u201d in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint \u00b6\u00b63-4, 11-30, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19-26\u2014as did their supporting declarations, see, <em>e.g., </em>App. 34, 36, 40, 43, 49-52, 54-56.

Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. But the <em>Heller </em>plaintiff sought only dispensation to keep an operable firearm in his home for lawful self-defense, see <em>id., </em>at 576, and n. 2, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637, and the Court\u2019s opinion was bookended by reminders that its holding was limited to that one issue, <em>id., </em>at 573, 635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; accord, <em>ante, </em>at 791, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 929 (plurality opinion). The distinction between the liberty right these petitioners have asserted and the Second Amendment right identified in <em>Heller </em>is therefore evanescent. Both are rooted to the home. Moreover, even if both rights have the logical potential to extend further, upon \u201cfuture evaluation,\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637, it is incumbent upon us, as federal judges contemplating a novel rule that would bind all 50 States, to proceed cautiously and to decide only what must be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Understood as a plea to keep their preferred type of firearm in the home, petitioners\u2019 argument has real force.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The decision to keep a loaded handgun in the house is often motivated by the desire to protect life, liberty, and property. It is comparable, in some ways, to decisions about the education and upbringing of one\u2019s children. For it is the kind of</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">[561 U.S. 886]</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">decision that may have profound consequences for every member of the family, and for the world beyond. In considering whether to keep a handgun, heads of households must ask themselves whether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of deliberate or accidental misuse that may result in death or serious injury, not only to residents of the home but to others as well. Millions of Americans have answered this question in the affirmative, not infrequently because they believe they have an inalienable right to do so\u2014because they consider it an aspect of \u201cthe supreme human dignity of being master of one\u2019s fate rather than a ward of the State,\u201d <em>Indiana </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>554 U.S. 164, 186, 128 S. Ct. 2379, 171 L. Ed. 2d 345 (2008) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>(Scalia, J., dissenting). Many such decisions have been based, in part, on family traditions and deeply held beliefs that are an aspect of individual autonomy the government may not control.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Bolstering petitioners\u2019 claim, our law has long recognized that the home provides a kind of special sanctuary in modern life. See, <em>e.g., </em>U. S. Const., Amdts. 3, 4; <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S., at 562, 567, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 585-590, 100 S. Ct. 1371, 63 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1980); <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>394 U.S. 557, 565-568, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542 (1969); <em>Griswold, </em>381 U.S., at 484-485, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510. Consequently, we have long accorded special deference to the privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a magnificent manse. This veneration of the domestic harkens back to the common law. William Blackstone recognized a \u201cright of habitation,\u201d 4 Commentaries *223, and opined that \u201cevery man\u2019s house is looked upon by the law to be his castle of defence and asylum,\u201d 3 <em>id., </em>at *288. <em>Heller </em>carried forward this legacy, observing that \u201cthe need for defense of self, family, and property is most acute\u201d in one\u2019s abode, and celebrating \u201cthe right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\u201d 554 U.S., at 628, 635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 2817, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">While the individual\u2019s interest in firearm possession is thus heightened in the home, the State\u2019s corresponding interest</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">[561 U.S. 887]</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">in regulation is somewhat weaker. The State generally has a lesser basis for regulating private as compared to public acts, and firearms kept inside the home generally pose a lesser threat to public welfare as compared to firearms taken outside. The historical case for regulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many States have for many years imposed stricter, and less controversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on their domestic possession. See, <em>e.g., id., </em>at 626, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 2816, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (noting that \u201cthe majority of the 19th-century courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues\u201d); <em>English </em>v. <em>State, </em>35 Tex. 473, 478-479 (1871) (observing that \u201calmost, if not every one of the States of this Union have [a prohibition on the carrying of deadly weapons] upon their statute books,\u201d and lambasting claims of a right to carry such weapons as \u201clittle short of ridiculous\u201d); Miller, Guns as Smut: Defending the Home-Bound Second Amendment, 109 Colum. L. Rev. 1278, 1321-1336 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-9\">It is significant, as well, that a rule limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home would be less intrusive on state prerogatives and easier to administer. Having unleashed in <em>Heller </em>a tsunami of legal uncertainty, and thus litigation,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and now on the cusp of imposing a national rule on the States in this area for the first time in United States history, the Court could at least moderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the States by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>adopting a rule that is clearly and tightly bounded in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">In their briefs to this Court, several <em>amici </em>have sought to bolster petitioners\u2019 claim still further by invoking a right to</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">[561 U.S. 888]</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">individual self-defense.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> As petitioners note, the <em>Heller </em>majority discussed this subject extensively and remarked that \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right.\u201d 554 U.S., at 628, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. And it is true that if a State were to try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of defending themselves from imminent physical threats, or to deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in response to criminal prosecution, that might pose a significant constitutional problem. The argument that there is a substantive due process right to be spared such untenable dilemmas is a serious one.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">[561 U.S. 889]</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-9\">But that is not the case before us. Petitioners have not asked that we establish a constitutional right to individual self-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court nor their filings in this Court make any such request. Nor do petitioners contend that the city of Chicago\u2014which, recall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shotguns, and to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>them loaded\u2014has unduly burdened any such right. What petitioners have asked is that we \u201cincorporate\u201d the Second Amendment and thereby establish a constitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States, to keep a handgun in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practicing self-defense. But the right to take a certain type of action is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and utilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that action. And while some might favor handguns, it is not clear that they are a superior weapon for lawful self-defense, and nothing in petitioners\u2019 argument turns on that being the case. The notion that a right of self-defense <em>implies </em>an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm presupposes not only controversial judgments about the strength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but also controversial assumptions</p>\n<p id=\"AlcY\">[561 U.S. 890]</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">about the likely effects of making that type of firearm more broadly available. It is a very long way from the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of self-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban handguns.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in particular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly relevant to an assessment of petitioners\u2019 asserted right, there is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case. The question we must decide is whether the interest in keeping in the home a firearm of one\u2019s choosing\u2014a handgun, for petitioners\u2014is one that is \u201ccomprised within the term liberty\u201d in the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Whitney, </em>274 U.S., at 373, 47 S. Ct. 641, 71 L. Ed. 1095 (Brandeis, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-10\">While I agree with the Court that our substantive due process cases offer a principled basis for holding that petitioners have a constitutional right to possess a usable firearm in the home, I am ultimately persuaded that a better reading of our case law supports the city of Chicago. I would not foreclose the possibility that a particular plaintiff\u2014say, an elderly widow who lives in a dangerous neighborhood and does not have the strength to operate a long gun\u2014may have</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-11\">[561 U.S. 891]</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-12\">a cognizable liberty interest in possessing a handgun. But I cannot accept petitioners\u2019 broader submission. A number of factors, taken together, lead me to this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-13\">First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent relationship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners defend their families and property from intruders, they can help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent victims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far from hypothetical, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>for gun crime has devastated many of our communities. <em>Amici </em>calculate that approximately 1 million Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire in the last decade.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Urban areas such as Chicago suffer disproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Handguns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some homeowners may prefer handguns because of their small size, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals will value them for the same reasons. See <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 710-712, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more than four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of all murders nationwide.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\">Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from particular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides of the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as well as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique potential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to destabilize ordered liberty. <em>Your </em>interest in keeping and bearing a certain firearm may diminish <em>my </em>interest in being and feeling safe from armed violence. And while granting you the right</p>\n<p id=\"Aexm\">[561 U.S. 892]</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">to own a handgun might make you safer on any given day\u2014assuming the handgun\u2019s marginal contribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contribution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mischief\u2014it may make you and the community you live in less safe overall, owing to the increased number of handguns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democratically elected legislature to take such concerns into account in considering what sorts of regulations would best serve the public welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">The practical impact of various gun-control measures may be highly controversial, but this basic insight should not be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive threat to the social order\u2014and that reasonable restrictions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable burden on one\u2019s personal liberty\u2014is as old as the Republic. As The Chief Justice observed just the other day, it is a foundational premise of modern government that the State holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: \u201cA basic step in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword out of private hands and turn it over to an organized government, acting on behalf of all the people.\u201d <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>United States ex rel. Watson, </em>560 U.S. 272, 282-283, 130 S. Ct. 2184, 176 L. Ed. 2d 1024 (2010) (dissenting opinion). The same holds true for the handgun. The power a man has in the state of nature \u201cof doing whatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself and the rest of mankind, he gives up,\u201d to a significant extent, \u201cto be regulated by laws made by the society.\u201d J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7 129, p. 64 (J. Gough ed. 1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does not dislodge this conclusion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>Even though the Court has long afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home, we have never understood that principle to \u201cinfring[e] upon\u201d the authority of the States to proscribe certain inherently dangerous items, for \u201c[i]n such cases, compelling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the individual to possess those</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">[561 U.S. 893]</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">materials.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>394 U.S., at 568, n. 11, 89 S. Ct. 1243, 22 L. Ed. 2d 542. And, of course, guns that start out in the home may not stay in the home. Even if the government has a weaker basis for restricting domestic possession of firearms as compared to public carriage\u2014and even if a blanket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might therefore be unconstitutional\u2014the line between the two is a porous one. A state or local legislature may determine that a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon is necessary to police that line.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">Second, the right to possess a firearm of one\u2019s choosing is different in kind from the liberty interests we have recognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the plethora of substantive due process cases that have been decided in the <em>post-Lochner </em>century, I have found none that holds, states, or even suggests that the term \u201cliberty\u201d encompasses either the common-law right of self-defense or a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a moment that many Americans feel deeply passionate about firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life as well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not appear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or any particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of autonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace offers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imperfect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their <em>amici </em>make such a contention. Petitioners\u2019 claim is not the kind of substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform, judicially enforced national standard is presumptively appropriate.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">[561 U.S. 894]</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-9\">Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue may be better viewed as a property right. Petitioners wish to <em>acquire </em>certain types of firearms, or to <em>keep </em>certain firearms they have previously acquired. Interests in the possession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as property interests subject to definition and regulation by the States. Cf. <em>Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>560 U.S. 702, 707, 130 S. Ct. 2592, 177 L. Ed. 2d 184 (2010) (opinion for the Court by Sca-lia, J.) (\u201cGenerally speaking, state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>law defines property interests\u201d). Under that tradition, Chicago\u2019s ordinance is unexceptional.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\">The liberty interest asserted by petitioners is also dissimilar from those we have recognized in its capacity to undermine the security of others. To be sure, some of the Bill of Rights\u2019 procedural guarantees may place \u201crestrictions on</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">[561 U.S. 895]</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">law enforcement\u201d that have \u201ccontroversial public safety implications.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 783, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 924 (plurality opinion); see also <em>ante, </em>at 799, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 943 (opinion of Scalia, J.). But those implications are generally quite attenuated. A defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness, or to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any threat. The defendant\u2019s liberty interest is constrained by (and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process. The link between handgun ownership and public safety is much tighter. The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the handgun\u2019s bullets <em>are </em>the violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound offense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the practices of another religion, or a gay couple\u2019s choice to have intimate relations. But that offense is moral, psychological, or theological in nature; the actions taken by the rights bearers do not actually threaten the physical safety of any other person.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Firearms may be used to kill another person. If a legislature\u2019s response to dangerous weapons ends up impinging upon the liberty of any individuals in pursuit of the greater good, it invariably does so on the basis of more than the majority\u2019s \u201c \u2018own moral code,\u201d\u2019 <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S., at 571, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (quoting <em>Casey, </em>505 U.S., at 850, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 120 L. Ed. 2d 674). While specific policies may of course be misguided, gun control is an area in which it \u201cis quite wrong ... to assume that regulation and liberty occupy mutually exclusive zones\u2014that as one expands, the other must contract.\u201d Stevens, 41 U. Miami L. Rev., at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">Third, the experience of other advanced democracies, including those that share our British heritage, undercuts the notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms is intrinsic to ordered liberty. Many of these countries place restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of firearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in this Nation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-10\">[561 U.S. 896]</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">See Municipal Respondents\u2019 Brief 21-23 (discussing laws of England, Canada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Luxembourg, and New Zealand). That the United States is an international outlier in the permissiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that our laws are bad laws. It does suggest that this Court may not need to assume responsibility for making our laws still more permissive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in many relevant respects, including their problems with violent crime and the traditional role that firearms have played in their societies. But they are not so different from the United States that we ought to dismiss their experience entirely. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 781-782, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 923 (plurality opinion); <em>ante, </em>at 800-801, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 935 (opinion of Scalia, J.). The fact that our oldest allies have almost uniformly found it appropriate to regulate firearms extensively tends to weaken petitioners\u2019 submission that the right to possess a gun of one\u2019s choosing is fundamental to a life of liberty. While the \u201cAmerican perspective\u201d must always be our focus, <em>ante, </em>at 784, 791, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 925, 929 (plurality opinion), it is silly\u2014indeed, arrogant\u2014to think we have nothing to learn about liberty from the billions of people beyond our borders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">Fourth, the Second Amendment differs in kind from the Amendments that surround it, with the consequence that its inclusion in the Bill of Rights is not merely unhelpful but positively harmful to petitioners\u2019 claim. Generally, the inclusion of a liberty interest in the Bill of Rights points toward the conclusion that it is of fundamental significance and ought to be enforceable against the States. But the Second Amendment plays a peculiar role within the Bill, as announced by its peculiar opening clause.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Even accepting the <em>Heller </em>Court\u2019s view that the Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms disconnected from militia service, it remains undeniable that \u201cthe purpose for which</p>\n<p id=\"ajg--dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 897]</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">the right was codified\u201d was \u201cto prevent elimination of the militia.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206 (1939) (Second Amendment was enacted \u201c[w]ith obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of [militia] forces\u201d). It was the States, not private persons, on whose immediate behalf the Second Amendment was adopted. Notwithstanding the <em>Heller </em>Court\u2019s efforts to write the Second Amendment\u2019s preamble out of the Constitution, the Amendment still serves the structural function of protecting the States from encroachment by an overreaching Federal Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">The Second Amendment, in other words, \u201cis a federalism provision,\u201d <em>Elk Grove Unified School Dist. </em>v. <em>Newdow, </em>542 U.S. 1, 45, 124 S. Ct. 2301, 159 L. Ed. 2d 98 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). It is directed at preserving the autonomy of the sovereign States, and its logic therefore \u201cresists\u201d incorporation by a federal court <em>against </em>the States. <em>Ibid. </em>No one suggests that the Tenth Amendment, which provides that powers not given to the Federal Government remain with \u201cthe States,\u201d applies to the States; such a reading would border on incoherent, given that the Tenth Amendment exists (in significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>part) to safeguard the vitality of state governance. The Second Amendment is no different.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1041-4\">The Court is surely correct that Americans\u2019 conceptions of the Second Amendment right evolved over time in a more individualistic direction; that Members of the Reconstruction Congress were urgently concerned about the safety of the newly freed slaves; and that some Members believed that,</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">[561 U.S. 898]</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Second Amendment would apply to the States. But it is a giant leap from these data points to the conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cincorporated\u201d the Second Amendment as a matter of original meaning or postenactment interpretation. Consider, for example, that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment says nothing about the Second Amendment or firearms; that there is substantial evidence to suggest that, when the Reconstruction Congress enacted measures to ensure newly freed slaves and Union sympathizers in the South enjoyed the right to possess firearms, it was motivated by antidis-crimination and equality concerns rather than arms-bearing concerns <em>per </em>se;<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> that many contemporaneous courts and commentators did not understand the Fourteenth Amendment to have had an \u201cincorporating\u201d effect; and that the States heavily regulated the right to keep and bear arms both before and after the Amendment\u2019s passage. The Court\u2019s narrative largely elides these facts. The complications they raise show why even the most dogged historical inquiry into the \u201cfundamentality\u201d of the Second Amendment right (or any other) necessarily entails judicial judgment\u2014 and therefore judicial discretion\u2014every step of the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-8\">I accept that the evolution in Americans\u2019 understanding of the Second Amendment may help shed light on the question whether a right to keep and bear arms is included</p>\n<p id=\"akd-dedup-1\">[561 U.S. 899]</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-9\">within Fourteenth Amendment \u201cliberty.\u201d But the reasons that motivated the Framers to protect the ability of militiamen to keep muskets available for military use when our Nation was in its infancy, or that motivated the Reconstruction Congress to extend full citizenship to the freedmen in the wake of the Civil War, have only a limited bearing on the question that confronts the homeowner in a crime-infested metropolis today. The many episodes of brutal violence against African-Americans that blight our Nation\u2019s history, see <em>ante, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>771-776, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 916-920 (majority opinion); <em>ante, </em>at 843-847, 856-858, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 961-963, 968-970 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), do not suggest that every American must be allowed to own whatever type of firearm he or she desires\u2014just that no group of Americans should be systematically and discriminatorily disarmed and left to the mercy of racial terrorists. And the fact that some Americans may have thought or hoped that the Fourteenth Amendment would nationalize the Second Amendment hardly suffices to justify the conclusion that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-4\">Fifth, although it may be true that Americans\u2019 interest in firearm possession and state-law recognition of that interest are \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in some important senses, <em>ante, </em>at 767, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 914 (internal quotation marks omitted), it is equally true that the States have a long and unbroken history of regulating firearms. The idea that States may place substantial restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms short of complete disarmament is, in fact, far more entrenched than the notion that the Federal Constitution protects any such right. Federalism is a far \u201colder and more deeply rooted tradition than is a right to carry,\u201d or to own, \u201cany particular kind of weapon.\u201d 567 F.3d, at 860 (Easterbrook, C.

See <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 699-704, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Chicago\u2019s handgun ban, in itself, has divided researchers.

But the Constitution\u2019s text, history, and structure are not so clear on the matter before us\u2014as evidenced by the groundbreaking nature of today\u2019s fractured decision\u2014and this Court lacks both the technical capacity and the localized expertise to assess \u201cthe wisdom, need, and propriety\u201d of most gun-control measures. <em>Griswold, </em>381 U.S., at 482, 85 S.

Quite to the contrary, today\u2019s decision invites an avalanche of litigation that could mire the federal courts in fine-grained determinations about which state and local regulations comport with the <em>Heller </em>right\u2014the precise contours of which are far from pellucid\u2014under a standard of review we have not even established. See <em>post, </em>at 923-924, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1011-1013. The plurality\u2019s \u201cassuranc[e]\u201d that \u201cincorporation does not imperil every law regulating firearms,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 786, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 926, provides only modest comfort. For it is also an admission of just how many different types of regulations are potentially implicated by today\u2019s ruling, and of just how ad hoc the Court\u2019s initial attempt to draw distinctions among them was in <em>Heller. </em>The practical significance of the proposition that \u201cthe Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 750, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 903 (majority opinion), remains to be worked out by this Court over many, many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">Furthermore, and critically, the Court\u2019s imposition of a national standard is still more unwise because the elected branches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of safeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms. The strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in connection with its status in the democratic process. And in this case, no one disputes \u201cthat opponents of [gun] control have considerable political power and do not seem to be at a systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,\u201d or that \u201cthe widespread commitment to an individual right to own guns . . . operates as a safeguard against excessive or unjustified gun</p>\n<p id=\"a2e-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 905]</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">control laws.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Sunstein, Second Amendment Minimalism: <em>Heller </em>as <em>Griswold, </em>122 Harv. L. Rev. 246, 260 (2008). Indeed, there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers tend to <em>under-</em>regulate guns, relative to the policy views expressed by majorities in opinion polls. See K. Goss, Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America 6 (2006). If a particular State or locality has enacted some \u201cimprovident\u201d gun-control measures, as petitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent reason to infer that the mistake will not \u201ceventually be rectified by the democratic process.\u201d <em>Vance </em>v. <em>Bradley, </em>440 U.S. 93, 97, 99 S. Ct. 939, 59 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">This is not a case, then, that involves a \u201cspecial condition\u201d that \u201cmay call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.\u201d <em>Carolene Products, </em>304 U.S., at 153, n. 4, 58 S.

Neither petitioners nor those most zealously committed to their views represent a group or a claim that is liable to receive unfair treatment at the hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>of the majority. On the contrary, petitioners\u2019 views are supported by powerful participants in the legislative process. Petitioners have given us no reason to believe that the interest in keeping and bearing arms entails any special need for judicial lawmaking, or that federal judges are more qualified to craft appropriate rules than the people\u2019s elected representatives. Having failed to show why their asserted interest is intrinsic to the concept of ordered liberty or vulnerable to maltreatment in the political arena, they have failed to show why \u201cthe word liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d should be \u201cheld to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion\u201d about how to deal with the problem of handgun violence in the city of Chicago. <em>Lochner, </em>198 U.S., at 76, 25 S. Ct. 539, 49 L. Ed. 937 (Holmes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">[561 U.S. 906]</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">The preceding sections have already addressed many of the points made by Justice Scalia in his concurrence. But in light of that opinion\u2019s fixation on this one, it is appropriate to say a few words about Justice Sca-lia\u2019s broader claim: that his preferred method of substantive due process analysis, a method \u201cthat makes the traditions of our people paramount,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 792, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 929, is both more restrained and more facilitative of democracy than the method I have outlined. Colorful as it is, Justice Scalia\u2019s critique does not have nearly as much force as does his rhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover, comes with its own profound difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">Although Justice Scalia aspires to an \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cneutral\u201d method of substantive due process analysis, <em>ante, </em>at 800, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 932, his actual method is nothing of the sort. Under the \u201chistorically focused\u201d approach he advocates, <em>ante, </em>at 803, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 937, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever gets to the history. At what level of generality should one frame the liberty interest in question? See n. 25, <em>supra. </em>What does it mean for a right to be \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u2019 \u201d <em>ante, </em>at 793, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 930 (quoting <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772)? By what standard will that proposition be tested? Which types of sources will count, and how will those sources be weighed and aggregated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these questions. There is not even a theory\u2014at least, Justice Scalia provides none\u2014of how to go about answering them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">Nor is there any escaping <em>Palko, </em>it seems. To qualify for substantive due process protection, Justice Scalia has stated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply rooted in American tradition, \u201cbut it must <em>also </em>be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S., at 593, n. 3, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying the latter, Palko-derived half of that test requires</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">[561 U.S. 907]</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">precisely the sort of reasoned judgment\u2014the same multifaceted evaluation of the right\u2019s contours and consequences\u2014that Justice Scalia mocks in his concurrence today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-12\">So does applying the first half. It is hardly a novel insight that history is not an objective science, and that its use can therefore \u201cpoint in any direction the judges favor,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 804, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 937 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Yet 21 years after the point was brought to his attention by Jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>tice Brennan, Justice Scalia remains \u201coblivious to the fact that [the concept of \u2018tradition\u2019] can be as malleable and as elusive as \u2018liberty\u2019 itself.\u201d <em>Michael H., </em>491 U.S., at 137, 109 S. Ct. 2333, 105 L. Ed. 2d 91 (dissenting opinion). Even when historical analysis is focused on a discrete proposition, such as the original public meaning of the Second Amendment, the evidence often points in different directions. The historian must choose which pieces to credit and which to discount, and then must try to assemble them into a coherent whole. In <em>Heller, </em>Justice Scalia preferred to rely on sources created much earlier and later in time than the Second Amendment itself, see, <em>e.g., </em>554 U.S., at 577-578, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (consulting late-19th-century treatises to ascertain how Americans would have read the Amendment\u2019s preamble in 1791); I focused more closely on sources contemporaneous with the Amendment\u2019s drafting and ratification.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> No mechanical yardstick can measure which of us was correct, either with respect to the materials we chose to privilege or the insights we gleaned from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\">The malleability and elusiveness of history increase exponentially when we move from a pure question of original meaning, as in <em>Heller, </em>to Justice Scalia\u2019s theory of substantive</p>\n<p id=\"a4z-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 908]</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">due process. At least with the former sort of question, the judge can focus on a single legal provision; the temporal scope of the inquiry is (or should be) relatively bounded; and there is substantial agreement on what sorts of authorities merit consideration. With Justice Scalia\u2019s approach to substantive due process, these guideposts all fall away. The judge must canvas the entire landscape of American law as it has evolved through time, and perhaps older laws as well, see, <em>e.g., Lawrence, </em>539 U.S., at 596, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (discussing \u201c \u2018ancient roots\u2019 \u201d of proscriptions against sodomy (quoting <em>Bowers </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>478 U.S. 186, 192, 106 S. Ct. 2841, 92 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1986))), pursuant to a standard (deeply rootedness) that has never been defined. In conducting this rudderless, panoramic tour of American legal history, the judge has more than ample opportunity to \u201clook over the heads of the crowd and pick out [his] friends,\u201d <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 617, 125 S. Ct. 1183, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1 (2005) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">My point is not to criticize judges\u2019 use of history in general or to suggest that it always generates indeterminate answers; I have already emphasized that historical study can discipline as well as enrich substantive due process analysis. My point is simply that Justice Scalia\u2019s defense of his method, which holds out objectivity and restraint as its cardinal\u2014and, it seems, only\u2014virtues, is unsatisfying on its own terms. For a limitless number of subjective judgments may be smuggled into his historical analysis. Worse, they may be <em>buried, </em>in the analysis. At least with my approach, the judge\u2019s cards are laid on the table for all to see, and to critique. The judge must exercise judgment, to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>sure. When answering a constitutional question to which the text provides no clear answer, there is always some amount of discretion; our constitutional system has always depended on judges\u2019 filling in the document\u2019s vast open spaces.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> But there is also transparency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">[561 U.S. 909]</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">Justice Scalia\u2019s approach is even less restrained in another sense: It would effect a major break from our case law outside of the \u201cincorporation\u201d area. Justice Scalia does not seem troubled by the fact that his method is largely inconsistent with the Court\u2019s canonical substantive due process decisions, ranging from <em>Meyer, </em>262 U.S. 390, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed. 1042, and <em>Pierce, </em>268 U.S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070, in the 1920\u2019s, to <em>Griswold, </em>381 U.S. 479, 85 S. Ct. 1678, 14 L. Ed. 2d 510, in the 1960\u2019s, to <em>Lawrence, </em>539 U.S. 558, 123 S. Ct. 2472, 156 L. Ed. 2d 508, in the 2000\u2019s. To the contrary, he seems to embrace this dissonance. My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on which the American people have relied for decades. Justice Scalia\u2019s method seeks to vaporize them. So I am left to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation\u2019s constitutional history? And which of us is more faithful to the values and commitments of the American people, as they stand today? In 1967, when the Court held in <em>Loving, </em>388 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1817, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1010, that adults have a liberty-based as well as equality-based right to wed persons of another race, interracial marriage was hardly \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in American tradition. Racial segregation and subordination were deeply rooted. The Court\u2019s substantive due process holding was nonetheless correct\u2014and we should be wary of any interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make: Justice Scalia\u2019s method invites not only bad history, but also bad constitutional law. As I have already explained, in evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitutional claim for that matter), it makes perfect sense to give history significant weight: Justice Scalia\u2019s position is closer to my own than he apparently feels comfortable acknowledging. But it makes little sense to give history dispositive weight in every case. And it makes <em>especially </em>little sense to answer questions like whether the right to bear arms is \u201cfundamental\u201d by focusing only on the past, given that both the practical significance and the public understandings of such a right often change as society changes. What if the evidence had</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">[561 U.S. 910]</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">shown that, whereas at one time firearm possession contributed substantially to personal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes nothing, or even tends to undermine them? Would it still have been reasonable to constitutionalize the right?</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">The concern runs still deeper. Not only can historical views be less than completely clear or informative, but they can also be wrong. Some notions that many Americans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not to be true. Some practices that many Americans believed to be consistent with the Constitution\u2019s guarantees of liberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be inconsistent with them. The fact that we have a written Constitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal existence. Although we should always \u201cpa[y] a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>decent regard to the opinions of former times,\u201d it is \u201cnot the glory of the people of America\u201d to have \u201csuffered a blind veneration for antiquity.\u201d The Federalist No. 14, pp. 99, 104 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). It is not the role of federal judges to be amateur historians. And it is not fidelity to the Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious language, in an effort to transform foundational legal commitments into narrow rules of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">As for \u201cthe democratic process,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 804, 805, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 937, 938, a method that looks exclusively to history can easily do more harm than good. Just consider this case. The net result of Justice Scalia\u2019s supposedly objective analysis is to vest federal judges\u2014ultimately a majority of the judges on this Court\u2014 with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area in which they have no special qualifications, and in which the give-and-take of the political process has functioned effectively for decades. Why this \u201cintrudes much less upon the democratic process,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 804, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 937, than an approach that would defer to the democratic process on the regulation of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident. I cannot even tell what, under Justice Scalia\u2019s view, constitutes an \u201cintrusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">[561 U.S. 911]</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democracy that underlies Justice Scalia\u2019s critique. Very few of us would welcome a system in which majorities or powerful interest groups always get their way. Under our constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a judicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have outlined\u2014an approach that investigates both the intrinsic nature of the claimed interest and the practical significance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its reasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate constraints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it, and that is willing to protect some rights even if they have not already received uniform protection from the elected branches\u2014has the capacity to improve, rather than \u201c[im]peril,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 805, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 938, our democracy. It all depends on judges\u2019 exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it always has, and as it always will.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-9\">The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in the Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the Court\u2019s decision to enforce that right against the States. By its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the States; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals outside of the militia context. The Second Amendment was adopted to protect the <em>States </em>from federal encroachment. And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been understood by the Court to have \u201cincorporated\u201d the entire Bill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about today\u2019s outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-10\">Although the Court\u2019s decision in this case might be seen as a mere adjunct to its decision in <em>Heller, </em>the consequences could prove far more destructive\u2014quite literally\u2014to our Nation\u2019s communities and to our constitutional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment right identified in <em>Heller </em>and its newly minted Fourteenth Amendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the home. But neither the \u201cassurances\u201d provided by the plurality, <em>ante, </em>at 786, 177 L.

For the reasons set out at length above, I cannot accept either the methodology the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Although impressively argued, the majority\u2019s decision to overturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent and to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is not, in my judgment, built \u201cupon respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms.\u201d <em>Griswold, </em>381 U.S., at 501, 85 S.

The argument that this Court should establish any such right, however, faces steep hurdles. All 50 States already recognize self-defense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses \u00a7 132 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly an interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive. And the States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this interest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and amounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of aggressors, the availability of the \u201ccastle doctrine,\u2019\u2019 and so forth. See Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>9-21; Brief for American Cities et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>17-19; 2 W. LaPave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 10.4, pp. 142-160 (2d ed. 2003). Such variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist system, as the States and localities select different rules in light of different priorities, customs, and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-12\">As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of self-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear. We have generally understood Fourteenth Amendment \u201cliberty\u2019\u2019 as something one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal right of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent government tyranny, it is only when the State has <em>failed </em>to interfere with (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially necessary. Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy that, in entering civil society and gaining \u2018The advantages of mutual commerce\u2019\u2019 and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish, to a significant degree, \u201cthat wild and savage liberty\u2019\u2019 one possessed in the state of nature. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *125; see also, <em>e.g., </em>J. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government \u00a7 128, pp. 63-64 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (in state of nature man has power \u201cto do whatever he thinks fit for the preservation of himself and others,\u2019\u2019 but this \u201che gives up when he joins in a . . . particular political society\u2019\u2019); <em>Green </em>v. <em>Biddle, </em>8 Wheat. 1, 63, 5 L. Ed. 547 (1823) (argument for defendant) (\u201cIt is a trite maxim, that man gives up a part of his natural liberty when he enters into civil society, as the price of the blessings of that state: and it may be said, with truth, this liberty is well exchanged for the advantages which flow from law and justice\u2019\u2019). Some strains of founding-era thought took a very narrow view of the right to armed self-defense. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitutional and Pennsylvania History as <em>Amici Curiae </em>6-13 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories). Just because there may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self-defense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restrictions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional right to the same.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1036-14\">. The Second Amendment right identified in <em>Heller </em>is likewise clearly distinct from a right to protect oneself. In my view, the Court badly misconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of personal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state militias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with tyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military, not with criminals and intruders. But even still, the Court made clear that self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and substance of the Amendment\u2019s guarantee. The Court struck down the District of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban not because of the <em>utility </em>of handguns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their <em>popularity </em>for that purpose. See 554 U.S., at 629, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. And the Court\u2019s common-use gloss on the Second Amendment right, see <em>id., </em>at 627, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L.

Nor can I find any justification for interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate regulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from democratically elected legislatures to courts or from the States to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude that the Fourteenth Amendment does not \u201cincorporate\u201d the Second Amendment\u2019s right \u201cto keep and bear Arms.\u201d And I consequently dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">The Second Amendment says: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d Two years ago, in <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S. Ct. 2783, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (2008), the Court rejected the pre-existing judicial consensus that the Second Amendment was primarily concerned with the need to maintain a \u201cwell regulated Militia.\u201d See <em>id., </em>at 638, and n. 2, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>id., </em>at 672-679, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206 (1939). Although the Court acknowledged that \u201cthe threat that the new Federal Government would destroy the citizens\u2019 militia by taking away their arms <em>was the reason </em>that right . . . was codified in a written Constitution,\u201d the Court asserted that \u201cindividual self-defense . .. was the <em>central component </em>of the right itself.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (some emphasis added). The Court went on to hold that the Second Amendment restricted Congress\u2019 power to regulate handguns used for self-defense, and the Court found unconstitutional the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on the possession of handguns in the home. <em>Id., </em>at 635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">[561 U.S. 914]</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">The Court based its conclusions almost exclusively upon its reading of history. But the relevant history in <em>Heller </em>was far from clear: Four dissenting Justices disagreed with the majority\u2019s historical analysis. And subsequent scholarly writing reveals why disputed history provides treacherous ground on which to build decisions written by judges who are not expert at history.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Since <em>Heller, </em>historians, scholars, and judges have continued to express the view that the Court\u2019s historical account was flawed. See, <em>e.g., </em>Konig, Why the Second Amendment Has a Preamble: Original Public Meaning and the Political Culture of Written Constitutions in Revolutionary America, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1295 (2009); Finkelman, It Really Was About a Well Regulated Militia, 59 Syracuse L. Rev. 267 (2008); P.

Rev. 171 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">Consider as an example of these critiques an <em>amici </em>brief filed in this case by historians who specialize in the study of the English Civil Wars. They tell us that <em>Heller </em>misunderstood a key historical point. See Brief for English/Early American Historians <em>as Amici Curiae </em>(hereinafter English Historians\u2019 Brief) (filed by 21 professors at leading universities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia). <em>Heller\u2019s </em>conclusion that \u201cindividual self-defense\u201d was \u201cthe</p>\n<p id=\"AoOe\">[561 U.S. 915]</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-9\"><em>central component\u201d </em>of the Second Amendment\u2019s right \u201cto keep and bear Arms\u201d rested upon its view that the Amendment \u201ccodified a <em>pre-existing </em>right\u201d that had \u201cnothing whatever to do with service in a militia.\u201d 554 U.S., at 599, 592-593, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. That view in turn rested in significant part upon Black<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>stone having described the right as \u201c \u2018the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence,\u2019 \u201d which reflected the provision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that gave the King\u2019s Protestant \u201c \u2018subjects\u2019 \u201d the right to \u201c \u2018have arms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as allowed by Law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 593-594, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (quoting 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 140 (1765) (hereinafter Blackstone), and 1 W. &amp; M., ch. 2, \u00a7 7, in 3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689)). The Framers, said the majority, understood that right \u201cas permitting a citizen to \u2018repe[l] force by force\u2019 when \u2018the intervention of society in his behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.\u2019 \u201d 554 U.S., at 595, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (quoting 1 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries 145-146, n. 42 (S. Tucker ed. 1803)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The historians now tell us, however, that the right to which Blackstone referred had, not <em>nothing, </em>but <em>everything, </em>to do with the militia. As properly understood at the time of the English Civil Wars, the historians claim, the right to bear arms \u201censured that <em>Parliament </em>had the power\u201d to arm the citizenry: \u201cto defend the realm\u201d in the case of a foreign enemy, and to \u201csecure the right of \u2018self-preservation,\u2019 \u201d or \u201cself-defense,\u201d should <em>\u201cthe sovereign </em>usurp the English Constitution.\u201d English Historians\u2019 Brief 3, 8-13, 23-24 (emphasis added). Thus, the Declaration of Right says that private persons can possess guns only \u201c \u2018as allowed by law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>at 13. See <em>id., </em>at 20-24. Moreover, when Blackstone referred to \u201c \u2018the right of having and using arms for self-preservation and defence,\u2019 \u201d he was referring to the right of the people <em>\u201cto take part in the militia </em>to defend their political liberties,\u201d and <em>to the right of Parliament </em>(which represented the people) to <em>raise a militia </em>even when the King sought to deny it</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">[561 U.S. 916]</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">that power. <em>Id., </em>at 4, 24-27 (emphasis added). Nor can the historians find any convincing reason to believe that the Framers had something different in mind than what Blackstone himself meant. Compare <em>Heller, supra, </em>at 593-595, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637, with English Historians\u2019 Brief 28-40. The historians concede that at least one historian takes a different position, see <em>id., </em>at 7, but the Court, they imply, would lose a poll taken among professional historians of this period, say, by a vote of 8 to 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">If history, and history alone, is what matters, why would the Court not now reconsider <em>Heller </em>in light of these more recently published historical views? See <em>Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>PSKS, Inc., </em>551 U.S. 877, 923-924, 127 S. Ct. 2705, 168 L. Ed. 2d 623 (2007) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting that <em>stare decisis </em>interests are at their lowest with respect to recent and erroneous constitutional decisions that create unworkable legal regimes); <em>Citizens United </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>558 U.S. 310, 362-363, 130 S.

Ed. 2d 29 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) <em>(\u201c[SJtare decisis </em>may bind courts as to matters of law, but it cannot bind them as to matters of history\u201d). At the least, where <em>Heller\u2019s </em>historical foundations are so uncertain, why extend its applicability?</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">My aim in referring to this history is to illustrate the reefs and shoals that he in wait for those nonexpert judges who place virtually determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>tive weight upon historical considerations. In my own view, the Court should not look to history alone but to other factors as well\u2014above all, in cases where the history is so unclear that the experts themselves strongly disagree. It should, for example, consider the basic values that underlie a constitutional provision and their contemporary significance. And it should examine as well the relevant consequences and practical justifications that might, or might not, warrant removing an important question from the democratic decisionmaking process. See <em>ante, </em>at 873-877, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 979-982</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-4\">[561 U.S. 917]</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">(Stevens, J., dissenting) (discussing shortcomings of an exclusively historical approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">In my view, taking <em>Heller </em>as a given, the Fourteenth Amendment does not incorporate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self-defense. Under this Court\u2019s precedents, to incorporate the private self-defense right the majority must show that the right is, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cfundamental to the American scheme of justice,\u201d <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 149, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968); see <em>ibid., </em>n. 14; see also <em>ante, </em>at 791, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 929 (plurality opinion) (finding that the right is \u201cfundamental\u201d and therefore incorporated). And this it fails to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">The majority here, like that in <em>Heller, </em>relies almost exclusively upon history to make the necessary showing. <em>Ante, </em>at 768-780, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 915-922. But to do so for incorporation purposes is both wrong and dangerous. As Justice Stevens points out, our society has historically made mistakes\u2014for example, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century property rights to be fundamental. <em>Ante, </em>at 876, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 981. And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere, history often is unclear about the answers. See Part I, <em>supra; </em>Part III, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-11\">Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation question, has never stated that the historical status of a right is the only relevant consideration. Rather, the Court has either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opinions that the right in question has remained fundamental over time. See, <em>e.g., Apodaca </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>406 U.S. 404, 410, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation \u201cinquiry must focus upon the function served\u201d by the right in question in <em>\u201ccontemporary </em>society\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Duncan, supra, </em>at 154, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (noting that the right in question \u201ccontinues to receive strong support\u201d); <em>Klopfer </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>386</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-12\">[561 U.S. 918]</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-13\">U.S. 213, 226, 87 S. Ct. 988, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1967) (same). And, indeed, neither of the parties before us in this case has asked us to employ the majority\u2019s history-constrained approach. See Brief for Petitioners 67-69 (arguing for incorporation based on trends in contemporary support for the right); Brief for Respondent City of Chicago et al. 23-31 (hereinafter Brief for Municipal Respondents) (looking to current state practices with respect to the right).</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-14\">I thus think it proper, above all where history provides no clear answer, to look to other factors in considering whether a right is sufficiently \u201cfundamental\u201d to remove it from the political process in every State. I would include among those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>factors the nature of the right; any contemporary disagreement about whether the right is fundamental; the extent to which incorporation will further other, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the extent to which incorporation will advance or hinder the Constitution\u2019s structural aims, including its division of powers among different governmental institutions (and the people as well). Is incorporation needed, for example, to further the Constitution\u2019s effort to ensure that the government treats each individual with equal respect? Will it help maintain the democratic form of government that the Constitution foresees? In a word, will incorporation prove consistent, or inconsistent, with the Constitution\u2019s efforts to create governmental institutions well suited to the carrying out of its constitutional promises?</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">Finally, I would take account of the Framers\u2019 basic reason for believing the Court ought to have the power of judicial review. Alexander Hamilton feared granting that power to Congress alone, for he feared that Congress, acting as judges, would not overturn as unconstitutional a popular statute that it had recently enacted, as legislators. The Federalist No. 78, p. 405 (G. Carey &amp; J. McClellan eds. 2001) (\u201cThis independence of the judges is equally requisite to guard the constitution and the rights of individuals from the</p>\n<p id=\"a5n-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 919]</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">effects of those ill humours which\u201d can, at times, lead to \u201cserious oppressions of the minor party in the community\u201d). Judges, he thought, may find it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the basic rights of an unpopular minority. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carolene Products Co., </em>304 U.S. 144, 152, n. 4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234 (1938). That being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particular comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case at hand. See, <em>e.g., </em>J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-9\">How do these considerations apply here? For one thing, I would apply them only to the private self-defense right directly at issue. After all, the Amendment\u2019s militia-related purpose is primarily to protect <em>States </em>from <em>federal </em>regulation, not to protect individuals from militia-related regulation. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; see also <em>Miller, </em>307 U.S., at 178, 59 S. Ct. 816, 83 L. Ed. 1206. Moreover, the Civil War Amendments, the electoral process, the courts, and numerous other institutions today help to safeguard the States and the people from any serious threat of federal tyranny. How are state militias additionally necessary? It is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority concedes, has \u201clargely faded as a popular concern\u201d could possibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorporation through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Ante, </em>at 770, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 916. Hence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot be based on the militia-related aspect of what <em>Heller </em>found to be more extensive Second Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-10\">For another thing, as <em>Heller </em>concedes, the private self-defense right that the Court would incorporate has nothing to do with \u201cthe reason\u201d the Framers \u201ccodified\u201d the right to keep and bear arms \u201cin a written Constitution.\u201d 554 U.S., at 599, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (emphasis added). <em>Heller </em>immediately adds that the self-defense right was nonetheless \u201cthe <em>central component </em>of the right.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In my view, this is the historical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>equivalent of a claim that water runs uphill. See Part I, <em>supra. </em>But, taking it as valid, the Framers\u2019 basic <em>reasons </em>for including</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">[561 U.S. 920]</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">language in the Constitution would nonetheless seem more pertinent (in deciding about the contemporary <em>importance </em>of a right) than the particular <em>scope </em>17th- or 18th-century listeners would have then assigned to the words they used. And examination of the Framers\u2019 motivation tells us they did not think the private armed self-defense right was of paramount importance. See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitution, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1164 (1991) (\u201c[T]o see the [Second] Amendment as primarily concerned with an individual right to hunt, or protect one\u2019s home,\u201d would be \u201clike viewing the heart of the speech and assembly clauses as the right of persons to meet to play bridge\u201d); see also, <em>e.g., </em>Rakove, The Second Amendment: The Highest Stage of Originalism, 76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 103, 127-128 (2000); Brief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as <em>Amici Curiae </em>22-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Further, there is no popular consensus that the private self-defense right described in <em>Heller </em>is fundamental. The plurality suggests that two <em>amici </em>briefs filed in the case show such a consensus, see <em>ante, </em>at 789, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 928, but, of course, numerous <em>amici </em>briefs have been filed opposing incorporation as well. Moreover, every State regulates firearms extensively, and public opinion is sharply divided on the appropriate level of regulation. Much of this disagreement rests upon empirical considerations. One side believes the right essential to protect the lives of those attacked in the home; the other side believes it essential to regulate the right in order to protect the lives of others attacked with guns. It seems unlikely that definitive evidence will develop one way or the other. And the appropriate level of firearm regulation has thus long been, and continues to be, a hotly contested matter of political debate. See, <em>e.g., </em>Siegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitutionalism in <em>Heller, </em>122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 201-245 (2008). (Numerous sources supporting arguments and data in Part II-B can be found in the Appendix, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">[561 U.S. 921]</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-9\">Moreover, there is no reason here to believe that incorporation of the private self-defense right will further any other or broader constitutional objective. We are aware of no argument that gun-control regulations target or are passed with the purpose of targeting \u201cdiscrete and insular minorities.\u201d <em>Carolene Products Co., supra, </em>at 153, n. 4, 58 S. Ct. 778, 82 L. Ed. 1234; see, <em>e.g., ante, </em>at 904-905, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 999-1000 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Nor will incorporation help to ensure equal respect for individuals. Unlike the First Amendment\u2019s rights of free speech, free press, assembly, and petition, the private self-defense right does not constitute a necessary part of the democratic process that the Constitution seeks to establish. See, <em>e.g., Whitney </em>v. <em>California, </em>274 U.S. 357, 377, 47 S. Ct. 641, 71 L. Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). Unlike the First Amendment\u2019s religious protections, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments\u2019 insistence upon fair criminal procedure, and the Eighth Amendment\u2019s protection against cruel and unusual punishments, the private self-defense right does not significantly seek to protect individuals who might otherwise suffer unfair or inhu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>mane treatment at the hands of a majority. Unlike the protections offered by many of these same Amendments, it does not involve matters as to which judges possess a comparative expertise, by virtue of their close familiarity with the justice system and its operation. And, unlike the Fifth Amendment\u2019s insistence on just compensation, it does not involve a matter where a majority might unfairly seize for itself property belonging to a minority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">Finally, incorporation of the right <em>will </em>work a significant disruption in the constitutional allocation of deci-sionmaking authority, thereby interfering with the Constitution\u2019s ability to further its objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\"><em>First, </em>on any reasonable accounting, the incorporation of the right recognized in <em>Heller </em>would amount to a significant incursion on a traditional and important area of state concern, altering the constitutional relationship between the</p>\n<p id=\"atc-dedup-1\">[561 U.S. 922]</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">States and the Federal Government. Private gun regulation is the quintessential exercise of a State\u2019s \u201cpolice <em>power\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>the power to \u201cprotec[t] . . . the lives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protection of all property within the State,\u201d by enacting \u201call kinds of restraints and burdens\u201d on both \u201cpersons and property.\u201d <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>16 Wall. 36, 62, 21 L. Ed. 394 (1873) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has long recognized that the Constitution grants the States special authority to enact laws pursuant to this power. See, <em>e.g., Medtronic, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 475, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L. Ed. 2d 700 (1996) (noting that States have \u201cgreat latitude\u201d to use their police powers (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>471 U.S. 724, 756, 105 S. Ct. 2380, 85 L. Ed. 2d 728 (1985). A decade ago, we wrote that there is \u201cno better example of the police power\u201d than \u201cthe suppression of violent crime.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 618, 120 S. Ct. 1740, 146 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2000). And examples in which the Court has deferred to state legislative judgments in respect to the exercise of the police power are legion. See, <em>e.g., Gonzales </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>546 U.S. 243, 270, 126 S. Ct. 904, 163 L. Ed. 2d 748 (2006) (assisted suicide); <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S. 702, 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1997) (same); <em>Berman </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>348 U.S. 26, 32, 75 S. Ct. 98, 99 L. Ed. 27 (1954) (\u201cWe deal, in other words, with what traditionally has been known as the police power. An attempt to define its reach or trace its outer limits is fruitless . . . \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\"><em>Second, </em>determining the constitutionality of a particular state gun law requires finding answers to complex empirically based questions of a kind that legislatures are better able than courts to make. See, <em>e.g., Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Alameda Books, Inc., </em>535 U.S. 425, 440, 122 S. Ct. 1728, 152 L.

And it may require this kind of analysis in virtually every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">Government regulation of the right to bear arms normally embodies a judgment that the regulation will help save lives.

Ct. 2095, 95 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1987). With respect to other incorporated rights, this sort of inquiry is <em>sometimes </em>present. See, <em>e.g., Brandenburg </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S. Ct. 1827, 23 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1969) <em>(per curiam) </em>(free speech); <em>Sherbert </em>v. <em>Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 403, 83 S. Ct. 1790, 10 L.

Ct. 2095, 95 L. Ed. 2d 697 (bail). But here, this inquiry\u2014calling for the fine tuning of protective rules\u2014is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to answer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind. Suppose, for example, that after a gun regulation\u2019s adoption the murder rate went up. Without the gun regulation would the murder rate have risen even faster? How is this conclusion affected by the local recession which has left numerous people unemployed? What about budget cuts that led to a downsizing of the police force? How effective was that police force to begin with? And did the regulation simply take guns from those who use them for lawful purposes without affecting their possession by criminals?</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Consider too that countless gun regulations of many shapes and sizes are in place in every State and in many local communities. Does the right to possess weapons for self-defense extend outside the home? To the car? To work? What sort of guns are necessary for self-defense? Handguns? Rifles? Semiautomatic weapons? When is a gun semiautomatic? Where are different kinds of weapons likely needed? Does time of day matter? Does the presence of a child in the house matter? Does the presence of a convicted felon in the house matter? Do police need special rules permitting patdowns designed to find guns? When do registration requirements become severe to the point that they amount to an unconstitutional ban? Who can possess guns and of what kind? Aliens? Prior drug offenders?</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">[561 U.S. 924]</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">Prior alcohol abusers? How would the right interact with a state or local government\u2019s ability to take special measures during, say, national security emergencies? As the questions suggest, state and local gun regulation can become highly complex, and these \u201care only a few uncertainties that quickly come to mind.\u201d <em>Caperton </em>v. <em>A. T. Massey Coal Co., </em>556 U.S. 868, 898, 129 S. Ct. 2252, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1208 (2009) (Roberts, C. J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">The difficulty of finding answers to these questions is exceeded only by the importance of doing so. Firearms cause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United States each year. Those who live in urban areas, police officers, women, and children, all may be particularly at risk. And gun regulation may save their lives. Some experts have calculated, for example, that Chicago\u2019s handgun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to 1,000, since it was enacted in 1983. Other experts argue that stringent gun regulations \u201ccan help protect police officers operating on the front lines against gun violence,\u201d have reduced homicide rates in Washington, D. C., and Baltimore, and have helped to lower New York\u2019s crime and homicide rates. Brief for Association of Prosecuting Attorneys et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>13-16, 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>At the same time, the opponents of regulation cast doubt on these studies. And who is right? Finding out may require interpreting studies that are only indirectly related to a particular regulatory statute, say, one banning handguns in the home. Suppose studies find more accidents and suicides where there is a handgun in the home than where there is a long gun in the home or no gun at all? To what extent do such studies justify a ban? What if opponents of the ban put forth counterstudies?</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">In answering such questions judges cannot simply refer to judicial homilies, such as Blackstone\u2019s 18th-century perception that a man\u2019s home is his castle. See 4 Blackstone 223. Nor can the plurality so simply reject, by mere assertion, the fact that \u201cincorporation will require judges to assess the</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">[561 U.S. 925]</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">costs and benefits of firearms restrictions.\u201d Ante, at 790-791, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 929. How can the Court assess the strength of the government\u2019s regulatory interests without addressing issues of empirical fact? How can the Court determine if a regulation is appropriately tailored without considering its impact? And how can the Court determine if there are less restrictive alternatives without considering what will happen if those alternatives are implemented?</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Perhaps the Court could lessen the difficulty of the mission it has created for itself by adopting a jurisprudential approach similar to the many state courts that administer a state constitutional right to bear arms. See <em>infra, </em>at 930, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1015 (describing state approaches). But the Court has not yet done so. Cf. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 634-635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (rejecting an \u201c \u2018interest-balancing\u2019 approach\u201d similar to that employed by the States); <em>ante, </em>at 790-791, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 929 (plurality opinion). Rather, the Court has haphazardly created a few simple rules, such as that it will not touch \u201cprohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\u201d \u201claws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings,\u201d or \u201claws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\u201d <em>Heller, supra, </em>at 626-627, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 2817, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; <em>ante, </em>at 786, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 926 (plurality opinion). But why these rules and not others? Does the Court know that these regulations are justified by some special gun-related risk of death? In fact, the Court does not know. It has simply invented rules that sound sensible without being able to explain why or how Chicago\u2019s handgun ban is different.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">The fact is that judges do not know the answers to the kinds of empirically based questions that will often determine the need for particular forms of gun regulation. Nor do they have readily available \u201ctools\u201d for finding and evaluating the technical material submitted by others. <em>District Attorney\u2019s Office for Third Judicial Dist. </em>v. <em>Osborne, </em>557 U.S. 52, 74, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (2009); see also <em>Turner Broadcasting, </em>520 U.S., at 195-196, 117 S. Ct. 1174, 137 L. Ed. 2d 369. Judges cannot easily make empirically based predictions;</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">[561 U.S. 926]</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">they have no way to gather and evaluate the data required to see if such predictions are accurate; and the nature of litigation and concerns about <em>stare decisis </em>further make it difficult forjudges to change course if predictions prove inaccurate. Nor can judges rely upon local community views and values when reaching judgments in circumstances where predic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>tion is difficult because the basic facts are unclear or unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-3\">At the same time, there is no institutional need to send judges off on this \u201cmission-almost-impossible.\u201d Legislators are able to \u201camass the stuff of actual experience and cull conclusions from it.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gainey, </em>380 U.S. 63, 67, 85 S. Ct. 754, 13 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1965). They are far better suited than judges to uncover facts and to understand their relevance. And legislators, unlike Article III judges, can be held democratically responsible for their empirically based and value-laden conclusions. We have thus repeatedly affirmed our preference for \u201clegislative not judicial solutions\u201d to this kind of problem, see, e.g., <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Board of Regents of Fla., </em>457 U.S. 496, 513, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982), just as we have repeatedly affirmed the Constitution\u2019s preference for democratic solutions legislated by those whom the people elect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">In <em>New State Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Liebmann, </em>285 U.S. 262, 310-311, 52 S. Ct. 371, 76 L. Ed. 747 (1932), Justice Brandeis stated in dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-5\">\u201cSome people assert that our present plight is due, in part, to the limitations set by courts upon experimentation in the fields of social and economic science; and to the discouragement to which proposals for betterment there have been subjected otherwise. There must be power in the States and the Nation to remould, through experimentation, our economic practices and institutions to meet changing social and economic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct [the social problems we face].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_eR\">[561 U.S. 927]</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">There are 50 state legislatures. The fact that this Court may already have refused to take this wise advice with respect to Congress in <em>Heller </em>is no reason to make matters worse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\"><em>Third, </em>the ability of States to reflect local preferences and conditions\u2014 both key virtues of federalism\u2014here has particular importance. The incidence of gun ownership varies substantially as between crowded cities and uncongested rural communities, as well as among the different geographic regions of the country. Thus, approximately 60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated Western States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report that their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of adults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural communities and cities. Urban centers face significantly greater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural communities have proportionately greater problems with nonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents. And idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities finding themselves in dramatically different circumstances: For example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times higher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">It is thus unsurprising that States and local communities have historically differed about the need for gun regulation as well as about its proper level. Nor is it surprising that \u201cprimarily, and historically,\u201d the law has treated the exercise of police powers, including gun control, as \u201cmatter[s] of local <em>concern.\u201d Medtronic, </em>518 U.S., at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>475, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 135 L. Ed. 2d 700 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\"><em>Fourth, </em>although incorporation of any right removes decisions from the democratic process, the incorporation of this particular right does so without strong offsetting justification\u2014as the example of Oak Park\u2019s handgun ban helps to show. See Oak Park, Ill., Village Code \u00a7 27-2-1 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">[561 U.S. 928]</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Oak Park decided to ban handguns in 1983, after a local attorney was shot to death with a handgun that his assailant had smuggled into a courtroom in a blanket. Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>1, 21. A citizens committee spent months gathering information about handguns. <em>Id., </em>at 21. It secured 6,000 signatures from community residents in support of a ban. <em>Id., </em>at 21-22. And the village board enacted a ban into law. <em>Id., </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">Subsequently, at the urging of ban opponents the board held a community referendum on the matter. <em>Ibid. </em>The citizens committee argued strongly in favor of the ban. <em>Id., </em>at 22-23. It pointed out that most guns owned in Oak Park were handguns and that handguns were misused more often than citizens used them in self-defense. <em>Id., </em>at 23. The ban opponents argued just as strongly to the contrary. <em>Ibid. </em>The public decided to keep the ban by a vote of 8,031 to 6,368. <em>Ibid. </em>And since that time, Oak Park now tells us, crime has decreased and the community has seen no accidental handgun deaths. <em>Id., </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">Given the empirical and local value-laden nature of the questions that lie at the heart of the issue, why, in a Nation whose Constitution foresees democratic decisionmaking, is it so <em>fundamental </em>a matter as to require taking that power from the people? What is it here that the people did not know? What is it that a judge knows better?</p>\n<p id=\"pAXA4\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"36\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQ0AAAAjAQAAAACmuGJXAAAAlElEQVR4nOXTPQrCQBDF8f8OqSUHEvRmehgPYeFlTJE6diuKzzJPZiFNEMTtfo8ZZj/YIhbWPZYq4AdLPs6dEcDraGnGOntB0vameSXUAA3ekRFQpmlOGwjgPFpnA5LqzsYn1AC6vTVmBDB6mhHAqbO0AUmbq41PqAHqe7uKBiRdHtaYUJH0PFiaUNd56fKvX+0rJW/iNcQ17/WiCwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==\" width=\"269\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-11\">In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative decision-making, the need for local decision-making, the comparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking, the lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life-threatening harm that may flow from striking down regulations ah argue against incorporation. Where the incorporation of other rights has been at issue, <em>some </em>of these problems have arisen. But in this instance <em>all </em>these problems are present, <em>all </em>at</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">[561 U.S. 929]</p>\n<p id=\"ADo-\">the same time, and <em>all </em>are likely to be present in most, perhaps nearly ah, of the cases in which the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue. At the same time, the important factors that favor incorporation in other <em>instances\u2014e.g., </em>the protection of broader constitutional objectives\u2014are not present here. The upshot is that ah factors militate against incorporation\u2014with the possible exception of historical factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-14\">I must, then, return to history. The Court, in seeking to justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the Second Amendment protects are \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 767, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 914 (quoting <em>Glucksberg, </em>521 U.S., at 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772). It looks to selected portions of the Nation\u2019s history for the answer. And it finds an affirmative reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only pertinent consideration. Nor would I read history as broadly as the majority does. In particular, since we here are evaluating a more particular right\u2014 namely, the right to bear arms for purposes of private self-defense\u2014general historical references to the \u201cright to keep and bear arms\u201d are not always helpful. Depending upon context, early historical sources may mean to refer to a militia-based right\u2014a matter of considerable importance 200 years ago\u2014which has, as the majority points out, \u201clargely faded as a popular concern.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 770, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 916. There is no reason to believe that matters of such little contemporary importance should play a significant role in answering the incorporation question. See <em>Apodaca, </em>406 U.S., at 410, 92 S. Ct. 1628, 32 L. Ed. 2d 184 (plurality opinion) (incorporation \u201cinquiry must focus upon the function served\u201d by the right in question in \u201ccontemporary society\u201d); <em>Wolf v. Colorado, </em>338 U.S. 25, 27, 69 S. Ct. 1359, 93 L. Ed. 1782 (1949) (incorporation must take into account \u201cthe movements of a free society\u201d and \u201cthe gradual and empiric process of inclusion and exclusion\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 9 (prohibiting</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\">[561 U.S. 930]</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">federal officeholders from accepting a \u201cTitle, of any kind whatever, from [a] foreign State\u201d\u2014presumably a matter of considerable importance 200 years ago).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">That said, I can find much in the historical record that shows that some Americans in some places at certain times thought it important to keep and bear arms for private self-defense. For instance, the reader will see that many States have constitutional provisions protecting gun possession. But, as far as I can tell, those provisions typically do no more than guarantee that a gun regulation will be a <em>reasonable </em>police power regulation. See Winkler, Scrutinizing the Second Amendment, 105 Mich. L. Rev. 683, 686, 716-717 (2007) (hereinafter Winkler, Scrutinizing) (the \u201ccourts of every state to consider the question apply a deferential \u2018reasonable regulation\u2019 standard\u201d); see also <em>id., </em>at 716-717 (explaining the difference between that standard and ordinary rational-basis review). It is thus altogether unclear whether such provisions would prohibit cities such as Chicago from enacting laws, such as the law before us, banning handguns. See <em>id., </em>at 723. The majority, however, would incorporate a right that is likely <em>inconsistent </em>with Chicago\u2019s law; and the majority would almost certainly <em>strike down </em>that law. Cf. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S., at 628-635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (striking down the District of Columbia\u2019s handgun ban).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">Thus, the specific question before us is not whether there are references to the right to bear arms for self-defense throughout this Nation\u2019s history\u2014of course there are\u2014or even whether the Court should incorporate a simple constitutional requirement that firearms regulations not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear arms, but rather whether there is a consensus that <em>so substantial </em>a private self-defense right as the one described in <em>Heller </em>applies to the States. See, <em>e.g., Glucksberg, supra, </em>at 721, 117 S. Ct. 2258, 138 L. Ed. 2d 772 (requiring \u201ca careful description\u201d of the right at issue when deciding whether it is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). On this question,</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">[561 U.S. 931]</p>\n<p id=\"AqZj\">the reader will have to make up his or her own mind about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>the historical record that I describe in part below. In my view, that record is insufficient to say that the right to bear arms for private self-defense, as explicated by <em>Heller, </em>is fundamental in the sense relevant to the incorporation inquiry. As the evidence below shows, States and localities have consistently enacted firearms regulations, including regulations similar to those at issue here, throughout our Nation\u2019s history. Courts have repeatedly upheld such regulations. And it is, at the very least, possible, and perhaps likely, that incorporation will impose on every, or nearly every, State a different right to bear arms than they currently recognize\u2014a right that threatens to destabilize settled state legal principles. Cf. 554 U.S., at 634-635, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (rejecting an \u201c \u2018interest-balancing\u2019 approach\u201d similar to that employed by the States).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">I thus cannot find a historical consensus with respect to whether the right described by <em>Heller </em>is \u201cfundamental\u201d as our incorporation cases use that term. Nor can I find sufficient historical support for the majority\u2019s conclusion that that right is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d Instead, I find no more than ambiguity and uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians would find difficult to penetrate. And a historical record that is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate basis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and applying it against the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">\n<em>The 18th Century</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">The opinions in <em>Heller </em>collect much of the relevant 18th-century evidence. See 554 U.S., at 579-605, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637; <em>id., </em>at 640-665, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>id., </em>at 683-687, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In respect to the relevant question\u2014the \u201cdeeply rooted nature\u201d of a right to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self-defense\u2014that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when augmented as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">[561 U.S. 932]</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\"><em>First, </em>as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and Justice Stevens argued in dissent, the history discussed in <em>Heller </em>shows that the Second Amendment was enacted primarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related rights. See <em>supra, </em>at 915-916, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1006; <em>Heller, supra, </em>at 579-605, 128 S. Ct. 2783, 171 L. Ed. 2d 637. Many of the scholars and historians who have written on the subject apparently agree. See <em>supra, </em>at 914-916, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1004-1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-10\"><em>Second, </em>historians now tell us that the right to which Blackstone referred, an important link in the <em>Heller </em>majority\u2019s historical argument, concerned the right of Parliament (representing the people) to form a militia to oppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the people of their traditional liberties (which did not include an unregulated right to possess guns). Thus, 18th-century language referring to a \u201cright to keep and bear arms\u201d does not <em>ipso facto </em>refer to a private right of self-defense\u2014certainly not unambiguously so. See English Historians\u2019 Brief 3-27; see also <em>supra, </em>at 914-916, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 1004-1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-11\"><em>Third, </em>scholarly articles indicate that firearms were heavily regulated at the time of the framing\u2014perhaps more heavily regulated than the Court in <em>Heller </em>believed. For example, one scholar writes that \u201c[h]undreds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>individual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns in colonial and early national America.\u201d Churchill, Gun Regulation, the Police Power, and the Right To Keep Arms, 25 Law &amp; Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007). Among these statutes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston, as well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct in Philadelphia and New York.

Scholars have thus concluded that the primary Revolutionary-era limitation on a State\u2019s police power to regulate guns appears to be only that regulations were \u201caimed at a legitimate public purpose\u201d and \u201cconsistent with reason.\u201d Cornell, Early American Gun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &amp; Hist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">\n<em>The Pre-Civil War 19th Century</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">I would also augment the majority\u2019s account of this period as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\"><em>First, </em>additional States began to regulate the discharge of firearms in public places. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 17, 1831, \u00a7 6, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern Territory 1740 (S. Chase ed. 1835); Act of Dec. 3, 1825, 1825 Tenn. Priv. Acts ch. 292, pp. 306-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\"><em>Second, </em>States began to regulate the possession of concealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous. See, <em>e.g., </em>C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early Republic 143-152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also 1837-1838 Tenn. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200-201 (banning the wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va. Acts ch. 7, \u00a7 8, p. 110 (\u201cAny free person who shall habitually carry about his person, hidden from common observation, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, or weapon of the like kind, from the use of which the death of any person might probably ensue, shall for every offence be punished by [a] fine not exceeding fifty dollars\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws, finding that, even when the state constitution granted a right to bear arms, the legislature was permitted to, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cabolish\u201d these small, inexpensive, \u201cmost dangerous weapons entirely from use,\u201d even in self-defense. <em>Day </em>v. <em>State, </em>37 Tenn. 496, 500 (1858); see also, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Jumel, </em>13 La. Ann. 399, 400 (1858) (upholding concealed weapon ban because it \u201cprohibit[ed]</p>\n<p id=\"ahc-dedup-0\">[561 U.S. 934]</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-13\">only <em>a particular mode </em>of bearing arms which is found dangerous to the peace of society\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>5 La. Ann. 489, 489-490 (1850) (upholding concealed weapon ban and describing the law as \u201cabsolutely necessary to counteract a vicious state of society, growing out of the habit of carrying concealed weapons\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>1 Ala. 612, 616-617 (1840).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>\n<em>The Post-Civil War 19th Century</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">It is important to read the majority\u2019s account with the following considerations in mind:</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\"><em>First, </em>the plurality today properly declines to revisit our interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. See <em>ante, </em>at 758, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 908. The Court\u2019s case for incorporation must thus rest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is \u201cfundamental.\u201d But the very evidence that it advances in support of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Americans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows with equal force that Americans wanted African-American citizens to have the <em>same </em>rights to possess guns as did white citizens. <em>Ante, </em>at 770-778, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 916-921. Here, for example, is what Congress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Second Freedmen\u2019s Bureau Act. It wrote that the statute, in order to secure \u201cthe constitutional right to bear arms ... for all citizens,\u201d would ensure that each citizen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1064-6\">\u201cshall have ... <em>full and equal benefit </em>of all laws and proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal, including the constitutional right to bear arms, [by securing] ... to ... all the citizens of [every] . . . State or district without <em>respect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.\u201d </em>\u00a7 14, 14 Stat. 176-177 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">This sounds like an <em>antidiscrimination </em>provision. See Rosenthal, The New Originalism Meets the Fourteenth Amendment:</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">[561 U.S. 935]</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-9\">Original Public Meaning and the Problem of Incorporation, 18 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 361, 383-384 (2009) (discussing evidence that the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau was focused on discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-11\">Another Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, also took aim at <em>discrimination. </em>See \u00a7 1, 14 Stat. 27 (citizens of \u201cevery race and color, without regard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude . . . shall have the same right [to engage in various activities] and to full and equal benefit of all laws ... as is enjoyed by white citizens\u201d). And, of course, the Fourteenth Amendment itself insists that all States guarantee their citizens the \u201cequal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-13\">There is thus every reason to believe that the <em>fundamental </em>concern of the Reconstruction Congress was the eradication of discrimination, not the provision of a new substantive right to bear arms free from reasonable state police power regulation. See, <em>e.g., </em>Brief for Municipal Respondents 62-69 (discussing congressional record evidence that Reconstruction Congress was concerned about discrimination). Indeed, why would those who wrote the Fourteenth Amendment have wanted to give such a right to Southerners who had so recently waged war against the North, and who continued to disarm and oppress recently freed African-American citizens? Cf. Act of Mar. 2, 1867, \u00a7 6, 14 Stat. 487 (disbanding Southern militias because they were, <em>inter alia, </em>disarming the freedmen).</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-15\"><em>Second, </em>firearms regulation in the later part of the 19th century was common. The majority is correct that the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau points to a right to bear arms, and it stands to reason, as the majority points out, that \u201c [i]t would have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee the . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>equal benefit of a . . . right that does not exist <em>.\u2019\u2019 Ante, </em>at 779, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 921. But the majority points to no evidence that there existed during this period a fundamental right to bear arms for private self-defense immune to the reasonable exercise of the</p>\n<p id=\"ASOk\">[561 U.S. 936]</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">state police power. See Emberton, The Limits of Incorporation: Violence, Gun Rights, and Gun Regulation in the Reconstruction South, 17 Stan. L. &amp; Pol\u2019y Rev. 615, 621-622 (2006) (noting that history shows that \u201cnineteenth-century Americans\u201d were \u201cnot opposed to the idea that the state should be able to control the use of firearms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">To the contrary, in the latter half of the 19th century, a number of state constitutions adopted or amended after the Civil War explicitly recognized the legislature\u2019s general ability to limit the right to bear arms. See Tex. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 13 (1869) (protecting \u201cthe right to keep and bear arms,\u201d \u201cunder such regulations as the legislature may prescribe\u201d); Idaho Const., Art. I, \u00a7 11 (1889) (\u201cThe people shall have the right to bear arms . . . ; but the Legislature shall regulate the exercise of this right by law\u201d); Utah Const., Art. I, \u00a7 6 (1896) (same). And numerous other state constitutional provisions adopted during this period explicitly granted the legislature various types of regulatory power over firearms. See Brief for Thirty-Four Professional Historians and Legal Historians as <em>Amici Curiae </em>14-15 (hereinafter Legal Historians\u2019 Brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">Moreover, four States largely banned the possession of all nonmilitary handguns during this period. See 1879 Tenn. Acts ch. 186, \u00a7 1 (prohibiting citizens from carrying \u201cpublicly or privately, any . . . belt or pocket pistol, revolver, or any kind of pistol, except the army or navy pistol, usually used in warfare, which shall be carried openly in the hand\u201d); 1876 Wyo. Comp. Laws ch. 52, \u00a7 1 (forbidding \u201cconcealed or ope[n]\u201d bearing of \u201cany fire arm or other deadly weapon, within the limits of any city, town or village\u201d); 1881 Ark. Acts no. 96, \u00a7 1 (prohibiting the \u201cwearing] or carry-ting]\u201d of \u201cany pistol . . . except such pistols as are used in the army or navy,\u201d except while traveling or at home); 1871 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 34 (prohibiting the carrying of pistols unless there are \u201cimmediate and pressing\u201d reasonable grounds to fear \u201cimmediate and pressing\u201d attack or for militia service). Fifteen States</p>\n<p id=\"AcY9\">[561 U.S. 937]</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-9\">banned the concealed carrying of pistols and other deadly weapons. See Legal Historians\u2019 Brief 16, n. 14. And individual municipalities enacted stringent gun controls, often in response to local conditions\u2014Dodge City, Kansas, for example, joined many western cattle towns in banning the carrying of pistols and other dangerous weapons in response to violence accompanying western cattle drives. See Brief for Municipal Respondents 30 (citing Dodge City, Kan., Ordinance No. 16, \u00a7 XI (Sept. 22, 1876)); Courtwright, The Cowboy Subculture, in Guns in America: A Reader 86, 96 (J. Dizard, R. Muth, <em>&amp; </em>S. Andrews eds. 1999) (discussing how Western cattle towns required cowboys to \u201c \u2018check\u2019 \u201d their guns upon entering town).</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-10\">Further, much as they had during the period before the Civil War, state courts routinely upheld such restrictions. See, <em>e.g., English </em>v. <em>State, </em>35 Tex. 473 (1871); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>State, </em>53 Ga. 472, 475 (1874); <em>Fife </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Ark. 455, 461 (1876); <em>State </em>v. <em>Workman, </em>35 W. Va. 367, 373, 14 S.E. 9, 11 (1891). The Tennessee Supreme Court, in upholding a ban on possession of nonmilitary handguns and certain other weapons, summa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>rized the Reconstruction understanding of the States\u2019 police power to regulate firearms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-4\">\u201cAdmitting the right of self-defense in its broadest sense, still on sound principle every good citizen is bound to yield his preference as to the means to be used, to the demands of the public good; <em>and where certain weapons are forbidden to be kept or used, by the law of the land, </em>in order to the prevention of <em>[sic] </em>crime\u2014a great public <em>end\u2014no man can be permitted to disregard, this general end, and demand of the community the right, in order to gratify his whim or willful desire to use a particular weapon in his particular self-defense. </em>The law allows ample means of self-defense, without the use of the weapons which we have held may be rightfully proscribed by this statute. The object being to banish these weapons from the community by an absolute prohibition</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-5\">[561 U.S. 938]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-6\">for the prevention of crime, no man\u2019s particular safety, if such case could exist, ought to be allowed to defeat this end.\u201d <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>State, </em>50 Tenn. 165, 188-189 (1871) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-7\">\n<em>The 20th and 21st Centuries</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-8\">Although the majority does not discuss 20th- or 21st-century evidence concerning the Second Amendment at any length, I think that it is essential to consider the recent history of the right to bear arms for private self-defense when considering whether the right is \u201cfundamental.\u201d To that end, many States now provide state constitutional protection for an individual\u2019s right to keep and bear arms. See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights To Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. &amp; Politics 191, 205 (2006) (identifying over 40 States). In determining the importance of this fact, we should keep the following considerations in mind:</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-10\"><em>First, </em>by the end of the 20th century, in every State and many local communities, highly detailed and complicated regulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern) nearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell guns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns and what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms must be stored and where they may be used; and so on. See generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regulating Guns in America (2008), online at http://www. lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_ guns.asp (all Internet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\u2019s case file) (detailing various arms regulations in every State).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-11\">Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban handguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the right to bear arms. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code \u00a7 8-20-050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Village Code \u00a7\u00a7 27-2-1 (2007), 27-1-1 (2009); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25 (2010). Moreover, at least seven States and Puerto Rico ban</p>\n<p id=\"Aqjk\">[561 U.S. 939]</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-12\">assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons. See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12280(b) (2009 West Supp.); Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 53-202c (2007); Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 134-8 (1993); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 4-303(a) (Lexis 2002); Mass. Gen.

Ann. \u00a7 456m (Supp. 2006); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(o) (federal machinegun ban).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>Thirteen municipalities do the same. See Albany, N. Y., City Code \u00a7 193-16(A) (2005); Aurora, Ill., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 29-49(a) (2010); Buffalo, N.

And two States, Maryland and Hawaii, ban assault pistols. See Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 134-8; Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. \u00a7 4-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\"><em>Second, </em>as I stated earlier, state courts in States with constitutions that provide gun rights have almost uniformly interpreted those rights as providing protection only against <em>unreasonable </em>regulation of guns. See, <em>e.g., </em>Winkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the \u201ccourts of every state to consider\u201d a gun regulation apply the \u201c \u2018reasonable regulation\u2019 \u201d approach); <em>State </em>v. <em>McAdams, </em>714 P.2d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986); <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>City and County of Denver, </em>874 P.2d 325, 328 (Colo. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">When determining reasonableness those courts have normally adopted a highly deferential attitude toward legislative determinations. See Win-kler, Scrutinizing 723 (identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the article\u2019s publication striking down gun-control laws: three that banned \u201cthe transportation of any firearms for any purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">[561 U.S. 940]</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">whatsoever,\u201d a single \u201cpermitting law,\u201d and two as-applied challenges in \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d). Hence, as evidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States and local governments maintain substantial flexibility to regulate firearms\u2014much as they seemingly have throughout the Nation\u2019s history\u2014even in those States with an arms right in their constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">Although one scholar implies that state courts are less willing to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Implementing the Right To Keep and Bear Arms for Self-Defense: An Analytical Framework and a Research Agenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware of no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court has struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a particular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-10\">Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitutional (under their state constitutions) firearms regulations that have included handgun bans. See <em>Kalodimos </em>v. <em>Morton Grove, </em>103 Ill. 2d 483, 499-500, 470 N.E.2d 266, 273 (1984) (upholding a handgun ban because the arms right is merely a right \u201cto possess some form of weapon suitable for self-defense or recreation\u201d); <em>Cleveland </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>1977 WL 201393, *5 (Ohio App., Aug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban \u201cdoes not absolutely interfere with the right of the people to bear arms, but rather proscribes possession of a specifically defined category of handguns\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bolin </em>378 S. C. 96, 99, 662 S.E.2d 38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons under 21 did not infringe arms right because they can \u201cposses [s] other types of guns\u201d). Thus, the majority\u2019s decision to incorporate the private self-defense right recognized in <em>Heller </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>threatens to alter state regulatory regimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\"><em>Third, </em>the plurality correctly points out that <em>only a few </em>state courts, a \u201cpaucity\u201d of state courts, have specifically upheld handgun bans. <em>Ante, </em>at 786, 177 L. Ed. 2d, at 926. But which state courts have struck them down? The absence of supporting information</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">[561 U.S. 941]</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">does not help the majority find support. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>519 U.S. 482, 496, 117 S. Ct. 921, 137 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1997) (noting that it is \u201ctreacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Silence does not show or tend to show a consensus that a private self-defense right (strong enough to strike down a handgun ban) is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pAC_1\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"44\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAPsAAAArAQAAAACWN8MkAAAArklEQVR4nO3TIQ7CQBAF0N9JLQEPogdB9AAcBosCFCg8t6lAYLjDNMEDIQESYD9yZ0eUChTpuDf7dzMjNiMaq5bmc6ALtA8E65eHAE/bu3n8YgYuj5Fv2TsIws6OtfYQiGrs5VXlkBEbmcbmKNcENcjznLGUKRTkw/YuDirAYWEG28KD7K3inTDsp9AcHIzjnVBMHAShKMzqZelBzu7m1espRastmutrIOs+7x8FPhfAwPl3ZnQtAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"251\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the right is, or was, \u201cfundamental.\u201d No broader constitutional interest or principle supports legal treatment of that right as fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional concerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against that treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century history shows a consensus that the right to private armed self-defense, as described in <em>Heller, </em>is \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history [or] tradition\u201d or is otherwise \u201cfundamental.\u201d Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in <em>Heller </em>may change the law in many of the 50 States. Read in the majority\u2019s favor, the historical evidence is at most ambiguous. And, in the absence of any other support for its conclusion, ambiguous history cannot show that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates a private right of self-defense against the States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-10\">With respect, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-12\">Sources Supporting Data in Part II-B</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-14\">\n<em>Popular Consensus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-15\">Please see the following sources to support the paragraph on popular opinion, <em>supra, </em>at 920, 177 L.
