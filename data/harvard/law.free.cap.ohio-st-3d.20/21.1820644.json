This argument is irrelevant in view of the fact that relator claims to have modified her residency status and has submitted a new registration form.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Respondents make no challenge to the facts which relator alleges now support her residency on Kelleys Island. Thus, for purposes of this action, they must be accepted as true. There is nothing which prohibits relator from removing the disability formerly found by the board of elections and re-registering.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">Respondents, having failed to assert any challenge to relator\u2019s new registration, are under a clear legal duty to register her as an elector in the Kelleys Island precinct of Erie County in the November 5, 1985 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">Accordingly, the writ as prayed for is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-14\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes and C.
