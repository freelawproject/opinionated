Appellants contend that two factors in that formula, \u201cdegree of need\u201d for improvement and \u201cdegree of problem correction,\u201d violate the applicable statutory and constitutional requirements for ditch assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">This court stated in <em>In re Appeal in the Joint Cty. Ditch No. 1 </em>(1930), 122 Ohio St. 226, 236, that an assessment disproportionate to the benefit received was in effect an unconstitutional taking of private property. R.C. 6131.15 states, in pertinent part, that \u201c* * * [t]he county engineer, in making his estimate of the amount to be assessed * * * shall levy the assessments according to benefits. Each tract of land * * * affected by an improvement * * * shall be assessed in the proportion that each is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>benefited by the improvement, as \u2018benefit\u2019 and \u2018improvement\u2019 are defined in section 6131.01 of the Revised Code, and not otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">R.C. 6131.01(F) defines \u201cbenefits\u201d as advantages to land and owners and provides that \u201c* * * [f]actors relevant to whether such advantages result include:</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u201c(1) The watershed or entire land area drained or affected by the improvement;</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u201c(2) The total volume of water draining into or through the improvement and the amount of water contributed by each land owner;</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u201c(3) The use to be made of the improvement by any owner * *</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">This subsection further provides that \u201cbenefits\u201d may include any or all of the following: Elimination or reduction of flood damage; removal of water conditions that jeopardize public health and safety; increased value of land as a result of the improvement; use of water for irrigation or soil conservation; and providing an outlet for accelerated runoff.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">We find that the formula used in calculating appellants\u2019 assessments accurately determined the assessments in proportion to the benefits accruing to appellants\u2019 lands. The evidence adduced at the trial <em>de novo </em>clearly showed that the portion of the ditch upon appellants\u2019 lands was most in need of drainage and required the highest degree of correction. Appellants\u2019 portion of the ditch was almost completely closed and had been plowed and cultivated. Their lands had the most extensive flooding and soil erosion after a rain. Although the \u201cdegree of need\u201d and \u201cdegree of problem correction\u201d elements of the formula are not <em>per se </em>enumerated by R.C. 6131.01(F), these elements are consistent with the statutory factors relevant to whether advantages result from improvements. Such resulting improvements reduce flood damage and increase the value of appellants\u2019 lands, both \u201cbenefits\u201d as defined by statute. These elements are further consistent in view of R.C. 6131.15, which states that in estimating an assessment, the county engineer shall give primary consideration to the potential increase in productivity of the land which may result from the improvement. It is obvious that the improvement of this ditch will result in the increased productivity of appellants\u2019 lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-10\">We therefore conclude that the use of the \u201cPreble County\u201d formula gave a rational and justifiable basis to the calculation of appellants\u2019 ditch assessments, consistent with the applicable controlling sections of the Revised Code, and demonstrated an assessment in which appellants\u2019 greater need was proportionate to their greater benefits from the improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">Appellants also contend that the trial court erred by placing upon them the burden of proving, at the trial <em>de novo, </em>that their assessments were not in proportion to the benefits received. Appellants argue that once they made a prima facie showing that the assessments on their lands were substantially in excess of the other landowners\u2019 assessments, the burden of proof shifted to appellees to rebut this evidence. This contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>is without merit. R.C. 6131.25 provides the mechanism for an appeal of an assessment to the court of common pleas. R.C. 6131.30 explicitly states that on appeal \u201c* * * the burden of proof shall be on the owner having the affirmative of the proposition, who shall have the opening and closing. * * *\u201d Accordingly, the burden was properly upon appellants here throughout the trial <em>de novo </em>to demonstrate the unlawfulness of the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b40-7\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
