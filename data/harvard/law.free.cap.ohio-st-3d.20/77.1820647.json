R. 54(B). An entry of judgment involving fewer than all of the claims or parties is not final unless the court expressly determines that there is \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Because the judgment entry against Mucci did not adjudicate the liabilities of all the parties and it did not contain the Civ. R. 54(B) words of \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d it was subject to modification. Mucci\u2019s motion for relief was improperly labeled a Civ. R. 60(B) motion because it did not seek relief from a final judgment. The motion and the trial court\u2019s order vacating the judgment were instead authorized by Civ. R. 54(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">An order vacating a judgment that was entered against less than all the parties and in which the trial court did not make an express determination that there was \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b102-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Connors and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b102-10\">Connors, J., of the Sixth Appellate District, sitting for C.
