R.C. 503.24, 503.241 and 3503.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">R.C. 3503.02 sets forth the rules for determining residence and provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">\u201c(A) That place shall be considered the residence of a person in which his habitation is fixed and to which, whenever he is absent, he has the intention of returning.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u201c(B) A person shall not be considered to have lost his residence who leaves his home and goes into another state or county of this state, for temporary purposes only, with the intention of returning.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">\u201c(C) A person shall not be considered to have gained a residence in any county of this state into which he comes for temporary purposes only, without the intention of making such county his permanent place of abode. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b26-16\">\u201cOrdinarily a decision of a board of elections is final and will be reviewed by this court only to ascertain whether it is tainted with fraud or corruption or resulted from an abuse of discretion or a clear disregard of the applicable law. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 387; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Brushart </em>[(1950), 153 Ohio St. 372 (41 O.O. 398)] * * *.\u201d <em>State, ex rel.

Evidence that relator rented his Harrison Township property out to tenants, listed it with a realtor for sale, and moved to the Liberty Township address supports the board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Relator has not demonstrated any abuse of discretion on the part of respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Accordingly, the writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b27-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
