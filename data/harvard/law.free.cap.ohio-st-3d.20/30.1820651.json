For the reasons set forth below, we hold that appellants are entitled to the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">The extraordinary legal remedy of mandamus may be granted to compel execution of an. official duty from a ministerial officer when three conditions exist. The relator must show (1) a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, (2) a clear legal duty upon respondent to perform the act re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>quested, and (3) that relator has no plain and adequate remedy at law. <em>Eudela </em>v. <em>Rogers </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 159, 161; <em>State, ex rel. Berger, </em>v. <em>McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 28, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Appellee\u2019s legal duties, and hence appellants\u2019 legal rights, hinge on the interpretation given to R.C. 149.43(B), which states: \u201cAll public records shall be promptly prepared and made available to any member of the general public at all reasonable times for inspection. Upon request, a person responsible for public records shall make copies available at cost, within a reasonable period of time. In order to facilitate broader access to public records, governmental units shall maintain public records in such a manner that they can be made available for inspection in accordance with this division.\u201d The question thus presented is whether the files sought are, in fact, \u201cpublic records,\u201d and whether the appellee is the appropriate \u201cperson responsible\u201d for making them available to the public,</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Information is a public record when it \u201cmust be kept by a governmental unit\u201d and when the information is specifically \u201crequired to be kept by law.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., </em>v. <em>Lesak </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 1, 2, citing <em>State, ex rel. Citizens Bar Assn., </em>v. <em>Gagliardo </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 70 [9 O.O.3d 74], and interpreting R.C. 149.43. Also, in <em>Dayton Newspapers </em>v. <em>Dayton </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 107 [74 O.O.2d 209], the phrase \u201crequired to be kept,\u201d was held to mean \u201cany record which but for its keeping the governmental unit could not carry out its duties and responsibilities; that the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of such record is to assure the proper functioning of the unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">It is difficult to conceive of more necessary records for the disposition of DWI cases than thos\u00e9 requested by appellants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R.C. 4511.191(K)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>speaks in terms of evidence of blood-alcohol level, chemical or blood tests, and prior convictions of the accused committed while under the influence of alcohol. Invariably, the requested documents A-E are offered as evidence on these issues both at trial and on appeal. R.C. 149.40 states that:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u201cAny document, device, or item, regardless of physical form or characteristic, created or received by or coming under the jurisdiction of any public office of the state or its political subdivisions, which serves to document the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office, is a record within the meaning of sections 149.31 to 149.44, inclusive, of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It would seem to be clear that if, as here, the requested documents are received by, are under the jurisdiction of, and are utilized by, the court to render its decision, then their retention assures the proper functioning of the governmental unit and, accordingly, could reasonably be classified as \u201cpublic records\u201d and required to be kept within the meaning of R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">It must now be determined whether the Clerk of the Miami County Municipal Court is the \u201cperson responsible\u201d under R.C. 149.43(B), and the person to whom a writ of mandamus may issue. R.C. 1901.31(E) requires that the clerk \u201cshall file and safely keep all journals, records, books, and papers belonging or appertaining to the court * * *.\u201d Also, R.C. 1901.30(B) places upon the clerk a legal duty to \u201ctransmit the transcript, together with all original papers filed in the case\u201d whenever an appeal is taken from a municipal court. These statutes place the supervision of all documents used by the court in its decision-making capacity upon the clerk. When statutes impose a duty on a particular official to oversee records, that official is the \u201cperson responsible\u201d under R.C. 149.43(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">While courts at all levels are possessed with rule-making authority, such rules must be reasonable and not in \u201cconflict with the organic law, or any valid statute.\u201d <em>Cassidy </em>v. <em>Glossip </em>(1967), 12 Ohio St. 2d 17, 21 [41 O.O.2d 153]. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the municipal court promulgated a local court rule. The court of appeals determined that this local rule empowered the municipal court to avoid filing or keeping the documents at issue with the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">A local rule of court cannot prevail when, as in this case, it is inconsistent with the express requirements of a statute. In the case here, the local rule authorized the clerk to keep two separate files, one public and one private. The public file was expressly limited to \u201cthe complaints, motions, memorandums [sic], entries and verdicts.\u201d The non-public file contained matters including alcohol influence reports, breath test results, arresting officers\u2019 reports, accident reports, and Leads sheets, which we have determined herein to be public records. Consequently, the local rule effectively forbids public access to public records, thereby conflicting with R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>149.43(B). Furthermore, the rul\u00e9 contravenes the requirements of R.C. 1901.31(E) to \u201cfile and safely keep\u201d these records. Therefore, to the extent that the local rule is inconsistent with the above statutes, it is hereby invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Having invalidated the offending portion of the local rule, we find the clerk\u2019s paramount duty to the people of this state to be clear. The legal right of appellants to have access to documents A-E is also apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the writ of mandamus is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b58-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, C.
