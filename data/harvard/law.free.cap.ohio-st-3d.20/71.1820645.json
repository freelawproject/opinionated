Haines, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St. 2d 15, 16 [58 O.O.2d 70].</p>\n<p id=\"b96-17\">This court has held that when there is no evidence upon which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>commission could have based its order, there is an abuse of discretion and mandamus is appropriate. <em>State, ex rel. Wallace, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 55, 58 [11 O.O.3d 216]. Conversely, where the record contains some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s finding that the claimant is not totally disabled, its findings will not be disturbed <em>(State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>[1982], 69 Ohio St. 2d 396, 397 [23 O.O.3d 358]) unless the claimant has produced \u201creliable, probative, and substantial\u201d evidence to support his claim of permanent total disability. <em>State, ex rel. Thompson, </em>v. <em>Fenix &amp; Scisson, Inc. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St. 3d 76, syllabus. In such a case, the commission must show some evidence to the contrary which \u201cmeets such standards\u201d in order to justify its order denying those benefits. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">In the instant case we note that appellant\u2019s evidence, contained in Dr. King\u2019s report, was reliable, probative, substantial and definite. In contrast, the evidence given by Dr. McCloud to support the commission\u2019s determination that appellant was not permanently and totally disabled was demonstrably not reliable, probative, or substantial because of Dr. McCloud\u2019s equivocation in deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">In his report, Dr. King opined that appellant\u2019s significant work-related impairment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> viewed in light of his age, lack of education, and lack of job skills, left him totally unsuited for any future gainful employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Dr. King\u2019s well-considered findings are factually supported and his conclusion concerning the extent of appellant\u2019s disability is reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supporting appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The decision of the commission, however, reflects the opinion contained in Dr. McCloud\u2019s report, in which he stated that appellant was not totally impaired. In contrast, to Dr. King\u2019s steadfast conclusion that appellant was totally disabled and hence unemployable, Dr. McCloud, subsequent to his medical report, changed his view concerning the effect appellant\u2019s impairment had on his employment prospects. For example, during deposition, Dr. McCloud first agreed with Dr. King\u2019s evaluation as to appellant\u2019s total disability, then stated that appellant was not unfit for some type of gainful employment and then again specifically agreed with Dr. King\u2019s findings as to both appellant\u2019s impairment and total disability. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>At worst, Dr. McCloud contradicted himself; at best, his conclusion that appellant was not totally disabled was equivocal.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">This court faced a strikingly similar situation in <em>State, ex rel. Paragon, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 72. In that case, a physician examined the appellant at the commission\u2019s request and produced a report which stated that appellant was totally disabled but might be able to return to work if \u201cmotivated.\u201d We held that such an equivocal report \u201cdoes not constitute evidence upon which the commission may either grant or deny appellant\u2019s application\u201d for permanent total disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 76. See <em>State, ex rel. Jennings, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In the instant case, the physician\u2019s equivocation came at deposition, where counsel for both parties elicited Dr. McCloud\u2019s opinion as to the extent of appellant\u2019s disability. Dr. McCloud\u2019s opinions on that issue were part of the record and were admittedly relied upon by the commission. The apparent uncertainty in Dr. McCloud\u2019s position gives the commission an insufficient basis to support its order denying appellant permanent total disability benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that there is reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in support of appellant\u2019s claim. While the record also contains some evidence to the contrary, it does not meet the above standards and thus cannot support the commission\u2019s denial of the claim. We therefore hold that mandamus will issue where the record contains reliable, probative, and substantial evidence supporting a claim for permanent total disability benefits and the decision of the Industrial Commission to the contrary is based solely on a medical report where the reporting physician, during a later deposition, equivocates or contradicts his opinion concerning the extent of disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the writ prayed for is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-10\">Sweeney, C. Brown and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ACF\">Locher, Holmes and Wright, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\"> Although Dr. King used the terms \u201cimpairment\u201d and \u201cdisability\u201d interchangeably, a fair reading of his report makes clear that he concluded that appellant had incurred a twenty-five to thirty percent physical impairment, which, when viewed against appellant\u2019s age, education and work experience, resulted in a permanent total disability. See <em>Meeks </em>v. <em>Ohio Brass Co. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St. 3d 147, 149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\"> The Medical Examination Manual of the commission states, at page vi, that permanent total disability \u201c* * * is established when the injury has caused the injured worker to be unfit for sustained remunerative employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">This court requires that determinations of disability be based on the claimant\u2019s ability to return to the type of work for which he or she is qualified. <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630 [23 O.O.3d 518].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-11\"> In the case at bar, both doctors spoke to both impairment and disability. We recognize that determinations as to extent of impairment are medical in nature, while determinations as to extent of disability are administrative in nature. <em>State, ex rel. Dallas, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 193. However, the commission itself often refers to and relies on doctors\u2019 opinions as to extent of disability when making its determination as to permanent total disability benefits. <em>State, ex rel. Kokocinski, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 186, 188. Such is the case here. The commission relied on Dr. McCloud\u2019s statement that appellant was not unfit for gainful employment, yet disregarded the doctor\u2019s later statements agreeing with Dr. King that appellant was totally disabled. The commission cannot claim that it alone determines extent of disability when it makes this determination solely by relying on an equivocating medical expert.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b99-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Holmes, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFF\">dissenting. I dissent in that I find the record reflects facts quite different from those found and interpreted by the majority. I find there to be no equivocation or contradiction within the testimony adduced from one of the examining physicians upon which evidence the commission relied in making its determination that this claimant was not permanently and totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\">The major concern of the majority is the commentary of Dr. McCloud concerning the report of Dr. King. There is no equivocation or contradiction in Dr. McCloud\u2019s testimony in this regard. Dr. King\u2019s report stated <em>aliunde:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><em>\u201c* </em>* * While I feel that this patient had some impairment of his left shoulder, I don\u2019t feel that it is of such a magnitude that is deserving 100% disability. * * * I feel as if his chances of being gainfully employed is [sic] nil, but, as far as his objective disability is concern [sic], I feel that he has 25 to 30% disability. I certainly don\u2019t feel that this man is 100% disabled. From the duration of this injury over 12 years, I don\u2019t feel that this man will ever be able to return to the job market on a [sic] active basis, however, I certainly don\u2019t feel that he is 100% impaired. I feel that this man\u2019s problem is approximately 25 to 30% of an impairment, from him being a functional individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Unlike the statement of counsel for claimant, as contained in the majority opinion here, Dr. King did not state that the claimant\u2019s \u201cprospect of returning back to the employment market was nil.\u201d Precisely what he stated was that he didn\u2019t feel \u201cthat this man will ever be able to return to the job market on a [sic] active basis * * The reasonable interpretation of this language is that the claimant is not totally disabled from an objective physical basis, and that due to all factors of the total man, <em>i.e., </em>physical condition, age, job training, the claimant would not be able to return to the job market <em>on an active basis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Dr. McCloud, upon deposition, merely was indicating his approval with Dr. King that the claimant was not totally disabled, and that the claimant may not be able to return to the job market <em>on an active basis </em>in the same manner as prior to his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Thereafter, Dr. McCloud emphasized his prior commentary in his testimony upon direct examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">\u201cQ. Just one more question, Doctor. In light of Dr. King\u2019s report and this discussion at the deposition regarding the impairment due to the allowed condition, is it your opinion that the claimant in a physical sense is completely precluded from a substantially remunerative employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u201cA. No, it is not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">On re-cross, Dr. McCloud was again asked to explain his answer:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">\u201cQ. The only question I have, Doctor, then, the opinion that you expressed today, which is in agreement with that of Dr. King, was an opinion expressed taking into consideration age, educational background, past work experience and the impairment as found by you; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cA. That answer was directed towards my response to Dr. King\u2019s evaluation, which I feel was very close to my evaluation as well, and he included both impairment and disability. From that standpoint, I agree with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Indeed, as noted by Dr. McCloud, Dr. King\u2019s position as to the disability of the claimant was quite similar to his own. In his prior report, Dr. McCloud had stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201c* * * It is my opinion this patient does not present with medical evidence consistant [sic] with considering him permanently and totally impaired based on the injuries to his upper left extremity. I would extimate [sic] that he has a PPI of 40% of the body as a whole in regards to the injuries noted in this claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">These statements are unequivocal, as found by the court of appeals\u2019 decision in affirmance of the order of the Industrial Commission. There definitely was some evidence to support the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Mandamus is an extraordinary legal remedy, the essential purpose of which is to command the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. The writ will not issue in a doubtful case, or where the effect of its issuance would be to control the discretion of the one against whom it would be directed. <em>State, ex rel. Gerspacher, </em>v. <em>Coffinberry </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 32 [47 O.O. 31], paragraph one of the syllabus. The relator seeking the writ must establish a clear legal right to the relief sought. <em>State, ex rel. Stevenson, </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 112, 114 [23 O.O.3d 160],</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In addition, since the respondent has referred to the evidence upon which it has based its order, consistent with <em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, no abuse of discretion and, therefore, no clear right to a writ, have been shown by relator. As such, relator\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus should be denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b100-10\">Locher and Wright, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
