This argument is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>without merit. It is well-settled that a charter municipality has the authority to prescribe the manner of electing its officials, and that the charter provisions will govern in the event they differ from the state law. <em>State, ex rel. Graham, </em>v. <em>Bd. of Elections </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 123, 124 [14 O.O.3d 349]. Thus, the limitation imposed by the Westlake City Charter applies in this case to prevent relator from being a write-in candidate at the general election. He asserts no other claim challenging the validity of the charter provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Assuming that the charter provision will be held inapplicable, relator proceeds to challenge the above-quoted portion of R.C. 3513.04, claiming that it deprives him of his rights to free speech, assembly and franchise guaranteed by \u201cSections 5 [sic] and 11, Article I, and Section 1, Article V, of the Ohio Constitution and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d In light of our determination that the charter provision does apply herein, we need not address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Relator had access to the primary ballot but lost the election. He is not entitled to a second opportunity by a write-in candidacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The writ is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b44-9\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Douglas, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b44-10\">Wright, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
