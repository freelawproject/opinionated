A tax was assessed upon him at the rate of six per cent on the ground that the $871 was received by him as interest from . . . money at interest\u201d within St. 1916, c. 269, \u00a7 2 (a). The petition now before us is brought to obtain an abatement of that tax. If the $871 was not taxable under \u00a7 2, no tax was due from the petitioner because the net income received by the petitioner from his whole business did not exceed $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">The petitioner\u2019s first contention is that, under and by force of the decisions of this court construing the tax acts in force before the enactment of the income tax act here in question, \u201cmoney at interest\u201d did not include money lent by a pawnbroker in the course of his business and for that reason the same words in St. 1916, c. 269, \u00a7 2 (a), do not include money so lent. The second contention of the petitioner is that interest received on money lent by him as a pawnbroker is taxable under \u00a7 5 and not under \u00a7 2 because it is money \u201creceived from dealing and trafficking with tangible personal property\u201d and that the proposition that it is money \u201creceived from dealing and trafficking with tangible personal property\u201d was established by the decisions of this court before the income tax act here in question was enacted. Both contentions are based upon the decision made in <em>Boston Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>137 Mass. 332. We do not find it necessary to determine how far the conclusion drawn in the petitioner\u2019s first contention is or is not correct. The second contention is founded on a mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>apprehension of the decision made in <em>Boston Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, ubi supra. </em>What was decided in that case was that a pawnbroker\u2019s place of business was a shop within Gen. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 12, cl. 1, because in lending money at interest a pawnbroker carries on the business of trafficking in money and the pledgee\u2019s title to tangible personal property acquired by him as security for money so lent is a part of his stock in trade in the same sense that the fixtures at his place of business are a part of his stock in trade and taxable as such in the town where he had his place of business or shop on the first day of May within Gen. Sts. c. 11, \u00a7 12, cl. 1. It was not there decided nor does it follow from what was there decided that interest received on loan's made by a pawnbroker is not in fact income received from money at interest, much less that such interest could not be treated by the Legislature as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">There would be great force in the proposition that interest received on loans made by a pawnbroker or (as in the case at bar) by a pawnbroker and dealer in second hand articles in the course of his business as a pawnbroker is income from \u201cprofessions, employments, trade or business\u201d within \u00a7 5 and not income derived by way of \u201cinterest from ... money at interest\u201d within \u00a72 (a) were it not for the clause at the end of \u00a7 5 which provides that \u201cInterest and dividends taxable under section two of this act shall not be taxed under this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">This clause at the end of \u00a7 5 is a direct implication that interest and dividends received as part of an income \u201cderived from professions, employments, trade or business\u201d can be taxed as income under \u00a7 2. In other words this clause at the end of \u00a7 5 is a direct implication that- the tax commissioner can analyze the income \u201cderived from professions, employments, trade or business\u201d and tax at six per cent so much of it as is income within \u00a7 2 and the balance of that income \u201cfrom professions, employments, trade or business\u201d at one and one half per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">This consideration is decisive of the question now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">It follows that the tax imposed upon the interest amounting to $871 received by the petitioner in the course of his business as a pawnbroker was taxable under St. 1916, c. 269, \u00a7 2, and the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
