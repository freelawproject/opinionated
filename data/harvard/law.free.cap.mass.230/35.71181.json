He shall give like notice with full particulars of any claim made on account of such accident. ...\u201d It appeared that the plaintiff was an inspector in the employ of the metropolitan park commission and that on a certain day his leg was scalded by a jet of steam or boiling water coming from an engine operated by workmen of the bridge builders who were constructing a bridge for that commission, that immediately upon receiving the injury the plaintiff walked away from the job unaided, had his leg bandaged at the office of the commission and went home, that the next day he returned to work and remained on the job for eight days, when his leg became worse and he went home, that he remained at home for twelve days, that during this time he called in attorneys, and that they on the last of the twelve days mailed a letter to the bridge builders containing a full statement of the accident and of his claim and that two days later the bridge, builders sent to the insurance company a letter enclosing the letter of the attorneys, which was received in due course, that the plaintiff did not notify the bridge builders that he was injured nor make any claim for his injury until the letter of his attorneys was sent to them, but that the foreman of the bridge builders learned of the injury at some time during the day on, which it happened and notified the bridge builders of it within a week, who assumed from the fact that the plaintiff had gone back to his work and had made no complaint that his injury was a trifling one. <em>Held, </em>that there could be no recovery on the policy because the condition in regard to notice was not complied with, the policy having required immediate notice of the occurrence of an accident, regardless of any claim for damages or the amount of damages sustained, and such requirement being a reasonable one.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b61-8\">In the case above described it was <em>pointed out </em>that the fact, that the person injured had a reasonable and <em>bona fide </em>doubt as to the existence of any injury or any liability, could not deprive the insurer of its contractual right under the policy to have immediate notice of the occurrence of an accident regardless of any claim that might be founded on it.

Upon these facts the judge found that the requirements of the policy respecting notice had been complied with, and that the plaintiff was entitled to a decree. At the request of the defendant insurance company he reported the case for determination by this cotut. If the ruling of the judge was correct, a decree was to be entered in favor of the plaintiff McCarthy in the sum of $1,547.10 with interest from September 24, 1917, together with costs. If the ruling was wrong as a matter of law, a decree was to be entered dismissing the bill with costs to the defendant insurance company.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-7\"><em>L.

The policy contained the following provision: \"This agreement is subject to the following conditions:. . . D\u2014The assured upon the occurrence of an accident shall give immediate written notice thereof to the Company, or to its duly authorized Agent, with the fullest information obtainable. He shall give like notice with full particulars of any claim made on account of such accident. . . .\u201d The presiding judge found as a fact that there was no waiver, and at the request of the Travelers Insurance Company reported the case to this court to determine whether \"upon my findings of facts, my ruling that the requirements of the policy respecting notice have been complied with, is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The reported facts are as follows: On January 6,1915, the plaintiff\u2019s leg was scalded by a jet of steam or boiling water coming from an engine operated by one of Rendle and Stoddard\u2019s workmen. The plaintiff was an inspector working for the metropolitan park commission, and Rendle and Stoddard were contractors who were constructing a bridge for the commission. \u201cImmediately upon receiving the injury McCarthy walked away from the job unaided, had his leg bandaged at the office of the commission, and went home. The next day he returned to work and remained upon the job until January 14, when, his leg becoming worse, he went home and remained at home until after January 26. Between January 14 and January 26 he called in attorneys, and they, on January 26, mailed a letter to Rendle and Stoddard containing a full statement of the accident and the claim, and on January 28 Rendle and Stoddard sent to the insurance company a letter enclosing the letter of the attorneys, which was received by the company January 29. No claim is made that this notice when received was not a sufficiently full notice of the nature of the accident and of the claim. But this was the first notice of the accident received by the company and upon its receipt the company objected that it came too late. McCarthy did not notify Rendle and Stoddard that he was injured, nor make any claim for his injury before the letter of his attorneys was sent to them. They learned of the occurrence from their foreman (who, it is agreed, was not present at the time, but learned of it during the same, day), within a week after January 6. They assumed, however, and had a right to assume, from the fact that McCarthy was back upon his job and made no complaint, that his injury was trifling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The question presented is whether the fact, found by the judge, that \u201cthey [Rendle and Stoddard] assumed, . . . and had a right to assume, from the fact that McCarthy was back upon his job and made no complaint that his injury was trifling,\u201d was a sufficient justification as a matter of law for their failure to give notice of \u201cthe occurrence of an accident\u201d for a period of at least fifteen days after \u201cthey learned of the occurrence from their foreman.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Within the week after January 6, 1915, and between January 14 and 28, 1915, when they gave notice of the accident to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>insurance company, Rendle and Stoddard knew of the \u201coccurrence of the accident,\u201d that is, they knew that the plaintiff on January 6, 1915, had had his leg \u201cscalded by a jet of steam or boiling water\u201d coming from an engine operated by one of their workmen. In passing, it must be said that in the reported facts there is not the slightest support for the suggestion of the plaintiff that the phrase \u201cthe occurrence\u201d used by the judge in \u201cthey learned of the occurrence from their foreman,\u201d was intended by him to summarize or characterize a series of events having their origin as a practical joke upon the plaintiff as the victim. Differing from policies that provide for \u201cimmediate notice\u201d \u201cupon the occurrence of an accident, and upon notice of any claim on account of an accident,\u201d <em>Anoka Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, </em>63 Minn. 286, which hold that the assured need not give notice until a claim is presented, but see <em>Underwood Veneer Co. </em>v. <em>London Guarantee &amp; Accident Co. Ltd. </em>100 Wis. 378; 11 Ann. Cas. 258, note, and cases collected, the policy in suit provides for immediate notice of \u201cthe occurrence of an accident\u201d regardless of any claim for damages or of the amount of damage] sustained or claimed. The policy then provides that the insured \u201cshall give like notice with full particulars of any claim made on account of such accident.\u201d The reason for the first of the conditions is plain. The occurrence of an accident and injury, however slight, may result in litigation, even in protracted litigation. It is, the experience of every defender of causes that it is a matter of first importance to become possessed of all material facts and of the names and residences of all known witnesses at the earliest possible moment, as facts may be forgotten or distorted and witnesses may go beyond reach. It is an important provision in that it is \u201cfor the protection of the insurer against fraudulent claims, and also against those which, although made in good faith, are not valid.\u201d <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>United States Casualty Co. </em>197 Mass. 101, 105, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">If we assume that the first knowledge of the \u201coccurrence of an accident\u201d which the insured had was on January 13, 1915, the last day of the week following the accident, the condition of the policy required that they should then \u201cgive immediate written notice thereof to the Company.\u201d Notice was not given until January 28, 1915. It is not contended that the failure to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>with the requirements of the policy was due to ignorance of the occurrence of the accident, as was the case in <em>Mandell </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. </em>170 Mass. 173, or that from the nature of the accident it was reasonably impossible during the period to determine whether there was or would be any bodily injury, as was the case in <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>206 Mass. 223, 226. For the application of a like rule under the workmen\u2019s compensation act see <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 388; <em>Carroll\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 203. It is plain that the fact, that the insured has a reasonable and <em>bona fide </em>doubt as to the existence of any injury or of any liability, cannot be used to deprive the insurer of his'contractual right to have an immediate notice of the occurrence of an accident, regardless of the damages that may be claimed to flow from that accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We are of opinion that the ruling was wrong as a matter of law, and in accordance'with the terms of the report a decree must be entered dismissing the bill with costs as to the defendant insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
