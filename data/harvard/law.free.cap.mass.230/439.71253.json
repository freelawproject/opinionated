The declaration also contained a second count alleging that the \"servants and agents of the defendant, intending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>play a practical joke on the plaintiff, locked him in a refrigerator or room to preserve goods, whereby the plaintiff was injured.\u201d Writ dated November 12, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-5\">In' the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Keating, </em>J. The evidence is described in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant filed a motion asking the judge to order a verdict for it. The judge refused to order a verdict for the defendant and submitted the case to the jury, a portion of his charge being as follows: \u201cSo it becomes necessary for you to determine, if you find that the occurrence took place in the way in which the plaintiff says it did, whether the employee of the defendant in locking that door after he went out of the refrigerator, if he did lock it, was playing a practical joke on this plaintiff, or whether he was doing something in the way of performing the work for which he was hired. You have heard the evidence in the case. If you come to the conclusion that the occurrence took place as the plaintiff testified, but that an employee of the defendant was playing a practical joke upon the plaintiff, that when he closed the door on him he intended to have fun with him, then the plaintiff cannot recover, because in doing that act for such a purpose he would not be acting within the scope of his employment. But if you should find that the occurrence took place as the plaintiff says and that the employee in closing or locking the door on the plaintiff, if he did close it or lock it, was doing so for the purpose of performing the work for which he was hired by the defendant, then he would be acting within the scope of his employment. Now, if you find that he was not acting within the scope of his employment, the plaintiff cannot recover. If you find that the employee of the defendant was acting within the scope of his employment, then you come to the consideration of the question, Was he negligent? Did he exercise such care as an ordinary prudent man would be likely to use under such circumstances? What was the employee doing? What knowledge did he have of the circumstances existing at that time? What knowledge did he have of the presence of the plaintiff? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b466-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, in the sum of $350; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b466-7\"><em>C.

This evidence was disputed. The declaration was in two counts, \u2014 the first alleging negligence of the defendant in locking the door and keeping the plaintiff in the refrigerator; the second, that the servants or agents of the defendant, intending to play a \u201cpractical joke on the plaintiff,\u201d locked him in the refrigerator. The judge instructed the jury that the plaintiff could not recover if the employees intended to play a joke on him, or shut the door \u201cto have fun with him,\u201d or if he himself closed the door and the defendant\u2019s employees had no knowledge that he was shut in; and fully instructed them that the plaintiff could not recover unless the defendant\u2019s employees, acting within the scope of their employment, negligently shut the door and suffered him to remain in the refrigerator.</p>\n<p id=\"AtCp\">The jury found for the plaintiff. Therefore, under the judge\u2019s instructions, they must have found that the plaintiff was a customer of the defendant, properly upon the premises, and was injured by reason of the negligence of one of its agents while acting within the scope of his authority. Under such circumstances the plaintiff clearly was entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
