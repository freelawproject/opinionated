While the vessel was being unloaded platforms were placed against the side of the stage to prevent the cargo from falling into the water and were removed as soon as the cargo was unloaded. While these platforms were in place the longshoreman who each time threw back the fall to lower the next piece of cargo stood with one or both feet on the platform. An experienced longshoreman in the employ of the owner of the vessel, who had been working in this way, temporarily left his work to go to another part of the pier and when he returned the hatch he was working at had been emptied of cargo and the dirt &lt;that had been swept out of the hold was being lowered in boxes. The longshoreman, with a fellow workman, was ordered to attend to this work. During his absence, when the unloading was completed, the platforms by the side of the stage had been removed by order of the superintendent. It was broad daylight at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. When the last box of dirt was lowered the longshoreman threw the fall back to the hatchman. As he threw the fall he was standing on the rail of the stage and, either because he lost his balance or because he stepped back where the platform had been, he fell between the vessel and the pier and received severe injuries which resulted in his death. In an action by the administratrix of the estate of the longshoreman against the owner of the vessel to recover for his death and conscious suffering, it was <em>held, </em>that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>was nothing to show negligence on the part of the superintendent, who had no reason to think that the longshoreman expected to use the platform to stand upon when it was apparent that it had been removed, and that, even if it had been the custom not to remove the platforms until the cleaning of the hold had been completed, it was not the duty of the superintendent to warn an experienced longshoreman of a danger which was plainly visible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b473-3\">In the same case it was <em>held </em>that the platforms were not a part of the ways, works or machinery of the defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b473-4\">Tort by the administratrix of the estate of Daniel J.

ICenneally, was employed by the defendant as a longshoreman. On September 27, 1911, he was at work discharging a cargo from No. 4 hatch of the steamship Canopic; seventeen men were engaged in this work, nine in the hatch, and eight on the trucks which were used to remove the cargo from the wharf. In handling the trucks the men worked in pairs. The material was lowered by a fall over the ship\u2019s side, one of. the men unhooking the load, the other handling the truck. The stage on which the cargo was landed extended from the wharf to the ship; it was of planking firmly fastened together, about thirty or thirty-five feet long and six feet wide, with guard rails of timber on both sides, the top of each rail being five or six inches above the floor of the stage. Platforms or skids from four to six feet wide were placed against the side of the stage, and there was evidence that they were so placed to protect the cargo from falling overboard and were removed as soon as the ship was discharged. There was also some evidence that in throwing back the fall a man stood with one or both feet on the platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>About half past two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the No. 4 hatch had been discharged and all the men, except Kenneally and his partner, had been set to work in the hold sweeping the dirt before loading the outward cargo. Kenneally went to another part of the pier and during his absence the platforms were removed by order of the, superintendent. The intestate and his partner were ordered to get two boxes of sawdust for use in the hold, and to take away the boxes of dirt as they were lowered to the stage, \u2014 these boxes being lowered in the same manner as the cargo. Two of the boxes had been lowered and carried away, and as the third box was lowered and placed on the truck, Kenneally, standing on the rail of the stage, threw the fall to the hatchman; and either because he lost his balance or stepped back where the platform had been, he fell, receiving injuries from which he died. The ship listed slightly inshore, making it more difficult to throw the fall. The accident happened about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, there was plenty of light at the time. The action is under the employers\u2019 liability act, the plaintiff contending there was negligence of the superintendent. The judge directed a verdict for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\">When the employee returned to the stage it was perfectly obvious that the platforms had been removed. There was nothing to ' show negligence on the part of the superintendent: he did not know that Kenneally expected to uge the platform to stand upon when it was apparent it had been removed; and, even if it were not customary to remove the platforms until the hold had been cleaned, there was no duty on the part of the superintendent to warn an experienced longshoreman of a danger which was visible on the slightest inspection. <em>Lenzi </em>v. <em>Hanscom Construction Co. </em>221 Mass. 195. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>L.
