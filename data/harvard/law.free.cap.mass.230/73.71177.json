A finding was warranted that no final certificate ever was given or intended to be given by the architect as arbitrator under the contract, and an auditor to whom the case had been referred found that \u201cat the time the certificate of final payment was given the defendant had not performed the work\u201d or furnished the \u201cmaterials required by the specifications; that the architect could easily have ascertained this, and was negligent in not doing so.\u201d It was conceded that the basement of the building had not been made waterproof as called for by the contract. The presiding judge refused to make a ruling requested by the defendant, that \u201cThe original contract was conclusively settled by the making and acceptance of the final certificate and payment,\u201d and also refused to instruct the jury \u201cthat the plaintiff could not recover on the principal contract because of the issuance of the architect\u2019s final certificate and payment thereunder.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the refusal of the judge to make the rulings requested was right.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b100-5\">In the case above described it also was <em>held </em>that the judge properly refused to rule that the plaintiff could not recover under a certain guaranty clause in the contract, because the request for the ruling was inappropriate, the plaintiff having made no claim under that clause.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b100-6\">In the case above described the plaintiff sought to recover for damage to \u201chis dry goods and other merchandise\u201d caused by the defendant\u2019s failure \u201cto put up a building that shall be waterproof.\u201d The auditor found \u201cthat the defendant knew that said basement was to be used for the storage of dry goods and merchandise,\u201d and further found \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s goods and merchandise in the basement became damp and mouldy due to the absence of waterproofing,\u201d and there also was oral evidence warranting the jury in making this finding. The presiding judge refused to make a ruling requested by the defendant that, \u201cEven though the defendant knew that the store was to be used for the storage of goods, the plaintiff [\u00a1defendant] would not be liable for damage thereto because the defendant\u2019s act in omitting the waterproofing would not be the proximate cause of such damage.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the judge was right in refusing to make this ruling, because the jury could find that the plaintiff\u2019s damages were such as reasonably might be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties if at the time of making the contract they had taken thought of the consequences likely to ensue if the waterproofing as specified were omitted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-7\">Contract upon a contract in writing, further described below, to construct a building for the plaintiff for stores and tenements on East Main Street in Fall River.

The plaintiff says the defendant contracted according to agreement, a copy of which is annexed, to put up a building that shall be waterproof and in accordance with certain specifications. The plaintiff says said building was not constructed as agreed and that as a result thereof his dry goods and other merchandise put in said building became moist and mouldy and were therefore damaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-7\">\u201cThe plaintiff further says the defendant knew the plaintiff intended to use said building for such purpose.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-8\">The defendant\u2019s answer, filed on November 9, 1912, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-9\">\u201cAnd now comes the defendant in the above entitled cause and for answer denies each and every allegation in the plaintiff\u2019s writ and declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-10\">\u201cAnd further answering, without waiving any of the above allegations, said defendant says that whatever agreement he has made with said plaintiff respecting the building of any house whatever he has fully performed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-11\">\u201cAnd without waiving any of the above allegations, but insisting thereon, the defendant further says that he did build for said plaintiff a certain house, and fully performed all by said defendant to be done and performed under the agreement made respecting said house, and that said plaintiff accepted said house as fully completed, and thereby released said defendant of and from all obligations respecting said house.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b101-12\">The contract declared upon contained, among others, the following'provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cArticle 2.

The contract price shall be paid only upon certificates of the architect as follows: 85% of amount of work done. Payments to be made monthly and final payment when building is accepted by the architect. All payments shall be due when certificates for the same are issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-7\">\u201cArticle 10. It is further mutually agreed between the parties hereto that no certificate given or payment made under this contract, except the final certificate or final payment, shall be conclusive evidence of the performance of this contract, either wholly or in part, and that no payment shall be construed to be an acceptance of defective work or improper materials.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-8\">The specifications contained, among others, the following material clauses, each of which applied to the entire contract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-9\">\u201cWaterproofing. After the stone walls have been faced, inside the walls and bottom of north cellar will be waterproofed; the entire height to grade with two coats of felt and one-coat of burlap well mopped in and coated with asphalt, then cellar walls to have a lining of four inches thick of brick laid in cement mortar.\u201d \u201cGuarantee.

F. Brown, </em>J. The findings of the auditor to whom the case was referred and the findings warranted by the evidence at the trial- are stated in the opinion. At the close of the evidence the defendant filed a motion in writing that a verdict be ordered for him. The judge denied the motion, and the defendant then asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlC\">\u201c1. The original contract was conclusively settled by the making and acceptance of the final certificate and payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b102-11\">\u201c2. Even though the defendant knew that the store was to be used for the storage of goods, the plaintiff [defendant] would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\"be liable for damage thereto because the defendant\u2019s act in omitting the waterproofing would not be the proximate cause of such damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">\u201c3. The declaration is not so drawn \u00a1as to entitle the plaintiff to recover in this action on the so called guarantee.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings. It was stated in the bill of exceptions that the judge \u201ccharged the jury correctly \u25a0and fully as to the law on all branches of the case, but refused to instruct the jury that upon all the evidence the architect\u2019s final certificate was in any way final and conclusive upon the parties, or that the plaintiff could not recover on the principal contract because of the issuance of the architect\u2019s final certificate and payment thereunder, \u2014 or that he could not recover for the damage to goods stored in the basement, \u2014 or that he could not recover under the pleadings for defects and faults appearing after the completion of the building.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,430; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-9\"><em>A. S. Phillips &amp; T. C. Crowther, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b103-10\">D. <em>R. Radovsky &amp; F. A.

A further finding also would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>been warranted that no final certificate was ever given or intended by the architect to be given in accordance with the terms of the original contract, under which he was to act as if he were an arbitrator. The auditor moreover has found, and there is no evidence to contradict his report, that \u201cat the time the certificate of final payment was given the defendant had .not performed the work\u201d or furnished the \u201cmaterials required by the specifications; that the architect could easily have ascertained this, and was negligent in not doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The present case, therefore, is plainly distinguishable from <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>215 Mass. 212, and the plaintiff is not estopped from contending that, the building not having been completed in accordance with the specifications, he is entitled to 'damages notwithstanding the architect\u2019s certificate of final payment with which he has complied. <em>Handy </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>204 Mass. 513. And the jury on the auditor\u2019s report would be warranted in finding \u201cthat the work and material which had not been furnished and performed consisted of the furnishing of an inadequate heating apparatus . . . omissions to waterproof the cellar, . . . and a shortage in the height of the sheathing.\u201d It was not contended by the defendant that the basement had been made waterproof as called for by the contract, and, whether the plaintiff as the architect testified agreed to a substituted performance, was as we have said for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The third request, for a ruling that, under the declaration as framed the plaintiff could not recover \u201con the so called guarantee\u201d was inappropriate. While the contract contained a clause that the contractor at his own expense is to make good \u201cany defects or faults in his work, occurring from poor workmanship or materials, which may appear within twelve months after completion of the building,\u201d neither the substituted nor amended declaration contains a count on the guaranty, and on the record the parties and the judge must have understood that the plaintiff made no claim under, it;</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">It is stated in the bill of exceptions that the court \u201ccharged the jury correctly and fully as to the law on all branches of the case,\u201d unless the first request and the second request should have been given. The plaintiff under the second count having asked for damages to \u201chis dry goods and other merchandise\u201d caused by the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>failure'\u201cto put up a building that shall be waterproof,\u201d the judge by the second request was asked to rule, that, even if he knew the store was to be used for the storage of goods, the defendant \u201c would not be liable for damage thereto because the defendant\u2019s act in omitting the waterproofing would not be the proximate cause of such damage.\u201d The refusal to give this ruling is the remaining question. It is settled by <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>190 Mass. 298, 299, and <em>Hanson &amp; Parker, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Wittenberg, </em>205 Mass. 319, 327, 328, that, although the contract contains no reference to the use which the plaintiff intended to make of the building, evidence is admissible to show knowledge by the parties of the circumstances on the basis of which the contract was made. And, \u201cas damages are assessed as compensation, the amount awarded should be such as the parties at the time of the making of the contract are supposed to have contemplated naturally would follow from the probable consequences of a breach.\u201d The auditor-found \u201cthat the defendant knew that said basement was to be used for the storage of dry goods and merchandise,\u201d and the jury could find on the evidence as the auditor further found, \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s goods and merchandise in the basement became damp and mouldy due to the absence of waterproofing.\u201d The defendant relies on <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale, </em>9 Exch. 341, where in an action against a common carrier special damages were sought for loss ,of profits, caused by the carrier\u2019s unreasonable delay in delivering a broken mill shaft to be used by the consignee as a pattern for the making of a new one, but which were denied, as decisive of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. But, as pointed out in <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. </em>206 Mass. 547, 555, citing among other cases <em>Hadley </em>v. <em>Baxendale, supra, </em>the loss of prospective profits may be allowed if-the loss likely to result from non-performance is within the contemplation of the parties, and \u201cthe profits are not so uncertain or contingent as to be incapable of reasonable proof.\u201d The general question also was considered in <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Fiberloid Co. </em>196 Mass. 440, 444-449, with a very full review of English and American cases, which without further citation abundantly show that recovery may be had where, as in the present case, the jury could find that the plaintiff\u2019s damages were \u201csuch as reasonably might be supposed to have been within the contemplation of the parties if at the time\u201d of making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>contract \u201cthey had taken thought of the consequences likely to ensue\u201d if the waterproofing as specified were omitted. The ^exceptions therefore should be overruled, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
