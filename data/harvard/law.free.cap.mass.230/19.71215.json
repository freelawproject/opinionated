The manner of the plaintiff\u2019s accident is described in the opinion. She testified, \u201cThat at that time she had no room anywhere else, so that the only place she had as a room was this room which her employer gave her as a part of her wages; that there were eight or nine other scrubwomen who had an arrangement like that; that, when she came into the hotel to go to her room, she came in the Idtchen door entrance, which was on a small side street off Lagrange Street; that she then walked along where they washed dishes and began descending the, stairs, the dish washing room being situated near the stairway which she had to descend.\u201d In regard to her slipping she testified, \u201cThat at the time she stepped her right foot down on to the stairs, she felt that there was something under her foot slippery and she did not know anything that happened until she found herself on her back; that she could not see what was on the stair; that the stairs were lighted at the time, the light being overhead toward the lower end of the stairs, there being one electric small bulb light there; that when she got to her room, she noticed that her clothes were soiled; that she could not really tell just what was on the clothes, \u201cit was refuse, sort of slippery refuse, on the clothes, like grease, she should say it was and on the back of the garment she was wearing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the judge, upon the defendant\u2019s motion, ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b46-7\"><em>E.

Later she noticed that upon her clothes there was some \u201csort of slippery refuse . . . like grease.\u201d There was an overhead electric bulb light toward the lower end of the stairs. There is nothing to indicate negligence on the part of the defendant. For aught that appears the object upon which the plaintiff slipped may have been dropped there but a moment before by some one for whose conduct in this respect the defendant was not responsible.
