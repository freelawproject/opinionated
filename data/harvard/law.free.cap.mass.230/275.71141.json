Wentzell and which he had turned across the tracks to go into Irving Street, a connecting street on which the plaintiffs lived. Writs dated March 8, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 amended declarations alleged that at the time of the collision the defendant\u2019s car was being operated \u201cat an unlawful, unreasonable and dangerous rate of speed in and upon said highway and in a reckless or wanton manner.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-6\">The defendant\u2019s amended answers alleged that each plaintiff was travelling in a motor car not registered in accordance with St. 1909, c. 534, as amended by St. 1912, c. 400, and St. 1914, c. 204. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-7\">In the Superior Court the cases were tried together before <em>Hitchcock, </em>J. The substance of the plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a1evidence is stated in the opinion. The plaintiff William C. Wentzell held an operator\u2019s license regularly issued to him. He had taken steps to secure a license for the car in which they were driving, but on the day of the accident, the license not having been issued for this car, he had taken the plate with the registration number belonging to another car which he owned and had put it upon this car, but the registration license for the car in question had not been issued. The plaintiff William C. Wentzell testified that, when he started to cross the defendant\u2019s tracks to go into Irving Street, the defendant\u2019s car was about three hundred feet away and that hi's motor car \u201cwas then going slowly, probably not over five miles an hour, perhaps less;\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-8\">At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence the judge, upon a motion of the defendant, ordered the jury to return a verdict for the defendant in each of the four cases; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-9\">St. 1915, c. 87, referred to in the opinion, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-10\">\u201c Section 1. Violation of the provisions of section nine of chapter five hundred and thirty-four of the acts of the year nineteen hundred and nine, which provides for the registration and equipment of motor vehicles, shall not constitute a defence to actions of tort for injuries suffered by a person, or for the death of a person, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>or for injury to property, unless it is shown that the person injured in his person or property or killed was the owner or operator of the motor vehicle the operation of which was in violation of said provisions, or unless it is shown that the person so injured or killed, or the owner of the property so injured, knew or had reasonable cause to know that said provisions were being violated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-3\">\u201cSection 2.

B. Grant, (M. Stone </em>with him,) for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-6\"><em>H. D.

The plaintiffs nevertheless contend that, even if they were violators of the law, the defendant is responsible, because it could be found that the conduct of the motorman was reckless, wanton and wilful. <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Northampton Street Railway, </em>202 Mass. 443, 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The city ordinance that \u201cNo car shall be allowed to attain, a greater rate of speed than ten miles an hour\u201d having been properly excluded because never approved by the board of railroad commissioners or their successors, the public service commission, as required by St. 1906, c. 463, Part III, \u00a7 74, the plaintiffs urge that, when coupled with the failure of the motorman to shut off the electric current or to apply the brakes seasonably, the rate of speed was so excessive as to make out a ease for the jury. But the conduct required to be proved is something different from negligence even when the degree may be found under our law to be gross. The alleged wrongdoer acts wantonly and wilfully only when he inflicts the injury intentionally or is so utterly indifferent to the rights of others that he acts as if such rights did not exist. The result is a wilful not a negligent wrong. <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>United Fruit Co. </em>223 Mass. 300, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">It is true the jury could find that the car was moving at a speed of twenty-five to forty miles an hour, and that it ran a distance of one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet after the impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>before being brought to a stop. We are however of opinion that the circumstances are insufficient to show that the motorman acted wantonly or recklessly. As was said in <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>217 Mass. 495, where the conditions of operation were very similar to those of the present case, \u201cThe failure of the motorman to see the automobile before he did in such situation as it was, and to bring his car to a stop quicker, while evidence of negligence, fails to reach to the kind of conduct required as a basis for recovery by the plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The exceptions should be overruled, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
