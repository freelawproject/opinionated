L. c. 197, \u00a7 10, was not repealed by St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7 13. Following <em>See </em>v. <em>Kolodny, </em>227 Mass. 446.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-7\">Petition, filed in the District Court of Lawrence on January 25, 1916, under R.

No question was raised as to the sufficiency of the statement filed in the registry of deeds. The respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition for want of jurisdiction. The judge denied the motion and made the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-11\"><em>\u201c1. </em>That the District Court of Lawrence, and the Superior Court on appeal, had jurisdiction under the provisions of R.

On November 24, 1915, he filed in the registry of deeds the certificate called for by R. L. c. 197, \u00a7 6, and on January 25, 1916, he brought a petition in the District Court of Lawrence to enforce the lien to which he had thus become entitled. Judgment in his favor was rendered by the District Court and by the Superior-Court on appeal. The case is here on exceptions which raise' the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court and of the Superior Court on appeal to entertain the petition and render the judgments which they rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">The contention of the respondent is that the jurisdiction off the court had come to an end on January 1, 1916, because of the repeal of R. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10 (on which its jurisdiction rested) by-St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7 13, which (by force of \u00a7 14 of that act) took effect on January 1, 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">The contention is disposed of by the decision of this court in <em>See </em>v. <em>Kolodny, </em>227 Mass. 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">In that case two petitions to enforce mechanics\u2019 liens were brought before January 1, 1916, but they were not disposed off until after that day. The contention in that\" case was that the jurisdiction of the Superior Court over these petitions came to an end on January 1, 1916, by force of St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14. It. was decided that it did not. That conclusion was not reached on-the ground that by a general statutory provision there is a saving; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>clause in case of the repeal of a statute as far as pending causes are concerned. There is no such statute in civil cases. Nor was the decision in <em>See </em>v. <em>Kolodny </em>put upon the ground that since the Superior Court had jurisdiction under the new act (St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7 4) it was not of consequence that its jurisdiction under R. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10, had come to an end. It was decided in <em>See </em>v. <em>Kolodny </em>that the Superior Court had jurisdiction because: \"In this Commonwealth a mechanic\u2019s lien is not created upon the filing of a certificate and a petition but is created as soon as labor or material, or both, is performed or furnished on real estate. The lien is an interest in the property, stands as security for the payment of the debt, is a vested right and is not an additional and 6X7 traordinary remedy which the Legislature may discontinue at pleasure. ... In accordance with the general rule the statutq must be construed as intended to have a prospective and not a retroactive effect where, as in the case at bar, retrospective construction will interfere with a vested right. . . . That such was the intention of the Legislature see St. 1916, c. 163, St. 1917, c. 213.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqW\">By enacting St. 1915, c. 292, the Legislature adopted a new mechanic\u2019s lien law. The mechanic\u2019s lien law described in St. 1915, c. 292, differed essentially from that theretofore in effect and was in no sense an amendment of the mechanic\u2019s lien law theretofore existing. For example the lien for labor performed in the absence of a notice was different from that under the old law (compare St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7 1, with R. L. c. 197, \u00a7 2) and the new act contained the novel provision that if a written notice there specified was giv\u00e9n by the contractor and recorded in the registry of deeds, all persons furnishing labor and materials under it or under any subcontract pursuant to it should have a lien to be enforced by a bill in equity to be brought in the Superior Court in behalf of all persons interested. See St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7\u00a7 2-4. The new act (St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7 13), in terms repealed those sections of R. L. c. 197, which dealt with the creation of a mechanic\u2019s lien under the former law (namely \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of R. L. c. 197) and it also repealed \u00a7 10 of R. L. c. 197 which gave to the Superior Court and to the inferior courts there specified concurrent jurisdiction to enr force the lien provided for in these earlier sections of R. L. c. 197. It was provided by \u00a7 14 of St. 1915, c. 292, that the new act should go into effect on January 1, 1916. But nowhere in the new act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>was a provision inserted dealing with cases where (by reason of work done or materials furnished under R. L. c. 197) a vested right to a lien had come into existence before January 1, 1916. Under these circumstances it was decided in <em>See </em>v. <em>Kolodny </em>that the repeal of those sections of R. L. c. 197 which are repealed by St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7 13 (including \u00a7 10 which gave jurisdiction to the Superior Court and to the inferior courts there specified) applied to future liens which should come into existence under the new act and did not (as matter of construction of \u00a7 13 of St. 1915, c. 292) apply to cases where by force of R. L. c. 197, mechanics had acquired a vested right to a lien before January 1, 1916. That is to say for the purpose of enforcing a lien which came into existence before January 1,1916 (when the new act went into effect) R. L. c. 197, \u00a7 10, was not repealed by St. 1915, c. 292, \u00a7 13. '</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
