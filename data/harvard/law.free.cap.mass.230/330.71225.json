On July 25, 1917, the libellee filed a document with the title \u201cObjections to Entry of Absolute Decree,\u201d which set out as \u201ccause of such objections\u201d the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-14\">\u201c1. That in the granting of said decree the court was misled and deceived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-15\">\u201c2. That said decree was procured by false and perjured testimony introduced by the libellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-16\">\u201c3. That since the granting of said decree new evidence unknown to your libellee at the time of the hearing of said libel for divorce has come to her knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\"4. That such newly discovered evidence is material, and was not within her knowledge or control at the time of the granting of said decree.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">This document bore a statement signed by a justice of the peace, that it was \u201csubscribed and sworn to\u201d before him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">On September 29, 1917, the libellee filed a further document entitled \u201cLibellee\u2019s Supplemental Objection to Entry of Decree Absolute,\u201d which stated that the libellee objected to the entry of the decree absolute \u201cand for further cause to objection signs the following, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-7\">\u201cThat the said libellant Joseph H. Feldman has since the entry of the decree <em>nisi </em>therein and within six months thereafter, and particularly during the months of June and July of 1917, and at divers other times to said libellee unknown, has been guilty of the crime of adultery with persons to said libellee unknown.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-8\">This document bore an affidavit that the statements therein were true to the best of the libellee\u2019s knowledge and belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-9\">The objections were heard by the trial judge. The libellee made \u2022several requests for rulings raising in substance the questions dealt with in the opinion. The trial judge filed a memorandum in substance dismissing the objections because they did not comply with Divorce Rule 6, and ruling that he had no discretion, to permit the filing of the supplemental objection, and, if he had, that he should refuse to permit it to be filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-10\">The libellee alleged exceptions and also filed a document entitled a claim of appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-11\">J. <em>F. Barry, (J. Isaacs </em>with him,) for the libellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-12\"><em>W. J. Patron, </em>for the libellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b357-13\">De Courcy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Am4\">\u201cDecrees of divorce shall in the first instance be decrees <em>nisi, </em>and shall become absolute after the expiration of six months from the entry thereof, unless the court before the expiration of said, period) for sufficient cause, upon application of any party interested, otherwise orders.\u201d R. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18. Divorce Rule 6 of the Superior Court provides: \u201cAt any time before the expiration of six months from the granting of a decree of divorce <em>nisi, </em>the libellee, or any other party interested, may file in the office of the clerk for the county in which the libel is pending, a statement of objections to an absolute decree, which shall set forth specifically the facts- on which it is founded, and be verified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>affidavit. Such decree shall not become absolute until such objections have been disposed of by the court.\u201d The court had authority to establish this rule, and it has the force of law. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>157 Mass. 503, 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The decree <em>nisi </em>in this case was entered on January 26, 1917. The objections filed by the libellee on July 25, 1917, were rightly dismissed as not in compliance with said rule. The first and second causes assigned were not specific allegations of facts. <em>May </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>172 Mass. 11. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>207 Mass. 254. The third and fourth were insufficient for the same reason, and had the additional defect that they did not comply with the established practice as to newly discovered evidence. Rule 24, of the Superior Court. <em>Borley </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>181 Mass. 246. And there was no error in dismissing the supplemental objection. This was not filed until September 29, 1917; and it was not an amendment of the original objections, but an entirely new charge of adultery, alleged to have been committed by the libellant within six months after the entry of the decree <em>nisi. </em>The rule of court limiting the time within which objections might be filed was binding upon the trial judge. It is unnecessary to consider whether the court has discretionary power to allow new objections to be filed, or old ones to be amended, after the expiration of six months from the entry of a decree <em>nisi </em>but before the decree is made absolute, because here the judge expressly refused to exercise any discretion he might have in favor of entertaining the objections. See <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Pratt, supra; Norton </em>v. <em>Lilley, </em>214 Mass. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The libellee\u2019s requests for rulings have not been argued. But so far as applicable to the facts they are disposed of by the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
