Ellison.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A73\">The case was referred to an auditor, who filed a report, upon which as the only evidence the case afterwards was heard by <em>Wait, </em>J. The auditor\u2019s report, among other findings, contained the following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AIu\">\u201c The defendant furnished a location for the plant in the vicinity of the place where a large quantity of stone had been collected on Topliff Street, and it appears that the plaintiff caused a crushing plant to be transported to the location so furnished and there set up ready for operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u201cJust prior to the beginning of the crushing operations, an injunction, restraining the plaintiff from there operating the plant, was obtained upon the petition of the residents living in the vicinity of the location of the plant, on the ground that said crushing operations would be a nuisance, and as a result of said injunction, the plaintiff was unable to operate the plant upon the location furnished.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-3\">The auditor\u2019s report concluded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_5\">\u201cThe question, therefore, turns wholly upon the legal construction of the word csuitable\u2019 as used in this contract. If it be held to relate solely to the suitability of the location from an operating standpoint only, then I find that there has been no breach of the contract. If, however, its legal construction and significance is broader than that and that the suitability of the location as required and intended by the contract fairly implies such a \"location as will be suitable not merely from an operating standpoint, but also with reference to the neighborhood and with references to surrounding conditions and circumstances, then I find that a location of that description was not furnished and there consequently has been a breach of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-5\">\u201cIf there has been a breach of the contract in that a location of the character required was not furnished by the defendant, then I find that the plaintiff is entitled to damages in the sum of $968 and interest from the date of the writ.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-6\">The judge, without hearing either party in argument, found and ordered judgment for the defendant, and upon the request of both parties reported the case for determination by this court. If his finding was wrong, judgment was to be entered for the pla.int.iff in the sum of $968, with interest from the date of the writ; otherwise, judgment was to be entered on the finding for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>W. A. Knowlton &amp; F. M. Hill, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-9\"><em>H. V. Cunningham, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b135-10\">Loring, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">It is expressly provided in the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant that the defendant was \u201cto furnish a suitable location for the crusher.\u201d If the \u201clocation for the crusher\u201d furnished by the defendant was a location where stone could not be crushed, it was not a \u201csuitable location\u201d within the true meaning of this provision of the contract. The reason why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>stone could not be crushed at the location furnished by the defendant (if stone could not be crushed there) is of no consequence. If stone could not be crushed at the location furnished by the defendant because crushing stone there was a violation of the rights of those living in the neighborhood, the location was no more a \" suitable\u201d one than is a location where for physical reasons the work of crushing stone could not be carried on. See in this connection <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Reading Chemical Fertilizing Co. Ltd. </em>160 Penn. St. 209, <em>227; Susquehanna Fertilizer Co. </em>v. <em>Spangler, </em>86 Md. 562, 571; <em>Teilman </em>v. <em>Plock, </em>21 Fed. Rep. 349, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">If the action taken by the neighbors had been taken after the plaintiff had begun work at the location furnished by the defendant, questions would have arisen not presented by this record. It is stated in the report that the injunction forbidding the crushing of stone at the location furnished by the defendant was granted \u201cjust prior to the beginning of the crushing operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">So too, if it had appeared on the record that part of the damages found by the auditor included work done before the action was taken by the neighbors, a question would have arisen which has not been argued by the defendant. The report does not state how the damages (amounting to $968) found by the auditor were computed, and the defendant has confined his argument to the true meaning of the provision of the contract requiring the defendant to provide \u201ca suitable location for the crusher.\u201d The presiding judge ends his report with these words: \u201cIf my finding was wrong, then judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in the 'sum of $968, with interest from the date of the writ.\u201d The finding was wrong. It follows that judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff in the sum just stated, and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
