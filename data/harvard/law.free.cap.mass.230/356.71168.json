Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated January 24, 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-9\">The defendant\u2019s answer contained an allegation \"that the cause of action mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s writ and declaration did not accrue within six years before the suing out of the plaintiff\u2019s writ.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-10\">The evidence at the trial in the Municipal Court is described in the opinion. The first running account between the plaintiff and the defendant, there mentioned, was from May 31, 1907, to November 20, 1908, when there was a balance due to the plaintiff, the last credit item being dated May 6,1909. On October 8, 1913, the trading between the parties was resumed in the manner described in the opinion. From October 8, 1913, there were almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>continuous transactions between the parties until the last purchase on May 29,1914. The report states that \u201cAt the time of the trial, when the amended declaration was allowed, it was discovered that the credits of the second period of trading exceeded the debits by seventy-five cents.\u201d The plaintiff asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">\u201c 1. On all the evidence the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">\u201c2. That the defendant must be held to have intended the full effect of the payment of seventy-five cents upon whichever debt the creditor intended to apply it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\">\u201c 7. The payment by the defendant of a sum greater by seventy-five cents than the balance of the later part of the account in the absence of any fact tending to show that the defendant intended a different application gave the plaintiff the right to apply said payment on the earlier part of the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\">\u201c8. The payments made by the defendant were not made on any part of the account existing between the parties, but were made to be applied to the whole account.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-9\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings, and made the finding which is quoted in the opinion. He found for the defendant and at the request of the plaintiff reported the case to the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division made an order that the report be dismissed; and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-10\"><em>F. W. Boring, (F.

The trial judge has expressly found \"that the defendant did pay for each bill of goods as bought or shortly thereafter and intended that his payments should be applied on said purchases and not on the purchases of the first period of trading and that the plaintiff intended likewise and so applied them.\u201d At the time of the trial, when the amended declaration was allowed (April 7, 1916), it was discovered that the credits of the second period of trading exceeded the debits by seventy-five cents.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">The first running account ended on November 20, 1908, when . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>there was a balance due the plaintiff; and the last credit thereon was on May 6, -1909. It was almost seven years later when the parties discovered the overpayment on the second account, which apparently was made by error and mistake. Assuming that the plaintiff had a right to retain this seventy-five cents, his application of it to the old account, already barred by the statute of limitations, would not renew that account. In order to take the debt out of the operation of the statute, such appropriation must be specifically made or directed by the debtor. <em>Pond </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Gray, 630. <em>Wenz </em>v. <em>Wenz, </em>222 Mass. 314. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>225 Mass. 303, 308, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">It is urged by the plaintiff that the unintended overpayment may be considered as applied to the first account at the time when it was made, and the running of the statute thereby arrested. But a conclusive answer to this contention is, that whenever this was received by the plaintiff it was intentionally applied by him to the second account. Such too was the intention of the defendant, who had a right to direct the application of the payments made by him. <em>Ramsay </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>97 Mass. 8. The plaintiff never attempted to alter that application; nor could he have done so except with the consent of the defendant. <em>Plummer </em>v. <em>Erskine, 58 </em>Maine, 59. <em>Coon\u2019s Appeal, </em>52 Conn. 186. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>Saxton, 74. 30 Cyc. 1239, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In view of the findings of fact made by the trial judge there was no error in denying the plaintiff\u2019s first, second, seventh and eighth requests, and finding that the account sued on was barred by the statute of limitations,</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
