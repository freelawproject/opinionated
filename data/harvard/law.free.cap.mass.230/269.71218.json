The facts are not in dispute. The policy in question was issued by the defendant to Arthur O\u2019Neill, (a brother of the plaintiff) as the insured, on June 26, 1914, for one year from June 6, 1914. In the summer of 1914 Arthur O\u2019Neill made a claim under the policy and collected $32 for the loss of a tire. The following November he applied for and obtained from the defendant a change in the policy by omitting the clause which limited recovery for loss by theft to the excess above $25, and a rider to that effect, bearing date of November 30, 1914, was issued by the defendant to him. Soon afterwards, and during the same month, he directed the insurance brokers regularly employed by him, to apply to the defendant for a change in the name of the insured from Arthur O\u2019Neill to Katherine O\u2019Neill. He also directed a similar change to be made in a liability policy issued by another company upon the same car. These applications were made to one Kane, a clerk employed by the defendant\u2019s agents (Dewick and Flanders) who said \u201cthat he would attend to it;\u201d but no such change in the policy issued by the defendant ever was made. The motor car, while left temporarily on the street by Arthur O\u2019Neill on March 9,1915, was stolen, and before it was found was partially destroyed by fire on May 3, 1915. The plaintiff filed a sworn proof of loss with the defendant on April 29, 1915, in which the following appears: \u201cBy your policy of Insurance No. 2286. Issued at your Boston Agency, dated June 26, 1914, you insured Arthur O\u2019Neill who assigned to Katherine L. O\u2019Neill. . . .\u201d The car was owned by the plaintiff when the policy was issued and remained her property and was registered in her name; it never was owned by Arthur O\u2019Neill. The plaintiff does not claim under the original policy, but seeks to recover upon an oral contract of insurance; while it is the contention of the defendant that no valid agreement was made by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">It is plain that as Arthur O\u2019Neill had no insurable interest in the car the policy was void as against him. It is also true that, if he had assigned his interest in the policy to the plaintiff with the assent of the defendant, no valid contract would have been created, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>as the plaintiff would have taken by such assignment only such rights as her brother had under the policy. <em>McCluskey </em>v. <em>Providence Washington Ins. Co. </em>126 Mass. 306. <em>Mowles </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co. </em>226 Mass. 426. But the plaintiff contends that the defendant agreed to substitute her name in place of that of her brother as the insured, and that such agreement constituted a valid and enforcible obligation. The difficulty with this contention is, that, if it be assumed that the statement of the clerk of the defendant\u2019s agents \u201cthat he would attend to it\u201d amounted to an agreement to make the change, and also, that the agents were authorized to make such change upon the authority of <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Orient Ins. Co. </em>174 Mass. 416, 422, still such an agreement was wholly without consideration as between the plaintiff and the defendant. At most it was only a voluntary undertaking on the part of the defendant and did not create a new and independent contract of insurance. <em>McCluskey </em>v. <em>Providence Washington Ins. Co. supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Although the counsel for the plaintiff state in their brief that \u201cshe does not contend there was any oral contract whereby she was \u2019covered\u2019 or insured in any way,\u201d and that \u201cher whole case is predicated upon the claim that she was not insured,\u201d and that \u201cthe defendant company agreed to issue a policy of- insurance against theft and fire to her . . . and that it failed to do so, and thereby became liable in damages for breach of contract,\u201d we are of opinion that the agreement, properly construed, plainly contemplated the delivery either of a new policy or the issuance of a rider in connection with the original; indeed it is the contention of the plaintiff that she supposed that such a rider had been issued and did not discover that it had not been so issued until after the car was stolen. It was the duty of the plaintiff, within a reasonable time, to have taken some steps to ascertain whether the oral contract had ripened into a formal contract of insurance. The case cannot be distinguished in principle from <em>McQuaid </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co. </em>226 Mass. 281, and <em>Mowles </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co. supra; </em>it is clearly distinguishable from <em>Sanford </em>v. <em>Orient Ins. Co. supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">In accordance with the stipualtion of counsel, the entry must be, judgment for the defendant on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
