A physician was sent for and, arriving about an hour later, found him \u201cin a semi-conscious state, frothing at the mouth and stiffening up on one side.\u201d He was sent to a hospital and died soon afterwards, and his dependent widow made a claim under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. Previous to his death the employee appeared to have been in good health. He had assisted in making repairs on a tank in which chemicals were prepared, having been inside about ten or fifteen minutes on each occasion. There was evidence that on at least two occasions he had been overcome while working in this tank and that at times he had not appeared to be well. The claimant contended that the employee\u2019s death was the result of a personal injury due to the inhalation of poisonous fumes from chemicals. The physician who attended him at the factory, also the medical examiner who examined his body and another medical examiner each testified that he was unable to state the cause of death. The arbitration committee found that \u201cthe arbitrators are unable to determine what was the cause of [his] death, this being wholly a matter of conjecture, and, therefore, are-unable to find that [his] death . . . arose out of his employment.\u201d This finding was adopted by the Industrial Accident Board. <em>Held, </em>that the finding was warranted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-9\">Appeal to the Superior Court under St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 14, from a decision of the Industrial Accident Board refusing to award compensation to Mary A.

He was a carpenter by trade, thirty-five years old, and was employed to help around generally, \u201cdoing odd jobs, with no regular hours, subject to call at all times including Sundays and evenings.\u201d His employment began about August 19, 1912, and there was evidence that during the early part of the week ending Saturday March 1, 1913, work at the factory was temporarily discontinued; that on the Saturday morning above referred to he went to work as usual, and was told by his employer that after doing certain things that had to be done he could go home and return when necessary to care for the furnaces, as there was nothing else for him to do. The evidence shows that he did not go home afterwards; that the next morning the employer went to the factory about 10:30 o\u2019clock and found Murphy sitting on a box in front of a furnace; that he complained of feeling ill; that a physician was sent for and arrived about 11:20 o\u2019clock; that at that time Murphy \u201cwas in a semi-conscious state, frothing at the mouth and stiffening up on-one side; \u201d that he was sent to a hospital and died soon afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">The Industrial Accident Board found that \u201cIt was shown that the employee had been in good health\" previous to his death and that he had been engaged to perform carpenter work and help <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>his employers to perfect a certain moving picture film. Certain chemicals were used in preparing this film, the testimony showing, however, that these were not dangerous nor was there any risk of suffocation or poisoning from their use or from contact with them. The employee had assisted in making repairs on the tank into which the preparation of chemicals was placed, being inside about ten or fifteen minutes on each occasion.\u201d The physician who attended him at the factory testified that he could not state the cause of death. Dr. Magrath, medical examiner for Suffolk County, examined the body on July 7, 1913; he testified he was unable to state the cause of death. And Dr. Jones, medical examiner for the Quincy district, testified to the same effect. The arbitration committee found that \u201cthe arbitrators are unable to determine what was the cause of Murphy\u2019s death, this being wholly a matter of conjecture, and, therefore, a-re unable to find that John T. Murphy\u2019s death on March 2, 1913, arose out of his employment.\u201d This finding has been adopted and affirmed by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">To entitle the dependent to the payment of compensation under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, it must be found affirmatively that the injury which caused the death of the employee arose out of and in the course of his employment, \u2014 the burden rests upon her to prove that fact by a preponderance of evidence. The finding of the board that the injury did not arise out of and in the course of his employment, was a finding upon a question of fact, and cannot be set aside if there was any evidence to support- it. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 526. <em>Sanderson\u2019s Case, </em>224 Mass. 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">It is true, as the counsel for the claimant argues, that the facts required to establish her claim to compensation under the act need not necessarily be proved by direct evidence, but may be established by reasonable inferences drawn from facts shown to exist. <em>Von Ette\u2019s Case, </em>223 Mass. 56, 59, 60. <em>Sponatski\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Although there was evidence that the employee had been overcome on at least two occasions while working in the mixing tank, and that on other occasions during his employment he had complained of feeling ill, and at times had not appeared to be well, still upon all the evidence we cannot say that the Industrial Accident Board was required to find that his death was the result of a personal injury due to the inhalation of poisonous fumes from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>chemicals, as the claimant contends; there was no direct evidence to support that contention and we do not think it reasonably could be inferred that death was the result of that cause. In view of the medical and other testimony, it would seem that the finding of the board that the cause of death was doubtful and could . not be determined, was amply justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-3\">While the widow and children of the deceased are entitled to sympathy, we are constrained to .hold that the cause of the employee\u2019s death is wholly conjectural and speculative. The contention that it arose out of the employment does not rest on a sound basis in view of the evidence as recited in the record. <em>Sanderson\u2019s Case, supra. Milliken\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 293. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Owners of Steamship Wild Rose, </em>[1910] A. C. 486. <em>Barnarbas </em>v. <em>Bersham Colliery Co. </em>3 B. W. C. C. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Because of the conclusion reached, we need not consider whether the dependent\u2019s claim for compensation is barred for failure to give the notice required by St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 15, nor whether under Part II, \u00a7 18, the dependent would be entitled to compensation even if such notice had not been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
