Later she testified that it fell from the roof and was about a foot long and from four to five inches wide and from four to five inches thick. On cross-examination she testified that she did not know where the ice came from. <em>Held, </em>that it was for the jury to choose between these contradictory statements, and that a finding was warranted that the ice fell from the roof of the defendant\u2019s building.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-7\">In the foregoing action it was admitted that, although parts of the defendant\u2019s building were rented to tenants, the roof was under the defendant's care and control, and it was <em>held </em>that, if the jury found that ice of the size described by the plaintiff came from the roof and struck the plaintiff, they would be warranted in finding for the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-8\">At the trial of an action for personal injuries from being struck on the head by a piece of ice falling from a building of the defendant, there was evidence that the same piece of ice damaged the plaintiff\u2019s muff, that the superintendent of the building sent the plaintiff with the janitor to a lawyer\u2019s office, where the plaintiff first was offered $2 \u201c for the damage done her muff; \u201d that after further talk $5 was paid, that before receiving this amount a release of all demands was drawn up in duplicate by a young woman in the office who, when she presented it to the plaintiff for her signature, said it was a \u201creceipt for $5 for damage to her muff,\u201d and that the plaintiff, relying on that representation, signed the release.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b462-9\">The defendant produced both duplicate originals of the release and relied upon them. <em>Held, </em>that the jury were warranted in finding that the representations as to the releases were made and that they were binding upon the defendant; and that the release therefore did not bar the action.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXk\">Tort for personal injuries caused by being struck upon the head by a piece of ice falling from a building of the defendant on State Street in Boston.

Parts of the building were rented to tenants, but the defendant admitted that the gutters and the roof were in her charge and control. The statutory notice was seasonably given, and there was evidence that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. She testified, in substance, that the ice struck her on the head and \u201cbounding, struck her muff and cut a tail off it; \u201d that the superintendent of the building sent her with the janitor to a lawyer\u2019s office where she signed a receipt executed in duplicate, under seal, in full of all demands, the consideration being $5. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $700.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In one part of her direct evidence the plaintiff said the .ice fell from the building. Later she testified that it fell from the roof and was about a foot long and four to five inches wide and four to five inches thick. On cross-examination she said she did not know where it came from. It was for the jury to choose between these contradictory statements. <em>Tierney </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>216 Mass. 283. <em>Kane </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>218 Mass. 101. If they believed that a piece of ice of the size described by the plaintiff fell from the roof of the building, it being admitted that the roof was under the defendant\u2019s care and control, they could find the defendant was negligent. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Creamer, </em>160 Mass. 496. <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fifty Associates, </em>101 Mass. 251. <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Farnam, </em>208 Mass. 448. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Carigianis, </em>217 Mass. 1. <em>Yorra </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>226 Mass. 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The defendant contends that it was entirely conjectural from what part of the building the ice fell, \u2014 that it may have fallen from the portion of the building controlled by the various tenants. That would be true were it not for the direct testimony of the plaintiff that the ice fell from the roof; and it was for the jury to say how far they relied on this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, which on the record does not appear to have been contradicted, the first offer made her was $2 \"for the damage done her muff,\u201d but after some further talk $5 was paid; before receiving this amount the release was drawn up by a young woman in the office who, when she presented it to the plaintiff for her signature, said it was a \u201creceipt for $5 for damage to her muff,\u201d and the plaintiff relying on this representation signed the release. It is not in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that at this time any claim was made for damages on account of personal injury; and the conversation concerned the personal property damage only. These facts bring the case within the rule stated in <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River Railroad, </em>160 Mass. 447, 454. It was for the jury to say -yvhether the plaintiff signed the writing relying on the misrepresentation that it was a receipt merely for the damage to her property, and if they so found they could find that she was not deprived of her right to recover for injuries to her person. <em>Freedley </em>v. <em>French, </em>154 Mass. 339. <em>Larsson </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Stock Exchange, </em>200 Mass. 367. From all the evidence disclosed by the record, the representations as to the contents of the release were binding upon the defendant. Both of the duplicate originals of the release were part of the same transaction and the same representations applied equally to each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In accordance with the report, judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for the amount of the verdict, with interest from June 22, 1917, and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
