One of the firm retired as a partner. The remaining partner then alone made a new contract' of general agency with the company, but, instead of making a new contract in writing with the solicitor, agreed with him orally that the provisions of the contract formerly made with him by the firm should continue in force. <em>Held, </em>that the new oral contract was supported by a good consideration and was not terminable at the will of the general agent, but could be terminated only in accordance with the provisions of the former contract in writing which it adopted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b274-7\">A provision of the contract thus adopted by the oral contract, which provided for its termination if the solicitor left the agency of the company to engage in other business, or became connected with another life insurance company or severed his connections with the agency, was <em>held </em>to mean that such termination should occur upon a voluntary retirement by the solicitor, and not to mean that it would occur upon his discharge for a cause not included in the contract\u2019s provisions or upon his enforced resignation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b274-8\">Where such a contract, made by the company\u2019s general agent, was a complete contract for services to be rendered by the solicitor, the compensation for which was to be paid by the company, the company was <em>held </em>to have no power to terminate it in the absence of a provision in the contract for such termination by the company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b274-9\">The mere fact, that the solicitor above described advocated and sought legislation providing for a different form of endowment policy than that issued by the company, does not show disloyalty on his part warranting his discharge, where it appears that he honestly believed that the form of policy which he advocated, if adopted, would enure to the advantage not only of the insured but also of the company, and that his activities in this regard were known to the company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b274-10\">Where, at the trial of an action upon the contract above described by the solicitor against the company, it appeared that the company and the general agent both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>regarded the contract as binding upon the company, that its officers knew of the contract, that it paid the solicitor his commissions thereunder and that the company was the actor in discharging the solicitor and fixing the terms of his dismissal, findings of the judge were <em>held </em>to have been warranted that the company was liable upon the contract for the continued payment to the solicitor of renewal premiums according to the contract\u2019s provisions.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b275-3\">In an action upon the same contract against the general agent it was <em>held </em>that the general agent likewise-was liable personally to the solicitor, although the solicitor could have but one satisfaction in damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b275-4\">An oral contract between -a solicitor of insurance and a life insurance company or its general agent, which is to continue in force during the continuation of the general agency or until it is terminated by reason of one of several specified acts on the part of the solicitor, and which provides for the payment to the solicitor as compensation of a certain percentage of first year\u2019s premiums and another percentage of all renewal premiums upon policies procured by him from the company, is not within the provisions of the statute of frauds, R. L. c. 74, \u00a7 1, cl. 5, enacting that \u201cNo action shall be brought . . .

It was made between the plaintiff and Williams and Jones, the defendant company\u2019s general agents, and among other provisions established the plaintiff\u2019s compensation for services on a percentage basis \u201cfor first year of insurance,\u201d and also on all renewals. But, Jones having resigned on July 1, 1901, the defendant Williams succeeded as the company\u2019s general agent, and continued as such to the date of the respective actions. The auditor reports that, after the retirement of Jones, while no written contract was entered into between the plaintiff and Williams, the plaintiff continued as before \u201cto solicit insurance for the company down to July, 1909, when he was discharged by a letter of dismissal\u201d signed by Williams as the company\u2019s general agent, and, after some correspondence and at least one interview between the plaintiff and the company, the company confirmed this action. It is stated in the letter of discharge \u201cWhile you had no legal claim for commissions under this contract after the termination of the general agency of Williams and Jones, I have continued to allow you commissions since that time and shall.allow you, in full settlement of all your claims under this contract, renewals for five full years from August 15,1909, the date of termination, as provided for therein.\u201d And the auditor has found that the commission on all renewal premiums were duly paid until, August 15, 1914, on all policies procured by the plaintiff. But, as no commissions have since been paid, these actions are brought to recover commissions alleged to have accrued thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>It is not contended by the plaintiff that the commissions were to be paid during the life of the respective policies but he relies upon an oral contract with the defendants. The auditor\u2019s findings, which are amply supported by the evidence recited, show that after Williams became the sole agent instead of \u201cmaking out a new contract\u201d in writing, \u201cthe provisions of the Williams and Jones agreement were to continue in force after the agency of Williams and Jones had ceased and were thus to define the relations between the plaintiff and the defendant, Williams, after that time.\u201d While it was said in the letter of dismissal that the plaintiff \u201chad no legal claim for commissions under this contract after the termination of the general agency of Williams and Jones,\u201d the auditor says, \u201cthis statement is probably true if applied to the Williams and Jones contract alone without taking into consideration any new contract made by Williams with the plaintiff after the Williams and Jones agency ceased. . . . But it is plain that some such new contract was made thereafter and that under it Williams, as he said in his letter, \u201c\u2018continued to allow . . . commissions since that time\u2019 to the plaintiff.\u201d The question is one of fact, and the oral contract found by the auditor is to be deemed and treated $s the same in terms and effect as if the Williams and Jones contract had been redrafted with the omission of the name of Jones. It is supported by a sufficient consideration, namely, services to be rendered by the plaintiff, and it was not terminable at the will of the defendant Williams or by the company which also can be held for reasons to be subsequently stated. <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>207 Mass. 226, 234, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">It could be ended only in accordance with its provisions. By article ten, if the plaintiff should \u201ccommit any misdemeanor\u201d he forfeited any further commissions. The auditor reports that he has not been guilty of any misconduct at common law or under any statute which would constitute a misdemeanor. By article eleven the contract might be terminated if the plaintiff left the agency of the company to engage in other business, or became connected with another life insurance company, or severed his connection with the agency. This he has not done. If he had taken such action the plaintiff still was to have his renewal commissions for a period of five years after the termination of the agency. It is also settled, as the auditor rightly ruled, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>words, \u201cIn case the said agent leaves the agency,\u201d and \u201cshould said Elwell sever his connection with this company,\u201d mean the plaintiff\u2019s voluntary retirement and not his discharge, or an enforced resignation. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. 225 </em>Mass. 439. <em>Grapel </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>112 N. Y. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\">Where the contract as in the present case is a complete contract for services to be rendered by the plaintiff, the compensation for which is to be paid by the principal, the principal alone cannot revoke unless a power of revocation is expressly reserved. <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Central National Bank, </em>129 Mass. 279. See 31 Cyc. 1297, 1298, note 22, for a collection of cases. The consideration for the agency had not failed as in <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>189 Mass. 377. It also appears that the plaintiff advocated a different form of endowment policy than the policy issued by the company and sought legislation to that end. The defendants\u2019 contention that this conduct was sufficient to justify his discharge because it showed disloyalty to his principal, is disposed of by the auditor\u2019s finding, that the plaintiff was honest in his belief, that if the form he suggested were adopted it would enure to the advantage of not only the insured but of the company, and that in all which he did he acted in good faith, with the knowledge of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It is sufficiently plain without further recitals from the report that the plaintiff never assumed, or was understood by the defendants to have assumed, such inconsistent relations with other parties as to prevent or influence his impartial and honest discharge of the duty he owed the defendants. <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>195 Mass. 277. It follows that under article five of the contract commissions on renewals would be ended only when the defendant Williams ceased to act as the company\u2019s general agent, and as the agency never has been terminated, the plaintiff can recover from him the commission of five per cent on all renewal premiums received since August 15,1914, to the date of the writ, unless It. L. c. 74, \u00a7 1, cl. 5, to which reference will hereafter be made, is a bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">But even if Williams entered into contractual relations with the plaintiff as previously described, the defendant company contends that the evidence fails to show any agreement by which it became bound. It was a question of fact, whether it was the intention and understanding of the parties that while the agent should be liable personally, the company also should be held. <em>Silver </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>136 Mass. 319. The auditor\u2019s report warranted the judge in finding that both defendants regarded the contract as binding the company. Its officers knew of the contract. It paid the plaintiff his commissions thereunder, and it was the company itself which finally decided that he should be discharged, and fixed the terms of dismissal, as shown by the correspondence. The plaintiff, although entitled to but one satisfaction in damages, can accordingly sue the company\u2019s general agent who is personally responsible by the express terms of the contract, and the company also, which on the record had given authority to Williams to act in its behalf. <em>Byington </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>134 Mass. 169. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Bradlee, </em>156 Mass. 28, 32. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>168 Mass. 446, 449. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Franklin Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>165 Mass. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">It lastly is urged by each defendant that having been oral the contract is within R. L. c. 74, \u00a7 1, cl. 5, declaring that no action shall be brought upon <em>\u201c </em>an agreement that is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof \u201d unless \u201cthe promise, contract or agreement ... or some memorandum . . . thereof is in writing.\u201d The defendant Williams however might have died, or his general agency terminated within the year, or the insured might never pay a renewal premium, and the contract even if it might continue for years could be fully completed within one year. <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Westborough, </em>19 Pick. 364. <em>Somerby </em>v <em>Buntin, </em>118 Mass. 279, 286. <em>Scribner </em>v. <em>Flagg Manuf. Co. </em>175 Mass. 536. <em>Carnig </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>167 Mass. 544. The provision of \u00a7 1, cl. 2, that no action shall be brought to charge a person upon a special promise to answer for the debt, default or misdoings of another unless the promise, contract or agreement or some memorandum thereof is in writing signed by the-party to be charged, also relied on by the defendants, is wholly inapplicable on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The result is that, finding no error in the computation of the amounts or in any of the rulings of the auditor or of the court, judgment for the plaintiff is to be entered in .each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
