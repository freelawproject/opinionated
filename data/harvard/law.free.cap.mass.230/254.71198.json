'</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b280-9\">A judgment in an action of contract is not subject to reversal upon a writ of error merely because the officer\u2019s return upon the writ states that, after making a nominal attachment, he left the summons \u201cat his [the defendant\u2019s] last and usual place of abode,\u201d without adding the words \u201cknown to me to be such,\u201d the only reasonable interpretation of such a return being that the officer knew the facts to be as averred in his return, which showed a compliance with the requirements of R.

While the record fails to show that a writ of scire facias issued, and the defendant\u2019s plea was filed nearly a year after the entry of the petition, without any order of the court or consent of counsel for the plaintiff, the voluntary appearance by the defendant without objection is sufficient to confer jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>We find no assignment of error of fact, and the defendant by his plea <em>in millo est erratum, </em>admits that while the assignments of errors of law are true on the record\u201ethey are insufficient to reverse the judgment. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>206 Mass. 408. The question thus presented is one of law within the exclusive jurisdiction of the full court, and not of the court when held by a single justice. <em>Conto </em>v. <em>Silvia, </em>170 Mass. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The eight assignments are in legal intendment only different statements of the ground for reversal, that the service on the plaintiff of the writ in the original action was insufficient to give the trial court jurisdiction. The Pub. Sts. c. 161, \u00a7 31, in force when the service was made, provides, that \u201cIf the summons is not served personally on the defendant, the original or a copy, as the case may be, shall be left at bis last and usual place of abode, if he has any within the Commonwealth known to the officer; and if he has none, it shall be left with his tenant, agent, or attorney, if he has any within the Commonwealth. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The form of the return is left to the officer serving process. The only requirement is, that to be valid it must show substantial compliance with the statute. The writ described the defendant as a resident of Lynn, and the officer\u2019s return states that after making a nominal attachment he, left the summons <em>\u201c </em>at his last and usual place of abode.\u201d If the words <em>\u2018\u2018 </em>known to me as such in said Lynn \u201d had been added the present case would be governed by <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>15 Gray, 353, where the judgment was affirmed. But these words are a mere amplification. The only reasonable construction is, that the officer knew the facts to be as averred, and, as the defendant\u2019s abode on the record was at the time in this Commonwealth, the return is to be read as unequivocally meaning the last and usual place of abode of the defendant in this Commonwealth known to the officer. And when so read it is sufficient to support the judgment. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>1 Allen, 456. <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Cushman, </em>131 Mass. 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
