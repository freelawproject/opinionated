The corporation carried on the business of a partnership, consisting of the claimant and his brother. The claimant\u2019s brother was the treasurer of the corporation and owned the other half of the capital stock. A policy of insurance under the workmen\u2019s compensation act insured the brothers both as a corporation and as individuals. The policy provided that \u201cIf the subscriber is a corporation, the remuneration of the president... actually engaged ... in the personal superintendence of, the manual or mechanical operations\u2019\u2019 should not be included in the insurance unless such president\u2019s \u201centire remuneration is included in the declarations hereinafter contained and upon which the premium for this policy is computed.\u201d The remuneration received by the claimant was excluded in determining the amount of the premium. The policy had been taken out by the claimant\u2019s brother as treasurer of the corporation, and the remuneration of the claimant and his brother had been expressly excluded upon their representation '\u201cthat they were practically a partnership and owned practically all the business.\u201d The Industrial Accident Board found that the claimant was an employee and that \u201c the fact that the insurer, for any reason, did not include the earnings of the claimant in its payroll audit, has no bearing upon the rights of the claimant as an employee.\u201d An award was made by the board, which was affirmed by a decree of the Superior Court. <em>Held, </em>that the decree must be reversed and a decree entered in favor of the insurer, because, assuming that the claimant was an employee of the corporation of which he was the president, his remuneration not being included in the payroll on which the premium was based, his injury was not covered by the policy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Appeal to the Superior Court under St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 11, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 14, from a decision of the Industrial Accident Board awarding compensation to Daniel Cashman as an employee of Cashman Brothers Company, a corporation, for an injury received on May 5, 1916, by an eight ton weight falling on his leg when a chain parted in the course of the work of moving machinery to be set up in the factory of Gray and Davis, Incorporated, at Amesbury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-5\">The case was heard by <em>J.

The work was done by Cashman Brothers Company, a corporation of which the claimant was the president and a director, and of whose capital stock he owned twenty-five shares; his brother, Michael Cashman, was its treasurer and a director, and owned twenty-four shares; the remaining one share was held by their counsel. The policy of insurance under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, insured the Cashman brothers both as a corporation and as individuals. The policy provided if the subscriber was a corporation \u201cthe remuneration of the president, any vice-president, secretary or treasurer not actually engaged in connection with, or in the personal superintendence of, the manual or mechanical operations described in such declarations need not be included.\u201d The remuneration received by the claimant was excluded in determining the amount of the premium. The Industrial Accident Board found that Daniel Cashman was an employee, and \u201cthe fact that the insurer, for any reason, did not include the earnings of the claimant in its payroll audit, has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>bearing upon the rights of the claimant as an employee.\u201d Compensation was awarded him.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Assuming, but not deciding, that Daniel Cashman might have been found to be an employee under the workmen\u2019s compensation act, when he was injured he was engaged in the \u201cpersonal superintendence, of the manual or mechanical operations\u201d of the corporation. The premium paid was based on the payroll in which his remuneration was not included, and, as he was not within the terms of the policy, he cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The business of Cashman Brothers Company was conducted as a partnership. There was evidence that before the issuance of the policy other policies under the workmen\u2019s compensation act had been taken out in the name of the corporation, in which the income received by the Cashmans had not been included. Michael Cash-man had charge of the financial affairs of the concern, and the greater part if not all of the conversation regarding the policies was between him and the agents of the insurer. The remuneration of Michael and that of his brother were expressly excluded because of their objection and representation, their reason being \u201cthat they were practically a partnership and owned practically all the business.\u201d Under these circumstances the claimant, who was the president and a director of the corporation and the owner of half of its capital stock, must be presumed to have assented to the contract of insurance made by the treasurer of the corporation who also owned half of its capital stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The policy by its express terms does not cover the president while doing the work which Daniel \u2022 Cashman was doing when injured. The policy provided, \u201c This agreement shall apply only to such injuries so sustained by any person or persons in the service of the subscriber under a legal contract of hire express or implied, oral or written and whose entire remuneration is included in the declarations hereinafter contained and upon which the premium for this policy is computed; such injuries being sustained by reason of the business operations described in said declarations conducted at the places and in the manner therein described. If the subscriber is a corporation, the remuneration of the president, any vice-president, secretary or treasurer not actually engaged in connection with, or in the personal, superintendence of, the manual or mechanical operations described in such declarations need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>be included, this policy covering such officers nevertheless.\u201d The interpretation of this clause under the circumstances here disclosed is that a president, vice-president, secretary or treasurer, who is injured while actually engaged in the manual or mechanical operations of the corporation, is not included as a beneficiary under the policy, unless his remuneration has been included as the basis of the premium to be paid on the policy, and the workmen\u2019s compensation act cannot be construed so as to afford the claimant compensation contrary to this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">While insured as an individual, he was an employer and could not claim compensation as an employee. Assuming he was an employee of the corporation of which he was the president, his remuneration not being included in the payroll, it would be manifestly- unjust to require the insurer to pay him compensation. See in this connection <em>Monitor Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Buffam, </em>115 Mass. 343. In <em>Cox\u2019s Case, </em>225 Mass. 220, it was decided that with certain exceptions there mentioned, the workmen\u2019s compensation act does not permit an employer carrying on a business which is in substance one business, to become a subscriber as to one part of it and to remain a non-subscriber as to the rest. That case is not applicable to the case at bar. It follows that the decree must be reversed and a decree entered in favor of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
