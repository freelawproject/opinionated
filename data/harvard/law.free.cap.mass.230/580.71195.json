The tax deeds under which the city claims liens for taxes were dated respectively in 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912 and 1913. The city never sold the land as unredeemed land under R. L. c. 13, \u00a7 67, St. 1909, c. 490, Part II, \u00a7 68, or St. 1915, c. 237, \u00a7 20. The tax deed under which the petitioner claims title was dated July 9, 1915. ' The validity of the several deeds by which the parties acquired their respective titles is not questioned, and each one was duly executed, delivered and recorded. At the trial the respondent city asserted \u201cthat prior tax titles held by a city constitute a lien which is not extinguished by a subsequent sale for taxes, and that any decree for the petitioner in this case must be made subject to the respondent\u2019s lien.\u201d The presiding judge ruled and ordered as follows: \u201cI rule that the petitioner\u2019s title is paramount to the lien claimed by the respondent. Unless the respondent files forthwith an offer to redeem there must be a decree for the petitioner forever foreclosing and barring all rights of redemption.\u201d To this ruling the respondent excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The deeds of the collector conferred upon the city a fee and seisin subject to the right of redemption in the same manner it would upon an individual purchaser. R. L. c. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 43, 48. St. 1909, c. 490, Part II, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 49. <em>Coughlin </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>131 Mass. 56. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>2 Gray, 185, 189. The tax title is also subject to the later and paramount lien arising from taxes thereafter assessed. \u201cFor the lien of each year\u2019s tax is paramount to all previous liens.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>Keen </em>v. <em>Sheehan, </em>154 Mass. 208, 209. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Baxter, supra. Hunt </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>183 Mass. 303, 305. <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>185 Mass. 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\u25a0 The respondent does not dispute that \u201cThe rule generally stated is that a sale of land for a valid tax gives a paramount title, free from the ownership or incumbrance of rights previously existing which had been carved out of the property by an owner, or which had been acquired in it by prescription or otherwise,\u201d Knowlton, C. J., in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Boston, supra, </em>and cases cited, but contends that the rule is not applicable where a municipality holds the earlier tax title. In support thereof it relies upon St. 1909, c. 490, Part II, \u00a7 67, as amended by St. 1915, c. 237, \u00a7 19, which reads: \u201cIf land is taken or purchased by a city or town, taxes shall,- until foreclosure of the title so acquired, be assessed thereon as though the same were not so taken or purchased; and shall be deducted from the proceeds of the final sale; \u201d also, upon St. 1915, c. 237, \u00a7 18, which reads: \u201cAfter the foreclosure by a city or town of the rights of redemption under a tax title or taking, as hereinabove provided, the land shall thereafter be held and disposed of like any land belonging to it and held for municipal purposes, and shall not while so held be assessed for taxes; \u201d also, upon St. 1909, c. 490, Part II, \u00a7 68, as amended by St. 1915, c. 237, \u00a7 20, which provides for the sale of unredeemed land \u201cwithin two years after the time for redemption has expired, . . . ; and if, from any cause, such sale shall not be made within two years, it shall be made by the collector when he deems best or at once upon the service upon him of a written demand of any person interested therein. . . . He [the collector] shall deduct from the proceeds of said sale the expense thereof, the amount named in the collector\u2019s deed. . . . The balance shall be deposited with the city or town treasurer to be paid to the person entitled to the land, if demanded within five years. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">: It is true that the title conveyed by the deed of the collector is held by a municipality \u201c as security for the repayment of the purchase price\u201d until redemption or until the right of redemption is foreclosed in the manner provided by St. 1915, c. 237, \u00a7\u00a7 4 to 9 inclusive, but it is equally true that under the same statutory provisions the title of an individual purchaser is held as security until foreclosure of the right of redemption. The statute above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>quoted relating to the -sale of unredeemed land taken or purchased by a municipality, does not affect the validity or quality of the title acquired by it as a purchaser at a tax sale, and was intended only to define the method by which a municipality should dispose of its tax titles and account to the former owner, or person entitled to the land, for any surplus remaining after deducting \u201cfrom the proceeds of said sale the expense thereof, the amount named in the collector\u2019s deed or instrument of taking as due when the same was executed, all interest, charges and subsequent taxes and assessments thereon.\u201d <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>224 Mass. 261, 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The argument of the respondent that \u201cThe municipality would lose its taxes unless it sells the land as unredeemed land before the expiration of two years from the purchase by an individual of a subsequent tax title,\u201d is unsound, because if it redeems from that lien it could deduct the amount paid as a subsequent tax from the proceeds of the sale of the unredeemed land. We are of opinion the lien of a tax deed as security for the repayment of the purchase price, is paramount to all previous tax liens acquired by municipalities or individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">The ruling of the judge of the Land Court was right, and the exception thereto is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
