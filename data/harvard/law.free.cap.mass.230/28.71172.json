Grant. Writ of scire facias dated February 26, 1915.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Hitchcock, </em>J. At the trial the plaintiffs introduced in evidence the bill in equity, which was filed on July 15, 1914, and in which Florence J. Grant was described as of Freeport, in the county of Cumberland and State of Maine, and these plaintiffs were described as of Boston, Massachusetts. On the back of the bill, in the defendant\u2019s handwriting, was the following indorsement: \u201cFrom the office of J. C. Johnston, 421 Tremont Building,\u201d he being an attorney at law. The plaintiffs also showed that on November 30, 1914, a final decree was entered dismissing the bill with costs amounting to $63.61. The plaintiffs also introduced in evidence the execution for the costs issued against Florence J. Grant in behalf of the plaintiffs in this action, the execution being dated December 21, 1914, and returned to court on February 24, 1915, by one Gast, who was admitted to be a duly qualified constable of Boston, and who indorsed on the execution the following return: \u201cSuffolk, ss. Boston, February 19, 1915. By virtue of this execution, on the 31st day of December, 1914, and again on the 1st day of January, 1915, and again on the 15th day of February, 1915, I made diligent search for the goods, chattels, or lands of the within named Florence J. Grant, the judgment debtor, but could find none within my precinct; I therefore return this execution to court in no part satisfied.\u201d No demand ever was made upon Florence J. Grant for the amount of the execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">There was evidence from which the jury could find that Florence J. Grant resided continuously in Boston from the date of the issuance of the execution until the time of her death in September, 1916; and that during all that time she was the owner of an equity in real estate in Freeport in the county of Cumberland and State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>of Maine. There was evidence that this was worth $500. There was no\" other evidence upon-the question of her financial ability to pay the execution except the officer\u2019s return in the suit of Grant against Bird et al. The plaintiffs offered in evidence a sealed envelope with a post office date stamped thereon, addressed to Florence J. Grant, 554 Columbus Avenue, Boston, alleged to contain a letter to her, bearing upon its face a statement to the effect that the letter was unclaimed and that the addressee could'not be found and that the letter was returned to the writer. There was no evidence offered as to who stamped on the envelope the statement that the addressee could not be found. The defendant excepted to the admission of the envelope in evidence. The plaintiff Hopwood was allowed to testify that he wrote and sent the letter and to the contents of the letter alleged to be contained in the envelope, although he admitted that he had made a copy thereof and did not know where the copy was, but was permitted to testify that the letter inside the envelope was a demand upon Mrs. Grant for the payment of the execution. The defendant excepted to the admission of this testimony. A witness called by the plaintiffs testified that he had called at the home of Florence J. Grant at 554 Columbus Avenue and had seen one Mrs. Saulnier. Against the objection of the defendant he was allowed to testify that Mrs. Saulnier told him that Mrs. Grant was not there and that she did not know where she was. This was offered to contradict Mrs. Saulnier\u2019s testimony that at that time Mrs. Grant boarded at her house, also to show the efforts made by the plaintiffs to find Mrs. Grant. The defendant excepted to the admission of this testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-5\">The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-6\"><em>\u201c1. </em>That, unless it appears that the plaintiff in the suit in equity brought by Florence J.

Grant, the plaintiff in the original bill in equity, was therein described as of Freeport in the county of Cumberland and State of Maine. By placing his name on the back of the bill the present defendant, John C. Johnston, became an indorser for costs under R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 39. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>1 Allen, 402. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>183 Mass. 102. This writ of scire facias against the indorser is based upon the record in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>original suit, and the record in that suit is conclusive against him in this proceeding. It was not open to him to show that Florence J. Grant was an inhabitant of this Commonwealth at the time when she filed her bill in equity; and the first answer of the jury' must be disregarded. This disposes of the requests for instructions numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 10 and 11. <em>M\u2019Gee </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>14 Pick. 212. <em>Sherburne </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>142 Mass. 141. <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>148 Mass. 348, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">A final decree dismissing the bill with costs was entered in the original suit. The statute made the indorser liable for the costs, as surety, \u201cin case of avoidance or inability .of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Ruggles </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>6 Mass. 494. The officer\u2019s return on the execution, that he \u201cmade diligent search for the goods, chattels, or lands of the within named Florence J. Grant, the judgment,debtor, but could find none within my [his] precinct,\u201d was some evidence of such \u201cavoidance or inability;\u201d and the jury specially found that she was unable to pay the amount of the execution for costs. This renders the sixth, seventh and eighth requests immaterial; and the ninth was rightly refused. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Whithead, </em>1 Allen, 276. <em>Wixon </em>v. Lapham, 5 Allen, 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">No exception was taken to the instructions given by the presiding judg\u00e9, and it is to be assumed that the subject matter of the fifth, twelfth and thirteenth requests Was dealt with properly. The liability of the indorser was established by the special finding <em>' </em>of the jury, that the judgment debtor was unable to pay the costs, and there was no error in directing a verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">It is apparent from the answers of the jury that the defendant was not harmed by the evidence as to the registered letter addressed to Mrs.- Grant. The evidence of statements made by Mrs. Saulnier was competent for the limited purpose for which it was admitted. It follows that the entry must be</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
