Taylor, late of Haverhill, for instructions in regard to the proper distribution of the testator\u2019s estate to be made under the ninth and residuary clause of his will, which is quoted in full in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-15\">The Probate Court made the following decree: \u201cThat it was not the intention of said testator to give a beneficial interest in the property disposed of under said ninth clause of said will to the petitioners; but that he intended that they should receive said property upon a trust which the court finds is not sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>defined to be carried into effect. The petitioners received said property therefore under a resulting trust for Matthew H. Taylor, Martin Taylor and Louisa J. Foster, the heirs at law and next of kin of said testator, and the petitioners should make distribution thereof among said persons or their legal representatives in the same proportions in which they would have been entitled to intestate property of the testator.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\">William E.

Taylor disposed of the residue of his estate in these words: \u201cAll the remainder of my estate both real and personal of which I may die seized and possessed, and to which I may in any way be entitled at the time of my decease, I give, bequeath and devise to my executors and trustees, in whose honesty and discretion I have reposed especial trust and confidence, for certain purposes which I have made known to them. And I hereby authorize and empower my said executors to make such distribution and division of my estate as I have indicated to them, and as they shall deem proper for the fulfillment of my wishes so well known to them, relying entirely'upon their judgment in the premises.\u201d The executors contend that no trust was created by this clause, that there was an absolute gift of the residue to them. In the Probate Court it was held that the executors received the property upon a trust which was too indefinite to be carried into effect, and that a trust resulted for the heirs at law and next of kin of the testator; from this decree the executors appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">If \u2018the words expressing trust and confidence in the honesty and discretion of the trustees and executors, and reliance \u201cupon their judgment in the premises,\u201d were omitted from the residuary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>clause, it probably would be undisputed that the testator did not intend an absolute gift to the trustees and executors, but to create a trust of the residue of his estate to be disposed of, they being authorized and empowered \u201cto make such distribution and division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEK\">The words expressing trust and confidence in the executors and trustees did not show that the executors were to take the property absolutely as their own. These words are merely expressions of confidence that the trustees will carry out the trust and distribute the property and divide the estate according to the wishes of the testator \u2014 already \u201cmade known to them,\u201d \u2014 according to their best judgment. The gift was not to the petitioners by name, but was <em>a </em>gift to them as trustees and executors of the testator\u2019s will; and he clearly manifested his intention to give the estate to them for certain purposes, although they were to use their own best judgment in its distribution, and as they thought proper for the fulfilment of his wishes. <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>214 Mass. 192. <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>189 Mass. 176 and cases cited. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>130 Mass. 211.</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">In <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>173 Mass. 97, there was an outright gift of the estate, and the words of recommendation, confidence and desire were not intended by the testator to cut down this absolute and unrestricted character of the gift. See <em>Durant </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>159 Mass. 229; <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>172 Mass. 101; <em>Pitts </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>192 Mass. <em>88; Poor </em>v. <em>Bradbury, </em>196 Mass. 207.</p>\n<p id=\"ASO\">Although a trust was attempted to be created by the will of the deceased, it was not a charitable trust, and, not being sufficiently definite, it cannot be executed. The judge of probate, therefore, was right in deciding that the residue should go to Matthew H. Taylor, Martin Taylor and Louisa J. Foster, \u201cthe heirs at law and next of kin of said testator, and the petitioners should make distribution thereof among said persons or their legal representatives in the same proportions in which they would have been entitled to intestate property of the testator.\u201d <em>Olliffe </em>v. <em>Wells, </em>130 Mass. 221. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>207 Mass. 198. <em>Davison </em>v. <em>Wyman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABS\">Decree of the Probate Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AUt\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
