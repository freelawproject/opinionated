The prayers of the bill were for a determination of the validity of the mortgage to Melkon, a declaration of the invalidity of the foreclosure sale and, if the mortgage were proved to be valid, that the plaintiff might be permitted to redeem.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-8\">The suit was referred to a master \u201cto hear the parties and their evidence and report his findings to the court together with such facts and questions of law as either party may request.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWrL\">The plaintiff filed twenty objections and exceptions to the master\u2019s report. The twentieth exception was to the exclusion of the following testimony, offered by the plaintiffs in rebuttal on the issue whether the plaintiffs had notice of the foreclosure proceedings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-11\">The plaintiffs offered to prove in rebuttal, that Arakel Ananian, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>one of the plaintiffs., after he had received the newspaper from the witness Rugg, and on the same day, went to see one Caragulian at the latter\u2019s home on Mount Auburn Street in Watertown, and that the said Caragulian would testify that Arakel Ananian did call on him on this particular Sunday with the newspaper given to Arakel by Mr. Rugg. That Arakel Ananian was in an excited and nervous state at the time; that Mr. Caragulian took charge of the matter. On the following day, which was Monday, he and Mr. Ananian consulted Mr. Sevasly, of counsel for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ai\">The witness Rugg would testify that, sometime in the latter part of April, or early in May, he was passing by the building on Coolidge Hill Road and saw one of the plaintiffs watching the property. The witness said to the plaintiff, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The plaintiff answered, \u201cI am watching the property.\u201d The witness then said, \u201cYou are watching somebody else\u2019s property because I see by the paper that it has been foreclosed.\u201d The plaintiff then said that neither he nor his brother knew anything about it, and the witness told him to send his brother to him and that he would tell him all that he knew. On the following Sunday, which was a day or two after the conversation above set forth, Arakel Ananian, one of the plaintiffs, called to see the witness Rugg, and the witness informed him of the foreclosure. The witness looked for the papers in which the foreclosure notice had appeared. He found three copies of the newspaper, of which he gave one to Arakel Ananian. Arakel Ananian expressed surprise at what happened and said that he knew nothing about it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b350-5\">The exceptions were heard by <em>Hardy, </em>J., who filed a memorandum reading as follows: \u201cThe fourteenth exception is sustained.

The case was referred to a master who found that the mortgage was given for a valuable consideration and was not obtained through fraud or misrepresentation; that the plaintiffs had notice of the foreclosure proceedings and could have protected their interest in the property if they so desired; that a proper notice of sale was published as required by law, and that the proceedings were in accordance with the requirements of the statute. He further found that the defendant Arakil was a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for value at the foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">In the Superior Court the judge filed a memorandum overruling all the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions to the master\u2019s report except the fourteenth, and an interlocutory decree was entered sustaining this exception. The case was recommitted to the master to report, without further testimony, certain material evidence submitted to him at the hearing. No appeal was taken from the interlocutory decree. The master then made a supplemental report, and the final decree was entered confirming the report as submitted and ordering that the bill be dismissed) from which the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">The interlocutory decree, sustaining but one of the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions, was not appealed from; even if the exceptions were before us, see <em>Craig </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>216 Mass. 386, we find no reversible error in the conduct of the hearing. Many of the exceptions are to the master\u2019s refusal to report certain evidence and to his findings of fact. Under the reference he was not required to report the evidence, <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>214 Mass. 29, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>224 Mass. 173; and where it is not reported his findings are conclusive, <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>189 Mass. 353, 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The master excluded certain testimony offered by the plaintiffs in rebuttal, tending to show that one of the plaintiffs made statements consistent with those made at the hearing; the plaintiffs excepted. According to the memorandum of the presiding judge this, was one of. the exceptions intended by him to be overruled. But even if it were before us, the master was right in excluding the testimony: the statement of a witness made out of court, cannot be used to corroborate his testimony before the master. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>10 Gray, <em>485. </em>The evidence was not admissible within the exception to this rule allowing such evidence to be introduced where an attempt is made to impeach the witness, or where it is sought to discredit him by showing that his testimony was of recent invention or he was unduly influenced to testify as he did. See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>188 Mass. 475; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>211 Mass. 86 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\">We discover no error in the notice of foreclosure. This case may be one of hardship for the plaintiffs; but according to the findings of the master, they were fully notified of the' foreclosure proceedings and had ample opportunity to protect their rights, and, there was evidence to support this conclusion. We cannot review the master\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
