There was no averment of a return or of a tender back of the money paid by defendant. Upon the opening by plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the trial a motion was made to dismiss the complaint on the ground that it did not state a cause of action ; plaintiff\u2019s counsel thereupon offered to prove that she was misled by EI.\u2019s representations and induced thereby to execute the satisfaction and release as alleged in the complaint, and that such representations were false. This offer was excluded, although no objection was made to it by defendant. The motion to dismiss was granted \u201c on the opening, * * * and on the ground that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\u201d <em>Held, </em>error; that while the sum paid by the defendant should be taken into account in the award of relief, an offer to restore it was not a condition precedent to bringing the action.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b586-6\">(Argued June 19, 1891;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A3pb\">decided October 6, 1891.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-7\">Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the Court of Common Pleas for the city and county of Hew York, entered upon an order made May 9, 1889, which affirmed a judgment in favor of defendant entered upon a decision of the court on trial at Special Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-8\">This was an action to procure the cancellation of a satisfaction of a judgment upon the ground that it was obtained by fraud and for other relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b586-9\">The material facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b586-10\"><em>Hector M.

Courts of equity will always interpose to grant relief where settlements, contracts, agreements and even judgments have been obtained by means of fraud, misrepresentations and deceit.

It is ordinary, practice to dismiss a complaint on the opening of the plaintiffs attorney or counsel, when he undertakes to state all the facts, as was done in the case at bar, upon which the plaintiff relies, and upon which alone such plaintiff rests the supposed cause of action, if such statement shows that the plaintiff has no cause of action. <em>(Tooker </em>v. <em>Arnoux, </em>76 N. Y. 397; <em>Scofield </em>v. <em>Whitelegge, </em>49 id. 259; <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>37 id. 640.) The complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and should have been dismissed. <em>(Farrington </em>v. <em>Ballard, </em>40 Barb. 513, 516; <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Hacker, </em>51 How.

Y. 398, 404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">This court has also held that where, after the plaintiff has opened his case, the complaint is dismissed on the ground that it states no cause of action, it must be treated on appeal as if it had been demurred to and that the sole question to be considered \u2022 is whether it sufficiently states a cause of action. <em>(Sheridan </em>v. Jackson, 72 N. Y. 170, 172.) In the Supreme Court the practice has been laid down by the learned judges of the General Term in the first department, as follows: <em>\u201c </em>There is no finding of facts or conclusions of law in the court below; no part of the opening of counsel is given; the dismissal of the complaint must, therefore, be regarded as made upon the ground that the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, because we must assume that the counsel in his opening stated substantially the same facts alleged in the complaint.\u201d <em>(Linde </em>v. <em>Bensel, </em>22 Hun, 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The opening in behalf 'of the plaintiff is a brief statement of the nature of the action, the issues to be tried and the facts that he expects to prove. <em>(Tisdale </em>v. <em>President, etc., </em>116 N. Y. 416, 419; <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Chamberlin, </em>31 id. 611, 614; <em>Ayrault </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>33 Barb. 229, 233.) As the proof must conform to the pleadings, it is reasonable to presume that when such statement is not set forth in the appeal-book it followed the pleading under which it was made. It cannot be assumed, even to support a judgment on appeal, that the opening contained either a fatal admission or anything inconsistent with the allegations of the complaint, as that would be opposed to its nature and a departure from the usual practice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>We think that where the opening of the plaintiff does not appear in the appeal-book, it should be presumed to comprise the substance of the complaint, and that any offer to prove made in connection with the opening, unless objected to as inadmissible under the pleadings, should also be regarded as a part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The substance of the complaint in question is that the plaintiff, having recovered a judgment against the defendant Healy that was a hen upon certain lands belonging to him, was induced to satisfy the same and countermand an execution issued thereon by the false and fraudulent representations made to her by said\" Healy with intent to deceive; that he was a member of a certain mercantile firm carrying on business in the city of Hew York and had a lucrative interest therein that would soon enable him to pay said judgment, and that if the recovery of said judgment became known to his copartners they would dissolve the firm, eject him from the business and entail upon him financial ruin. She further alleged that being misled by such misrepresentations, she <em>\u201c </em>consented to comply with his request upon condition that he would pay her attorney his fees in said action, which he did,\u201d and that \u201c relying upon the truth of said representations and trusting to his promises to pay said judgment,\u201d she gave him <em>\u201c </em>a general release and satisfaction \u201d of the same \u201c without receiving any consideration therefor whatsoever ; \u201d that Healy failed to pay and had no property, except his interest in said premises. She demanded that the release and satisfaction be canceled and the judgment restored as a valid hen with leave to issue execution to enforce the same against said Healy. Hpon the. trial, after the motion to dismiss was made, the counsel for the plaintiff offered to prove that she \u201c was misled by these false representations and thereby induced to execute the satisfaction piece and the release as alleged in the complaint, and that at the time these representations were made Healy was not interested in said firm, and that those allegations made by him were false.\u201d Ho objection was made by the defendant to the offer to prove, but the court did not permit the proof to be given and an exception was taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>to the ruling. When the complaint and offer are construed together, according to the rule already announced, every fact appears that is essential to a cause of action to set aside a written instrument upon the ground that it was procured by fraud. Those facts, briefly stated, are that the plaintiff was induced to sign the paper in question by false statements made to her by the defendant with intent to deceive. A complaint that sets forth successful deception intentionally practiced by the defendant upon the plaintiff to his injury, alleges a good, cause of action, according to all the authorities. <em>(Brackett </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>112 N. Y. 454, 467; <em>Arthur </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>55 id. 400, 410 ; <em>State of Michigan </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix </em>Bank, 33 id. 9, 25.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Even if reliance is placed upon the mere promises of the defendant,ras well as upon his false representations, still a cause of action for fraud may be maintained, provided the representations had a material effect in accomplishing the deception. <em>(Addington </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>11 Wend. 375 ; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Stine, </em>8 Bosw. 157 ; <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>22 Pick. 48 ; Cooley on Torts, 502.) It is not necessary that they should be the sole inducing cause. The cases cited by the defendant to the effect that fraud cannot be founded solely upon a promise not performed, even if the promisor never intended to fulfill, are, therefore, not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The main ground upon which this appeal is resisted is the failure to allege any return dr tender of the money paid by the defendant to the attorney for the plaintiff in the former action. Even if this point were otherwise tenable, it is doubtful whether it could be successfully taken here, because the motion to dismiss was not based upon that ground, and even if it had been, the defect, if any, might have been cured by amendment. A more satisfactory answer, however, may be found in the principle that one who attempts to rescind a transaction on the ground of fraud is not required to restore that which in any event he would be entitled to retain either by virtue of the contract sought to be set aside, or of the original liability. <em>(Fisher </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>108 N. Y. 25, 30; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Cayuga Co. Nat. Bank, </em>86 id. 75, 81; <em>Gucken</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number><em>heimer </em>v. Angevine, 81 id. 394 ; <em>Allerton </em>v. Allerton, 50 id. 670; <em>Nichols </em>v. Michael, 23 id. 264; <em>Imp. </em>&amp; <em>Trad. Bank </em>v. Peters, 21 N. Y. S. R. 98, 102; 123 N. Y. 273 ; <em>Pierce </em>v. Wood, 23 N. H. 519, 534; Hay v. Hay, 13 Hun, 315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">While the sum retained should be taken into account in the award\u2019 of relief, an offer to restore it is not a condition precedenkto-the bringing of an action to set aside the fraudulent release. Assuming, as we do, for the purpose of this appeal, that all the allegations of the complaint are true, the plaintiff would be entitled to retain the costs that she indirectly received, whatever might be the result of her action for a rescission, ( <em>Vail </em>v. Reynolds, 118 N. Y. 297, 302.) If her action failed, she was entitled to the sum received by virtue of the transaction itself. If she succeeded, the sum was less than she was concededly entitled to- by the original judgment. In any event, therefore, she had only that which, without dispute, belonged t'a her, and a restoration,, or the offer thereof, was unnecessary prior to the commencement of the action, for such conditions as might be essential to the protection of the defendant could be inserted in the judgment ultimately rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">For these reasons, we think that the court below erred in its disposition of the case, and that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the final award of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
