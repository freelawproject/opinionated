Subsequent to the date on which defendant agreed to refrain from manufacturing and selling, and within five years from the date of the contract, two of her said agents sold cheese having the same name and substantially' the same trade-marks as that sold by defendant to plaintiffs, which was not manufactured by them, but was a similar product to that formerly so manufactured. In an action for an alleged breach of said covenant, <em>held, </em>that it was not opposed to public policy as in restraint of trade; that it was not confined to defendant\u2019s personal acts, but covered as well those of her agents; and that, as the actual damages for a breach of the covenant would he wholly uncertain and incapable of being ascertained except by conjecture, it was the intent of the parties to liquidate them when they named $5,000 \u201c as stipulated damages,\u201d and plaintiffs were entitled to recover that amount; that the use of the word \u201cpenalty\u201d was not, under the circumstances, controlling.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b510-16\">(Argued June 12, 1891;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AV_y\">decided October 6, 1891.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the Supreme Court in the second judicial department, entered upon an order made February 11, 1889, which affirmed a judgment in favor of plaintiffs entered upon a decision of the court on trial without a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-6\">This was an action to recover the' sum of $5,000 as stipulated damages for breach of covenant</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-7\">On the 15th of October, 1884, the defendant owned a cheese factory situate in the town of Monroe, Orange county, comprising two parcels of land with the buildings thereon and a quantity \"of fixtures, machinery and tools connected therewith. For some time prior, with the assistance of her husband, Conrad Gross, her brother-in-law, August Gross, and her father, John Hoffman, she had been engaged in the business of manufacturing cheeses at said factory known as Fromage de Brie, Fromage d\u2019Isigny and Neufchatel. Such cheeses were made by a secret process, known only to herself and her said agents. On the day last named, she entered into a sealed agreement with the plaintiffs whereby she agreed to sell and transfer to them the said factory and all its belongings, together with the \u201c good will, custom, trade-marks and names used in and belonging to the said business,\u201d for the sum of $25,000, to be paid and secured March 1, 1885, when possession was to be given.

She had the right to continue the business, and, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>keeping her secret, to enjoy its benefits to any practicable extent. She also had the right to sell the business, including as an essential part thereof the secret process, and, in order to place the purchasers in the same position that she occupied, to promise to divulge the secret to them alone and to keep it from everyone else. In no other way could she sell what she had and get what it was worth. Having the right to make this promise, she also had the right to make it good to her vendees and to protect them by covenants with proper safeguards against the consequences of any violation. Such a contract simply left matters substantially as they were before the sale, except that the seller of the secret had agreed that she would not destroy its value after she had received full value for it. The covenant was not in general restraint of trade, but was a reasonable measure of mutual protection to the parties, as it enabled the one to sell at the highest price and the other to get what they paid for. It imposed no restriction upon either that was not beneficial to the other by enhancing the price to the seller or protecting the purchaser. Recent cases make it very clear that such an agreement is not opposed to public policy, even if the restriction was unlimited as to both time and territory. <em>(Diamond Match Co. </em>v. <em>Roeber, </em>106 N. T. 473; <em>Hodge </em>v.<em> Sloan, </em>107 id. 244; <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>Lorillard, </em>110 id. 519, 534; <em>Watertown Thermometer Co. </em>v. <em>Pool, </em>51 Hun, 157.) The restriction under consideration, however, was not unlimited as to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The chief reliance of the defendant in this court, where the point seems to have been raised for the first time, is that the covenant, so far as stipulated damages are concerned, is confined to the personal acts of Mrs. Gross, and does not embrace the acts of her agents. A careful reading of the agreement, however, in the light of the circumstances surrounding the parties when it was made, shows that no such result was intended. What was the object of the covenant ? It was to keep secret at all hazards the process upon which the success of the business depended. On no other basis could the plaintiffs safely buy or the defendant sell for what her property was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u25a0worth. Who had the power to keep the process secret? Clearly the defendant, if anyone, as she had confided it to no one except her trusted agents, who were nearly related to her by blood or marriage. But could she covenant against the acts of those over whom she had no control ? She had the \u2022right to so covenant by assuming the risk of their actions, and unless she had done so, presumptively, she could not have sold \u25a0her factory for so large a sum. It was safer for her to sell with such a covenant than it was for the plaintiffs to buy without it. She could exercise some power over her own husband and her father and her husband\u2019s brother, all of whom had been associated with her in carrying on the business, and whose actions in certain other respects she assumed to control for a limited time, whereas the plaintiffs were powerless unless they had her promise to keep the process secret at the peril of paying heavily if she did not. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the restrictive part of the covenant applies with the same force to her agents that it does to herself, for she undertakes that neither she nor they will disclose the secret or engage in maiding or selling either kind of cheese, or use the trade-marks or names connected with the business. We do not think that a personal act of the defendant is essential to a violation of this covenant by her, for if she permits, or even does' not prevent her agents from doing the prohibited acts, the promise is broken. While it is her exclusive covenant, it relates to the action of others, and if they do what she agreed -that they would not do, it is a breach by her, although not her own act. She violated her agreement, not by selling herself, but by not preventing others from selling. This construction \u00a9f the restrictive part of the covenant would hardly be open to question were it not that in the same sentence occurs the reparative or compensatory part designed to make the plaintiffs whole, if the defendant either could not or did not keej) her agreement. While this provides that any violation involves the penalty of $5,000, it adds, \u201c which sum is hereby \u25a0named as stipulated damages to be paid\u201d by the defendant in case of a violation by her of the covenant in question. What <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>kind of violation is thus referred to <em>% </em>The defendant says a personal violation by her only, but we think, for the reasons already given, that the spirit of the agreement includes both a violation by her own act, and by the act of those whom she did not prevent from selling, although she had agreed that they would not sell. As no one not a party to a contract can violate it, every act of defendant\u2019s former agents contrary to her covenant was a violation thereof by her, whether she knew of it or assented to it or not. Whenever that was done which she agreed should not be done, it was a breach of a covenant by her, even if the act was contrary to her wishes and in spite of her efforts to prevent it. Her covenant was against a certain act by any one of four persons, including herself. Two of those persons separately did the act which she had agreed that neither of them should do, and thus there was a violation of the covenant by her the same as if she had done the act in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The argument of the learned counsel for the defendant that the contract fixed a sum to be paid in case of a violation by the defendant, but not in case of a violation \u201cby the other parties,\u201d while plausible, is unsound, for there were no \u201c other parties \u201d who could break the covenant. She was the sole covenantor, and unless she kept the covenant she broke it, and she did not keep it.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">As the actual damages for a breach of the covenant would necessarily be \u201c wholly uncertain and incapable of being ascertained, except by conjecture,\u201d we think that the parties intended to liquidate them when they provided that the sum named should be \u201c as stipulated damages.\u201d The use of the word penalty under the circumstances is not controlling. <em>(Bagley </em>v. Peddie, 16 N. Y. 469; <em>Dakin </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>17 Wend. 448; affirming 22 id. 201; <em>Wooster </em>v. Kisch, 26 Hun, 61.)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">As there is no other question that requires discussion, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">All concur, except Brown, J., not sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
