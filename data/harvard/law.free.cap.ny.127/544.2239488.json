On the date mentioned she and one Herman Gierke entered into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>written contract by which she covenanted to sell and he to purchase the premises for $70,000. Gierke also covenanted to complete, on or before October 1, 1887, six dwelling-houses, then\u2019begun on the south part of the lands, in a style specified in the contract and costing at least $6,000 each. The defendant covenanted to advance Gierke $21,000, payable by installments as the work progressed, to aid in the erection of the buildings. It was mutually covenanted that when the houses were completed the defendant would convey the land to Gierke, and that he, concurrently therewith, would give his bonds to secure the payment of the purchase-price (870,000) and the $21,000 to be advanced, secured by mortgages on the juemises. The contract contained the following provision: \u201c And it is agreed that should any mechanic\u2019s lien be filed against the property herein described during the progress of' said buildings or against any part-thereof. * * * Such mechanic\u2019s lien * * * shall be subsequent to the liens and claims of the party of the first part (Sarah F.

Mead), be withheld until such lien or liens shall be removed and discharged of record, or said party of the first part may, at her option, apply such payments or advances to the payment and discharge thereof, or said party of the first part (Sarah F. Mead) may, at her option, in the case of a mechanic\u2019s lien, deposit an amount sufficient to cover said hen or liens, or give security under the statute and contest the same at the cost and expense of the party of the second part (Herman Gierke), and deduct the same from said payments or advances ; and the said party of the first part (Sarah F.

On the 20th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>of June, 1887, David Miller (the plaintiff) and Grippentrog entered into a written contract, by which Grippentrog contracted to furnish stone for the completion of the buildings \u25a0 for $9,060, under which, prior to January 24, 1888, the plaintiff furnished stone of the value of $1,500 and the price thereof not being paid, a lien was filed on the 24tli of January, 1888, pursuant to chapter 342 of the Laws of 1885, to foreclose which this action was brought. Upon the trial the court found that the plaintiff had furnished under the contract stone used in the buildings of the value of $1,500, which was adjudged to be due, 'and a judgment was entered foreclosing the lien, with costs; from which the defendant appealed to the General Term, where it was affirmed; and thereupon the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-6\">Further facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b576-7\"><em>E N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1O\">It is provided by chapter 342 of the Laws of 1885 \u2014 the general Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of this state \u2014 as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">\u201c \u00a7 1. Any person * * * who shall, hereafter perform any labor or service, or furnish any materials which have been used, or which are to be used in erecting, altering or repairing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>any house, * \"x\" * with the consent of the owner as here, inafter defined, or his agent, or any contractor or subcontractor, or any other person contracting with such owner to erect, alter or improve, as aforesaid, within any of the cities or counties of this state, may * * * have a lien for the principal and interest of the price and value of such * * * material upon such house * * * and upon the lot * * * upon which the same may stand, or be intended to stand, to the extent of the right, title and interest at that time existing of such owner, whether owner in fee or of a less estate, * * * or of the owner of any right, title or interest in such estate, which may be sold under an execution.\u201d * * * \u201c In cases in which the owner has made an agreement to sell and convey the premises to the contractor, or other person, such owner shall be deemed to be the owner, within the intent and meaning of this act, until the deed has been actually delivered and recorded conveying said premises pursuant to such agreement.\u201d (\u00a7 5.-)</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">The parts of the statute above quoted have been recently construed by the Court of Appeals in <em>Schmalz </em>v. <em>Mead </em>(125 N. Y. 188, which affirms 15 Daly, 223), the facts of which were as follows: The defendant, the owner in fee of the land (the same land involved in the case at bar), contracted, in \u00a1November, 1885, to sell and convey it to George Kuhn for an agreed price, and to advance to the vendee a certain sum in installments to enable him to erect buildings of a kind agreed to thereon. The vendor covenanted \"that when the buildings were completed he would convey the land and take the grantee\u2019s bond, secured by a mortgage on the land, for the payment of the purchase-price and the sum to be advanced for building purposes. Under this contract the vendee entered into possession and began the erection of the buildings, but soon failed and abandoned his purchase. The vendor had performed her part of the contract, and no advances were due from her when the hen for materials furnished the vendee was filed or foreclosed. The vendor defended the action to foreclose the lien on the grounds: (1) That the contract of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>sale and for the erection of buildings was not sufficient evidence of the owner\u2019s, vendor\u2019s, consent within the statutory meaning of <em>\u201c </em>the consent of the owner \u201d that the buildings be erected. (2) That only the interest of George Kuhn, vendee, and contractor, could be subjected to liens. (3) That the lien could attach only to advances due from her, if any, and not to her interest as vendor in the real estate. These defenses were overruled and the lien was held to attach and bind the vendor\u2019s interest in the realty. <em>Schmalz </em>v. <em>Mead </em>differs from the case at bar only in the fact that the contract of sale and for building did not contain the stipulation contained in the agreement under consideration and quoted in the statement of facts, that if any mechanic\u2019s lien was filed it should be subject to the lien and claim of the vendor. The defendant\u2019s relation to and interest in the land constituted. her the owner thereof within the meaning of the word <em>\u201c </em>owner \u201d as defined in the fifth section of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law. <em>(Schmalz </em>v. <em>Mead, supra.) </em>And her estate could be subjected to the liens of persons furnishing labor or materials for the construction of buildings erected thereon with her consent. By the contract entered into May 25, 1887, between Mrs. Mead, then the owner of the fee, and Gierke, and by him assigned to Grippentrog with her consent, she not only agreed to sell and thereafter convey the land, but bound the vendee to build within a specified time six houses according to plans which had been agreed on, to cost not less than $6,000 each, she agreeing to advance $21,000 for the purpose of partly paying the cost of their erection; which contract was proof of her (the owner\u2019s) consent that the buildings be erected, and rendered her interest in the premises subject to such liens as might be filed for labor and materials furnished for -the construction of the houses, unless in some way relieved from liability by the stipulation that any mechanic\u2019s lien should be subject to her interest in the property. <em>(Schmalz </em>v. <em>Mead, supra; Rollin </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>45 N. Y. 766; <em>Husted </em>v. <em>Mathes, </em>77 id. 388 ; <em>Burkitt </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>79 id. 273; <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Dodd, </em>90 id. 336.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The stipulation in respect to the priority of liens did not destroy the owner\u2019s consent that the houses should be built, nor diminish its effect, nor did it lessen the absolute obligation resting upon the vendee to build them. It was not the design of the parties to accomplish any such results, but simply to circumvent the statute and defeat the rights given by it to persons furnishing labor and materials for the work, which design could not be accomplished by such a stipulation as against persons not in privity with either of the parties to it who should, without notice of the stipulation, furnish labor or materials for the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
