H. </em>Brodie, for Appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-11\">The assessments were void, because the property of the See Tup Company was wrongly assessed, in th\u00e1t an alley eight feet front on Pine Street by one hundred and thirty-seven and one-half feet deep was added to it, which was neither owned, possessed, nor claimed by said company, nor by these defendants; but over it they had the right of way only, and their recorded deed showed it. (3 Kent\u2019s Com. 419.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-12\">The Assessor has no power to join in one assessment two pieces of land owned by different persons. (Stat. 1859, 346, Sec. 3; <em>Terrill </em>v. <em>Graves et al., </em>18 Cal 149; <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>36 Me., 433 ; Blackwell on Tax Titles, 175, 176.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-13\">1st. By such an assessment A would be made to pay B\u2019s debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-14\">2d. Such an assessment is beyond the Assessor\u2019s power, because it might deprive the property owner of his right to designate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>collector the piece he wishes sold, should less than the whole suffice to pay the taxes, which right the statute secures to him. (Stat. 1857, 332, Sec. 17.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-4\">3d. An assessment joining A\u2019s land with that of B, would be void further, because if A should designate to the collector B\u2019s land as the piece to be sold, if less than the whole be taken, and B should designate A\u2019s land, the collector could not sell at all, because it is only when the owner fails to designate that the Tax Collector has any power to designate what portion shall be bid upon. (Id.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">The deed of Hunt following the sale of one-eighth was void, because it is only when \u201c an undivided interest is assessed \u201d\u2014which was not the case here\u2014that the Tax Collector can sell an undivided interest. (Id.; Black, on Tax T. 332.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-6\">Again, both deeds were void, because :</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-7\">1st. Uncertainty of the land sold (\u201c one-eighth \u201d and \u201c fourteen feet\u201d). <em>(Kelsey </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>13 Cal. 619.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-8\">2d. Variance between the piece bid on and that described in the said deeds respectively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">3d. The pieces mentioned in and intended to be conveyed by said deeds were not sold at auction, but only at private sale ; for only \u201c one-eighth\u201d and \u201cfourteen feet\u201d were knocked off at auction, and the officer had no power to make a private sale. (Black, on Tax T. 313.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-10\">4th. The Tax Collector\u2019s act, in conveying by metes and bounds, amounted to an attempted exercise of the power to partition the land between the owner assessed and the supposed purchaser of part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-11\">A partition can only be had by agreement of parties, or else by decree of \u00e1 Court. Of course, the Tax Collector has no such power given him by law. It would be monstrous if the law should confer such a power; for if the officer may sell a certain number of feet without locating them, and then convey by metes and bounds what portion of the property he pleases, it is easy to see that if an enemy should purchase, the officer might convey, to him the least valuable portion; while if a friend was the successful bidder, he would obtain that part of the land which was best located, most valuable, and covered, perhaps, with costly improvements. (Id. 338.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>J. J. Papy, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-4\">The defendant objected to the introduction of both these deeds upon the ground that they were null and void upon their faces. The defendant did not offer to show in what the deeds were null and void; therefore, the ruling of the Court was correct. <em>(Kiler et al. </em>v. <em>Kimball et </em>al., 10 Cal. 267 ; <em>Martin </em>v. Travers, 12 Id. 243.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-5\">The deeds being admitted as evidence without legal objection, or without objection at all, they are <em>\u201c </em>declared to be all the requisites essential to the validity of the sale made for taxes, or assessments.\u201d (Stat. 1859, 349, Sec. 23.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-6\">And the deed conveys to the purchaser the absolute title to the lands described in the deed, clear of all encumbrances, etc. (Id.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-7\">And such deed shall be conclusive proof of the matters by it set forth; except, that the Court may examine only in regard to such deed, and may hear any testimony in relation thereto, as follows, etc. (Id.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-8\">The Court has already decided that a defendant is limited to the defenses authorized by statute. <em>(Mills </em>v. Tukey, 22 Cal. 373.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-9\">If the defendants failed to present their objections at the time of the offer of the deeds in evidence, and also failed to allege any one of them as defenses in them answer, then they are estopped from controverting any one of the allegations of the deeds. They are conclusive, so far as they can convey title; and nothing but a superior outstanding title can avail the defendants. This they have not. (Eor the meaning of the word \u201c conclusive,\u201d see Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Burrill, Webster, etc.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-10\">The statute finally determines that all the statements in the deed are true\u2014not to be rebutted. When matters are pronounced <em>\u201c </em>conclusive,\u201d they are rendered effectually so, by not permitting the party to give any evidence against them. (Grreenl. 204.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-11\">The answer of the defendants, being a simple general denial, they could not avail themselves of any testimony. They could not contradict the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, except to show a superior outstanding title in a third party. \u201c Matters in avoidance must be specially pleaded. They cannot be used under an answer which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>a simple denial of the allegations of the bill.\u201d ( <em>Gaskill </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>4 Cal. 233; <em>Piercy </em>v. <em>Sabin, </em>10 Id. 22.) In which the Court say: \u201c If the onus of proof is thrown upon defendant, it is new matter.\u201d <em>(Payne Dewey </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>16 Cal. 244.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-4\">The first two exceptions in the statute, and the only ones upon which defendants can rely, are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-5\">1st. \u201c That the property, or a larger part of which it is a portion, was not assessed or equalized according to law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">2d. <em>\u201c </em>That the taxes, or a portion of them, were not levied by law, or by some person or body under authority of law.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-7\">Plaintiff insists that under these exceptions, the defendants cannot give any evidence relative to the manner of conducting the sale, because the sale, or act of the Tax Collector, is no part of the assessment or equalization; nor is it levying the tax. The assessment, equalization, and unlawful levy of the tax, can alone be examined into, under a proper averment in the answer. Everything else not allowed by statute is excluded, and the deed made conclusive.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b263-8\">Crocker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axx\">delivered the opinion of the Court\u2014Norton, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">This is an action to recover possession of a lot in the City of San Francisco, the plaintiff claiming title thereto under two tax deeds. He recovered judgment, from which the defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The plaintiff introduced in evidence the two tax deeds\u2014one executed by J. Hunt as Tax Collector, under a sale for delinquent taxes for the year 1859-1860, conveying a portion of the premises described in the complaint; and another executed by E. H. Wash-burn as Tax Collector, under a sale for delinquent taxes for the year 1860-1861, conveying the remainder of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">After the plaintiff had closed his testimony, the defendants introduced in evidence a deed, under which they claimed title, which showed that a lane or alley, eight feet wide, on the west side of the premises deeded to them, was not included therein; and they also offered to prove by a witness, that this alley was not possessed or owned by the defendants, but that it was an open alley, over which the owners of the adjoining property had a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>of way only. The Court excluded the testimony, and this ruling is assigned as error. When the tax deeds were offered in evidence, the defendants objected to their introduction, on the ground, first, that no preliminary evidence, laying the basis for them introduction, had been offered; second, that they were void on their face; which objections were overruled by the Court. The complaint in this case is general in its terms, making no reference to the tax deeds, or the peculiar character of the title under which the plaintiff claimed. The answer is equally general in its denials and averments. The respondent insists that the Court properly overruled this objection, because, first, the point it was sought to sustain by the evidence was not specifically made as an objection to the introduction of the tax deeds, citing 10 Cal. 267; 12 Id. 243; second, the matter was not specifically set forth as a defense in the answer. These objections of the respondent also apply to the other evidence offered by defendants attacking the tax deeds, which was ruled out by the Court. The rule that a party must specify his objections to evidence when offered, applies only to those objections which relate to the question whether the evidence is- admissible or not, and does not relate to the question as to the weight to be given to the evidence after it is admitted, or to matters tending to contradict, overthrow, or invalidate it. It, therefore, has no application to the present case. The objection that these matters are not set forth in the answer is equally untenable. Under the general denials of the answer, the defendants had a clear right to introduce any evidence allowed by the statute, to show the invalidity of the tax deeds, or the title acquired under them. The respondent also insists, that, as the statute only permits a tax deed to be attacked upon certain points, therefore these points must be specifically stated in the answer. But this is also untenable. The statute expressly declares, that Courts of Law and Equity may examine in regard to such deed, and may hear any testimony in relation thereto to show the points on which the permitted objections are founded. It is a matter, therefore, of evidence, and not of pleading. Besides, as the complaint makes no reference to a tax deed or title, the defendants were not bound to make any reference to it in their answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The statute authorized the Court to hear testimony to show \u201c that the property, or a larger parcel, of which it is a portion, was not assessed or equalized, as required by law,\u201d and under this the defendants had a right to show that the lot or portion of a lot assessed to them included a tract in which they had no right, title, interest, or claim, and which was not in their possession, charge, or control; and if this eight-foot alley was thus improperly included in the assessment, the defendant had a right to prove those facts. We think, however, that the exclusion of the parol evidence worked no injury in this respect to the defendants; as the deed introduced by them shows that they had an interest in this alley to the extent of a right of way over it, as appurtenant to adjoining property conveyed by the deed. The alley does not appear to have been a public highway. The fact that it was included in the assessment with such adjoining property was not, therefore, sufficient to invalidate the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The property assessed in 1859, and which is the same as that described in the deed to the defendants, except that it includes the alley, was offered for sale by the Tax Collector in December, 1859, and at that sale plaintiff bought \u201c one-eighth \u201d of the whole premises. The evidence shows that there was no statement or designation made, before or at the time of the sale, to the bidder, of the particular portion or location of the part he should bid on, should less than the whole be taken; nor was any designation thereof made until the certificates of purchase were made out, which was from two weeks to two months after the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The property assessed in 1860 is also the same as that described in defendant\u2019s deed, except that it includes the alley; and it was offered for sale by the Tax Collector in December, 1860, when the plaintiff purchased \u201cfourteen feet\u201d of the premises. Ho designation was made, at the time of the sale, of the particular portion to be taken by the purchaser, when less than the whole property was bid for. The evidence shows that this fourteen feet was not located or specifically designated until some time after the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The deeds made in pursuance of these sales do not conform to the purchases made in any respect. The Hunt deed, instead of conveying the \u201cone-eighth\u201d of the premises assessed, describes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>an irregular tract, three feet one and one-quarter inches wide at one end, and eight feet seven and one-eighth inches at the other,_ and running across the premises one hundred and thirty-seven feet six inches in length. The Washburn deed conveys a strip fourteen feet wide at each end, and running across the premises one hundred and thirty-seven feet six inches in length, and includes a portion of the premises conveyed by the Hunt deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The statute under which the sale was made (Wood\u2019s Dig. 619, Sec. 17) authorized the owner of the property to designate, prior to the commencement of the sale, what portion of the property he wishes bid on; but, if he did not so designate, \u201cthen the Tax Collector shall designate; and the person who will take the least quantity or smallest part of the land; or, in case 'an undivided interest is assessed, then the- smallest portion of such interest, etc., etc., shall be declared to be the purchaser.\u201d It will be noticed that it is only in case that an \u201c undivided interest is assessed,\u201d that a .portion of such interest can be bid for. \" In this case, no undivided interest in the property was assessed; and the Tax Collector had no power or authority to sell an undivided interest therein to the plaintiff. It is clear also, that the intention of the statute is, that, when there is a sale of a less portion than the whole, and the owner has not designated the portion he wishes sold, and the Tax Collector is thus authorized to designate, such designation must be made before or at the time of the sale of the particular tract put up for sale, and that such designation cannot be made afterward. By the terms used in the statute, it is evident that the designation, whether by the owner or by the Tax Collector, must precede the actual sale to the purchaser. And, independent of these terms, if the statute had left it ambiguous, the necessity of such designation before the property is sold is apparent. It is important that the purchaser shall know what portion of the premises he is purchasing, that he may be able to bid understandingly; and it is of the greatest importance to the owner, as thereby the competition will he closer among the bidders. Besides, if the designation is not made until afterward, a door is left open for the grossest frauds. It follows, that there was not, in fact, any sale of the particular tracts described in the tax deeds. The property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>really sold, was not sufficiently described to enable it to be located, or to render the sale valid. If the tax deeds had correctly described the tracts really sold according to the facts; that is, \u201c one-eighth \u201d and \u201c fourteen feet \u201d of the assessed premises\u2014they would have been clearly void for uncertainty of description. It does not show whether the <em>\u201c </em>fourteen feet \u201d are fourteen square feet or fourteen feet square, or in what portion of the premises it was intended to be located\u2014whether on any side or in the center; and the same difficulty exists as to the \u201c one-eighth.\u201d This uncertainty of description could not be remedied after the sale by the Tax <em>Collector; </em>for that would be virtually attempting to make a new sale,' not at public auction, but in the most private manner. This objection to the title claimed under the tax deeds is properly included within the statutory provision upon this subject, which permits proof \u201c that, at a proper time and place, the property was not sold at public auction, by a proper officer or by a person acting <em>de facto </em>as such officer.\u201d It in fact shows, that the property attempted to be conveyed by the tax deeds was never sold at all. It follows, that the tax deeds conveyed no title to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">See. 32 of the Revenue Law in force at the time these taxes were levied and sales were made (Wood\u2019s Digest, 623), provides, that every tax levied under the provisions of that act shall be a judgment against the person and a lien upon the property assessed, \u201c which judgment shall not be satisfied or the lien be removed, until the taxes are all paid or the property has absolutely vested in a purchaser under a sale for taxes.\u201d Sec. 20 also provides that this lien of the State is transferred to and vested in the purchaser at the tax sale, upon filing the certificate of purchase with the County Recorder; and it can only be divested by payment of the taxes and a per centage. Ho title having vested in \u25a0 the purchaser under this sale for taxes, it is a question whether this lien for taxes does not still exist upon the property; and also whether, under Sec. 20, the purchaser cannot in equity be subrogated to the rights of the State, and enforce this lien accordingly. But, as these questions have not been discussed by the counsel for the parties, and were not raised in the Court below, it is unnecessary to determine them at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
