J. and Norton, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-14\">This is an appeal from an order refusing an injunction. The complaint avers that the plaintiffs are the owners of a toll-bridge over Feather River, between Yuba City and Marysville; that the defendants are running a ferry, within one mile of the bridge, under a license issued by the Board of Supervisors of Yuba County, who had improperly determined, upon the application for the ferry license, that the public convenience required a ferry within one mile of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>bridge ; and alleging numerous irregularities in the action of the Board of Supervisors in granting the ferry license, and also that they erred in deciding that the public convenience required a ferry at that place.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">The plaintiffs have mistaken their remedy in this case. The Board of Supervisors is a special tribunal, with mixed powers, administrative and judicial; and it has full jurisdiction conferred upon it by the statute over all matters relating to bridges and ferries. Many questions of a judicial character come before it in determining such matters. Their decision in such cases is not final and conclusive, but their judgments and orders cannot be attacked in a collateral action, as is attempted in this case. <em>(Waugh </em>v. Chauncey, 13 Cal. 11; <em>Thomas </em>v. Armstrong, 7 Id. 287.) It is a question whether the judgment and determination of the board upon the point whether a ferry is demanded by public convenience within one mile of a regularly established ferry or bridge, is not final and conclusive, as a matter confided to their sound discretion. The judgments and orders of the board, in proper cases, where their action is not final and conclusive, can be reviewed by <em>certiorari. (People </em>v. <em>El Dorado Co., </em>8 Cal. 58 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Marin Co., </em>10 Id. 344.) If the plaintiffs have any remedy to set aside the action of the board in granting the ferry license, it is by writ of <em>certiorari, </em>and not by the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The order is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
