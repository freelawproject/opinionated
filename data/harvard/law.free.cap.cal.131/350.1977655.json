One of the grounds relied upon to secure a dismissal is based upon the claim that the undertaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>upon appeal is substantially defective. This undertaking recites that whereas the appellants have appealed to this court from the judgment entered in the action, and also from the order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment, now, therefore, \u201cin consideration of the premises and of such appeal,\u201d the sureties undertake that appellants will pay all damages awarded against them on \u201cthe appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The ease of <em>Estate of Heydenfeldt, </em>119 Cal. 346, is similar to the case at bar. There the appeal was taken from various orders, and the sureties undertook \u201cthat said appellant will pay all damages and costs which may be awarded against her on said appeal.\u201d In this case the undertaking uses the language \u201cthe appeal.\u201d In the Heydenfeldt case this court said: \u201cIt has been established by a long line of decisions of this court that an undertaking on appeal such as the one .given in this case is entirely invalid for any purpose. <em>(People v. Center, </em>61 Cal. 191; <em>Corcoran v. Desmond, </em>71 Cal. 100, and previous cases there cited; <em>Home etc. Associates v. Wilkins, </em>71 Cal. 626; <em>McCormick v. Belvin, </em>96 Cal. 182; <em>Centerville etc. Co. v. Bachtold, </em>109 Cal. 111.)\u201d It is said in the Centerville ease, <em>supra: </em>\u201cIf the undertaking has no special reference to either matter appealed from, but is conditioned generally upon 'such appeal\u2019 <em>(People v. Center, supra; Corcoran v. Desmond, supra), </em>or 'said appeals\u2019 <em>(McCormick v. Belvin, supra), </em>all the appeals will be dismissed upon the ground that by reason of its ambiguity it cannot be determined for which appeal it was given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">For the foregoing reasons the appeals are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Van Dyke, J., Harrison, J., McFarland, J., and Temple, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
