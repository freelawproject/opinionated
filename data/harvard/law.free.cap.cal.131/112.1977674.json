What is called the \u201ctranscript on appeal\u201d shows what purport to be a large number of affidavits and other papers and testimony given and proceedings had at the preliminary examination; but there is no bill of exceptions authenticating these matters, and therefore there is nothing before us into which we can look to see whether the order appealed from was, or was not, erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The codes contain no provision, either in civil or criminal cases, for authenticating papers or evidence used on a motion, other than a bill of exceptions, and formerly there was great difficulty and confusion on the subject. It was held in <em>Walsh v. Hutchings, </em>60 Cal. 228, that the certificate of the clerk would not do. In <em>Pieper v. Centinela etc. Co., </em>56 Cal. 173, the judge of the lower court had certified to the papers used, and the court said that \u201cas the codes had prescribed no mode of authentication, this court has the power to prescribe by a rule how such papers can be brought before it on appeal,\u201d and that, \u201cas it has such right to make a rule in advance, it has a like power to ratify and adopt the mode followed in this case\u201d; and the papers named in the judge\u2019s certificate were considered. There is no decision as to when the judge must make his certificate, and his recollection of the facts might be very indistinct; and in <em>Borkheim v. North British etc. Ins. Co., </em>38 Cal. 627, the court suggests to members of 'the bar that they \u201crequest the judge, at the hearing of such motion, to indorse each affidavit or other document as having been used upon the motion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In <em>Somers v. Somers, </em>81 Cal. 608, the whole matter was extensively discussed\u2014several justices expressing opinions. It was held in the leading opinion \u201cthat the papers could only be presented to this court by bill of exceptions\u201d; but as the certificate of the judge was itself insufficient, it was probably on that ground that the appeal was dismissed\u2014the court being embarrassed by former decisions. <em>But it </em>was suggested in that ease\u2014 which was decided in 1899\u2014that there should be a rule of court \u25a0on the subject to \u201coperate prospectively\u201d; and immediately afterward the rule\u2014then Ho. XXXII, and now Ho. XXIX \u2014was adopted, which is as follows: \u201cIn all'cases of appeal to this court from the orders of the superior courts, the papers and evidence used or taken on the hearing of the motion must be authenticated by incorporating the same in a bill of exceptions, except where another mode of authentication is provided by law.\u201d Afterward, in March, 1891, the case of <em>White v. White, </em>88 Cal. 429, was decided, in which this court said: \u201cThe transcript on appeal herein purports to show that certain affidavits and testimony of witnesses were used upon the hearing of the motion, which resulted in the order appealed from, but there is no bill of exceptions in the record. In the case of <em>Somers v. Somers, supra, </em>the members of this court were divided as to the proper practice to be pursued in authenticating the record on appeal from this class of orders, but since then the court has adopted rule XXXII, which we think should be deemed as settling the practice, so far as relates to appeals taken since it went into effect; and this appeal having been taken since that date, the rule is decisive of the question arising on this motion.\u201d That case was decided nearly ten years ago, and the rule itself has been in existence more than eleven years, and there is no reason why, since then, all difficulties on the subject should not be avoided by a compliance with the rule. Of course, the rule does not apply to papers which are themselves parts of the judgment-roll, as was the case in <em>Miller v. Lux, </em>100 Cal. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Henshaw, J., and Temple, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
