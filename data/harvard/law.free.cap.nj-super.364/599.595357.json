A., J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">This is the second time that this matter comes before us. In <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Palisades Safety and Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>No. A-219-99T5 (App.Div. Jan. 8, 2001), we decided, among other things, that Palisades Safety and Insurance Association (Palisades), must provide liability coverage to Raymond Majewski for injuries sustained by Cedar A. Johnson in an automobile accident. We remanded the matter to determine whether Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company (Atlantic), must also provide coverage to Majewski. If so, the Law Division judge was to decide whether Palisades\u2019 and Atlantic\u2019s coverages are primary, or excess. The judge found that Atlantic must provide coverage. The judge also determined that Palisades\u2019 and Atlantic\u2019s coverage is to be pro-rated according to the respective policy limits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">The facts are undisputed. On August 29, 1995, Johnson was operating his wife\u2019s vehicle when he struck an automobile'operated by Samuel Finn. Finn was injured. Johnson was accompanied by a co-worker, Daniel LaVienna. Both men were employed by Cambridge Frozen Bakery Products (Cambridge). They were returning from the home of their superior, Plant Manager Raymond Majewski, who had sent them to his home to retrieve his prescription medicine. Neither man \u201cpunched out\u201d but remained \u201con the clock.\u201d Thus, they were \u201cworking\u201d for Cambridge during the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">In a deposition, Majewski testified that he sent Johnson and LaVienna on this errand because he was the only manager on the shift and could not leave the plant. According to Majewski, he and Cambridge\u2019s president often used their employees for similar tasks. Johnson corroborated that he had made similar errands for his superiors.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Finn sued the Johnsons, Cambridge, and Majewski for negligence. Cambridge sent the complaint to Atlantic, its liability insurance carrier. Atlantic defended the action on Cambridge\u2019s behalf. Majewski notified Atlantic of the suit against him. Atlantic denied coverage for Majewski. Majewski also submitted the complaint to two other carriers: Preserver Insurance Company (Preserver), his homeowner\u2019s insurance carrier, and Palisades, his personal automobile insurance carrier. Preserver and Palisades denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Finn settled with the Johnsons and Cambridge for $790,000. The Johnsons\u2019 insurer paid $100,000 and Atlantic, $690,000. Cambridge and Majewski entered into a consent judgment. Majewski agreed to a $690,000 judgment against him in order to satisfy Cambridge\u2019s indemnity claim. In return for an agreement not to execute on the consent judgment, Majewski assigned to Atlantic) and Cambridge all of his rights against Preserver and Palisades! As Majewski\u2019s assignee, Atlantic filed the present lawsuit against Preserver and Palisades. Preserver and Palisades moved successfully for summary judgment. We affirmed as to Preserver, but reversed as to Palisades, concluding that the Palisades policy provided coverage. We remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">On remand, the judge found that both policies provided coverage and ordered Palisades to reimburse Atlantic for one-half of the Finn settlement. Upon reconsideration, the judge ordered that Palisades and Atlantic provide coverage on a pro rata basis according to their limits \u00f3f coverage. He ordered Palisades to reimburse Atlantic $138,000, or twenty percent of the settlement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Atlantic appeals contending that: (1) its policy does not provide coverage to Majewski; (2) Palisade\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause does not apply because there is no \u201cother insurance;\u201d and (3) the judge erred by finding that Atlantic\u2019s policy provides liability coverage to Majewski. Palisades cross-appeals contending that Atlantic\u2019s policy provides primary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>The determination of whether an individual is an insured under an insurance policy is a matter of law to be decided by the court. <em>National Union Fire Ins. v. Transportation Ins. Co., </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>437, 443, 765 A.2d 240 (App.Div.2001). The court should interpret the policy \u201caccording to its plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Progressive Cas. Ins. v. Hurley, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>260, 272-73, 765 A.2d 195 (2001). However, the \u201cpolicy should be construed to comport with the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations of coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 765 A.2d 195 (citing <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 669-71, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999)). Therefore, the court should only enforce those restrictions or terms in the policy that are consistent with the insured\u2019s \u201cobjectively reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">With those principles in mind, we concur with the judge that the Atlantic policy provides coverage to Majewski. The Atlantic policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\n<em>1. WHO IS AN INSURED</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\n<em>The following are \u201cinsureds:\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>a. You for any covered \u201cauto;\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">\n<em>b.

The proofs support two critical findings by the judge. First, that Majewski was using, with Cambridge\u2019s permission, Johnson\u2019s auto. Second, that Johnson\u2019s auto was borrowed by Cambridge. It is self-evident that neither exception (1) or (2) to section b applies here. Therefore, Majewski has liability coverage for the Finn accident under the unique circumstances of this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-15\">We have already held that as a matter of law Majewski was in effect \u201cusing Johnson\u2019s vehicle ... and, thus, through Johnson, was operating Johnson\u2019s vehicle.\u201d <em>Atlantic Mut. Ins. v. Palisades Safety and Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>No. A-219-99T5 (App.Div. Jan. 8, 2001). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Therefore, we turn to the second finding, <em>i.e., </em>that Cambridge was borrowing Johnson\u2019s auto. The meaning of the term \u201cborrow\u201d within the context of an insurance policy has been considered by courts in New Jersey on two occasions. In <em>F &amp; M Schaefer Brewing Co. v. Forbes Food Div., </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 376 A.2d 1282 (Law Div.1977), the judge found that a person becomes a borrower when he or she \u201cassume[s] a certain amount of control, dominion or power over the object being borrowed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 376 A.2d 1282. We adopted this analysis in <em>National Union Fire Ins. v. Transportation Ins. Co., supra, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 447, 765 A.2d 240. Along with the Law Division\u2019s definition of the term \u201cborrower,\u201d we adopted the Fifth Circuit\u2019s definition for the term as analyzed in <em>Sturgeon v. Strachan Shipping Co., </em>731 F.2d 255 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied sub nom, Strachan Shipping Co. v. Bankers &amp; Shippers Ins. Co. of N.Y., </em>469 <em>U.S. </em>883, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>251; 83 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 188 (1984), and the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s definition as stated in <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. v. American Employers Ins., </em>556 S.W.2d 242 (Tex.1977). <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The <em>Sturgeon </em>court adopted the \u201cuse and possession\u201d test as applied in <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. </em>to determine whether a party is a \u201cborrower.\u201d <em>Sturgeon, supra, </em>731 F.2d at 259. Under the test, a person is a \u201cborrower\u201d if he or she obtained possession of the vehicle. <em>Ibid. </em>Possession is established by having dominion or control. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the \u201cuser\u201d of the vehicle must also have the simultaneous authority to move the vehicle in order to be considered a \u201cborrower.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">We recognize that the analysis adopted in <em>National Union Fire Ins. </em>addressed the term \u201cborrower\u201d as used in the \u201cloading and unloading\u201d context, but nevertheless find the adopted analysis to apply here. The record reflects that Cambridge and its president used Johnson and three other employees to run their errands. Although Majewski\u2019s use of Johnson\u2019s vehicle was limited, the record reflects that Cambridge\u2019s use of its employee\u2019s automobiles was a \u201cdaily occurrence.\u201d Johnson admitted that he believed that the performance of these tasks were a part of his job. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>when running errands, the employees remained \u201con the clock\u201d and \u201creceiv[ed] pay.\u201d Majewski testified that Cambridge paid the employees because they considered the errands to be \u201ccompany business.\u201d In fact, after Johnson\u2019s accident Cambridge changed its policy and required the employees to \u201cpunch out.\u201d When considering these facts, it is clear that Cambridge had substantial dominion or control over Johnson\u2019s vehicle. Accordingly, Cambridge \u201cborrowed\u201d the Johnson vehicle and permitted Majewski to \u201cuse\u201d it by providing him with the authority to send Cambridge employees on errands. Thus, Atlantic\u2019s policy provides liability coverage to Majewski.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">On cross-appeal, Palisades argues that Atlantic provides primary coverage to Majewski, and that it provides only excess coverage. Therefore, Palisades contends that it does not have to reimburse Atlantic because the Finn settlement is well within the Atlantic policy\u2019s $1.25 million limit. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Atlantic\u2019s other insurance clause reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\"><em>SECTION IV </em>\u2014 BUSINESS <em>AUTO CONDITIONS</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">\n<em>B. GENERAL CONDITIONS</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF51\">\n<em>5. OTHER INSURANCE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\"><em>a. For any covered \u201cauto\u201d you own, this Coverage Form provides primary insurance. For any covered \u201cauto\u201d you don\u2019t own, the insurance provided by this Coverage Form is excess over any other collectible </em>insurance____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">\n<em>c. Regardless of the provisions of paragraph a. above, this Coverage Form\u2019s Liability Coverage is primary for any liability assumed under an \"insured contract. \u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\"><em>SECTION V </em>\u2014 DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9k\">\n<em>F. \u201cInsured Contract\u201d means:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">\n<em>5. That part of any other contract or agreement pertaining to your business ... under which you assume the tort liability of another to pay for \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to a third party or organization. Tort liability means a liability that would be imposed by law in the absence of any contract or agreement.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">Palisades argues that this language means that Atlantic must provide primary coverage for any liability assumed under contract, and that includes Majewski\u2019s liability. Yet, the policy clearly states that the coverage is primary if Cambridge assumes liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>under any contract or agreement, i.e., an insured contract. Majewski\u2019s tort liability was incurred by law, not by an insured contract. Thus, Atlantic\u2019s policy does not provide primary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Palisades further argues that the judge initially found that Atlantic provided primary coverage, and that finding becomes \u201cthe law of the case.\u201d We reject Palisades\u2019 law-of-the-case argument.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s order dismissing Atlantic\u2019s claim did make a finding that the Atlantic policy provided primary coverage. However, in reversing that order, we noted that the issue of primary and excess coverage had not been addressed. Therefore, the earlier finding was implicitly reversed. The \u201claw of the case doctrine\u201d did not apply and Atlantic appropriately filed a cross-motion to alter or amend the judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Both parties agree that if Majewski is an insured under Atlantic\u2019s policy and if that coverage is not primary, then the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses of both policies are applicable. Thus, Palisades is required to reimburse Atlantic $138,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-9\"> Atlantic\u2019s policy limit is $1,250,000 and Palisades's limit is $250,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-9\"> The \"law-of-the-case\u201d doctrine stands for the proposition that an unreversed decision of law or fact made during the course of litigation settles that question for all subsequent stages of the suit. <em>State v.
