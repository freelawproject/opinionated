He was sentenced to five years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections with 85% to be served before parole eligibility under the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2. The vehicle defendant was driving at the time of the stop and arrest in East Orange was the subject of the receiving count, and the purse stolen from victim Paulette Lenez in Bloomfield was the subject of the robbery. On this appeal the defendant argues that \u201cthe prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by unfairly besmirching the defendant\u2019s credibility on the basis of his, and counsel\u2019s, presence at trial, necessitating reversal.\u201d Defendant asserts that comment on defendant\u2019s ability to tailor his testimony in response to hearing the other witnesses was unconstitutional and, in any event, prejudicial in this case. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">The testimony at trial reveals that on September 20, 2001, at around 10:00 a.m., Paulette Lenez left her home on Ashland Avenue in Bloomfield to walk to the post office. She carried her \u201cdouble strap,\u201d white handbag over her shoulder. The handbag contained her glasses, identification, papers, credit cards, prepaid telephone calling cards, about $90 in cash, and \u201ca golden watch\u201d that was given to her on retirement, which she carried \u201cin a little pouch\u201d in the pocketbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Lenez walked past one or two houses before she felt someone \u201cspinning\u201d her around from behind and \u201cgrabbing\u201d the handle of her handbag. She thereupon started screaming \u201cvery hard\u201d for someone to help her. Lenez refused to let go of her handbag, but the assailant kept pulling it away from her. During this time a car stopped next to Lenez and the assailant. She did not see the face of the driver because she was \u201ctoo upset\u201d and just looked briefly in the direction of the car, which she first thought was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>stopping to help her. Finally, the straps of the handbag broke, and the assailant ran with it towards the vehicle. Lenez suffered a \u201cbig mark\u201d and \u201cscarring\u201d on her arm due to the force that was used to pull the handbag away from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">After running in the direction of the vehicle, the assailant came back towards Lenez because he dropped something. She testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">[I] was right behind him and I start[ed] chasing him. He went to the car, the passenger seat and then he sat ... I had my hands inside the car ... holding the door, mak[ing] sure it don\u2019t close. Then he pushed me back and he was just forcing me back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">When the vehicle started moving, Lenez let go, but she continued screaming. She described the car as a \u201cvery new white ear,\u201d a Ford Explorer, with an American flag on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Carmen Alava, Lenez\u2019s neighbor on Ashland Avenue, saw Lenez walking up the street that morning. Within a few minutes Alava noticed a man, who was not \u201cfrom around\u201d the neighborhood, jogging \u201calongside\u201d \u201ca brand new jeep SUV car [that was] driving very slow.\u201d The jogger started \u201crunning a little bit faster,\u201d moved onto the sidewalk and then \u201csnatch[ed] the purse of Miss Lenez.\u201d Alava noticed that the assailant grabbed the purse from the back and Lenez struggled with him. It was at that time that Alava \u201cdropped everything and ran downstairs\u201d to help, but by the time she got outside, Lenez was already walking back towards her house and she was \u201ccrying and yelling [and] very upset.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Lenez\u2019s screams were also heard by Maria Atunes, who was visiting her friend at the corner of Ashland and Linden Avenues. Atunes saw Lenez \u201changing on to a white SUV\u201d with two men inside and told her friend to call the police while she \u201cran outside.\u201d Atunes described the vehicle more specifically as a \u201cbrand new white SUV [with] an American flag on it.\u201d She \u201csaw the same vehicle [she] had seen Paulette hanging onto drive around the corner.\u201d She had also seen the passenger \u201ctrying to push [Lenez] out from the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>At about 10:05 a.m., Bloomfield police officers responded to the scene and interviewed Lenez, Alava and Atunes. Lenez described her assailant as an approximately twenty-year-old black male, about five feet eight inches in height, wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans, with braids in his hair. Alava gave a similar description of the jogger that she saw. Atunes saw both the assailant and the driver even though they were both in the SUV at the time. She stated that the driver was in his twenties, wore a white t-shirt and had braids in his hair. Atunes\u2019 description of the assailant and his clothing was similar to that given by Lenez and Alava. Detective Edward Sousa of the Bloomfield Police Department sent out a description of the SUV through the State Police Emergency Network.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Shortly thereafter, Officer Eric Browmley of the East Orange Police Department saw a vehicle matching the SUV\u2019s description with two people inside, and turned on the overhead lights of his patrol car. Officer Browmley radioed information to headquarters about the vehicle he was chasing, and discovered that the vehicle was listed as a \u201cstolen felony vehicle.\u201d The SUV made several \u201cabrupt\u201d turns before turning into a parking lot at 61 Glenwood Avenue, East Orange, where the driver pulled into a parking space. When Officer Browmley approached the vehicle, only defendant, the driver, was inside. The officer never saw the other occupant leave the vehicle. Browmley ordered defendant to get out and place his hands on the hood of the car, which defendant did, and the officer placed him under arrest for possession of the stolen SUV. Browmley also observed a purse \u201con the front passenger side on the floor area\u201d of the SUV. When the officer asked defendant where the other person went, he \u201cjust didn\u2019t respond.\u201d A search of the area for the other occupant was unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">After defendant\u2019s arrest, Browmley advised the dispatcher to notify the Bloomfield Police Department that defendant was under arrest. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Gerald Mastroeni of the Bloomfield police transported Lenez to East Orange where she identified the white SUV. Lenez was also asked if she recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>defendant, and she said \u201cyes, but [she] didn\u2019t know his face\u201d because she \u201cwas fighting with the guy taking [her] pocketbook.\u201d At trial Lenez identified defendant as the person that she saw in East Orange, but she was not sure if he was the driver because she \u201cdidn\u2019t really have a chance to see\u201d the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">When Lenez approached the SUV in East Orange, she identified her handbag, which was laying \u201cbetween the door and the seats.\u201d After looking through her handbag, Lenez noticed that her $90 in cash, prepaid calling card and watch were missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Detective Sousa transported Alava and Antunes to East Orange. At the scene of the arrest, Alava identified the vehicle but she could not identify the driver because she did not see him during the incident in Bloomfield. Alava, however, stated that the defendant was not the jogger that she saw from her window. Atunes saw the SUV when she was taken to East Orange, and had \u201cno doubt\u201d it was the vehicle Lenez was \u201cholding onto\u201d on Ashland Avenue. Atunes also identified defendant as the driver of that vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">At trial, Yvette Campbell of Orange testified that she was the owner of a white 2001 Ford Explorer, and that on September 18, 2001, she was \u201cmugged\u201d and her pocketbook, which contained her \u201ccar keys and credentials,\u201d was stolen. Campbell further testified that on September 19, 2001, she heard the alarm on her vehicle go off while it was parked in her driveway, but by the time she looked outside, it was being driven away. She identified the SUV driven by defendant at the time of arrest as her vehicle that was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. He said that on September 20, 2001 at 10:15 a.m. he was at home in East Orange, getting ready for work, when he heard a car horn. When he looked outside, he recognized a \u201cmutual friend\u201d of his cousin, named Mumbles, who was \u201cwaving for [him] to come downstairs.\u201d At that time the defendant was wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans. When the defendant went downstairs he told Mumbles that he had to go to work, but Mumbles \u201casked [him] to drive\u201d the car, which Mumbles identified as belonging to his mother. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>defendant described the vehicle as a 2001 SUV Ford Explorer with an American flag on the antenna. He further testified that Mumbles is a black male about five feet 10 inches in height, with a short haircut, and on that day Mumbles wore a white t-shirt with blue jeans. After \u201c[a]t the most 30 seconds,\u201d defendant agreed to drive the vehicle because it was an \u201copportunity to take a joyride.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The defendant got into the driver\u2019s side of the SUV and Mumbles got into the passenger side. The defendant testified that he did not see the white handbag described earlier in the trial by Lenez. He stated that he intended to drive himself to his job at Fish and Chips on Springfield Avenue, but when he arrived at Washington Terrace, Mumbles asked him to make a right turn and then a series of quick turns. He never noticed that there was a police car with flashing lights driving behind him. Finally, Mumbles asked the defendant to pull into a driveway, and as the defendant drove to the back of the lot, Mumbles \u201chopped out\u201d of the vehicle and \u201cjust kept running.\u201d The defendant parked the SUV, and by the time he turned off the engine, the East Orange police officers had arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The defendant further testified that the officers approached him \u25a0with guns drawn and told him to \u201cfreeze\u201d and \u201cget down on the ground,\u201d to which he complied. He claimed that the officers handcuffed him and placed him in custody, but never told him why he was being arrested. He remained in the police car for \u201c[ajbout an hour or so,\u201d before being taken to the East Orange headquarters where he was told he was arrested for \u201c[sjtolen property\u201d and was \u201ca suspect in a purse snatch in Bloomfield.\u201d The defendant further testified that the Bloomfield police officers did not tell him why he was later being transported to Bloomfield until he arrived at Bloomfield headquarters, where he answered no questions after being given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. At trial, defendant maintained that he did not drive the SUV in Bloomfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">During his summation the prosecutor stated that \u201cdefendant is trying to weave a story that acknowledges those things he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>can\u2019t overcome and yet exculpate himself of any kind of guilt whatsoever.\u201d The prosecutor subsequently added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">Now, the defense generally does not have to give you a story, they do not have to give you a ease, they do not have to defend themselves. It is the State\u2019s obligation to provide to you proof beyond a reasonable doubt of what happened in this case. Reasonable doubt, not unreasonable doubt, reasonable doubt. But if the defendant takes the stand what he tells you is going to be subject to the same scrutiny as you hear from the State\u2019s witnesses. And let\u2019s look at what he tells you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">Now I said that the defendant in his testimony is subject to the same kinds of scrutiny as the State\u2019s witnesses. But just keep in mind, there is something obvious to you, I\u2019m just restating something you already know, which is all I do in my summation, the defendant sits with counsel, listens to the entire ease and he listens to each one of the State\u2019s witness[es], he knows what facts he can\u2019t get past. The fact that he was in the SUV. The fact that there\u2019s a purse in the car. The fact that a robbery happened. But he can choose to craft his version to accommodate those facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">No objections were made to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. Thereafter, the judge instructed the jury about the governing law in this case and the role of jurors. In particular, the judge cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATL\">You are to determine the credibility of the various witnesses, as well as what weight to attach to any particular witness\u2019 testimony. You and you alone are the sole and exclusive judges of that evidence, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to attach to the testimony of each witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">Regardless what counsel may have said during their closing arguments or if I say anything about the evidence, which I generally do not, keep in mind it is your recollection of the evidence that should guide you ... Any arguments, statements, remarks in the openings or summations of counsel are not evidence and must not be treated by you as evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">As noted at the outset, the jury found defendant guilty of robbery and acquitted him of receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Defendant argues that the prosecutor, in summation, attacked the defendant\u2019s credibility by adversely commenting on his constitutional right to be present at trial and implying that defendant tailored his testimony to that of the other witnesses. He contends that such a \u201ctactic strikes at the heart of the exercise of a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d and, therefore, \u201cis both grossly improper and highly prejudicial.\u201d Defendant further argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct also warrants reversal of the conviction because the summation suggested he improperly utilized the services of counsel at his trial. On the other hand, the State contends that the prosecutor\u2019s summation constituted a proper comment on the credibility of defendant\u2019s testimony and, therefore, does not provide a basis to disturb \u201cthe justly rendered verdict in this case.\u201d The State further argues that the trial court properly \u201cguided the jury on how to evaluate witness credibility in light of the summation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">There was no objection to the comment, and counsel\u2019s failure to raise an error at trial is usually taken to mean that counsel did not consider the alleged error to be a significant part of the trial. It also deprives the trial judge of an opportunity to cure any defect. <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 333, 273 A.2d 1 (1971). Nonetheless, an issue not raised in the trial court may \u201cin extraordinary circumstances\u201d be considered on appeal if it meets the \u201cplain error\u201d standard. <em>Ibid.; R. </em>2:10-2. Under the plain error standard any trial error or omission shall be disregarded by us unless it was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2. <em>See also State v. Bakka, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>533, 547-48, 826 A.2d 604 (2003). In order to be so considered, the error must be \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 336, 273 A.2d 1. Of course, an error of constitutional magnitude may be more likely to constitute \u201cplain error\u201d than any other error at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 341, 273 A.2d 1. <em>See also </em>PRESSLER, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment <em>R. </em>2:10-2 (Gann).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">A defendant in a criminal trial has the constitutionally protected right to confront the witnesses appearing against him or her and to have the assistance of counsel. <em>U.S. Const, amend. </em>VI; <em>N.J. Const, </em>art I, par. 10. The right of confrontation guarantees the defendant the opportunity to hear and cross-examine government witnesses and to call defense witnesses before deciding, with the assistance of counsel, whether or not to take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>stand as a witness and testify. <em>See Brooks v. Tennessee, </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>605, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1891, 82 L. Ed.2d 358 (1972) (finding statute requiring defendant to testify first for the defense, or not at all, violates right against self-incrimination and due process); <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>337, 338, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1057, 1058, 25 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 353, 356 (1970) (Sixth Amendment provides \u201cright to be present in the court room at every stage of [the] trial\u201d). Nevertheless, the United States Supreme Court has recently held it is not unconstitutional \u201cfor a prosecutor, in [his or] her summation, to call the jury\u2019s attention to the fact that the defendant had the opportunity to hear all other witnesses testify and to tailor his testimony accordingly.\u201d <em>Portuondo v. Agard, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>61, 63, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>1119, 1122, 146 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 47, 52 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">In <em>Portuondo </em>the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit and, over Justice Ginsburg\u2019s dissent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> reinstated the District Court\u2019s denial of a writ of habeas corpus, which challenged a conviction for sodomy and weapons possession. <em>Id., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 63-65, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1121-1123, 146 L.Ed.2d at 52-53. There, the prosecutor had stated during summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">[UJnlike all the other witnesses in this case the defendant has a benefit ... he gets to sit here and listen to the testimony of all the other witnesses before he testifies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">That gives you a big advantage, doesn\u2019t it. You get to sit here and think what am I going to say and how am I going to say it? How am I going to fit it into the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">He\u2019s a smart man. I never said he was stupid ... He used everything to his advantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\"><em>[Portuondo v. Agard, supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 64, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1121, 146 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 53.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The Court concluded that the federal constitution did not require the prosecutor to treat defendant differently from other witnesses in terms of commenting on their credibility. <em>Id., </em>529 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number><em>U.S. </em>at 73, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1127, 146 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 58-59. When witnesses testify, their credibility can be called into question, and the same is true when a defendant takes the stand. <em>Id., </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 69,120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1125, 146 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d at 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Speaking through Justice Scalia, the Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s summation did not violate the Fifth, Sixth or Fourteenth Amendments to the federal constitution. According to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-7\">The defendant\u2019s right to hold the prosecution to proving its case without his assistance is not to be impaired by the jury\u2019s counting the defendant\u2019s silence at trial against him \u2014 and upon request the court must instruct the jury to that effect. See <em>Carter v. Kentucky, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>288,101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1112, 67 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 241 (1981). It is <em>reasonable enough to expect </em>a jury to comply with that instruction since, as we observed in <em>[Griffin v. California, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>609, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1229, 14 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 106 (1965)J, the inference of guilt from silence is not always \u201cnatural or irresistible.\u201d 380 <em>U.S. </em>at 615, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106. A defendant might refuse to testify simply out of fear that he will be made to look bad by clever counsel, or fear \u201c \u2018that his prior convictions will prejudice the jury.\u2019 \u201d \u201c <em>Ibid, (quoting People v. Modesto, </em>62 <em>Cal.2d </em>436, 453, 42 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>417, 398 <em>P.2d </em>753, 763 (1965) (en banc)). By contrast, it <em>is </em>natural and irresistible for a jury, in evaluating the relative credibility of a defendant who testifies last, to have in mind and weigh in the balance the fact that he heard the testimony of all those who preceded him. It is one thing (as <em>Griffin </em>requires) for the jury to evaluate all the <em>other </em>evidence in the case without giving any effect to the defendant\u2019s refusal to testify; it is something else (and quite impossible) for the jury to evaluate the credibility of the defendant\u2019s testimony while blotting out from its mind the fact that before giving the testimony the defendant had been sitting there listening to the other witnesses. Thus, the principle respondent asks us to adopt here differs from what we adopted in <em>Griffin </em>in one or the other of the following respects: It either prohibits inviting the jury to do what the jury is perfectly entitled to do; or it requires the jury to do what is practically impossible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">Second, <em>Griffin </em>prohibited comments that suggest a defendant\u2019s silence is \u201cevidence of <em>guilt.\u201d </em>380 <em>U.S., </em>at 615, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1229, 14 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>106 (emphasis added); see also <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>25, 32, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>864, 99 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 23 (1988) (\u201c <em>\u2018Griffin </em>prohibits the judge and prosecutor from suggesting to the jury that it may treat the defendant\u2019s silence as substantive evidence of guilt\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 <em>U.S. </em>308, 319, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1551, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>810 (1976)). The prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case, by contrast, concerned respondent\u2019s <em>credibility as a witness, </em>and were therefore in accord with our longstanding rule that when a defendant takes the stand, \u201chis credibility may be impeached and his testimony assailed like that of any other witness.\u201d <em>Brown v. United States, </em>356 <em>U.S. </em>148, 154, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>622, 2 L.Ed.2d 589 (1958). \u201c]W]hen <em>(&amp; </em>defendant] assumes the role of a witness, the rules that generally apply to other witnesses \u2014 rules that serve the truth-seeking function of the trial \u2014 are generally applicable to him as well.\u201d <em>Perry v. Leeke, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>272, 282, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>594, 102 L.Ed.2d 624 (1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>See also <em>Reagan v.

A witness\u2019s ability to hear prior testimony and to tailor his account accordingly, and the threat that ability presents to the integrity of the trial, are no different when it is the defendant doing the listening. Allowing comment upon the fact that a defendant\u2019s presence in the courtroom provides him a unique opportunity to tailor his testimony is appropriate \u2014 and indeed, given the inability to sequester the defendant, sometimes essential \u2014 to the central function of the trial, which is to discover the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\"><em>[Portuondo v. Agard, supra, </em>529 <em>U.S. </em>at 73, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1127, 146 L.Ed.2d at 59.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Defendant urges us not to follow the federal precedent and to give him the greater protection frequently afforded to criminal defendants under the New Jersey Constitution. In <em>State v. Buscham, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 366, 823 A.2d 71 (App.Div.2003), we declined to consider that question because defendant did not raise it, and found no \u201cplain error\u201d with respect to a similar summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">The New Jersey Constitution of 1947 was adopted prior to the incorporation or absorption of provisions of the federal Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment, making those rights applicable to the States. <em>See, e.g., Mapp v. Ohio </em>367 <em>U.S. </em>643, 81 <em>S.Ct. </em>1684, 6 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1081 (1961) (Fourth Amendment); <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 <em>US. </em>1, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>1489, 12 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>653 (1964) (Fifth Amendment); <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965) (Sixth Amendment). Our constitution in various sections provides for the citizens of New Jersey rights guaranteed in identical or similar terms as those in the Bill of Rights. Other rights are provided in different language. In either event, our Supreme Court has made clear that, in certain respects, our Constitution can and does provide greater protection for the citizens of New Jersey than the comparable provisions of the federal constitution. <em>State v. Carty, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>632, 650-51, 790 A.2d 903 (2002) (articulable suspicion necessary as prerequisite to seek consent to search an automobile); <em>State v. Cooke, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>657, 666-71, 751 A.2d 92 (2000) (probable cause and exigent circumstances needed to search automobile); <em>State v. Pierce, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>184, 208-15, 642 A.2d 947 (1994) (search of vehicle incident to arrest for motor vehicle violation); <em>State v. Novembrino, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>95, 144-47, 154-59, 519 A.2d 820 (1987) (no good faith exception to warrant requirement); <em>State v. Alston, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>211, 225-30, 440 A.2d 1311 (1981) (automatic standing if charged with possession or proprietary interest); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 353-54, 346 A.2d 66 (1975) (knowledge of right not to consent required for valid consent search). The greater protection, however, cannot flow from the feeling or whim of a judge or panel of judges. It must flow from some history, intent, or language of the drafters designed to provide for the greater protection. Where the language of our State constitution contains similar language, as Article I, paragraph 10 does regarding the Sixth Amendment, there should be some intent or historical support for the proposition that our drafters were providing something different than the drafters of the federal constitution. <em>See, e.g., Joye v. Hunterdon Central High School, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>568, 607-08, 826 A.2d 624 (2003); <em>id. </em>at 636, 826 A.2d 624 (requiring analysis of \u201cmatters of particular state interest or local concern, state traditions, and public attitudes to determine whether a particular situation calls for greater protection under the state constitution\u201d) (LaVecchia, J. dissenting); <em>State v. Williams, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>39, 57, 459 A.2d 641 (1983); <em>State v. Hunt, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>338, 450 A.2d 952 (1982); <em>id. </em>at 350-58, 450 A.2d 952 (Pashman, J.concurring); <em>id. </em>at 358-68, 450 A.2d 952 (Handler, J. concurring); Garibaldi, Remark: <em>Conference on the Rehnquist Court: \u201cThe Rehnquist Court and State Constitutional Law,\u201d </em>34 <em>Tulsa L.J. </em>67, 83 (1998). Where the language is different, the wording, purpose or intent of that language must be examined in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Article I, paragraph 10 of the New Jersey Constitution affords the defendant the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him\u201d and \u201cto have the assistance of counsel in his defense.\u201d <em>N.J. Const., </em>art. I, par. 10 (1947). There is nothing we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>are referred to, or can find, in its wording, intent or history to suggest that this paragraph of the New Jersey Constitution grants a defendant greater protection than the Sixth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., State v. Davenport, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>288, 302, 827 A.2d 1063 (2003) (finding that the right to counsel under <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, par. 10 is substantially identical and co-extensive with federal constitutional rights); <em>State v. Bey, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 466, 610 A.2d 403 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>19, 611 A.2d 657 (1992) (finding federal and state constitutional rights to counsel as co-extensive); <em>State v. Washington, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 191, 494 A.2d 335 (App.Div.1985) (finding that New Jersey protects an accused\u2019s right of confrontation by \u201cparroting\u201d the language of the Sixth Amendment in the state constitution). <em>See also State v. Garron, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>147, 168-69, 827 A.2d 243 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In fact, long before <em>Portuondo </em>was decided, we found no problem with a summation that included the allegation that defendant\u2019s testimony \u201ccomported with the other stories that were presented in a way which I would point at and say it looks incredible to me. It doesn\u2019t look credible. It looks unbelievable. It looks like something fabricated.\u201d <em>State v. Robinson, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 120, 384 A.2d 569 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>484, 391 A.2d 498 (1978). In <em>Robinson, </em>the prosecutor also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">He [defendant] was sitting here while Mr. Buniak testified. Mr. Buniak told us he used a specific mortar, a specific color in making mortar ... When I asked Mr. Robinson [defendant] about that, he said he used the same color. He had the ability to sit here and listen to the other witnesses testify____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\"><em>[State v. Robinson, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 119, 384 A.2d 569.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">In reversing an order granting a new trial, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments did not in any way deprive defendant of his right to confront the witnesses against him or of his right to be present at his trial. Obviously he did confront these witnesses and was present at his trial. And a reasonable reading of the comments clearly reveals that they were a comment on the credibility of defendant\u2019s testimony. It is well settled that when a defendant waives his right to remain silent and takes the stand in his own defense, he thereby subjects himself to cross-examination as to the credibility of his story. And that issue would involve whether the story had been fabricated. <em>State v. Kimbrough, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>57, 67, 262 A.2d 232 (App.Div.1970); <em>State v. Burt, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 393, 258 A.2d 711 (App.Div.1969), <em>aff'd, o.b. </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>156, 279 A.2d 850 (1971), cert <em>denied, </em>404 <em>U.S. </em>1047, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>728, 30 L.Ed.2d 735 (1972). Here the issue of defendant\u2019s credibility was whether his testimony was tailored to that of the testimony of other witnesses, a perfectly proper inquiry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">[State <em>v. Robinson, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 120, 384 A.2d 569.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-7\"><em>See also, State v. Munoz, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>204, 217-19, 774 A.2d 515 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>610, 782 A.2d 427 (2001)(finding that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during summation about defense counsel\u2019s role in distorting the facts, by themselves, were not \u201csufficiently egregious to deprive defendant of his right to a fair trial,\u201d where the judge immediately instructed the jury to ignore the comment about the alibi being \u201cconcocted\u201d with defense counsel). Accordingly, the mere mention of defendant\u2019s right to be present and to hear all the witnesses before he or she testified does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Prosecutors are \u201caccorded considerable latitude in summing up the State\u2019s case forcefully and graphically and to pursue the prosecutorial duty with earnestness and vigor.\u201d <em>State v. Tilghman, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>571, 575, 786 A.2d 128 (App.Div.2001). <em>See also State v. Munoz, supra, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 217-18, 774 A.2d 515. Nonetheless, they \u201chave the overriding obligation to see that justice is fairly done,\u201d <em>Tilghman, supra, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 575, 786 A.2d 128, and we are obligated to reverse a conviction based on a prosecutor\u2019s summation where the misconduct \u201cis so egregious that it operates to deprive defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Lopez, </em>359 <em>N.J.Super. </em>222, 238, 819 A.2d <em>486 </em>(App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>576, 832 A.2d 326 (2003). To determine whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments were so prejudicial and egregious, we \u201cmust consider (1) whether defense counsel made timely and proper objections ...; (2) whether the remarks were withdrawn promptly; and (3) whether the court ordered'the remarks [be] stricken from the record and instructed the jury to disregard them.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 83, 727 A.2d 1 (1999)). We will not hesitate to reverse a conviction, even on the grounds of plain error, where the prosecutor\u2019s summation crosses the line and is essentially a comment on the exercise of the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>to be present at trial or on the defendant\u2019s right to hear all the testimony before taking the stand. A suggestion that the defendant or his or her counsel did something inappropriate by having defendant observe the trial or obtained some unfair advantage, before deciding what to say, warrants reversal. <em>Cf. State v. Eason, </em>138 <em>N.J.Super. </em>249, 259, 350 A.2d 506 (App.Div.1975) (noting, while reversing on other grounds, that a comment was \u201cbetter ... left unsaid\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Here the comments were directed to defendant\u2019s credibility as a witness. They did not emphasize that defendant had an unfair advantage because he sat through the trial when others did not. Rather, the summation was truly directed at credibility and referred to the evidence at length. While it is true defendant\u2019s testimony could be read to be compatible with all the State\u2019s evidence, including his testimony that Mumbles stopped at his home for only thirty seconds which was significant in light of timing, the quoted portion of the summation must be read in context with the remainder of the summation, which included a lengthy recitation of the evidence and why defendant\u2019s version was incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Once the defendant waived his right to remain silent and took the stand to testify, he subjected himself to an attack on his credibility. As in <em>Robinson, supra, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 120, 384 A.2d 569, the comments were not improper because they were a general attack on credibility and did not constitute an improper or critical reference to the exercise of a constitutional right. Nor could the passing reference to the assistance of counsel be understood as a criticism of defendant or suggestion that counsel did something improper. <em>State v. Tilghman, supra, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 576-78, 786 A.2d 128; <em>State v. Munoz, supra, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 217-19, 774 A.2d 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s comments here did not deprive defendant of his right to counsel, to be present at trial, to confrontation or to due process. Moreover, the State\u2019s case was strong, there was no objection to the summation, there is no claim that any inadmissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>evidence was introduced or that, other than by virtue of the summation, there is any other basis for reversal. Finally, we note that the trial judge properly charged the jury that anything said by either attorney in summation was not evidence and should not be treated as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b398-11\"> Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer concurred, joined in much of Justice Ginsburg's opinion in which Justice Souter joined.
