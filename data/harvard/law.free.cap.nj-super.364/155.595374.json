The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our consideration of the issues advanced on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">W.M. was born on February 27,1986. On January 10, 2003, he was charged in the Family Part with acts of delinquency purport<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>edly occurring in September 2002 when he was age sixteen which, if committed by an adult, would constitute second-degree aggravated assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12 \u2014 1(b), and third-degree endangering the welfare of a child under age sixteen, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. 2C:24-A. </em>The delinquency charges filed against W.M. arose from the following circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">On January 5, 2003, the badly decomposed body of F.W., a seven-year-old male child was discovered at 188 Parker Street in Newark. R.W., F.W.\u2019s twin brother, and their four-year-old brother, T.H., were also found at the Parker Street address; they were alive but in poor health. A police investigation disclosed that in September 2002, these three children had been living in Irving-ton in the care of W.M.\u2019s mother. W.M. often played rough with F.W. and his brothers. At that time and place, W.M. was wrestling with F.W. when W.M. placed F.W.\u2019s head in a \u201cheadlock,\u201d drove his knee into F.W.\u2019s abdomen several times, and then flipped F.W. over his right shoulder, causing F.W.\u2019s head to hit the edge of the bed and then bounce a few times when it struck the floor. W.M. heard F.W. make a \u201cgurgling\u201d sound like he was trying to breathe, prompting W.M. to get his mother, who placed ice on F.W.\u2019s head; W.M. then left the house and never saw F.W. again.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">An autopsy of F.W.\u2019s body disclosed that the cause of the child\u2019s death was homicidal violence, including blunt impacts to the head and abdomen. The injuries that caused F.W.\u2019s death were consistent with being caused by the described conduct of W.M. toward F.W. in September 2002, during the wrestling incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">After the delinquency complaint was filed against W.M., the State filed a timely motion in the Family Part pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26 and <em>Rule </em>5:22-2, seeking waiver of that court\u2019s jurisdiction over the delinquency complaints filed against W.M., and referral of the matter to the Law Division and prosecuting authority for the prosecution of W.M. as an adult. A hearing was conducted in the Family Part before Judge Troiano on the State\u2019s waiver application on March 4, 2003, after which the judge entered an order granting the State\u2019s motion and directing that the matter be transferred to the Law Division and the Essex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office for further proceedings against W.M. as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">On March 10, 2003, an adult criminal complaint was filed against W.M., charging him with second-degree aggravated assault and third-degree endangering the welfare of a child. W.M.\u2019s motion for leave to appeal from the March 4, 2003 waiver decision was denied by an order entered in this court on May 28, 2003. <em>See State in the Interest of R.L., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410, 414, 495 A.2d 172, 175 (App.Div.) (holding that a juvenile waiver order is an interlocutory order which may be appealed only by leave granted), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>357, 508 A.2d 226 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Upon granting the State\u2019s waiver application, a hearing was conducted in the Family Part before Judge Troiano on May 6, 2003 and June 6, 2003, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-36 and <em>Rule </em>5:22-3, to determine whether W.M., while in custody pending trial, should be remanded to the Essex County Juvenile Detention Facility (juvenile facility) or to the Essex County Jail (adult facility), pending resolution of the adult charges. W.M. had been housed at the juvenile facility since the delinquency charges were filed against him in January 2003. During the hearing, counsel for W.M. presented several witnesses in support of his position that he should remain at the juvenile facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Dr. Matthew B. Johnson, a psychologist, examined W.M. at the juvenile facility on several occasions and administered various tests designed to measure achievement, intelligence, and depression. Dr. Johnson\u2019s April 17, 2003 report setting forth his findings was admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Dr. Johnson testified that W.M. has significant academic deficits, with an I.Q. of 79, \u201cwhich is below the average level but above the level for mental deficiency and mental retardation.\u201d Dr. Johnson also found that W.M. had a moderate level of depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Citing to W.M.\u2019s social immaturity, his academic and intellectual deficits, the need for continuity of W.M.\u2019s educational program at the juvenile facility, W.M.\u2019s proteeted-custody status at the juvenile facility, the high level of publicity of the case, and the danger of assault against W.M., Dr. Johnson testified that transferring W.M. to the adult facility would be contrary to his best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Eleanor Elcock, a substance awareness coordinator at the juvenile facility, described the educational programs made available to its inmates, and W.M.\u2019s participation therein. Ms. Elcock explained that an alternative high school program, known as Sojourn High School, provides on-site, high-school level instruction to juveniles incarcerated at the juvenile facility. Ms. Elcock stated that W.M. was enrolled in Sojourn\u2019s high school equivalency diploma (G.E.D.) program and attended classes from approximately 8:00 a.m. to approximately 2:15 p.m., five days each week. Ms. Elcock testified that W.M. was progressing well at the juvenile facility and expressed concern for W.M.\u2019s safety if transferred to the adult facility. Ms. Elcock noted that W.M. was making progress toward obtaining his diploma and was being prepared to take the G.E.D. test in August 2003. Ms. Elcock asserted that juveniles brought from the adult facility to the juvenile facility to attend the educational program received only two hours of instruction each day.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Keith Ali, Warden of the adult facility, testified that juveniles waived to adult court who are incarcerated at the adult facility are all housed \u201con the third floor of the jail on a tier restricted policyf,]\u201d where there are ten cells. He explained that the juveniles are sight-and-sound segregated from the adult population, and are provided recreational, library and school privileges. The waived juveniles also receive their meals on their tier or in the day room adjacent to their cells.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Warden Ali stated that the waived juveniles are transported each day to the juvenile facility, where they receive the benefit of the Sojourn educational program from approximately 8:30 a.m. to sometime prior to 3:00 p.m., when they arrive back at the adult facility. He disagreed with Ms. Eleock\u2019s statement that inmates transported to the juvenile facility only received two hours of instruction each day. Warden Ali explained that the juveniles are awakened at 6:00 a.m. for breakfast and then are ready by approximately 7:30 a.m. for transport to the juvenile facility to participate in the educational program. In response to questioning concerning W.M.\u2019s enrollment in the Sojourn G.E.D. program and his need for approximately six hours of instruction each weekday, Warden Ali stated he would accommodate that need, and would guarantee that W.M. would receive the full six hours of instruction that he was then presently receiving at the juvenile facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Warden Ali also stated that juveniles housed at the adult facility are permitted visitors for one hour each day. Contact visits, however, are not permitted; a glass partition separates the inmate from the visitor. Attorney visits are also permitted in the first floor attorney\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Dana C. Hobson, Director of the juvenile facility, testified that the authorized capacity of that facility is 242, and that the population of detained juveniles housed there is always either at or above capacity; at the time he testified, the detained juvenile population was 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Director Hobson testified that W.M. was in protective custody \u201cdue to concern for his safety. His case was highly publicized[,]\u201d and \u201cit was felt that we should take precautions with him at the facility.\u201d Director Hobson explained that W.M. is housed in a separate area of the facility with other juveniles in protective custody, but \u201c[h]e doesn\u2019t come in contact with the general population on a regular basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Director Hobson stated that inmates at the juvenile facility are permitted contact visits with their family members, as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>attorney visits. On the education issue, Director Hobson testified he and Warden Ali would fully cooperate to ensure that W.M. received the amount of class instruction recommended by his instructors.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">W.T., W.M.\u2019s father also testified, stating he felt the best interests and safety of W.M., as well as the continuity of his education, required W.M\u2019s continued detention at the juvenile facility. W.T. also noted that his visitation access to W.M. would be more restricted at the adult facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">W.M.\u2019s extensive prior record of delinquency was also presented to the trial court. On June 4, 2001, W.M. pled guilty to assault and robbery. The disposition imposed was a two-year term of imprisonment at the Jamesburg Training School for Boys, which was suspended; W.M. was placed on probation for a two-year period. On June 18, 2002, W.M. was adjudicated delinquent on a charge of possession of a controlled dangerous substance with the intent to distribute; the disposition imposed was an eighteen-month period of probation. Additionally, W.M. had been charged with two separate violations of the terms of his probation and bench warrants for his arrest were issued; the bench warrants were executed in January 2003, and those matters were still pending at the time of the waiver proceedings. In August 2001, W.M. was charged, in two separate complaints, with receiving stolen property and narcotics offenses; those matters were also still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Subsequent to the detention-placement hearing, counsel submitted written summations. On July 30, 2003, Judge Troiano issued a written decision and entered an order directing the transfer of W.M. from the juvenile facility to the adult facility, effective August 15, 2003. In his decision, the judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">The rule and statute clearly provide that the court must determine what is in the best interest of the juvenile considering various factors including age, intelligence, maturity, protection of the public, seriousness of the offense, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">The court makes the following findings of fact. The juvenile is presently 17 years of age and has been charged with an aggravated assault against a much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>younger child. He has been the product of a dysfunctional family. He has been diagnosed by Dr. Reeves, a psychiatrist, with a conduct disorder. The defense expert diagnosed the juvenile with an adjustment disorder and opines that a blow to the head at an earlier age of 12 had a negative impact on his academic and intellectual abilities. However, he provides no evidence to support this opinion. He also finds the juvenile to be depressed which could be worsened by his transfer to the adult jail. Again, however, he provides no support for this opinion. Depression is a readily treatable condition through medication, which can be monitored whether at the [adult facility] or the [juvenile facility]. This court was not persuaded by the testimony of Dr. Johnson. There does not appear to be any significant physical or medical disability affecting this juvenile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">This juvenile has had a significant prior involvement with the authorities as a result of substantive offenses, violations of probation and bench warrants for failure to appear. Although having a relatively low I.Q., he is clearly able to communicate, understand, function and survive in a home with very little positive adult influence and in a community where he has had to rely on his wits and \u201cstreet smarts.\u201d Although his formal education has been limited, the efforts he has made to acquire his GED have been significant. Eleanor Elcock, who is a Substance Abuse Awareness Coordinator at the [juvenile facility] and who has been directly involved in the establishment of the Sojourn School, has been impressed by the juvenile\u2019s efforts and willingness to gain the education that he decided that he wants. Clearly, he has an appropriate level of intelligence and maturity. It appears he is cooperative and most receptive to all instructional activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">It is clear that juveniles when waived are transferred to an area of the [adult facility] where they are kept sound and sight separated from adult inmates. The maximum number of these detainees is ten. The [adult facility] and the [juvenile facility] recently established a program allowing the transfer on a daily basis from the [adult facility] to the [juvenile facility] of those waived juveniles for purposes of continuing education and recreation. It must be accepted and understood that both the [adult facility] and the [juvenile facility] are custodial settings. The [juvenile facility] has only recently been averaging at or below its maximum capacity of 242. Assaults, harassment and inappropriate behavior are common. The special section of the [adult facility] is specifically separated to assure no contact with the adult population. There is ample time and space allotted for family and attorney [contact]. The maximum number of residents does not exceed ten thus minimizing inappropriate conduct. Although the individual cells are smaller and do not contain desks and visits are no-contact, these factors are not significant enough to persuade the court that the juvenile would suffer by this move.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">It is the conclusion of the court that although there are certain inconveniences in being maintained in the separate section of the [adult facility], as a whole the best interests of this juvenile would not be adversely affected by his transfer to the [adult facility].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">On appeal, W.M. argues that the evidence does not support the findings of the court, and that the judge misapplied his discretion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>and the law, in ordering that W.M. be transferred from the juvenile facility to the adult facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We begin our analysis of the issues advanced on appeal by briefly discussing certain established principles. The scope of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s fact-finding function is limited; the factual findings of the trial court are binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-12, 713 A.2d 390, 398-99 (1998); <em>O\u2019Connor v. O\u2019Connor, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>381, 400-01, 793 A.2d 810, 823-24 (App.Div.2002); <em>State in Interest of J.G., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>21, 33-34, 726 A.2d 948, 954-55 (App.Div.1999). \u201cThe aim of appellate review of factual findings is to \u2018determine whether the findings made could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence <em>present in the record.\u2019 \u201d State in Interest of B.C.L., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>362, 379, 413 A.2d 335, 344 (1980) (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809, 817 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The factual findings and legal conclusions of a trial judge should not be disturbed unless \u201cthey are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.\u201d <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495, 500 (1974). Moreover, \u201c[b]ecause of the family courts\u2019 special jurisdiction and expertise in family matters, appellate courts should accord deference to family court factfinding.\u201d <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 413, 713 A.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">In considering the applicable standard of review to the Family Part\u2019s decision on the detention placement of the waived juvenile, we are guided by those standards applied to appellate review of the waiver decision itself. Waiver of a juvenile offender for trial as an adult in the Law Division pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26 is highly discretionary and will not be disturbed unless it is shown that the discretion has been misapplied. <em>See State v. Bessix, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>126, 128-29, 706 A.2d 799, 800-01 (App.Div.1998); <em>State v. Matarama, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>6, 16-17, 703 A.2d 278, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>283-84 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>50, 707 A.2d 154 (1998); <em>State v. Onque, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 584, 676 A.2d 560, 563 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>497, 683 A.2d 200 (1996). The standard of review applicable to the waiver decision was articulated by the Supreme Court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">A word on the subject of appellate review. Here, as in other areas, the criminal justice system reposes this solemn responsibility in the sound discretion of the trial court. In the analogous transfer of jurisdiction to diversionary programs such as pretrial intervention or conditional discharge, the standard of review (with some variations) is whether the correct legal standard has been applied, whether inappropriate factors have been considered, and whether the exercise of discretion constituted a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d in all of the circumstances. <em>State v. Humphreys, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>4, 13[, 444 A.2d 569, 573] (1982) (citations omitted). The analysis evokes the three-part test of <em>State v. Roth, </em>[95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363-64, 471 A.2d 370, 386-87 (1984)], that 1) findings of fact be grounded in competent, reasonably credible evidence, 2) correct legal principles be applied, and 3) the judicial power to modify a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion will be applied only when there is a clear error of judgment that shocks the judicial conscience. The best measure of a waiver decision will be found in the court\u2019s statement of reasons. More is needed than the judge\u2019s individual call; specific factors must be delineated on the record. Once the particular standards legally applicable are followed and there is sufficient evidence in the record, the trial court decision should not be subjected to second-guessing in the appellate process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\"><em>[State v. R.G.D., </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15, 527 A.2d 834, 841 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We discern no reason to apply a different standard to appellate review of the Family Part\u2019s determination of the detention placement of the waived juvenile. Accordingly, we must determine whether the findings of fact by the trial judge are supported by substantial, credible evidence contained in the record; whether the judge correctly applied the statutory standards to those factual findings; and whether the exercise of discretion by the judge represented a clear error of judgment that shocks our judicial conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">We first examine the statutory criteria. Upon waiver and referral of a matter to the adult court pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-36 addresses the issue of detention of juveniles, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">a. If the court waives jurisdiction over a case and refers that case to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority, there shall be a hearing before the court waiving jurisdiction to decide whether to remand the juvenile to a juvenile or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>adult detention facility. The decision shall be based on the best interests of the juvenile and protection of the public, and shall take into account such factors as the juvenile\u2019s age and maturity, the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, the juvenile\u2019s prior offense history, the programs at each of the detention facilities, and any other relevant factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">b. No juvenile who has been waived to an appropriate adult court may be remanded to an adult detention facility prior to the hearing provided for in subsection a.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">It is evident from the plain language of the statute that, in determining whether the waived, incarcerated juvenile shall be housed in the juvenile or adult facility, the court must make its decision based on the best interests of the juvenile and protection of the public, considering the enumerated statutory factors. We conclude that the test for consideration of evidence in this statutory calculus under the residual, \u201cany other relevant factors\u201d provision, is whether that evidence is relevant to \u201cthe best interests of the juvenile\u201d or \u201cprotection of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In reviewing the Family Part\u2019s decision to remand W.M. to the adult facility, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-36(a) requires consideration of the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense charged!.]\u201d In addition to the specific alleged facts that form the basis for the subject charge, we interpret that factor to include the \u201cnature\u201d of that charge as it relates to the standards established for waiver in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26. We reach this conclusion because the extent of the State\u2019s burden of proof in a waiver case depends solely upon the \u201cnature\u201d of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The procedure and criteria for waiver of Family Part jurisdiction over incidents that form the basis for a delinquency complaint against a juvenile, and referral of that matter to the Law Division and prosecuting authority for prosecution of the juvenile as an adult are set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26. Where the juvenile is charged with a so-called \u201cchart 1\u201d offense, as delineated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26a(2)(a), the State need not demonstrate \u201cthat the nature and circumstances of the charge or the prior record of the juvenile are sufficiently serious that the interests of the public require waiver.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26a(3). Additionally, when a juvenile is charged with a Chart 1 offense, \u201c!i]n 2000, the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ture amended <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26e] of the Juvenile Code to eliminate the right of a juvenile sixteen years of age or older to defeat a prosecutor\u2019s motion to waive a charge of a Chart 1 offense to adult court by showing a probability of rehabilitation before the age of nineteen.\u201d <em>State in Interest of R.C., </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>248, 250, 798 A.2d 111, 113 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Here, W.M. was charged with an act of delinquency which, if committed by an adult would constitute second-degree aggravated assault, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-l(b)(l). That charge is among those determined by the Legislature to be more serious, or \u201cChart 1\u201d offenses, for which the State\u2019s burden on a waiver application has been lessened, and the focus of the court\u2019s inquiry narrowed. Because W.M. was age sixteen at the time the offense was allegedly committed, the State only bore the burden to establish \u201cprobable cause to believe that the juvenile committed [the] delinquent act[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-26a(2)(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The probability of W.M\u2019s rehabilitation prior to age nineteen and whether that probability \u201csubstantially outweigh[ed] the reasons for waiver,\u201d was irrelevant. <em>See N.J.SA </em>2A:4A-26(e). The Legislature has made a conscious decision to treat acts that constitute Chart 1 offenses more seriously. Accordingly, when considering the detention placement of a waived juvenile, the court should consider whether the \u201cnature\u201d of the charge is a Chart 1 offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">After analyzing the record in the light of the oral and written arguments advanced by the parties, we conclude that the factual findings of the trial judge are supported by substantial, credible evidence contained in the record, and could reasonably have been reached based on that evidence. W.M.\u2019s contentions to the contrary are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Specifically, W.M. argues the State submitted <em>no </em>expert testimony and that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s rejection of the testimony of Dr. Johnson. We disagree. It is well established that the trier of fact is not bound to accept expert opinion, <em>State v. Berry, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>280, 301, 658 A.2d 702, 713 (1995), \u201ceven if it is unrebutted by any other evidence.\u201d <em>Torres v. Schripps, Inc., </em>342 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419, 431, 776 A.2d 915, 921 (App.Div.2001). Moreover, expert opinion \u201cneed not be given greater weight than other evidence nor more weight than it would otherwise deserve in light of common sense and experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 776 A.2d at 921.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Here, Judge Troiano found unpersuasive Dr. Johnson\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the transfer of W.M. to the adult facility would not be in the juvenile\u2019s best interests, and said why. There was sufficient, credible evidence in the record from which the judge could reasonably have reached that conclusion. Dr. Johnson painted the picture of a juvenile with serious intellectual and social deficiencies who would be endangered in the adult facility. However, Ms. Elcock described W.M. as progressing well in the educational program offered at the juvenile facility, and stated he was capable of earning a G.E.D. and a good candidate for enrolling in the college courses in the \u201cDistant Learning [program] through Burlington County College.\u201d Director Hobson testified that W.M. was enrolled in \u201cMath, English, earth science, U.S. history, art, career exploration, exploration of computers and reading, physical education[ ]\u201d courses and he had attained grades of \u201cB\u201d in five courses and \u201cA\u201d in two courses. Accordingly, there was sufficient, credible evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s rejection of Dr. Johnson\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Additionally, the judge rejected Dr. Johnson\u2019s suggestion that a possible prior concussion suffered by W.M. in 1998 impaired W.M.\u2019s cognitive and intellectual abilities and, thus, was relevant on the issue of his detention placement. The court found that opinion inconsistent with the testimony of Ms. Elcock concerning W.M.\u2019s progress in the educational program. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>rejection of Dr. Johnson\u2019s opinion and the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]here does not appear to be any significant physical or medical disability affecting\u201d W.M. could reasonably have been reached based upon sufficient, credible evidence contained in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">W.M. also contends that in concluding \u201cthe best interests of this juvenile would not be adversely affected by his transfer to the [adult facility,]\u201d the trial court applied an incorrect standard. W.M. argues that 'the statutory standard requires a placement that serves the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the juvenile, not a finding as to whether placement in the adult facility would adversely affect those best interests. Although W.M. correctly recites the \u201cbest interests\u201d portion of the statutory standard, we do not agree that the trial court applied the wrong standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The referenced wording in the judge\u2019s written decision must be read in conjunction with the totality of the decision, and in the context of it addressing Dr. Johnson\u2019s testimony that W.M.\u2019s best interests would be adversely affected if he were to be transferred to the adult facility. A fair reading of Judge Troiano\u2019s written decision reflects application of the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard in conjunction with the relevant statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">W.M. was charged with committing a Chart 1 offense at age sixteen; his prior offense history was significant and indicative of a lack of control; the programs at each of the detention facilities were comparable, including continuance of his educational program at the adult facility at the same level of participation while he was housed at the juvenile facility; and the safety concerns were unfounded in light of the uncontroverted evidence that juveniles housed in the adult facility are sight-and-sound segregated from the adult population into a small control group of ten or less inmates. We can find no misapplication of discretion by the trial court in entering the July 30, 2003 order directing that W.M. be transferred to the adult facility for detention pending resolution of the charges filed against him. Moreover, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>circumstances disclosed by the record on appeal, that decision does not shock our judicial conscience.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\"> This information had been obtained from W.M.'s statement given to representatives of the Essex County Prosecutor's Office on January 10, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\"> The investigator's report concerning W.M.\u2019s statement and the medical examiner's post-mortem report of F.W. were admitted into evidence during the waiver hearing, but are not contained in the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> Although not relevant to the issues on appeal, we note \"that a prosecutor's motion for waiver to adult court of a juvenile complaint that falls within the Attorney General's Guidelines must be accompanied by a copy of the prosecutor\u2019s statement of reasons and that a prosecutor's waiver decision is subject to judicial review.\" <em>R.C., supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 250-51, 798 A.2d at 113.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
