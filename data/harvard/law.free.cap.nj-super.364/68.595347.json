Caplan appeals from the court\u2019s rulings on issues of child support, counsel fees, and management of certain trust funds, as memorialized in the supplemental final judgment entered on February 20, 2002, and from an order issued on May 15, 2002, denying her motion for reconsideration. Defendant cross-appeals, contending the trial judge improperly required him to contribute toward expenses unrelated to the children\u2019s needs, and that the effective date of the child support determination was erroneous. The following factual and procedural history is relevant to our consideration of the issues advanced on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The parties were married on April 17,1988. Two children were bom of the marriage: Daniel, on July 26, 1989; and Jacob, on December 12, 1991. Plaintiff was born on April 29, 1963; defendant was born on November 4, 1963. The complaint for divorce was filed on January 12, 1998; an answer and counterclaim for divorce was filed on March 23,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The parties entered into mediation and, on January 30, 2001, executed a settlement agreement resolving issues of custody, parenting time, equitable distribution, and alimony. Pursuant to that agreement, plaintiff agreed to waive alimony and to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>distribution of various assets to defendant in return for a lump-sum payment made to her by defendant in the amount of $2,075,000. Additionally, defendant agreed to deed the marital domicile, 41 Deer Creek Drive, Basking Ridge, then valued at approximately $910,000 with no mortgage encumbering the property, to plaintiff. Plaintiff represented that the terms of the settlement would permit her to live at a standard of living reasonably comparable to that achieved during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">On February 8, 2001, the court entered a \u201cFinal Judgment Fixing Custody and Parental Contact,\u201d which established custody and parenting time in accordance with the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement. Under that agreement, the parties were to share joint legal custody of the children. Primary residential custody was vested with plaintiff, with secondary residential custody awarded to defendant. The judgment set forth a detailed parenting-time schedule. The parties also acknowledged their agreement that a Special Needs Trust would be established for their son Daniel, and that there would be future issues relating to Daniel, such as his education, vocational training, residence, and health care. The parties agreed to select a mediator to assist them in addressing those issues. The amount of defendant\u2019s obligation for child support and associated expenses of the children, and the issue of counsel fees on the application for child support, were unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">By letter to defendant dated June 5, 2001, entitled \u201cSeparation Agreement and Release,\u201d the terms of defendant\u2019s separation from his employment with Citibank, N.A. and Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. were outlined by his employer. The \u201cagreement\u201d acknowledged that the parties had been negotiating the terms of the agreement since April 16, 2001. The agreement set forth that defendant\u2019s employment was being terminated, effective June 30, 2001, due to a reduction in force. At that point, defendant was age thirty-seven. In consideration for entering into the agreement, defendant\u2019s employer agreed to compensate defendant with gross severance pay in the amount of $115,384.62; continue health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>care coverage at no cost for three months and pay 50% of the costs thereof for another three months; and provide defendant with job placement services commencing on the effective date of the agreement. Prior to the termination of his employment, defendant had gross earned income of $1,796,326 in 1996; $2,434,773 in 1997; $1,093,531 in 1998; $2,945,454 in 1999; and $4,615,273 in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The unresolved issues of child support and counsel fees were tried non-jury in the Family Part on April 30, May 2, June 5, and June 13, 2001. On December 28, 2001, a judgment of divorce was entered dissolving the marriage. On January 16, 2002, the judge placed his decision concerning the tried issues on the record. On February 20, 2002, the court entered a supplemental judgment memorializing that decision; in summary, it provided, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">1. Effective January 16, 2002, defendant was required to pay child support to plaintiff in the amount of $5,391.34 per month, allocated $2,695.67 per child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">2. Plaintiff shall pay 34.82 percent, and defendant 65.18 percent, of the following expenses on behalf of the children:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">a. Medical insurance, which will be maintained by defendant, and unreimbursed medical expenses, including hospital, prescriptions, psychiatric, and counseling costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">b. Summer camp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">c. Dental expenses, including orthodontia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-12\">d. Bar Mitzvah expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-13\">e. $10,000 contribution to each child\u2019s UGMA account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-14\">f. Jacob\u2019s college, graduate school and miscellaneous educational costs not covered by his UGMA account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-15\">g. Daniel\u2019s post secondary education, training costs, health insurance and residential expenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-16\">3. Daniel\u2019s current UGMA shall be placed in a Special Needs Trust and defendant shall provide plaintiff with trust statements twice each year, with the costs of the trust to be borne by the parties in accordance with their respective percentages;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-17\">4. Defendant shall manage Jacob\u2019s UGMA account and his Special Needs Trust, and provide plaintiff statements twice each year;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-18\">5. Defendant shall be responsible for complying with applicable tax laws on behalf of Daniel and Jacob;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-19\">6. Plaintiff shall claim both children as dependents for tax purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>7. Each party shall maintain a life insurance policy on his or her life in the amount of 81,000,000, with the children as equal beneficiaries, with the other party named as trustee. Upon emancipation of one child, the policy coverage may be reduced by $500,000;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">8. Plaintiffs application to require defendant to purchase an automobile and provide automobile insurance for each child upon reaching the child\u2019s seventeenth birthday is denied without prejudice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">9. Plaintiffs application to require defendant to devise and bequeath all assets set forth on his case information statement to the children, is denied;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">10. Each party shall pay their own respective counsel fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">In considering the evidence and rendering his decision on these issues, the trial judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-10\">Mr. Caplan was employed by Salomon Smith Barney from July 1987 until June 2001 as a mortgage trader. Mr. Caplan was terminated and a separation agreement signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">In the agreement, Mr. Caplan was provided with two months compensation after he actually left the trading desk, pre-tax severance pay in the amount of $115,000, and he retained deferred compensation, all of which had been included in the total of his income-producing assets. Mr. Caplan\u2019s current unemployment does not adversely affect his ability to support his two sons, Daniel and Jacob.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-12\">Mrs. Caplan has not worked outside the home since the minor child Daniel was born, except for a brief period in 1999 when she earned $2,591.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">The parties\u2019 son Daniel is a special needs child. He is enrolled in a special education program in public school. He has been diagnosed with ADHD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-14\">Mrs. Caplan is a stay-at-home mother who spends her time helping her sons, especially Daniel, with important everyday activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-15\">* sf&lt; * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-16\">Mrs. Caplan sold the former marital home for its worth [$910,000] and purchased her new home on Landow Road for $549,000. Her new home is smaller than the parties\u2019 marital home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-17\">Mr. Caplan has remained unemployed voluntarily since his termination. He is also living in his home in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-18\">* + * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-19\">With regard to the Caplans\u2019 lifestyle during their marriage, Mrs. Caplan characterized their life together as an \u201cupper-class standard of living\u201d where they lived in a mortgage-free home of 4,000 square feet and drove BMW and Mercedes automobiles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-20\">The Caplans had live-in help, vacationed in Africa, Europe and Mexico and frequented Broadway shows and expensive restaurants according to Mrs. Caplan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-21\">Mr. Caplan characterizes the lifestyle of the parties as \u201cinitially modest,\u201d which in time became upper middle class. On account of his increased earned income, he described this lifestyle as comfortable and pleasant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>While their marriage is at an end, both Sandra Caplan and Craig Caplan acknowledge that their family has been blessed economically, and each recognizes their shared and fundamental responsibilities for the support of their two beloved sons, Daniel and Jacob.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">^ % # j}s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">The starting point in the court\u2019s analysis, in every case concerning an award of child support, is to be found in the child support guidelines enunciated in <em>Rule </em>5:6A[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">If the combined net income of the parents is more than $150,800 per year, the court shall apply the guidelines up to $150,800 and supplement the guidelines based award with a discretionary amount based on the remaining family income; for example, income in excess of $150,800, and the factors specified in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-23[a],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9b\">&amp; $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">Appendix IX-A also counsels that in situations where extreme parental income is involved, that although these guidelines apply to all actions to establish and modify child support awards, extremely low or high parental income situations make the Appendix IX-F awards inappropriate due to the limitations of the economic data.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-12\">Statutory analysis: Counsel for the parties agree, and the court so finds, in keeping with <em>[Walton v. Visgil, </em>248 <em>N.J.Super. </em>642, 649, 591 A.2d 1018, 1021-22. (App.Div.1991)], that as the combined net Caplan family income exceeds $150,800 per year, the court must initially apply the guidelines maximum total child support for two children, and supplement this award with an additional support amount based upon the actual family income and the dispositive legislative factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-23[a],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-13\">:): * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\">This court finds and concludes that for purposes of calculating support for Daniel and Jacob Caplan, Mr. Caplan\u2019s income-producing assets total $4,539,476, and those of Mrs. Caplan are $2,415,964. This yields a shared responsibility child support obligation ratio of 65.18 percent for Mr. Caplan and 34.82 percent for Mrs. Caplan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-15\">The court further finds that as the combined net income of the Caplan family clearly exceeds $150,800 per year, the dispositive legislative factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:34-23[a] require this court to supplement the [ruled-based] maximum total child support for two children with an additional support payment based upon these factors and the actual family income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-16\">A review of the pertinent expenses contained in Schedules A, B and C of the submitted case information statements is initially required. This court reaches today\u2019s conclusions based upon a specific review of the particular expenses contained in these statements that are clearly applicable to Daniel and Jacob.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-17\">Generally, Mr. Caplan shall be obligated to pay a specified portion of Schedule A and Schedule C expenses presented in Mrs. Caplan\u2019s submissions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-18\">While Mrs. Caplan contends that two-thirds of her case information Schedule A expenses are attributable to Daniel and Jacob, the court declines to embrace this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>proposition and underscores that expenses for taxes, insurance, repairs, garbage, snow removal, lawn care, exterminator and plumbing remain solely Mrs. Caplan\u2019s and are not fairly attributable to the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">Accordingly, Mr. Caplan shall be obligated for the sum of $486.54 per month which represents 65.18 <em>percent </em>of the total Schedule A expenses of $746 which are properly related to the children and include heat, electric and gas, water and sewer, phone and television. These expenses total $746 per month. Thus, 65.18 percent, or $486.54, remain Mr. Caplan\u2019s obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">In addition, the court finds and concludes that the Schedule C expenses of Mrs. Caplan\u2019s submission provide a fair and accurate estimation of Daniel and Jacob\u2019s monthly requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">These Schedule C child expenses total $7,525. Mr. Caplan\u2019s portion of this total is $4,904.80, which represents 65.18 percent of the total Schedule C expenses for his two sons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-9\">Furthermore, while Mrs. Caplan suggests that one hundred percent of the Schedule B expenses are attributable to their children, this court finds and concludes they remain the sole responsibility of Mrs. Caplan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-10\">Thus, this court finds, concludes and orders that Mr. Caplan\u2019s total child support obligation [is] $5,391.34 per month, or $1,253.80 per week. This sum is arrived at by adding the sums of $486.54 and $4,904.80, [totaling] $5,391.34, and dividing this total by 4.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-11\">This support obligation yields an amount which comports with the directives of the child support guidelines calculations for extreme parental income situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">This court further concludes, finds and orders that ... Mr. Caplan shall be responsible for 65.18 percent of Tthe following] obligations, and Mrs. Caplan shall be responsible for 34.82 percent of them:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-13\">A. Medical insurance and unreimbursed medical expenses for Daniel and Jacob;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-14\">B. The boys\u2019 summer camp;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-15\">C. Dental expenses, including orthodontia for Daniel and Jacob;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-16\">D. The bar mitzvah expenses for each child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-17\">E. The $10,000 contribution to each of the boys\u2019 UGMA accounts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-18\">P. Jacob Caplan\u2019s college and miscellaneous educational cost not covered by his UGMA account;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-19\">G. Daniel\u2019s post-secondary education and training costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-20\">On or about March 8, 2002, defendant filed a motion seeking reconsideration of the amount of child support set forth in the supplemental judgment. In his moving certification, defendant contended that the monthly needs of the children were $3,815.29, not $5,391.34 as found by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-21\">Specifically, defendant claimed there was a mathematical error in the calculation of the Schedule C, personal expenses of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>children as listed on plaintiffs case information statement, stating that those listed expenses actually totaled $7,450 per month, not $7,525 as found by the court. Defendant also argued that some of the children\u2019s expenses that he had been separately ordered to pay 65.18 percent thereof were actually already included within plaintiff\u2019s listing of the children\u2019s expenses contained in her case information statement. Those expenses of the children that he contended had been \u201cdouble counted\u201d by the court included medical, dental, and summer camp, totaling $755 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Defendant also noted that plaintiffs case information statement listed $1,382 as a monthly expense for \u201cgifts,\u201d of which she allocated $832 as an expense made or incurred on behalf of the children, yet listed no expense for herself or the children under the category \u201ccontributions,\u201d However, defendant stated that during her direct examination at the hearing, plaintiff had testified that she had combined \u201cgifts\u201d and \u201ccontributions\u201d together in reaching the figure of $1,382 listed under \u201cgifts\u201d in her case information statement. Defendant argued that charitable contributions \u201care not an appropriate child support expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Additionally, based upon plaintiffs testimony, defendant noted that plaintiffs actual charitable contributions during the <em>pendente lite </em>period had averaged approximately $1,473.52 per month, greater than the amount listed by plaintiff in her case information statement for the combined expenses of gifts and charitable contributions. Defendant suggested that an appropriate expense for gifts for the children would be $100 per month, and that the listed $832 monthly expenses should thereby be reduced by $732.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Plaintiff filed a cross-motion, seeking an order denying defendant\u2019s motion; increasing defendant\u2019s child support obligation to $9,931.77 per month, taking into consideration plaintiffs projected Schedule C personal expenses for the children or, alternatively, increasing the child support obligation by $1,416.01, taking into consideration plaintiffs additional Schedule A shelter costs, and those Schedule B transportation costs attributable to the children. Plaintiff also argued that yearly gross income of $3,800,000 should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>be imputed to defendant and, since defendant\u2019s total imputed earned income and his unearned income would thereby constitute ninety-eight percent of their combined income, defendant should be required to pay ninety-eight percent of the children\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In her cross-motion, plaintiff also sought an order requiring defendant to pay accumulated support arrears of $5,518.04; compelling defendant to produce documentation concerning the cost of medical insurance; directing defendant to reimburse her $811.18, representing his share of the children\u2019s unreimbursed medical expenses incurred; ordering defendant to pay his share of the children\u2019s summer camp expenses in the amount of $1,759.86; requiring defendant to provide plaintiff with copies of the children\u2019s investment account statements from April 1, 2001 to the present; and for assessment of plaintiff\u2019s counsel fees and costs against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In her supporting certification, plaintiff stated that her projected Schedule C expenses were $14,491, of which defendant should pay 65.18 percent thereof, or, $9,445.23, plus a share of the Schedule A expenses, for a total monthly support of $9,931.77. Plaintiff further contended that an appropriate allocation of her Schedule A shelter expenses and her Schedule B transportation expenses to the children would result in an increase in defendant\u2019s monthly child support obligation by $1,416.01 from its current level. Plaintiff also certified that defendant was voluntarily unemployed, yet had the capacity to earn $3,800,000 per year, which amount should be imputed to him and his calculated child support obligation should be based on that level of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">The motions were submitted to the court for a ruling on the filed papers. On May 15, 2002, the judge issued an order setting forth his written findings and conclusions on the various issues. In denying defendant\u2019s application for reduction of the amount of his direct monthly child support from $5,391.34 to $3,815.29, the judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">Defendant puts forth to the Court that the child support amount of $5,391.34 should be reduced as the Court ordered him to pay additional expenses of summer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>camp, medical insurance, unreimbursed medical expenses, dental expenses which were already accounted for in the child support amount. However, the Court notes to the Defendant that the Defendant\u2019s additional obligations such as the ones listed above, the bar mitzvah expenses for each child, the $10,000 contribution to the children\u2019s UGMA accounts, college, etc. were not incorporated into the $5,391.34 child support. These expenses were to be paid for separately, therefore, in light of Defendant\u2019s argument, the summer camp, dental and medical expenses will not have to be paid on a separate basis as they are already included into the child support and Defendant has and will satisfy those obligations through his payment of child support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">Furthermore, the Court notes that it utilized the Plaintiffs Schedule C total expenses of $7,525 from page 12 of the chart which was included in Plaintiffs Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Therefore, the Court finds that as the Defendant has not provided the Court with any new information for it to consider that would justify these adjustments, the Defendant\u2019s requests are denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The judge also denied plaintiffs applications to increase defendant\u2019s child support obligation to $9,931.77 or, in the alternative, to require defendant to pay ninety-eight percent of the children\u2019s needs by imputing an annual income to him of $3,800,000, on the basis that plaintiff \u201chas put forth no new information for the Court to consider!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">On appeal, plaintiff presents the following arguments for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-9\">\n<em>POINT ONE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-10\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REQUIRING PLAINTIFF TO PAY ALL OF THE TRANSPORTATION AND VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE SHELTER EXPENSES WITHOUT CONTRIBUTION FROM DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-11\">\n<em>POINT TWO</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-12\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ALLOCATING THE PERCENTAGE SHARE OF THE CHILDREN\u2019S EXPENSES BASED SOLELY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S EARNING CAPACITY [WHICH] AVERAGED $2.5 MILLION PER YEAR OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-13\">\n<em>POINT THREE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-14\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RESTRICTING THE CHILDREN\u2019S NEEDS TO PLAINTIFF\u2019S PENDENTE LITE EXPENDITURES AND FAILED TO CONSIDER PROJECTED EXPENSES THAT WERE CONSISTENT WITH DEFENDANT\u2019S CURRENT LIFESTYLE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-15\">\n<em>POINT FOUR</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-16\">DEFENDANT\u2019S ASSETS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY THE VALUE OF HIS 401(10 PLAN OR THE TAXES HE MAY PAY ON THE PLAN IN TWENTY YEARS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>\n<em>POINT FIVE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">PLAINTIFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN NAMED AS CUSTODIAN OF DANIEL\u2019S SPECIAL NEEDS TRUST SINCE SHE HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS DAILY NEEDS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\n<em>POINT SIX</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING PLAINTIFF\u2019S REQUEST FOR COUNSEL FEES WHERE SHE ACTED IN GOOD FAITH, THE ISSUES RELATED SOLELY TO THE SUPPORT OF THE CHILDREN AND DEFENDANT HAS VASTLY SUPERIOR ASSETS AND EARNING POTENTIAL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">On his cross-appeal, defendant advances the following arguments, as denominated in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">\n<em>POINT VI</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-11\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY INCLUDING WITH ITS CALCULATION OF THE CHILDREN\u2019S NEEDS, EXPENSES WHOLLY UNRELATED TO THE CHILDREN OR THEIR STANDARD OF LIVING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-12\">\n<em>POINT VII</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-13\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO MAKE ITS AWARD OF CHILD SUPPORT RETROACTIVE TO FEBRUARY 1, 2001, CREATING A WINDFALL TO THE PLAINTIFF.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">Both parties argue \u2014 for different reasons \u2014 that the trial court erred in computing defendant\u2019s child support obligation. In <em>Isaacson v. Isaacson, </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>560, 792 A.2d 525 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>364, 807 A.2d 195 (2002), we recently-addressed the issue of the calculation of a child support obligation where the parents\u2019 combined net income exceeds the maximum amount of the child support guidelines and the obligor parent does not dispute the ability to pay any reasonable amount of child support. <em>Id. </em>at 565, 792 A.2d at 528. Although <em>Isaacson </em>involved a post-judgment application for modification, the principles it established are applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">In discussing the needs of children whose parents have income in excess of the income threshold of the child support guidelines Judge Carchman, writing for the court, stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akc\">We have generally recognized that where the parties have the financial wherewithal to provide for their children, the children are entitled to the benefit of financial advantages available to them. We have characterized such circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>as reflecting a parent\u2019s \u201cgood fortune\u201d and have held that children are entitled to have their needs accord with the current standard of living of both parents, which may reflect an increase in parental good fortune____Children are entitled to not only bare necessities, but a supporting parent has the obligation to share with his children the benefit of financial achievement____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A10\">Where our attention is focused on the unique circumstances of the high-income earner whose ability to pay increased child support is not in issue, the dominant guideline for consideration is the reasonable needs of the children, which must be addressed in the context of the standard of living of the parties. The needs of the children must be the centerpiece of any relevant analysis. Other economic-dependent factors are of less significance, as the high earner\u2019s concession of ability to pay has essentially limited the consideration of such economic-dependent issues. However, any consideration of needs must factor in the age and health of the children, as well as the other assets or income of the children, including any debts. Obviously, when considering the age factor, the needs of an infant child are distinctly different from the needs of teenage children[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1A\">Determining a child\u2019s needs in these unusual financial circumstances presents unique problems. First, a balance must be struck between reasonable needs, which reflect lifestyle opportunities, while at the same time precluding an inappropriate windfall to the child or even in some cases infringing on the legitimate right of either parent to determine the appropriate lifestyle of a child____This latter consideration involves a careful balancing of interests reflecting that a child\u2019s entitlement to share in a parent\u2019s good fortune does not deprive either parent of the right to participate in the development of an appropriate value system for a child. This is a critical tension that may develop between competing parents. Ultimately, the needs of a child in such circumstances also calls to the fore the best interests of a child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-14\">We have suggested that \u201c \u2018needs\u2019 accord with the current standard of living of both parents, which may reflect an increase in parental good fortune.\u201d <em>[Zazzo </em>v. <em>Zazzo, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>124, 130, 584 A.2d 281, 284 (App.Div.1990), <em>certif. denied, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>321, 598 A.2d 881 (1991).] We have also recognized that after basic needs are met and a parent\u2019s income permits, children are entitled to non-essential items that are reasonable and in the child\u2019s best interest....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-15\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-16\">Judges must be vigilant in providing for \u201cneeds\u201d consistent with lifestyle without overindulgence____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-17\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-18\">Sharing good fortune does not absolve the parties or a judge of determining needs of a child in a sensible manner consistent with the best interests of the child____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-20\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-21\">We also recognize, as we have done in the past, that the law is not offended if there is some incidental benefit to the custodial parent from increased child support payments____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>This, too, requires the judge to balance the needs of the child.

In the circumstances presented, the required steps to establish a child-support obligation are easily articulated. We recognize, however, that they are difficult to apply. Accordingly, we outline the required steps in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\"><em>First, </em>the reasonable needs of the children must be determined, guided by the principles we enunciated in <em>Isaacson. </em>Here, the trial court\u2019s determination of the needs of the children is not supported by substantial, credible evidence in the record. It is obvious, for example, that the record supports a finding that transportation costs are a reasonable component of the children\u2019s expenses; yet, none of plaintiffs transportation costs were attributed to the children. Additionally, in computing defendant\u2019s responsibility for a portion of plaintiffs shelter expenses set forth on her case information statement entered in evidence, the judge multiplied defendant\u2019s respective percentage of the combined income-producing assets of the parties (65.18%) by the full amount of those shelter expenses that he determined represented expenditures by plaintiff made on behalf of the children (heat, electric, gas, water and sewer, telephone, and television). Obviously, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>plaintiff also resides with the children, that cannot be so; some portion of those items must also represent plaintiffs needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The significant task in this case is to determine the reasonable lifestyle to which the children are entitled and, to the extent possible, differentiate between the needs or expenses of plaintiff and those that benefit the children and provide them with that reasonable lifestyle. Overlapping, common expenditures are inevitable and are, indeed, incident to one\u2019s status as a custodial parent. A reasonable allocation of such expenses based upon adequate, credible evidence in the record is the goal. Other expenses, such as lessons, summer camp, club dues, sports, and personal hygiene costs are more easily identifiable as attributable to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\"><em>Second, </em>because there must be a fair and appropriate allocation of the children\u2019s needs between the parties, the ability of the parties to generate <em>earned </em>income, in addition to <em>unearned </em>income, must be determined. Where one or both parties have the ability to earn income, but have chosen not to work, it is insufficient and unfair to simply utilize the unearned income received by the parties from their assets to determine the share of the children\u2019s needs that each party should bear. Although relevant, \u201c[c]hild support will be based on income rather than on net worth.\u201d <em>Loro, supra, </em>354 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 223, 806 A.2d at 806. It is fundamental that \u201c[t]he fairness of a child support award resulting from the application of [the child support] guidelines is dependent on the accurate determination of a parent\u2019s net income.\u201d Pressler, <em>supra, </em>at 1112, \u201cImputing Income to Parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">Therefore, \u201c[I]f the court finds that either parent is, without just cause, voluntarily underemployed or unemployed, it shall impute income to that parent according to[,]\u201d <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cpotential employment and earning capacity using the parent\u2019s work history, occupational qualifications, educational background, and prevailing job opportunities in the region.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Additionally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARq\">In determining whether income should be imputed to a parent and the amount of such income, the court should consider: (1) what the employment status and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>earning capacity of that parent would have been if the family had remained intact or would have formed, (2) the reason and intent for the voluntary underemployment or unemployment, (3) the availability of other assets that may be used to pay support, and (4) the ages of any children in the parent\u2019s household and child-care alternatives. The determination of imputed income shall not be based on the gender or custodial position of the parent. Income of other household members, current spouses, and the children shall not be used to impute income to either parent except when determining the other-dependent credit. When imputing income to a parent who is caring for young children, the parent\u2019s income share of child-care costs necessary to allow that person to work outside the home shall be deducted from the imputed income____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">\n<em>Ubm</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Here, the trial court incorrectly applied a mechanistic approach to the child-support calculus, in circumstances where a fact-sensitive analysis was required, by ascertaining the income-producing assets of each party, determining each party\u2019s percentage relationship to their combined unearned-income-producing assets, and then utilized that percentage relationship to determine each party\u2019s child support responsibility. Here, the issue of imputation of income cannot be avoided by the reality that either party could meet the reasonable needs of the children from the unearned income produced by their assets. We reach that conclusion because of the necessity that the court <em>allocate </em>the reasonable needs of the children between the parents. It would be.inequitable to allocate those needs simply based upon an analysis of unearned income, since one or both parents would thereby have the ability to decrease their respective responsibility for the children\u2019s needs by simply not working and avoiding imputation-of-income principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Moreover, we perceive no basis here to depart from well-established law requiring imputation of income where a parent is voluntarily unemployed. <em>See Tash v. Tash, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>94, 99, 801 A.2d 436, 438-39 (App.Div.2002) (noting that both the guidelines and case law of this State permit imputation of income when determining child support obligations); <em>Halliwell v.

Dorfman, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 516-17, 719 A.2d 178, 180-81 (App.Div.1998) (noting that although imputation of income rules apply when determining child support, involuntary termination of employment must be considered when deciding whether a parent\u2019s income level equates to that parent\u2019s ability to earn); <em>Bencivenga v. Bencivenga, 254 N.J.Super. </em>328, 331, 603 A.2d 531, 531 (App.Div.1992) (stating the fact that a court will not order a parent to work does not mean that it cannot impute income to that parent); <em>Weitzman v. Weitzman, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 354, 549 A.2d 888, 891-92 (App.Div.1988) (recognizing the right of courts to realistically appraise a parent\u2019s earning capacity in determining child support), <em>certif. denied, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>505, 555 A.2d 623 (1989); <em>Lynn v. Lynn, </em>165 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 340-41, 398 A.2d 141, 146-47 (App.Div.) (noting, by citing to <em>Mowery v. Mowery, </em>38 <em>N.J.Super. </em>92, 102, 118 A.2d 49, 54-55 (App.Div.1955), <em>certif. denied, </em>20 <em>N.J. </em>307, 119 A.2d 791 (1956), that in setting child support, the court has the right to appraise the supporting parent\u2019s earning capacity), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>52, 404 A.2d 1152 (1979). <em>See also, </em>Elizabeth Trainor, Annotation, <em>Basis for Imputing Income for Purpose of Determining Child Support Where Obligor Spouse is Voluntarily Unemployed or Underemployed, </em>76 <em>A.L.R. </em>5th 191 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Accordingly, on remand the court must determine the ability of each parent to earn income and factor that ability into the income equation. However, in considering the ability of plaintiff to work, the court must consider her enhanced-care responsibilities for Daniel, the parties\u2019 special-needs child.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\"><em>Third, </em>upon determining the respective percentage of each party\u2019s net imputed earned and unearned income of their total combined net imputed earned and unearned income, those percentages shall be applied to determine each party\u2019s share of the maximum basic child support guideline award for two children. Currently, that maximum basic child support guideline award for two children is $654 per week. Pressler, <em>supra, </em>Appendix IX-F to <em>Rule </em>5:6A, \u201cSchedule of Child Support Awards.\u201d Here, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>dant\u2019s percentage of the parties\u2019 combined total net income would be applied to yield his share of the guidelines-based award.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\"><em>Fourth, </em>the maximum basic child support amount, here, $654 per week, or, $2,834 per month, should be subtracted from the court-determined reasonable needs of the children to determine the remaining children\u2019s needs to be allocated between the parties. Then, the court must analyze the factors outlined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23(a) and determine each party\u2019s responsibility for satisfying those remaining needs. It is the result of that analysis that is to be utilized when determining the fair and equitable allocation of the remaining needs of the children between the parties. In performing that analysis the court must be mindful that unlike the child support guidelines analysis \u2014 where the net earned and unearned income of each parent and the respective percentage of each parent\u2019s net income to their combined net income is the only factor to be considered in determining a guidelines-based analysis \u2014 the net income of each party is only one factor to be considered when performing the statutory analysis. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23(a)(3). Additionally, we note that the sole use of a percentage-of-income formula to determine child support ignores the other factors set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23(a) that require analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Finally, the guiding principles in determining the child support obligation of the non-eustodial parent (or parent of alternate residence in a shared-parenting arrangement) are that child support is a continuous duty of both parents; that children are entitled to share in the good fortune and current income of both parents and enjoy a lifestyle comparable to that of their parents; and that children should not be the economic victims of divorce or separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Here, we are constrained to reverse the child support award and remand for application of the principles discussed herein to the facts of this case to determine the fair and equitable child support obligation of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in denying her application for counsel fees. In their agreement, the parties were to bear their own counsel fees; however, plaintiff reserved the right to seek counsel fees incurred during trial of the unresolved issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">In rendering his oral decision on January 16, 2002, the trial judge correctly articulated the applicable criteria for considering a claim for counsel fees, citing to <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>229, 281 A.2d 273 (1971) and <em>Rule </em>5:3-5(c). However, other than concluding that \u201c[a] qualitative review of the applicable court rules and case law leads this court to conclude that the criteria ... have not been met in this case[,]\u201d the judge made no findings on those criteria and provided no explanation for his conclusion. <em>See Rule </em>l:7-4(a) (requiring the trial court to make findings of fact and conclusions of law on each issue). Additionally, since we have remanded the matter for findings concerning the parties\u2019 ability to produce earned income, a relevant factor in the counsel-fee calculus, we reverse the denial of counsel fees and remand that issue for further consideration and an analysis of the factors set forth in <em>Williams </em>and <em>Rule </em>5:3-5(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">Plaintiff further argues that defendant\u2019s assets should not have been reduced by the value of his 401(k) plan or by the future taxes he may pay on that plan, and that trial court erred in declining to name plaintiff as custodian of Daniel\u2019s special-needs trust. Defendant argues in his cross-appeal that the trial court erred in failing to make its award of child support retroactive to February 1,2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">Alter analyzing the record in light of the written and oral arguments advanced by the parties, we conclude those issues are without sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>Rule </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
