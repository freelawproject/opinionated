The court has considered the presentations at that hearing and the written material filed in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">It Is Ordered that there is created the Supreme Court Gender Equality Committee, charged with assisting the Wisconsin court system, within the bounds of the Supreme Court's administrative and superintending authority, to eliminate bias on the basis of gender and to achieve and promote gender neutrality in the court system. Using as a starting point some of the recommendations of the Equal Jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>tice Task Force that address matters within the jurisdiction and authority of the courts, the Committee shall ascertain the extent to which the court system has undertaken efforts to eliminate bias on the basis of gender and achieve and promote gender neutrality and suggest and assist in actions to be taken by the court system to accomplish those purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-3\">It Is Further Ordered that the following persons are appointed to serve on the Supreme Court Gender Equality Committee:</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Honorable Thomas Cane \u2014 Wausau</p>\n<p id=\"AnE\">Honorable Patricia S. Curley \u2014 Milwaukee</p>\n<p id=\"AyVo\">Honorable John B. Kerski \u2014 Marinette</p>\n<p id=\"AA9\">Attorney Maureen L. Kinney \u2014 LaCrosse</p>\n<p id=\"ADo\">Honorable Barbara A.

White \u2014 Milwaukee</p>\n<p id=\"b838-18\">It Is Further Ordered that the chair of the Committee shall be selected by its members and the organizational meeting of the Committee shall be called by the Chief Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-19\">It Is Further Ordered that the director of state courts shall arrange for the necessary staffing to the Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-20\">It Is Further Ordered that the Supreme Court Gender Equality Committee shall file with the court an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>interim report on or before July 1, 1994 and a final report on or before July 1,1995 of the actions taken by the court system, the actions suggested by the Gender Equality Committee and proposed plans and programs to eliminate bias on the basis of gender and achieve and promote gender neutrality in the court system.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">Dated at Madison, Wisconsin, this 8th day of June, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">BY THE COURT:</p>\n<p id=\"AWv\">/s/ Marilyn L. Graves</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Marilyn L. Graves, Clerk</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b839-7\">SHIRLEY S. ABRAHAMSON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6M\"><em>{concurring). </em>I strongly support the Court's decision to create the Supreme Court Gender Equality Committee. The committee's mandate ensures a flexibility that can only enhance the quality of the committee's work.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">I would prefer, however, that the committee membership were expanded. While it is certainly beneficial to include, as we have done, wide representation from within the judicial system, I believe that the perspective of people outside the court family is also important. As we have done on other committees and as several other states have done in their gender equality implementation committees, I would directly involve the public, so that the people the legal system is designed to serve are at the table. I would also have placed on this committee people from business and the executive and legislative branches of government who have worked with the issue of gender bias and could have lent their expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>There will, however, be ample opportunity for interested persons to attend the committee's meetings and to follow and comment upon the process. My concern is thus somewhat ameliorated.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\">In short, although I would have proceeded a bit differently, I join the court in undertaking this endeavor.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
