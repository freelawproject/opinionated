No opposition or other response to defendant\u2019s motion has been interposed on behalf of plaintiff. However, defendant\u2019s motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">It has been noted from the certificate of service attached to defendant\u2019s motion that plaintiff\u2019s attorneys of record, Cassel and Benjamin, have not been served with a copy of the motion at their office address, Suite 501 Flagler Federal Building, 111 Northeast 1st Street, Miami, Florida 33132, as required by rule 4.1(a) (2). See <em>Philip J. Bernstein Enterprises </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 71 Cust. Ct. 297, C.R.D. 73-34 (1973). Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, therefore, have not had an opportunity to respond to defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">Furthermore, an examination of the court record discloses that these cases were partially tried at a Miami docket on March 29,1965. Hence, the cases \u201cshall be further processed and governed in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the law and with the rules of the court in effect prior to October 1, 1970\u201d Buie 14.9 (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Bule 14.9 (b) (2) provides, so far as pertinent :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">Actions in which, in open court, a witness was sworn or evidence was admitted prior to October 1,1970 * * * shall be deemed to be actions in which trials have commenced prior to October 1,1970.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">At the hearing in Miami, Florida in 1965 plaintiff was sworn as a witness; evidence was admitted, but the trial was not concluded. Hence, this is an action in which trial has \u201ccommenced\u201d prior to October 1, 1970 within the purview of rule 14.9(b) (2). Upon adjournment of the Miami hearing, the cases were continued to the next docket. Subsequently these cases were suspended mider <em>Contmental Forwarding, Inc. </em>v. <em>United </em>States, Reap. No. R58/23790, 46 Cust. Ct. 579, R.D. 9910 (1961), <em>rem\u2019d, </em>52 Cust. Ct. 629, A.R.D. 171 (1964), <em>aff'd, United States </em>v. <em>Contmental Forwarding, </em>Inc., 53 CCPA 105, C.A.D. 885 (1966), which test case was, in turn, suspended under <em>Contmental Fwdg. Company et al. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>Reap. No. R60/2082, 62 Cust. Ct. 915, R.D. 11659, 297 F. Supp. 1396 (1969), <em>aff'd, United States </em>v. <em>Continental Fwdg.

Botwithstanding the aforementioned suspensions, these cases \u201cshall be further processed and governed in accordance with the law and with the rules of the court in effect prior to October 1, 1970\u201d pursuant to rule 14.9(b) (1), rather than processed under rule 14.9 (c) (2), providing for the transfer of certain cases to the suspension disposition file.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Complaints and motions for a more definite statement were not provided for by the rules in effect prior to October 1, 1970. Consequently, the complaints herein were improperly filed, and therefore they will be stricken, <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">In light of the foregoing circumstances, it is hereby OBDEBED:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">1. Defendant\u2019s motion for leave to file out of time a motion for a more definite statement is denied;</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">2.

Such actions shall remain suspended until the final determination of the action under which they were suspended, at which time they shall be transferred to the suspension disposition file in accordance with Rule 14.8\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
