Plaintiff has now moved to vacate my order of July 11 and to file out of time a reply to defendant\u2019s motion. In an affidavit accompanying plaintiff\u2019s motion, it is averred that an opposition to defendant\u2019s motion for a more definite statement was not timely interposed due to the unfortunate circumstance that the attorney responsible for handling these cases had been seriously injured in an automobile accident, and was hospitalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">Defendant indicates in its memorandum that it has no objection to plaintiff\u2019s motion for a vacatur. Accordingly, I have concluded that plaintiff\u2019s motion should be granted; and pursuant to the provisions of rule 12.1, I shall reconsider the merits of defendant\u2019s motion for a more definite statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-16\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b265-17\">Defendant\u2019s motion is denied for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-18\">In its motion for a more definite statement, defendant originally contended that the complaints filed by plaintiff in these protests were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>defective in several respects, viz.: the complaints did not comply with rules 4.5B(2), 4.5B(3), 4.5B(5), 4.5B(7), 4.3(b); and defendant further argued that the complaints do not adequately describe the merchandise in issue. However, now defendant urges only the latter contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Specifically, defendant insists that the description of the merchandise is paragraph 3 of the complaints does not coincide with the merchandise protested, and consequently plaintiff has failed to comply with rule 4.5 (a) (4), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">(a) General: The complaint in a civil action shall set forth: $$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">(4) a description of the merchandise involved;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The short of the matter is that defendant\u2019s contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">First, it must be pointed up that these cases are protests rather than \u201ccivil actions\u201d, and therefore rule 4.5(a) has no application to these complaints. Under rule 3.1(a) the term \u201ccivil action\u201d refers to an action commenced by filing a summons pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2632, as amended, while a \u201cprotest\u201d refers to an action filed pursuant to section 514 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514) and forwarded to the court pursuant to section 515 (19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515). None of these actions were commenced by the filing of a summons, and hence are not civil actions in which the complaints are governed by rule 4.5(a). Bather, these cases are protests, and thus the requisites of these complaints are governed by rule 4.5B. Unlike rule 4.5(a) (4), requiring that a complaint in a civil action describe the merchandise involved, rule 4.5B affecting protests contains no such specific requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Secondly, if defendant believes that paragraph 3 of the complaints inaccurately describes the merchandise under protest, defendant in its answer may deny the allegations of paragraph 3 insofar as the merchandise description is believed to be inaccurate; and defendant may then, under rule 4.6(a) (2), state its contention as to the merchandise covered by the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">It must be emphasized that the protests here \u2014 not the complaints\u2014 govern the merchandise over which the court has jurisdiction. Moreover, all merchandise within the scope of the protests remains in issue unless there is a limitation expressed by plaintiff in the complaints. The complaints here do not express any such limitation. For these reasons, I perceive no indefiniteness concerning the merchandise in issue under the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Accordingly, my order of July 11,1973 granting defendant\u2019s motion on default for a more definite statement is vacated; and defendant\u2019s motion for a more definite statement is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
