The iron is described therein as \u201cThe New Sunbeam Spray Mist spray, steam or dry iron \u2014 \u2022 steam-propelled spray gives you the delicate spray you want for the most stubborn wrinkles\u201d and \u201cNow! Faster ironing with fewer strokes because steam propelled spray thoroughly and gently envelopes the wrinkled area * * * penetrates, without soaking! Result: neater-looking ironing. Sprays warm water even for Dry ironing!\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">According to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged, 1961) \u201cspray\u201d, as a verb is defined, inter alia, as \u201cto discharge a liquid as spray\u201d and as a noun, inter alia, as \u201ca jet of liquid (as water) dispersed by a sprayer\u201d. \u201cMist\u201d is defined therein as \u201ca fine spray\u201d. In view thereof and considering applicant\u2019s iron as described in its catalog sheet, it is our opinion that although the mark \u201cSpray Mist\u201d may be somewhat incongruous in that the terms \u201cSpray\u201d and \u201cMist\u201d can be used interchangeably, it immediately conveys or describes a function or feature of applicant\u2019s iron, namely, that it sprays a mist of water during the ironing process. Accordingly, in the absence of evidence which would tend to indicate that it does, in fact, identify and distinguish applicant\u2019s irons, it is our opinion that \u201cSpray Mist\u201d is merely descriptive within the meaning of Section 2(e) (1) * * *[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">Granted, as appellant concedes, that \u201cSpray Mist\u201d is somewhat suggestive of one feature, or function, of the goods, we are unable to agree with the board that the mark is <em>merely descriptive </em>of an electric pressing iron within our understanding of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-10\">. Serial No. 124,304, filed July 19, 1961.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\">. Section 2 of the Lanham Act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">No trade-mark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-28\">(e) consists of a mark which, (1) when applied to the goods of the applicant is merely descriptive * * * of them * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
