In this case, Kristinus Gesellsehaft appeals from the decision of the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board which sustained appellee\u2019s opposition to appellant\u2019s application <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to register \u201cPEER EXPORT\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for use on \u201ccigars, cigarillos, cigars without wrappers, cigarettes, all goods filter-tipped ; cigarette paper incorporated into the cigarette.\u201d Appellee\u2019s opposition is based on its prior use and registration of the mark \u201cPEERAGE\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for smoking tobacco and cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-23\">The board found confusion or mistake is reasonably likely to occur and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-24\">Applicant\u2019s mark consists of the unitary term \u201cPEER EXPORT\u201d, but considering the obvious character of the term \u201cEXPORT\u201d as applied to cigarettes or to anything that is exported, it is reasonable to assume that the term \u201cPEER\u201d is the significant feature of applicant\u2019s mark and is that portion by which applicant\u2019s goods would be recognized and identified in trade. \u201cPEER\u201d and \u201cPEERAGE\u201d are defined in Webster\u2019s New Third International Dictionary (unabridged, 1961), inter alia, as \u201ca member of the five ranks of the British peerage\u201d and \u201cthe rank or dignity of a peer\u201d, respectively. It is apparent from the foregoing that these terms possess a similar significance, and considering that they are also similar in appearance and sound, it is concluded that the resemblances between them is such that as applied to the competitive goods here involved, confusion, mistake or deception is reasonably likely to occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlO\">Before us, the appellant argues that there is no likelihood of confusion, basing its contention largely upon the fact that it has not disclaimed the word \u201cEXPORT\u201d as a part of the mark and that, in any event, \u201cEXPORT\u201d is so important a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>part of the mark that it cannot be disregarded and, hence, that \u201cPEER EXPORT\u201d as an entire trademark cannot be considered similar to \u201cPEERAGE\u201d. It further contends that there was a lack of proof of the prior use and ownership of the mark \u201cPEERAGE\u201d by the appellee. All of these contentions were raised before the board and satisfactorily disposed of by it. Detailed discussion of the appellant\u2019s arguments is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-19\">.
