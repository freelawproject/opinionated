Claim 11 is typical:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-20\">11. A dental prosthesis device wherein an essential structure element thereof is composed of a linear high molecular weight fiber and film forming thermoplastic polycarbonate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-21\">The examiner relied on the following references:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-22\">Becker February 24, 1959</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-23\">Bayer (Belgian) October 30, 1954</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJv\">2,874,467</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APL\">532,543</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-24\">Becker discloses the manufacture of dentures with methyl methacrylate, a moldable thermoplastic material. These are said to have the advantage \u201cof physiological and chemical indifference as well as of good mechanical properties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-25\">Bayer teaches the manufacture of polycarbonates and fibers, films, and moldings thereof. The properties of the polycarbonates are described:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-26\">The polycarbonates produced according to the invention are thermoplastic and elastic synthetic materials whose softening point or melting point and physical properties depend in large measure on the kind of di-monohydroxyaryl-alkane employed. They are soluble in a variety of organic solvents * * * and can be worked up from solutions into shaped articles such [as] films, fibers, etc., or into lacquer coatings. They melt without decomposition and can therefore be worked up into useful shaped articles or coatings by pressing, spraying, flame spraying, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>It is surprising to note that according to the present process * * * there can be obtained crystallizable and linear polycarbonates from which films, fibers, etc., can be produced from the melt or solution, and which films, fibers, etc., can be oriented by stretching. The tensile strength of these products is significantly increased by the stretching process, whereas their elongation-to-break is decreased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">It is also disclosed that the polycarbonates form colorless, viscous, elastic materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The examiner was of the opinion that it would be obvious to use the poly-carbonates of Bayer in forming the Becker denture inasmuch as no more was involved than the substitution of one mold-able thermoplastic material for another. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">The Bayer reference teaches that this material may be injection molded and can be formed into hard and solid films and fibers. It is also stated that it has small water absorption, high elasticity, stability of shape up to 180 \u00b0C and is uncolored. Thus the material would not be affected by mouth fluids, would not be easily cracked or broken, could be sterilized without change of shape and would not have an unsuitable color. These are attributes which would indicate its usefulness in dental prosthesis to one skilled in the art. Once these properties are known the possible use of the material in dentistry would be obvious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL5\">The board agreed. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Appellants argue that the question is whether there is any suggestion in the cited references to make the substitution of the materials. They urge that in the absence of an express suggestion there should be at least such a description of the properties of the polycarbonates that their use in dentures would be encouraged. They find the examiner\u2019s recitation of properties insufficient, pointing out to us that the Bayer reference does not disclose the \u201csmall water absorption\u201d of polycarbonates.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">We think, however, that the uncontroverted part of the examiner\u2019s analysis provided sufficient basis for a finding of obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. Appellants\u2019 specification discusses the materials of the prior art, particularly polymethyl methacrylate, polyamides, and polyurethanes. It lists advantages and disadvantages. Polymethyl methacrylates have an undesirable capacity for water absorption and less than suitable mechanical properties. The polyurethanes and polyamides are marked by the disadvantages of high capacity for water absorption, some tendency toward changes in shape under strain, unsatisfactory appearance, and difficulty of repair. The obviousness of the use of polycarbonates in denture preparation would then hardly be foreclosed by the <em>possibility </em>that such dentures might have one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art material.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Appellants also argue that \u201cThe differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are not obvious under section 103\u201d, indicating several differences in properties between their invention and the denture of Becker. The legal issue, of course, is not the obviousness of the <em>differences </em>between the invention and the prior art but the obviousness of <em>the invention as a whole, </em>taking, those differences into account as section 103 clearly states.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">On the record here, we agree with the Patent Office finding of obviousness to make this new use of a known material.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
