L., 282), is not costs that the statutes authorize to be paid out of the state treasury.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b373-9\">2. The inclusion by the clerk of the court of common pleas of such compensation in the bill of costs of prosecution, and the certificate by the prosecuting attorney of the correctness and legality of such item, and its allowance by the warden of the penitentiary, do not make it the duty of. the auditor of state to draw a warrant for its payment.</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b373-11\">(No. 10536</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ALr\">Decided December 17, 1907.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-12\">In mandamus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-13\">This is an original action in this court.

It is further averred that the accused was convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary for life and to pay the costs of prosecution, and that thereupon a writ of execution against the property of the defendant was issued and returned by the sheriff \u201cNo goods, etc,\u201d and that thereupon the clerk of the court made a complete bill of the costs in the prosecution and included therein the compensation paid said expert, and that the prosecuting attorney examined into the correctness and legality of each and every item therein charged and certified that each and every item was correct and legal, and it is averred that the bill of costs so certified was then .presented to the warden of the penitentiary, who allowed the same and certified such allowance, and that said bill, with such certificate of the warden, was then presented by the sheriff to the auditor of' state, who deducted the item for the compensation of the expert from the amount of the bill, and refused to issue a warrant for the payment of that item.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">The defendant has filed a general demurrer to the petition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-7\"><em>Messrs.

But it is his duty under such circumstances to refer such item to those who by law are charged with the duty of determining the correctness and legality of the items included in such cost bill. Section 7332, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-8\">If the auditor of state has some power to- finally determine the legality of a cost bill or an item of such bill, the provision of the statute enjoining this duty upon the prosecuting attorney is a vain and useless formality.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-9\"><em>Mr. Wade H.

Defendant\u2019s contention is, however, that such compensation when paid by the county commissioners may not be included in the cost bill to be paid out of the state treasury. While it is true that Section 1306, Revised Statutes, provides for the payment of witness fees out of the county treasury, it is equally true that Section 1302 fixes such witness fees at $1.00 per day and five cents per mile, and no more. The expert witness in a case may be subpoenaed, compelled to attend upon the court and there testify the same as any other witness and is entitled to the same fees as provided in Section 1302, and such fees may be properly taxed in the \u201cbill of costs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">If, however, it is deemed essential by the prosecuting attorney to the due administration of justice to enter into a special contract with such witness by reason of some special or expert knowledge he possesses relative to the issues involved in the trial such employment may be made under the provisions of Section 1302-1, and the county commissioners may allow said witness such extra compensation for his service rendered the prosecuting attorney in the preparation and trial of the case, as they may deem just and proper, but there is no authority of law to tax such extra compensation in the \u201cbill of costs\u201d to be paid out of the state treasury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-7\">Section 7332, Revised Statutes, contains no provision for including in the complete \u201cbill of costs\u201d the extra compensation paid a witness for his services as an expert under Section 1302-1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-8\">The word \u201ccosts\u201d has a legal signification and-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>includes only those expenditures which are by law taxable. <em>State, ex </em>rel., v. <em>Commissioners, </em>14 C.

Sections 153 and 154, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b378-7\">Summers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"At-h\">Counsel for relator contend that a bill of the costs made in a prosecution would not be complete without including the compensation of the expert; and that the law having imposed upon the prosecuting attorney the duty of examining into the \u201ccorrectness and legality of each and every item therein charged,\u201d it is neither the duty nor the privilege of the auditor of state to pass upon the legality of any item so certified by the prosecuting attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Costs, in the sense the word is generally used in this state, may be defined as being the statutory fees to which officers, witnesses, jurors and others are entitled for their services in an action or prosecution and which the statutes authorize to be taxed and included in the judgment or sentence. The word does not have a fixed legal signification. As originally used it meant an allowance to a party for expenses incurred in prosecuting or de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>fending a suit. Costs did not necessarily cover all \u2022of the expenses and they were distinguishable from fees and disbursements. They are allowed only by authority of statute, and the word not having a fixed legal signification, it does not follow that the compensation of the expert, though an expense, is costs made in the prosecution. The following sections of the Revised Statutes are cited as supporting the contention of the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u201c(1302-1) Sec. 1. (Employment and pay of expert witnesses.) When, in the examination or trial of any person accused of the commission of crime, or upon inquiry before the grand jury it shall appear to the prosecuting attorney or the assistant prosecuting attorney to be necessary to the due administration of justice to procure examination by chemical or other experts, or the testimony of expert witnesses, the county commissioners may, upon the certificate of the prosecuting attorney or his assistant, that such services were or will be necessary to the due administration of justice, allow and to pay such expert such compensation for his services as the court approves and' as the commissioners may deem just and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">\u201cSec. 1306. (When costs in criminal case paid out of county treasury.) In all felonies, when the defendant- is convicted the costs of the justice of the peace, police judge, or justice, mayor, marshal, chief of police, constable and witnesses, shall be paid out of the county treasury and inserted in the judgment of conviction, so that, except in capital cases, the same may be paid to the county out of -the state treasury; provided in all cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>when recognizances are taken, forfeited and collected and in which there is no conviction said-costs shall be paid out of the county treasury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u201cSec. 7332- (Cost bill in case of felony to be made up and certified.) Upon sentence of any person for felony, the officers claiming costs made in the prosecution shall deliver to the clerk itemized bills thereof, who shall make and certify, under his hand .and seal of the court, <em>a complete bill of the costs made in the prosecution, </em>including any sum paid by the county commissioners for the arrest and return of the convict on the requisition of the governor, or on the request of the governor made to the president of the United States, <em>which said complete bill of costs </em>shall be presented by the clerk to the prosecuting attorney and it shall be his duty to examine into the correctness and legality of each and every item therein charged, and to certify to the same if correct and legal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\u201cSec. 7333- (Writs of execution to issue on sentence.) The clerk shall immediately issue to the sheriff of the county in which the iijdictment was found, and to the sheriff of any other county in which the convict has property, executions against his property for the costs of prosecution, which shall be served and returned within ten days, with the proceedings of the sheriff indorsed thereon, or the want of property upon which to levy the same, as the case may be; when a levy is made upon property under such execution, a writ shall immediately be issued by the clerk for the sale thereof; and the sheriff shall proceed to sell the property as in other cases, and make return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>thereof according to law, and after paying the costs of conviction, and of execution of sale, pay the balance to the person authorized to receive the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u201cSec. 7336. (Warden shall certify correctness of cost bill, etc.) When the clerk certifies on the cost bill that execution was issued according to the provisions of this chapter, and returned by the sheriff indorsed, \u2018No goods or chattels, lands or tenements, found whereon to levy/ the warden shall allow so much of the cost bill and charges for transportation as he finds to be correct, and certify such allowance, which shall be paid by the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">However, Chapter 30, Title IX, Revised Statutes, relating to fees and costs, comprising Section 1302, and Section 1302:i, was not enacted as supplementary to that chapter, or as amendatory of, or supplementary to, Section 1302, but as an independent act. It is entitled: \u201cAn act relating to the employment and pay of expert witnesses\u201d (95 O. L., 282). It was passed April 28, 1902, and first appeared in sectional numbering in Bates\u2019 Annotated Statutes, 4th edition, published in 1903. There is nothing in the act authorizing this expense to be taxed as costs, or to be paid otherwise than by the county commissioners. Nor is it at all certain that the statute would have authorized the payment of this expense from the state treasury if the act had been passed as supplementary to Section 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">The next contention is, that the duty of the auditor of state is merely ministerial, while the duty enjoined'on the prosecuting attorney is, \u201cto examine into the correctness and legality of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and every item therein charged, and to certify to the same if correct and legal,\u201d and that this requires him to pass judgment upon the legality of the item and that the legislature must have intended that his determination should be binding upon the auditor of state. If so, 'why is it provided in Section 7336 that: \u201cThe warden shall allow so much of the cost bill and charges for transportation as he finds to be correct?\u201d Section 153, Revised Statutes, provides that no money shall be drawn out of the treasury except on warrant of the auditor of state. And Section 154 provides that, \u201che shall not draw any warrant on the treasurer for any claim unless he finds the same legal, and that there is money in the treasury which has been duly appropriated to pay the same.\u201d These provisions, that the clerk shall make up and certify the cost bill, that the prosecuting attorney shall examine into the correctness and legality of each item, and that the warden shall only certify what he finds correct, and that the auditor of state shall not draw a warrant unless he finds the claim legal, are cumulative safeguards of the public funds. And being such, the auditor of state is not concluded by the determination of the prosecuting attorney, and the expenses of the expert witness not being authorized to be drawn from the state treasury, the writ must be refused, and the petition is dismissed at the cost of the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b382-8\">Shauck, C.
