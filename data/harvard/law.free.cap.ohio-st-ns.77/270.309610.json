Moormann, commenced an action in the Superior Court of Cincinnati against the defendants in error, John FI. Voss and Robert A. Moormann, to recover a balance of $2,161.18, which she alleged was due her from said Voss and Moormann, on a certain promissory note of which, omitting the indorsements thereon, the following is a copy:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-11\">\u201c$2,950.90.

To this petition the defendant/ John H. Voss, filed an answer in which he admitted the making and execution of the-note sued on, but denied each and every other allegation in plaintiff\u2019s petition contained. And by way of further and affirmative defense alleged \u201cthat if it be true that the plaintiff is the owner and holder of said note, and was such owner and holder at the times stated in plaintiff\u2019s petition, then Frank J. Moormann, husband of the plaintiff, acted as agent for the plaintiff, and as such received payment thereon at divers times, which payments were credited by said Frank J.

Moormann filed the following reply:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-12\">\u201cNow comes the plaintiff, and for reply to the answer of the defendant, John H. Voss, says that she denies that Frank J. Moormann, her husband, acted as her agent or had authority to act as her agent generally or in receiving the notice set forth in the answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-13\">\u201cPlaintiff further says that she has no knowledge and therefore denies that the defendant, John H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Voss, signed the note merely for the accommodation of his co-maker, Robert A. Moormann, and as surety for Robert A. Moormann. She further says that at the time when she purchased said note she had no knowledge or notice of any claim on the part of the defendant, John H. Voss, that he was a surety upon said note or had signed the same for the accommodation of the said Robert A. Moormann, and that she purchased the note as the joint note of both the makers thereof and looking for payment of the note to both and each of them. Plaintiff admits that the contents of the note set forth in the answer were communicated to her by her husband sometime after the receipt thereof but says that she paid no attention to same because it was not addressed to her and she understood and was advised that it was not a legal notice requiring her to act. Plaintiff further denies every other allegation in said answer not herein or in her original petition admitted and prays as in her original petition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">Thereafter, to-wit on January 20, 1904, John H. Voss, by leave of court, filed what is denominated in the record an \u201cAdditional Answer,\u201d pleading payment of said note in full. Rose F. Moormann, by \u201cAdditional Reply,\u201d denied such payment. The defendant, Robert A. Moormann, filed no answer and made no defense. Upon the trial of the cause in special term, the superior court refused to permit the defendant, John H. Voss, to give in evidence to the jury the notice of November 17, 1900, directed and mailed to Frank J. Moormann, for the reason, as stated by the court, that the same was not a notice to Rose F. Moor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>mann, the creditor. And in the charge, the court instructed the jury touching this matter as follows: \u201cSince there is no evidence that notice as required by law was given to her as principal creditor, I charge you that even were you to find defendant, Voss, to be a surety \u2014 one who signed for accommodation merely \u2014 he would under the circumstances in this case, still be liable, provided you find plaintiff purchased said note for value without notice and before maturity.\u201d The jury returned a general verdict in favor of the plaintiff and against both defendants for the full amount claimed. A motion for a new trial was filed by John H. Voss, assigning as grounds therefor: 1. \u201cThe verdict is contrary to law and is against the law.\u201d 2. \u201cThe verdict is against the weight of the evidence.\u201d 3. \u201cThe court erred in the admission of evidence offered by the plaintiff and objected to by the defendant.\u201d 4. \u201cThe court erred in the rejection of evidence offered by the defendant, to which the defendant duly excepted.\u201d 5. \u201cThe court erred in its charge to the jury.\u201d This motion was overruled by the court, and judgment was thereupon entered on the verdict. Proper exceptions were saved throughout. On petition in error to the general term of the superior court, the judgment against John H. Voss was, by that court, reversed, and the following entry was made in said cause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">\u201cThis cause came on to be heard upon the petition in error, the original papers and pleadings from the Superior Court of Cincinnati in special term, was argued by counsel and submitted to the court. On consideration whereof the court finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>that there is error apparent on the record, in the proceedings of said court to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error, in this, to-wit: In holding and deciding that the written notice mailed to Frank J. Moormann, requiring him to sue upon .the note described in the petition, was not a sufficient notice to the defendant in error, Rose F. Moormann, under Section 5833, Revised Statutes of Ohioj although the said Frank J. Moormann was the husband and had been acting as the agent of the said Rose F. Moormann, and showed said notice to the said Rose F. Moormann within a short time after its receipt; and in the rulings of the court upon the evidence, and the charge of the court to the jury involving this proposition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">The court further finds that it is unnecessary to consider the other errors assigned in the petition in error and does not consider them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">Wherefore, it is considered by the court that the judgment rendered by the court in special term, in so far as the same purports to be a judgment against the plaintiff in error, be, and the same is hereby reversed and held for naught. To all of which the defendant in error, Rose F. Moormann, excepts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">And the court further finding that the facts as to said notice are shown by undisputed testimony, and proceeding to render such judgment as such court in special term should have rendered, it is considered that the defendant in error, Rose F. Moormann, is not entitled to recover anything from the plaintiff in error, John H. Voss; that the petition of said Rose F. Moormann, plaintiff below, be dismissed as to the plaintiff in error, John H. Voss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>defendant below; and that the said plaintiff in error recover from the defendant in error, Rose F. Moormann, his costs herein and in the court below expended. To all of which the said Rose F. Moormann now excepts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">Rose F.

Its language would seem to be clear and unambiguous. It requires a written notice to the creditor, requiring him to commence an action forthwith against the principal debtor. A notice to anyone else than the creditor is not sufficient. The notice, in this case, was addressed\u2019 to Frank J. Moormann, not as agent or attorney, but personally, and required him, as the holder of the note in suit, to bring an action. There is not one word in it of request, warning or command intended for or addressed to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-9\">It has been universally held that such statutes as Section 5833 should be strictly construed. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Osborn, </em>41 Ohio St., 28; <em>Baker et al., Admrs. </em>v. <em>Kellogg et al., </em>29 Ohio St., 663.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-10\">A notice to an agent or a husband, requiring him to sue, is not a compliance with the statute, though communicated to the real party in interest.

L. B., 330; <em>Baker et al., Admrs., </em>v. <em>Kellogg et al., </em>29 Ohio St., 663; <em>Iliff </em>v. <em>Meymouth, </em>40 Ohio St., 101.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b318-8\">Crew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A47\">It clearly and affirmatively appearing from the record herein, that the only matter considered or adjudicated in this case by the superior court in general term, was that of the sufficiency of the notice given by John PT. Voss as surety, it follows that our present' inquiry must be limited to a consideration of the propriety and correctness of the judgment of the superior court in that behalf. John H. Voss, as surety, claimed to be discharged and released from all liability upon the note in suit, by reason of the delay of Rose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>F. Moormann to commence an action thereon within a reasonable time after the service of notice upon her husband, Frank J. Moormann, requesting him to bring suit thereon, forthwith, against Robert A. Moormann, the principal debtor. There is no dispute in this case as to the form of the notice, and no claim is made that it was intended for, or addressed to, Rose F. Moormann, the creditor, although it is'admitted that the contents of said notice were communicated to her by her husband. Section 5833, Revised Statutes, provides as follows: <em>\u201cA </em>person bound as surety in a written instrument for the payment of money, or other valuable thing, may, if a right of action accrue thereon, require his. creditor, by notice in writing, to commence an action on such instrument forthwith, against the principal debtor; and unless the creditor commence such action' within a reasonable time thereafter, and proceed with due diligence, in the ordinary course of law, to recover judgment against the principal debtor for the money or other valuable thing due thereby, and to make, by execution, the amount thereof, the creditor, or the assignee of such instrument, so failing to comply with the requisition of such surety, shall thereby forfeit the right which he would otherwise have to demand and receive of such surety the amount due-thereon.\u201d Inasmuch as this statute is clearly in derogation of the common law, and in terms provides a forfeiture of the right of action against the surety where the creditor disregards the notice to sue; in accordance with established rules of interpretation, the statute should not be extended beyond its plain terms, and the remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>thereby afforded should be strictly pursued. In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Kellogg, </em>29 Ohio St., 665, this court said: \u201cIn view of the fact that the statute provides for the release of a party from a fixed legal liability-\u2014 from the payment of a debt which he justly ow.es\u2014 its' requirements should be at least substantially, if not strictly and literally complied with.\u201d In <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Osborn, </em>41 Ohio St., 36, the court, speaking of this statute, says: \u201cThe statute,' in a sense, is a part of the contract. The suretyship is accepted with knowledge of its terms. It gives rights to both parties. The right of the creditor is to disregard with impunity any notice not in strict conformity to its terms. This is his privilege, and concerns him alone, and is unaffected by considerations of public policy.\u201d These authorities alone, upon the conceded or undisputed facts, are, we think, decisive of the present case. However, as examination discloses that like holdings have been made under similar statutes, by courts of last resort in other states, we call attention briefly to the following additional decisions: In <em>Driskill </em>v. <em>Board of Commissioners, </em>53 Ind., 532, the appellee, as creditor and obligee, \u2022had sued the appellant and one Daniel B. Driskill, as obligors on a penal bond. As a defense appellant pleaded in the second paragraph of his answer, that after said bond became due he notified Fred L. Prow, the attorney of the appellee, in writing, that he was only surety for the co-defendant, Daniel B. Driskill, and directed said attorney to institute proceedings at once upon said bond for its collection, and that he would stand responsible no longer. To this answer the appellee demurred, and his demurrer was sustained by the lower court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Upon appeal to the supreme court, that court, in considering and commenting upon the sufficiency of this answer, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cIt is evident that the appellant, in this second paragraph of his answer, has attempted to frame a defense to the action which would be good under the requirements of Sections 672 and 673, of our practice act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201cSection 672 provides as follows: \u2018Any person bound as surety upon any contract in writing for the payment of money, or the performance of any act, when the right of action has accrued, may require, by notice in writing, the creditor or obligee forthwith to institute an action upon the contract.\u2019 2 Revised Statutes, 1876, p. 276.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\u201cIn the paragraph of appellant\u2019s answer now under consideration, the written notice did not require the creditor or obligee in the bond sued on to institute an action upon the contract; but instead thereof, the notice mentioned in this paragraph was to Fred L. Prow, who is described as the appellee\u2019s attorney, and directed him, and not the appellee, to institute proceedings on the bond. It is clear, we think, that the written notice described in this paragraph of the answer is not such a notice as the section quoted requires to be given. The remedy given by Sections 672 and 673 of our code of practice to sureties upon written contracts is purely a statutory remedy, and has never been regarded, in this state, as a part of the common law. <em>Halstead </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>17 Ind., 202. The surety who desires to avail himself of this remedy must do just what Section 672, in plain terms, requires him to do; he must, by written notice, require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>creditor or obligee to institute an action upon the contract. In our opinion, the notice in this case was clearly insufficient, and, therefore, the demurrer to the second paragraph of the answer was properly sustained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">In Davis, <em>Admr., </em>v. <em>Snead et al., </em>33 Grattan, 705, the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, reviewing the statute of that state relating to sureties, passed in 1873 \u2014 which statute, in its provisions, is substantially the same as Section 5833 of the Ohio Statutes \u2014 says: \u201cThis statute is substantially the same as that of 1794 found in the Revised Code, 1819, page 461.\u201d * * * \u201cThis statute of 1794 was the first enactment ever adopted in Virginia, authorizing notice by a surety to a creditor to sue, and imposing upon the latter a forfeiture of all claims against the surety as a consequence of his failure to comply with the requisition. * ' * *</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u201cIt will be observed that both by the act of 1794, and the present statute, the notice must be given to the <em>creditor </em>himself, and in the event of his death, to his personal representative. Under various provisions contained in the code, proceedings may be instituted against a creditor or other persons by notice to his agent or attorney. But under the statute we are now considering, no such indulgence is allowed. The reason is obvious. The statute is very stringent in its operation. The effect of the failure to sue after notice is an absolute forfeiture of all claims against every surety upon the bond, or other instrument. It is to such surety an absolute extinguishment of the debt. It was therefore wisely provided, that the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>should be given to the creditor himself, and him only; and the release of the surety should be the result of the creditor\u2019s act and his only.\u201d In <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>85 Ill., 22, the third clause of the syllabus is as follows: \u201cTo release a surety under the statute, proof must be made of a notice in writing by him to the holder of the obligation, to put the same in suit, and a refusal or neglect to do so. Proof of the delivery \u25a0 of such notice to an agent of the holder,\u2019 and that the agent told the holder of the fact, is not sufr ficient.\u201d In <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Sherman et al., </em>15 Ia., 365, we find the following syllabus: \u201cA surety seeking to discharge himself from liability on a promissory note, in the method provided by chapter 75 of the revision of i860, must comply fully with the requirements of the statute.\u201d Like holdings are made, and a like principle and rule announced, in the following cases: <em>Cummins &amp; Fenno </em>v. <em>Garretson, </em>15 Ark., 132; <em>England </em>v. <em>McKamey, </em>4 Sneed, 75; <em>Gillian </em>v. <em>Luddington, </em>6 W. Va., 128; <em>Coykendall </em>v. <em>Constable, </em>48 Hun, 360; <em>Sapington </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>15 Mo., 628; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Purdy et al., </em>82 N. Y., 486; <em>Shimer </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>47 Pa. St., 268. Not a single authority was cited by the superior court in general term in support of its finding, that the notice in question was, under the statute, because communicated to her, a sufficient notice to Rose F. Moormann. And none of the authorities cited here by counsel for defendant in error support that proposition. The plain requirement of the statute is, that the notice shall be given to the <em>creditor, </em>that is, to the person to whom the debt is owing, and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>has the present right to institute suit on the instrument, to recover the amount due. As no one else can forgive or release the debt, so also, no one else can, without his consent, involve the creditor in a forfeiture of his right of action against the surety. In the present case it is neither averred nor proved, that Frank J. Moormann was constituted the agent of Rose F. Moormann, the creditor, to accept and receive for her, this notice and it is not claimed that he was constituted the agent of John H. Voss, to deliver said notice to her. As we have seen, the name of Rose F. Moormann, does not appear in said notice. The notice was addressed to, and was intended for Frank J. Moormann, her husband, who was treated by Voss, the surety, as the real owner of said note. The notice \u2014 which was sufficient in form \u2014 was therefore, simply given to, and served on, the wrong party; and the mere fact that Frank J. Moormann thereafter communicated or exhibited such notice to his wife, would not affect, much less extinguish, her right of action against the surety. And especially should this be so where, as in the present case, at the time of exhibiting the notice to her he, being an attorney at law, then advised her that the same was not a notice to her, and that she need pay no attention to it whatever. For the reasons above stated, and upon the principles established by the foregoing authorities, we think it clear, that the notice to Frank J. Moormann was not binding upon Rose F. Moormann, the creditor, but that as to her, such notice was a mere nullity. It follows that the judgment of the superior court in general term, finding that said notice was sufficient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>and was effective to release and discharge the surety, John H. Voss, from all liability on the note in suit, was erroneous, and must be reversed. And it affirmatively appearing from the record in this case that the superior court in general term did not consider or pass upon all the assignments of error in the petition in error in that court, one of which was that the judgment of the trial court was against the weight of the evidence, the cause will be remanded to said superior court in general term, with instructions to consider and pass- upon all the errors assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b325-6\">Shauck, C.
