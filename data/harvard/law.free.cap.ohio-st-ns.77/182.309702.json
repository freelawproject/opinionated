L., 99), whose constitutional validity is challenged in the present case upon the ground alleged in the petition, that it was never presented to the governor as required by the amendment to Article II, Section 16, of the constitution adopted in November, 1903. The case proceeded to trial upon an issue as to the presentation to the governor of the bill after it had passed both houses of the general assembly. The court below admitted the record evidence upon the subject of presentation, and excluded all oral evidence offered by the plaintiff to sustain the allegation of his petition that the bill had not been presented to the governor. It was known in the legislative proceedings as House Bill No. 24. It was not signed by the governor, but the superior court found the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">\u201cOn consideration thereof the court does find that there appears in the general record of the governor of Ohio, under date of March 28, 1906, the following entry:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">\u201c 'March 28.

Cohen &amp; Mack; Mr. Rufus B. Smith; Mr. Albert Bettinger; Mr. A. J. Freiberg; Mr. Charles A. Groom </em>and <em>Messrs. Rowe, Shuey, Matthews &amp; James, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-9\">The constitutional requirement that every bill shall \u201cbe. presented to the governor\u201d requires his physical possession or control of the enrolled bill for the. purpose of affording him an opportunity to examine it and exercise his right of approval, objection, or allowing the bill to become law by failure to approve or object \u201cwithin ten days after being so presented.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-10\">The mere reading of the amendment to Article II, Section 16 (95 O. L., 962), shows that the provision that \u201cevery bill passed by both houses of the general assembly shall, before said bill can become law, be presented to the governor,\u201d requires the physical possession or control by the governor of the enrolled copy bearing the signatures of the officers of the two houses. It is specifically . provided that \u201cif he approves he shall sign said bill,\u201d and obviously such act requires his physical possession or control of the enrolled bill. It is specifically provided that \u201cif he object he shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>not sign and shall return said bill\u201d; obviously this requires the possession or control of the enrolled bill for the purpose of returning it to the house where it originated. It is specifically provided that \u201cif any bill passed by both houses of the general assembly and presented to the governor is not signed and is not returned to the house wherein it originated and within ten days after being so presented, exclusive of Sunday and the day said bill was presented, said bill shall be law in like manner as if signed\u201d; obviously, it is the enrolled bill of which the governor had physical possession or control, for the purpose of signing or returning it, which thus becomes law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-5\">We are, however, not without judicial decisions upon this subject. The Constitution of the United States and of the other states contain provisions similar to the Ohio provision, the difference being simply as to the time within which the executive is to act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b227-6\">In every case in which the question has arisen the construction placed by the courts upon such provisions of the constitution, requires the physical possession or control by the governor of the bill, for the purpose of enabling him to approve or object, and the decision holds that until such opportunity is afforded, the bill is not \u201cpresented\u201d as required by the constitution. Supplement, 99 Mass., 636; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>135 Mass., 594; <em>Farwell </em>v. <em>City of Boston, </em>78 N. E. Rep., 303; <em>State, ex rel. </em>v. <em>South Norwalk et al., </em>77 Conn., 257; <em>Harpending </em>v. <em>Haight, Governor, </em>39 Cal., 189; <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>92 Ky., 216; <em>State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number><em>ex rel., </em>v. <em>Deal, </em>24 Fla., 293; <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>52 La. Ann., 936.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-6\">In Ohio, it is provided who shall present to the governor a bill passed by the general assembly, and how the time and fact of such presentation shall be evidenced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-7\">Joint Rule 19, adopted by the Seventy-sixth General Assembly of Ohio, on February 11, 1904, and readopted February 1, 1906, by the Seventy-seventh General Assembly, is found in 98 Ohio Laws, at page 401. This joint rule, so far as it applies to the case at bar, is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-8\">\u201cRule 19. Each bill and joint resolution shall be first signed by the speaker of- the House of Representatives, and then by the president of the Senate, who shall fix the date and hour thereto, and be by him delivered to the clerk of the Senate, who shall immediately transmit each bill so passed to the governor of Ohio, taking a receipt therefor,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-9\">As to the method pursued in other states, see: <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>71 Mo., 266; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>33 Ill., 149; <em>Hamilton, Governor, </em>v. <em>State, ex rel., </em>61 Md., 14; <em>Lankford et al. </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>73 Md., 105; <em>Danielly et al. </em>v. <em>Cabaniss et al., </em>52 Ga., 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b228-10\">The record provided for in Joint Rule 19 being the only record provided by law of the fact and date of presentation, certainty, to say the least, no conclusive force can be given to any other so-called record; and if in this case there were on file in the office of the clerk of the senate a receipt signed by the governor himself, it might be claimed (although the cases we shall hereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>cite would show that a record as to presentation may be contradicted) that such record was conclusive. But the receipt on file in the office of the clerk of the senate, in the case at bar, is a receipt by a clerk of the governor \u2014 not such a receipt as the joint rule provides for- \u2014 -and therefore is of no effect, not being a receipt provided by law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-6\">One of two conclusions, it seems to us, must follow upon reading the record in the office of the clerk of the senate, viz.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-7\">1st. Either that the record on its face expressly shows that a personal presentation to the governor, as is required by the constitution and joint rule, was not made; or,</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-8\">2d. That the record fails to show a personal presentation to the governor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-9\">If the record required by Joint Rule 19, of the presentation of the Aikin bill to the governor, is silent as to the presentation of that bill to the governor, then the evidence offered is competent. This evidence would not contradict such record, but would supply such omission. <em>Ratcliff </em>v. <em>Teters, </em>27 Ohio St., 83; <em>Albright </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>43 Ohio St., 16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-10\">The signature of \u201cLewis B. Houck, Secretary to the Governor,\u201d to the endorsement on the enrolled Aikin bill, is of no greater. force than if it were that of any private citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-11\">As the Constitution of Ohio vests in the governor alone the power to approve or veto bills or allow the same to become laws within ten days after same have been presented to him, it would seem to require no argument to prove that this power can not be delegated by the governor, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>can any one bind the governor by act, statement or certificate in relation to such matters. <em>People, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>19 Ill., 283; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Green, </em>71 Ark., 527.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-6\">Moreover, the same argument which we have advanced above in reference to the certificate of Mr. Houck to the endorsement on the enrolled bill, applies with reference to this entry in the \u201cMinute Book.\u201d There is no authority in the constitution or statutes of Ohio with reference to such book being kept in the office of the governor, nor is there any semblance of authority for such act. Therefore, even if the \u201cMinute Book\u201d would purport to expressly state the date of the presentation of the bill to the governor, nevertheless such entry would be of no greater force in this case than if made by a private citizen or in a book kept by a private citizen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-7\">The entry made by Mr. Houck in the general record of the governor is without authority of law. If such entry is authorized by law, it is only <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the facts therein, stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-8\">Sections 107 and 108, Revised Statutes, were first enacted-in 1876 (73 O. L., 201), nearly thirty years before the veto power was given to the governor. It may be asserted, therefore, that in their enactments the legislature did not have in mind any action of the governor with respect to bills presented to him. It is also true that if the legislature had supposed these sections sufficient to constitute the evidence of a'presentation of a bill to the governor, it would nof have been necessary to provide a record by Joint Rule No. 19. It is not necessary for us to claim that it would be im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>proper for the governor to order an entry made concerning the presentation of a. bill on his general record; but such an entry, though ordered by the governor to be made, would not constitute the record which the law (Joint Rule 19) requires.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-5\">There must be an \u201cofficial\u201d proceeding before it can be entered on the record. If the governor never acted in regard to a matter, there was no official proceeding, and there can therefore be no entry. An entry made under such circumstances is unauthorized and void.-</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-6\">But even if the entry had been expressly authorized by the governor, it would only be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the facts therein stated. This plainly appears from the express language of Sections 108 and 5245, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-7\">We have already shown, we submit, that the endorsement and the entries were unauthorized, and are of no greater force than if made by a private citizen. We call attention to the cases on the question of presentation or return of a bill by the governor, in which the courts heard parol evidence as to all the facts, notwithstanding the enrolled bill was signed by the governor. In none of them could the questions which the courts considered have been raised unless the facts could have been called to the attention of the courts by parol testimony. This appears from the following brief summary of the cases, viz.: Supplement, 99 Mass., 636; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>135 Mass., 594; <em>Farwell </em>v. <em>City of Boston, </em>78 N. E. Rep., 303; <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Warfield, Governor, </em>100 Md., 516; <em>People, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>19 Ill., 282; <em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>92 Ky., 216; <em>Harpend </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>ing </em>v. <em>Haight, Governor, </em>39 Cal., 189; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Green, </em>71 Ark., 527; <em>Hamilton, Governor, </em>v. <em>State, ex rel., </em>61 Md., 14; <em>Soldiers\u2019 Voting Bill, </em>45 N.

Rep., 174.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-6\">Wholly ignoring the provisions of Section 108, Revised Statutes, as to records in the governor\u2019s office, and declaring that Joint Rule 19 does not govern the official record to be made concerning the fact and date of presentation of bills, our opponents cite a number of cases for the purpose of sustaining their contention that all public records in Ohio are conclusive of the facts therein stated. These cases have no application to the case at bar. In Ohio, the records of township \u25a0 trustees and county commissioners are treated as judicial records, because such boards have judicial powers conferred upon them, and there is an appeal and error proceeding provided. <em>Beebe </em>v. <em>Scheidt et al., </em>13 Ohio St., 406; <em>Carpenter et al. </em>v. <em>State, </em>12 Ohio St., 457; <em>Ratcliff </em>v. <em>Teters, </em>27 Ohio St., 66.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-7\">The general rule is, and it is adopted in Ohio, that public records are only <em>prima facie </em>evidence. <em>Hagerty, Auditor, et al. </em>v. <em>Huddleston, Hubbard &amp; Co., </em>60 Ohio St., 149; <em>Reynolds et al. </em>v. <em>Schweinefus, </em>27 Ohio St., 311; <em>Westerhaven </em>v. <em>Clive, </em>5 Ohio, 136.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-8\"><em>Messrs. Ireton, Schoenle &amp; Poor, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-9\">The record of the presentation of the Aikin bill to the governor is a legislative record, which rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>ord is conclusive, ar d can not be impeached by parol evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-5\">The constitutional amendment granting to the governor of Ohio the veto power was by the joint resolution of the general assembly (95 O. L., 962), Article II, Section 16, of constitution, and on November 3, 1905, by a vote of the people, made part of the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHZ\">Under this constitutional amendment the governor is part of the law-making power, and when this legislative duty is concluded, and not until then, do his powers, duties and prerogatives as chief executive of this state arise to see that all laws are properly executed. This constitutional amendment clearly shows that the acts and duties of the governor thereunder are legislative and not executive. The cases from other states are all to this effect: <em>People </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>210 Ill., 488; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>81 Me., 538; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clayton, </em>5 Utah, 598; <em>Hovey, Governor, </em>v. <em>State, ex rel., </em>119 Ind., 395; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Hurford, </em>13 Neb., 13; <em>State </em>v. <em>Deal, </em>24 Fla., 293; <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Boesch et al., </em>67 Iowa, 702; <em>Hardee </em>v. <em>Gibbs, Auditor, </em>50 Miss., 802; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cromise, </em>36 Neb., 835; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bowen et al., </em>21 N. <em>Y., </em>577.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-7\">If a bill passed by both branches of the legislature may receive its final approval and validity by being presented to the governor for his consideration, then it follows that such record of presentation is a legislative record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b233-8\">This being established, it follows that its evidence is absolutely conclusive, as is the case with every legislative record. Parol testimony is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>competent to prove that this legislative record is untrue, or that it be a fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b234-6\">There are several cases directly in point, which hold that the record of presentation of bills to the governor is a legislative record, and that it can not be impeached in any manner or for any reason by parol evidence. <em>People </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>210 Ill., 488; <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>81 Me., 538; <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>44 Ohio St., 349; <em>People </em>v. <em>Clayton, </em>5 Utah, 598; <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Richards et al., </em>14 Utah, 345; <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Young, Treas., </em>32 N.

It is within his power to say to the legislature, either expressly or impliedly, by long acquiescence in such a mode of delivery: \u201cDelivery of a bill to my official representative at my office will be considered as a presentation to me.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-7\">When a statute requires an act to be done by a public official it is universally held that if the act is merely ministerial, requiring the exercise of no discretion, its performance may be delegated. Surely, under this rule, a governor may delegate to an official secretary power to receive a bill from the messenger of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-8\">Ever since the amendment of Section 16, of Article II of the Constitution, the custom and joint rule of the legislature has been for the clerk of the senate to deliver bills at the office of the governor and take the receipt of the clerk therefor. This custom has been acquiesced in and the rule established and followed by two legislatures and two governors. <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>South Norwalk et al., </em>77 Conn., 257; <em>Harpendinger </em>v. <em>Haight, Governor, </em>39 Cal., 189; <em>Soldiers\u2019 Voting Bill, </em>45 N.

The same reasoning adopted by the courts which protects the legislative journals from kindred attacks, likewise protects the record of the governor made in connection with such acts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">We submit that it would be futile to surround the legislative journals with the presumptions of verity and likewise protect them from evidence <em>aliunde, </em>if the record of the governor, in connection with a legislative act, should be made subject to such attacks. So when authority is found denying the right to attack such journals, with the class of evidence sought to be introduced herein, the same authorities support our contention with regard to the governor\u2019s record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">In connection with this proposition we \u2022 only offer such further authorities as have not been cited in the very full and able brief of the solic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>itors of Hamilton county. <em>Andrews et al. </em>v. <em>People, </em>79 Pac.

The record as to his action thereon, kept in the office of the governor, and the act being deposited in the office of the secretary of state, makes its authentication complete, and all the preceding steps are conclusively presumed to have been accomplished prior to the deposit of the enrolled act with the secretary of state. <em>Field </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>143 U.

But even in those states where the evidence of enrollment is not conclusive, it is uniformly held, where the journals are merely silent, that the presumption is absolute that the required steps were, in fact, taken. <em>Lafferty et al. </em>v. <em>Huffman, </em>32 L.

This section has not been amended in any respect since 1883. We agree that it could not have been contemplated at the time of the original enactment of Section 107, Revised Statutes, that the general record mentioned therein would ever be made the record to contain the evidence of the acts of the governor on legislative bills, pursuant to the requirement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>constitutional amendment of 1903. There is, therefore, no statutory demand for such record. The common law rule, heretofore repeatedly announced, would protect the integrity of the act by a conclusive presumption that everything which was required to be done, was done, record or no record. And if the record of such act was preserved in \u201cthe general record\u201d kept in the governor\u2019s office, the particular entry in that record would be preserved from impeachment by oral testimony, although all other entries of his \u201cofficial proceedings\u201d might not be included with such presumption.</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">The truth of the facts stated in the endorsement on the bill can not be controverted by parol evidence. <em>People </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>210 Ill., 488.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-6\"><em>Mr. Wade PI. Ellis, </em>attorney general, in oral argument, said:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">It is proper to emphasize the grave effect upon other legislation that would follow a decision that the so-called Aikin bill was not validly enacted. If it is manifest that a certain construction of the constitution or of a statute would produce great confusion in the state, involve a multiplicity of other statutes and bring to a standstill the orderly conduct of the government because a doubt as to the validity of a number of acts creating public offices, fixing the compensation of officers, establishing state departments, and appropriating money to pay the general expenses of the state, as well as to support the institutions of charity and the public schools, a court might well hesitate before it would acquiesce in such a construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The present case involves even more than an attack upon other laws. It is, in effect, an attempt to try the title to the office of governor, to determine the capacity of the late Governor Pattison to discharge the duties of his office and to try that question not only in a collateral proceeding, but long after the man whose competency is challenged has forever surrendered the right to defend himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-6\">The first point insisted upon by the state is that every step necessary to a valid enactment of the Aikin. law is shown by the record, and the only way that record can be disputed is by something to be found on the face of it. It imports absolute verity. It can not be impeached by parol. This record consists of the legislative journals; the receipt of the bill issued by the executive department; the general record in the office of the governor required to be kept by Section 107, Revised Statutes; the transmission of the bill to the secretary of state, as required by Section 128, Revised Statutes, and finally the bill itself in the office of the secretary of state where it is certified to by that officer and published among the \u2022 laws of- the state. Not one of these steps is missing-. But even if one were missing the act would be protected by the conclusive presumption of the regularity of its passage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-7\">Each of these steps is as \u25a0 important as every other. The same rule of law which imports verity to legislate journals protects other records which evidence the enactment of the statute at other stages. State, <em>ex rel., </em>v. Robinson, 81 N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>C., 409; <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>131 Fed. Rep., 39; <em>Clare </em>v. <em>State, </em>5 Ia., 510.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">The second point made by the state is that the words of the new amendment to the constitution, \u201cpresented to the governor,\u201d do not mean personally presented; delivered face to face; transmitted from the hand of the general assembly to the hand of the governor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">The custom during two administrations does not support such a manual presentation. Every act that has been passed since the amendment was adopted in 1903, has been taken by the clerk of the senate to the office of the governor and left there with those in charge of his office, and custom may properly be cited to sustain the construction put by the people, upon their constitution. <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>South Norwalk, </em>77 Conn., 257; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>45 N. H., 611.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-8\">Our adversaries contend that personal presentation is required because the ten days begin to run from the moment the bill is handed to the governor. If this is true, then all the governor would have to do, if he desired to be relieved of all responsibility,- would be to keep away from his office and prevent a personal presentation. Further, if he was opposed to a certain pending measure, was determined not to approve it, and yet knew that if he vetoed it it would be passed over his veto, he would simply prevent its presentation. He would refuse to receive it or receipt for it, and there being no personal presentation there would be no time from which the ten days would begin to run and the act could never become a law. Our adversaries may say that he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>be mandamused to receive the bill. Would this court mandamus the governor to keep certain office hours, to be at a certain spot where, immediately following the passage of every act, he could be found by the clerk of the senate? Would it,call from a sick-bed the governor to be in attendance at his office to receive a bill, or invade his chamber with its writ and force into his hands a bill which he was willing should become a law without his personal signature?</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-6\">The people of Ohio were thinking of three things in conferring the veto power. First, that the governor might veto a bill; second, that he might approve it; and third, that it might become a law without any executive action whatever. This third contingency was not provided in order to afford an opportunity to, and tempt, the gvernor to avoid his official responsibility, to shirk the obligation imposed upon him by the people. It was put in to protect the act, not to protect the governor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-7\">The third point presented by the state is that manifold evils would result from a rule that parol testimony is admissible to dispute record evidence of any step necessary to the valid enactment of a law. This very case would settle nothing if parol testimony is admissible to impeach the record in the governor\u2019s office. If the condition of Governor Pattison can be inquired into in this collateral way, and the question of fact as to whether or not this bill was personally presented to him can be tried by witnesses, there will be no stability of a judgment on the question except between the same parties. The next man who resists the Aikin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>tax and the next court which examines that testimony may be confronted with different witnesses and a different conclusion may be reached, and the Aikin law, as well as all others, may apply to some men and not to others, may be enforced as to some citizens of the state and not as to others. This suggestion need not be further pursued, for the evils that are apparent are all well stated in the opinion of this court in <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>44 Ohio St., 349.</p>\n<p data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">But our opponents, in the closing paragraph of their brief, say that if the records in the governor\u2019s office can not be impeached \u201cthen the secretary to the governor, or any other clerk of the governor in the absence of the governor, or in case of his disability, may usurp the power of the governor and preclude inquiry as to such usurpation by merely making an entry on the record of the governor.\u201d The supreme court of the United States in the case of <em>Field </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>143 U. S., 649, has silenced such fear effectively. \u201cBetter, far better,\u201d say the court, \u201cthat a provision should occasionally finds its way into the statutes through mistake or even fraud\u201d than that the authenticity of laws should depend upon transient and perishable testimony.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b247-6\">Shauck, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJk\">It being admitted that the bill was passed by both houses of the general assembly, and that the governor did not either sign it or return it to the house in which it originated with his objection thereto, its efficacy as a statute depends upon the following provision of the constitution: \u201cIf any bill passed by both houses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the general assembly, and presented to the governor, is not signed and is not returned to the house wherein it originated and within ten days after being so presented, exclusive of Sunday and the day said \"bill was presented, said bill shall be law as in like manner as - if signed.\u201d Counsel for the plaintiff conclude that with respect to this bill there was not the presentation to the governor which this provision of the constitution obviously requires. Upon analysis of the argument which they advance in support of that conclusion; two general propositions appear: That the record evidence of presentation is not sufficient to show conformity with the constitutional requirement, and that oral evidence may be introduced to support the allegation that there was not the required presentation. Since the constitution does not prescribe either the place or manner of presentation, or the evidence by which it should be shown, it seems necessary to consider the purpose for which presentation is required, for it will be safe to assume that the presentation is sufficient if appropriate to that purpose. While the duties of the governor are mainly of an executive character, to the. extent indicated by the constitutional provision quoted, he is admitted to participation in legislation. The three modes, in which he may deal with a bill, which has been passed by both branches of the general assembly and presented to him, alike involve consideration arid an exercise of his judgment respecting its merits. The manner and extent of that consideration are left to the determination of the governor without direction or restriction, except that he may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>retain the bill beyond the period of ten days. We can not accept any view of the case which assumes that his discretion in the premises is otherwise limited. He may, in any place and at once, give to the bill the force of the law by signing it; or he may within the ten days return it to the house in which it originated with a statement in writing of his objection thereto; or he may, if he so elects, permit it to become a law at the expiration of ten days without signifying either approval or objection. The object of the requirement of presentation obviously is to afford to the governor an opportunity for the considerate exercise of the discretion which is thus vested in him. To say that the object is to enable him to so exercise that discretion, is manifestly inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Was the presentation of this bill appropriate to the purpose stated? The foregoing statement of the case presents numerous written memorials intended to establish the fact of presentation. Among them is the following entry found in the general record of the governor: \u201cMarch 28. H. B. Number 24 presented to governor March 28. Filed secretary of state, April 10, 1906.\u201d The book in which this entry was made is certainly identified as regularly kept as the governor\u2019s record. It was kept to the knowledge and with the acquiescence of the governor. It had been received by him from his predecessor in office. It was kept in obedience to the requirement of Section 107 of the Revised Statutes that \u201cThe governor shall cause to be kept in his office a general record in which shall be entered a brief abstract of the official proceedings of each day.\u201d This par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>ticular entry was made by a subordinate of the governor in the discharge of duties to which he had been appointed, and the appointment was in strict conformity with the requirement that \u201cthe governor shall cause\u201d the record to be kept. Of like character is the entry in the book designated as the \u201cgovernor\u2019s receipt for bills,\u201d except that there appears to be no statute requiring it to be kept. Over the signature of the governor\u2019s executive clerk it contains a receipt for this bill on March 28. These records with respect to the bill are corroborated by the legislative record, and by those of the secretary of state, who is the custodian of the laws. The executive records referred to were kept in one of several rooms maintained by the state, devoted exclusively to the use of the governor in the conduct of his official business, and designated as the place for the conduct of that business. They seem to show the presentation required by the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Did the trial court err in excluding the oral evidence offered by the plaintiff? That evidence tended to show that the governor was in his office on the day of his inauguration, January 8, 1906; that he never returned to it, being confined to his residence by an illness which proved mortal on the, 18th day of the following June; that in the meantime, when his strength permitted, he received personal visits from his secretary, who conferred with him respecting the business of his office and pending legislation, and placed in his hands bills which had been presented at his office for his approval; that at one of these interviews while this bill was pending, he indicated his ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>proval of its provisions, but that on the 28th day of March, and during the ten days following, he was unable, by reason of his illness, to receive the bill or to give it any consideration. In some of the cases cited in the brief of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, parol evidence was received upon the subject of presentation of bills to the governor. In some of those cases the governor himself affirmed that the bill had not been presented to him, and in most of them it appears that both the law and the practice of the governor left the question of presentation to be determined wholly by evidence <em>in pais. </em>With what propriety evidence of that character was admitted, under such circumstances, we need not consider. Here a record of the fact was made, and this in accordance with not only the requirements of the statute and the custom prevailing in the governor\u2019s office, but in accordance with the policy long established and firmly adhered to requiring that the enactment of officially published statutes shall be impeached only by the records of their enactment. <em>Miller &amp; Gibson </em>v. <em>The State, </em>3 Ohio St., 475; <em>State, ex rel. Herron, </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>44 Ohio St., 348. In this connection it is again important to observe that such manner of presentation had the approval of the governor and that it accorded with his discretion. The admission of the governor to a limited participation in legislation affords neither reason nor occasion for a departure from a policy whose beneficent operation has been long realized. It is clear that if one of the steps now necessarily involved in the enactment of a law may, by evidence <em>in pais, </em>be shown not to have been taken, the entire subject of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the law is, is withdrawn from the' protection of the rules devised and applied for the purpose of securing certainty where doubt would be intolerable. The prompt aversion of the legal mind from the consideration of evidence <em>in pais </em>to show the invalidity of an officially promulgated statute is justified by a contemplation of the consequences which would follow. Since judgments bind only those who are parties to the record, a conclusion in one case that a statute is valid would be no bar to a contrary conclusion in another, and not only acts to confer civil rights, but those defining and punishing crimes and misdemeanors might be judicially determined to be void as to one citizen of the state and valid as to another. The secretary of state is the official custodian of our statute laws, and we have long been familiar with the rule founded upon statutes that his certificate is conclusive as to what that law is. Obviously the recognition of the doctrine advanced by counsel for the plaintiff would involve the repudiation of that rule; and, since no one may be required to challenge the validity of a statute until it is invoked against him, there would arise a condition of endless doubt respecting a subject upon which every consideration requires that there should be immediate and enduring certainty. An interesting case upon the subject is <em>The People </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>210 Ill., 488, where the court, after considering the testimony of a number of witnesses upon the subject of a presentation of a bill to the governor and his action thereon, became so impressed with the intolerable mischief inseparable from an inquiry of that character that it resorted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>to the established doctrine respecting the conclusiveness of the record and based its decision upon that ground. That view is well sustained by <em>State, ex rel. Herron, </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>and numerous cases cited in the brief of counsel for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">It is suggested that the rejected evidence tended to show that on the 28th of March, and continuously for more than ten days thereafter, the governor, owing to his extreme illness, was unable to receive or consider the bill, and that because of his disability the duties of his office devolved upon the lieutenant governer according to the provisions of Section 15 of Article III of the Constitution. But the governor had not voluntarily surrendered the functions of his office, and no provision has been made for determining when a disability intervenes and when it ends. The constitutional provision does not execute itself, and the conduct of the affairs of an office by its occupant can not be questioned in this manner. A self-contained lieutenant-governor could not .be expected to assume the functions of the governor upon his own initiative. The judicial department of the government is charged with the duty of restraining the other co-ordinate departments to the exercise of the authority conferred upon them, but it is not permitted to consider the ability or the care with which such authority is exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">According to the well known rule of this court the points decided will be found in the syllabus. It may, however, be useful to add that the foregoing observations are intended to be restricted to the requirements of the present case. We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>not consider whether in the absence of the records in the office of the governor, the fact of presentation to the governor should not be regarded as established by the legislative journals and the records of the secretary of state, showing the presentation to the governor and the receipt from him by the secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b254-7\">Price, Crew, Summers and Spear, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
