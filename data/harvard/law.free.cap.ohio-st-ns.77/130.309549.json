Upon this hearing the probate court found and adjudged that the original contract made and entered into between Jacob R. Stewart and George F. Stewart, W. T. S. Johnson and Lewis N. Gatch, because of uncertainty and indefiniteness as to the time of its performance, was voidable by the administrator; and instructed him that he had full right to terminate the same, but the court allowed to said George F. Stewart and W. T. S. Johnson so much of said stock as had been paid for by them; and gave them a sixty day option on the balance, at par, with six months time in which to pay for the same, after the exercise of such option. Upon an appeal , to the court of common pleas, in which all the parties united, the court held that the contract, as modified by the writing of February To, 1900, was a good and valid contract of mutual obligation, by the terms of which Jacob R. Stew<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>art agreed to sell, and George F. Stewart, W. T. S. Johnson and Lewis N. Gatch agreed to buy and pay for it at its par value in money, 360 shares of the capital stock of The Bradford Machine Tool Company. From this judgment the administrator and the objecting distributees of the estate of Jacob R. Stewart, prosecuted error to the circuit court, where the judgment of the court of common pleas was modified. The circuit court affirmed as to two.-thirds of the number of shares of stock in question, reversed as to the one-third, and entered judgment accordingly. Again, none of the parties were satisfied with this judgment, and in consequence all are now seeking relief therefrom in this court. The plaintiffs in error are here, asking that the judgment of the court of common pleas, holding the contract valid, be reinstated and affirmed without modification. The defendants in error, by cross-petition, ask that said contract be declared wholly void.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-6\"><em>Messrs. Maxwell &amp; Ramsey </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-7\">It is said that the third and fourth clause of the writing deprive the seller of his right to enforce payment from any source except future dividends on the stock itself; that they extinguish the previously expressed personal obligation of the purchasers and make the whole transaction unilateral and illusory. It will be well to approach this branch of the argument by the consideration of a few elementary rules governing the construction of contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-8\">First. In case of doubt, that construction must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>be adopted which supports the agreement of the parties. 1 Beach, Modern Law of Contracts, Section 73; <em>Greenough et al. </em>v. <em>Smead et </em>al., 3 Ohio St., 416; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Tipton, </em>10 Ohio St., 88.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-5\">Second. The contract must not only be sustained as a whole, but in all of its parts, except where irreconcilable parts coexist. <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Housinger &amp; Norton, </em>10 Ohio St., 10; <em>Brown et al. </em>v. <em>Fowler et al., </em>65 Ohio St., 509.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">Third. As mutuality is essential to the validity of an executory contract, the law presumes intent to create mutual obligation except in cases where the expressed agreement will not admit of that interpretation. <em>Nowlin </em>v. <em>Pyne, </em>40 Ia., 166; <em>Furnace Co. v.

Clark on Contracts, 626.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b180-8\">The plaintiff in error insists that the obligation contained in the purchase and sale clause can not be qualified by the method of payment expressly provided; his theory being that the employment feature and the purchase and sale feature are clear and can not be consistently affected by the withdrawal feature in the one instance or by the method of payment clause in the other. We contend, however, that he overlooks the rule of construction prevailing in this court, that, it is only where one clause is clearly expressed and another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>is not, that the first shall be given effect. <em>Brown et al. </em>v. <em>Fowler et al., </em>65 Ohio St., 507.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-4\">There is an unknown quantity in counsel\u2019s interpretation, which is fatal. It is found in his requirement to pay not before \u201cthe expiration of a reasonable time for realizing the amount out of the dividends.\u201d What tribunal, court, or jury, could solve the question of such \u201creasonable time\u201d ? It would depend upon the annual amount and regularity of dividends realized in future years. It is obvious that dividends would be greater with the concern in properous times than in hard times.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-5\">The most that can be said is that the contingencies and hazards of the corporate business must-control the only claim of obligation to pay; that is, according as dividends may or may not accrue. Chitty on Contracts, 89; Benjamin on Contracts, 17; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>53 Ill. App., 310.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-6\">It would be optional with plaintiffs in error, upon the theory of their counsel and in fact, to control amounts of dividends in good times, while it might be without their power to produce dividends and so furnish them an excuse for not doing so, in hard times. Such a promise is \u201cillusory,\u201d and being \u201cdependent on a condition which in fact reserves an unlimited option to the promisor is not enforceable.\u201d Hammon on Contracts, 89.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-7\">Where a contract is so far incomplete that the period of its intended duration can not be determined by a fair inference from its provisions, either party is ordinarily at liberty to terminate it at will on giving reasonable notice of .his intention to do so. <em>Irish </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>39 Wis., 562; <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Landis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>46 Pa.

Rep., 773.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-4\">The absence then of any provision expressly requiring' the administrator of the elder Stewart to carry out the provisions of term five of the contract is significant. It is hard to believe that if the survivor of the younger Stewart or Johnson should fail to pay the estate of the one dying to the extent of past dividends accruing on his stock, it was ever intended that the administrator of the elder Stewart should pay such sum out of the estate. It is quite conceivable that such contingency might arise; but it is not conceivable that the parties ever intended that the elder Stewart\u2019s estate should be kept open for administration during a period so uncertain and indefinite.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-5\">This contract is so personal in its nature as not to be binding upon the legal representatives of any of the parties to it. It is like a contract of partnership, or principal and agent, and terminates at the death of either party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-6\">Without quoting at length, we refer to the following authorities as establishing this general proposition: Harriman -on Contracts, 2d Ed., Section 277; Rockel Ohio Probate Law, Par. 520; Williams on Executors, 3d Ed., p. 457, Sections 367, 368; <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Callahan\u2019s Adrnr., </em>5 B.

It is claimed by defendant in error that this agreement is void and of no effect because, as they insist, it is wholly uncertain and illusory in its nature, and is without mutuality or consideration. Referring to the writing itself we find in the initial paragraph thereof this language: \u201cJ.' R. Stewart agrees to sell 360 shares of the capital stock of The Bradford Mill Company to W. T. S. Johnson, George F. Stewart and Lewis N. Gatch, and said W. T. S. Johnson, George F. Stewart and Lewis N. Gatch agree to buy the same in equal proportions, on the following terms and conditions, viz.: \u2014 \u201d Here we have, pertinently and plainly expressed, mutual and concurrent engagements, equally obligatory upon the respective promisors; upon the one to sell, and upon the others to purchase, the 360 shares of stock upon such terms as are in said instrument expressed, and such as are necessarily implied therefrom. It is then further in said writing stipulated and agreed that: \u201cThe purchase price of said stock shall be' its par value of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per share.\u201d Thus we find in the language and terms of \u25a0 the instrument itself, absolute certainty as to parties, subject-matter and consideration \u2014 every element necessary to a complete and valid contract of purchase and sale; and if the foregoing were the only provisions of said instrument it could not be doubted, but that the contract as thus expressed, would be one of binding obligation upon all the parties thereto. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>we are told by counsel for defendants in error, that by force of the provisions of the third clause of said instrument, the vendor, J. R. Stewart, is wholly deprived of the right to demand or exact payment for said 360 shares of stock from the purchasers thereof, in any manner other than by application to the purchase price of future dividends on the stock itself; and that the effect of this is to destroy and extinguish any previously expressed personal obligation on the part of said purchasers, and to convert what would otherwise be a valid contract of mutual and binding obligation into a mere unilateral agreement without consideration. The language of this clause is as follows: \u201c3d. All dividends declared on said stock shall be paid to said J. R. Stewart, until it is paid in full. Enough of said dividends shall be retained by him to make four per cent, on the balance of said purchase price unpaid at the time said dividends are respectively declared, and the balance thereof applied by him on said purchase price; and as soon as said stock is fully paid fory either through dividends or otherwise, it shall be delivered to said purchasers. In case the dividend declared any year shall be less'than four per cent, no interest shall run on said purchase price in excess of the dividend declared, and if none be declared there shall be no interest.\u201d It will be observed that the language of the clause is not, that payment of the purchase price shall be made, or may be exacted, only- out of dividends declared, but that: \u201cAll dividends declared on said stock shall be paid to said J. R. Stewart until it (the purchase price) is paid in full.\u201d In other words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the mode of payment prescribed is not exclusively from dividends on the stock itself, neither is payment conditioned wholly, or finally, upon the alternative that dividends shall be declared, but the only requirement is that all dividends declared shall be applied in payment of the purchase price. This stipulation or requirement is in no wise necessarily inconsistent with, nor does it in any manner impair, avoid or extinguish, the obligation theretofore imposed upon* the purchasers by their express words of formal agreement to purchase. \u201cThat which is made certain in one part of a written instrument, can not be overcome or changed by words in another part, unless such other words are of equal or greater certainty.\u201d <em>Brown et al. </em>v. <em>Fowler et al., </em>65 Ohio St., 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In <em>The Ashland Mutual Fire Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Housinger &amp; Norton, </em>10 Ohio St., 10, this court had under consideration and review a policy of fire insurance, one clause of which provided for the payment of all losses or damages not exceeding the sum insured. There was a subsequent clause in said policy which the company claimed limited its obligation to two-thirds of the loss actually sustained. In construing said policy, this court said: \u201cIn the first sentence or provision the company undertakes, unconditionally, to pay <em>all losses or damages </em>not exceeding the sum insured; and the only way of avoiding its obligation is to show that the promise thus clearly and unconditionally expressed is retracted or varied in the succeeding sentence. But it is a rule to so construe an instrument, if practicable, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>whole may stand; <em>ut res magis valeat, quam pereat.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">\u201cNothing but a clear and unambiguous expression in the latter sentence, amounting to a necessity for it, could justify our regarding the subsequent provision in a contract as utterly inconsistent with the preceding provision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">But it is said, that by the provisions of the fourth clause of said instrument, the parties have themselves clearly evinced their understanding' and intent, that the dividends on the stock should be the only method of payment that could be exacted, and that the plain purpose of this clause was, and is, to exempt the purchasers from any liability to pay out of their own money or means, except upon their \u201cdesire\u201d or \u201coption\u201d so to do. The clause reads as follows: \u201cShould said purchasers desire to make payments on said purchase price in addition to the dividends from time to time declared on said stock, they shall have the option of doing so.\u201d While it is obviously true, that the option thus extended to make payments from time to time in addition to the dividends declared, neither creates nor imposes an obligation upon the purchasers to make such additional payments; yet it is equally true, that the giving of the option does not operate to discharge and release the purchasers from such obligation and liability as they assumed under and by virtue of their express agreement to purchase the 360 shares of stock, which J. R. Stewart, in terms, concurrently promised and agreed to sell them.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Among the considerations recognized in law as sufficient to support a contract, is that of mu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>tual promises, or as it is sometimes expressed, a promise for a promise. In our everyday business relations, many of our most familiar and common contracts depend for their validity upon the application of this principle. And the doctrine is very generally, if not universally, recognized that where there is mutuality of engagement so that each party has the right at once to hold the other to a positive agreement, a sufficient consideration is provided and the contract is binding upon each. What, then, considering all its terms and provisions, is the proper construction and legal effect, of this writing of September 23d, 1899, modified by the endorsement of February 10th, 1900? It is claimed that inasmuch as this writing contains neither express engagement to pay the purchase price of $36,000, nor fixes definitely the time within which the agreement shall be performed and said purchase price be fully paid, that therefore it is wholly uncertain and illusory in its nature, and should not be enforced. As to the first of these propositions it is enough to say, that the agreement of George T. Stewart, W. T. S. Johnson and Lewis N. Gatch to purchase the 360 shares of stock of The Bradford Mill Company, necessarily implies a promise on their part to pay for it. <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>26 Ohio . St., 223. As to the suggestion that time of performance is not therein specified, the rule is well settled, that where no time for performance is fixed by the contract itself, the law implies that performance is to take place within a reasonable time, and that the parties so intended and agreed. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Tipton, </em>10 Ohio St., 88; <em>Curtiss </em>v. <em>The City of Waterloo, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>38 Ia., 266; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Ogletree, </em>114 Ala., 343; <em>Wright </em>v. Maxwell, 9 Ind., 192. The written agreement here in question definitely fixes the amount to be paid, and refers to it throughout as the \u201cpurchase price.\u201d Immediately upon the execution of this writing the purchasers were entitled to receive, and did receive, the full beneficial interest in the 360 shares of stock, and the same were thereafter voted in accordance with their wishes and directions; and the dividends thereon amounting to several thousand dollars, were applied as a credit on the purchase price of said stock. We must presume that the parties thereto intended this instrument to have some operation, and it would seem but reasonable that, if as claimed, only a <em>gift </em>of the stock was intended, that then naturally and necessarily, the instrument and transaction would have assumed a very different form. To adopt the construction contended for by the defendants in error would be to import into .the written contract of the parties a condition nowhere found or expressed in the instrument itself, viz.: that if dividends fail, payment of the purchase price would not be exacted \u2014 and to thus, by judicial construction, render the instrument frivolous and ineffectual, and defeat rather than sustain it. But the rule is elementary, that if the language of a contract is susceptible of two constructions, one of which will render it valid and give effect to the obligation of the parties, and the other will render it invalid and ineffectual, the former construction must be adopted. Applying the foregoing principles and rules of construction to the contract now under review,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>necessarily leads to the conclusion that this contract is not wanting either in consideration or mutuality of obligation, and that it .is therefore binding and obligatory upon the parties, and imposes upon the purchasers the obligation to pay the full purchase price of $36,000, \u201cthrough dividends or otherwise,\u201d but in terms allows them a reasonable time within which to realize this amount from dividends' that may be declared. The following authorities, with more or less direction, bear upon the propositions above considered. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Tipton, </em>10 Ohio St., 88; <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>26 Ohio St., 223; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hummer, </em>10 Kan., 464; <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>4 Wyo., 379; <em>Carter White Lead Co. </em>v. <em>Kinlin, </em>47 Neb., 409, 416; <em>Minneapolis Mill Co. </em>v. <em>Goodnow, </em>40 Minn., 497; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Lord Ebury, </em>2 L. R. C. P., 255; <em>Aunez </em>v. <em>Dautel, </em>19 Wall., 560; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Rounsavell, </em>78 Ill., 589 <em>McCartney et al. </em>v. <em>Glassford, </em>1 Wash., 579; <em>DeRutte et al. </em>v. <em>Muldrow et al., </em>16 Cal., 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In view of the conclusion above reached, it is unnecessary to consider whether the fifth clause of said contract provides a valuable and sufficient consideration, independent of the purchase price agreed to be paid, or the effect, if any, on the rights of the parties, of alleged part performance by the purchasers, in the lifetime of said Jacob R. Stewart.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The further claim is made in this case by counsel for defendants in error, that said contract, if mutually binding upon the parties thereto, is nevertheless wholly incapable of performance by the administrator. We are of opinion, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>as performance on his part would only require of the administrator that he receive and credit upon said contract the amounts paid, upon the purchase price, through dividends or otherwise, and when fully paid that he transfer and deliver said stock to the persons entitled thereto, that no legal obstacle exists to prevent his full and complet\u00e9 performance of said contract in the due course of administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\n<em>The judgment of the circuit court will be reversed, and the judgment of the court of common pleas will be affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b190-7\">Shauck, C.
