Commonwealth, </em>No. 1388-99-3, 2000 WL 1724998 (Va.Ct.App. Nov. 21, 2000). However, we stayed the mandate of that decision and granted a rehearing <em>en banc. </em>Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the stay of the mandate is lifted, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">\u201cUnder familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party below, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>32 Va.App. 438, 442, 528 S.E.2d 187, 189 (2000) (citing <em>Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">So viewed, the evidence established that during a search of the appellant\u2019s residence on February 12, 1998, Sheriff Herbert Lightner of Highland County observed what appeared to be a semi-automatic .22 caliber rifle and a BB gun inside a gun cabinet. The gun cabinet was not opened, and neither gun was examined. Neither the rifle nor the BB gun was seized at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The appellant, who had a prior felony conviction, was later charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the preliminary hearing, defense counsel delivered the two weapons to the sheriff. No one test-fired the guns. At trial, Sheriff Lightner testified that the .22 caliber rifle appeared to be the same weapon he saw at the appellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Melvin Eugene Armstrong, the appellant\u2019s cousin, testified at trial that the .22 caliber rifle belonged to him. Melvin stated that he purchased the rifle at K-Mart in October 1997 and produced a receipt from the store with a serial number matching the number on the rifle. Melvin, who was in the military at the time, explained that the rifle \u201cwouldn\u2019t fire.\u201d He testified: \u2018You could pull the trigger but the gun won\u2019t go off.... [T]he firing pin ain\u2019t [sic] hitting the casing so I assume it\u2019s got something to do with the spring in there or the firing pin one.\u201d He said that while he was out hunting, \u201cit just stopped shooting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The appellant did not dispute the existence of his prior felony conviction or his possession of the rifle. Instead, he argued that the rifle was not a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 because it was not presently operable: \u201cIf the gun is not operable, and it\u2019s unconditional evidence ..., then it\u2019s not a firearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The trial court disagreed and found the appellant guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">On appeal, the appellant concedes that the rifle was \u201cdesigned or intended to expel a projectile by discharge or explosion of gun powder.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, he contends the gun was \u201cinoperable\u201d based upon the \u201ccredible, affirmative, and unrebutted\u201d testimony of Melvin Armstrong. Accordingly, the appellant concludes, the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The Commonwealth contends the trial court was free to disbelieve Melvin Armstrong\u2019s testimony that the rifle \u201cwouldn\u2019t fire.\u201d The Commonwealth further argues that Sheriff Lightner\u2019s testimony that he saw the .22 caliber rifle was sufficient to convict the appellant of this offense. We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding but for different reasons than articulated by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, at the time of the offense, provided that it was unlawful for a previously convicted felon to \u201cknowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm.\u201d The statute does not contain a definition of \u201cfirearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">In <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 354, 429 S.E.2d 615, <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>17 Va.App. 233, 436 S.E.2d 192 (1993), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 prohibits a felon from possessing a device that has the actual capacity to do serious harm because of its ability to expel a projectile by the power of an explosion, and it is not concerned with the use or display of a device that may have the appearance of a firearm. Therefore, we hold that the term \u201cfirearm\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is used in its traditional sense. The statute does not seek to protect the public from fear of harm caused by the display of weapons; rather, it is concerned with preventing a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>son, who is known to have committed a serious crime in the past, from becoming dangerously armed, regardless of whether that person uses, displays, or conceals the firearm. \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted of a felony ... to ... possess or transport any firearm or to ... carry about his person, [even if] hid[den] from common observation, any weapon described in \u00a7 18.2-308 A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 357-58, 429 S.E.2d at 617 (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Subsequent panel decisions of this Court have enlarged the holding in <em>Jones, </em>which held that a BB gun was not within the \u201ctraditional definition of a firearm\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. In <em>Gregory v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 393, 504 S.E.2d 886 (1998), however, we diverted from the holding in <em>Jones </em>and required the Commonwealth to prove the following elements in order to convict a felon for possession of a firearm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">(1) that the weapon is designed or intended to expel projectiles by the discharge or explosion of gunpowder, and (2) that it is capable of doing so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 400, 504 S.E.2d at 889. We reiterated these two elements of required proof in <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 796, 537 S.E.2d 21 (2000).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">The Commonwealth must initially prove that the accused possessed an object manufactured for the purpose of expelling a projectile by an explosion, namely, a firearm. It then must prove that the firearm is operational or can readily be made operational.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 807, 537 S.E.2d at 26 (citation omitted). In furtherance of this second element, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">[T]he statute prohibits felons from possessing actual firearms that are presently operational or can readily or easily be made operational or capable of being fired with minimal effort and expertise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-12\"><em>Id. at </em>806-07, 537 S.E.2d at 26. It is this latter judicially created element of proof, that the felon\u2019s weapon is \u201cpresently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>operational,\u201d that is contrary to the plain language of the statute and has caused unnecessary confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In the context of related statutes, the ready capability element has been phrased as \u201coperable\u201d or operable \u201con a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d Where the firearm, a sawed-off shotgun, lacked a firing pin in <em>Rogers v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 774, 418 S.E.2d 727 (1992), we held that the gun was close enough to actual firing capacity to justify a conviction for possession of the firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-300 (the Sawed-off Shotgun Act). Similarly in <em>Timmons v. Commonwealth </em>15 Va.App. 196, 421 S.E.2d 894 (1992), we held that the absence of the gun\u2019s ammunition clip did not deprive the firearm of its status as operable and, thus, we sustained the defendant\u2019s conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4 (possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine). Yet, in <em>Williams, </em>we held that the element of operability was not proven where the convicted felon\u2019s gun was too rusty to fire at the time of his arrest. We reversed Williams\u2019 conviction for possessing the firearm. 33 Va.App. at 808, 537 S.E.2d at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Contrasted with offenses committed in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the act of firearm possession under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 (or related statutes) involves no perception element by a victim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The crime is complete by the felon\u2019s possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>weapon. The statute is interpreted in this fashion to further the legislative intent of keeping firearms out of the hands of convicted felons. <em>Jones </em>concisely sets out the General Assembly\u2019s intent in adopting Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">[I]t is concerned with preventing a person, who is known to have committed a serious crime in the past, from becoming dangerously armed, regardless of whether that person uses, displays, or conceals the firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">16 Va.App. at 358, 429 S.E.2d at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Nothing in this statement of policy, or in the plain language of the statute, bifurcates convicted felons with firearms into classes of those (1) possessing firearms ready to fire immediately, or (2) possessing firearms which can fire with some repairs or adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Further, because there is no victim perception element to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, as there is under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, there is no public policy or legislative intent to find a felon who possesses a BB gun, a squirt gun or a plastic toy gun to be in possession of a firearm. That is all the <em>Jones </em>decision held. When the General Assembly used the term \u201cfirearm\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, it meant a \u201cfirearm\u201d is a firearm under that statute if it was made to shoot bullets, not BBs or tap water.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Had later interpretations of <em>Jones </em>limited the holding to devices such as toy weapons, squirt guns or BB guns, those decisions may not have run afoul of the plain meaning of the statute or created the byzantine network of decisions which has since evolved. The aftermath of <em>Jones </em>has seen creative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>findings of circumstantial proof with regard to the operability of the accused felon\u2019s firearm which are not only difficult to reconcile, but also provide little guidance to the trial courts. For instance, in <em>Redd v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 256, 511 S.E.2d 436 (1999), no gun was seized from Redd or produced at her trial for possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon. Nonetheless, Redd\u2019s threat to kill the clerk and her placing a \u201clong black gun\u201d on the store counter was sufficient to justify the inference that the object was an operable firearm. In <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 735, 536 S.E.2d 922 (2000), a case under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4, the defendant\u2019s exposure of a firearm tucked in his waistband was sufficient to permit the inference that it was a functional, operational firearm and sustain a conviction. As a corollary, decisions such as <em>Rogers, Timmons, Gregory </em>and <em>Williams </em>reflect a highly subjective approach in determining whether a felon\u2019s gun, which is in evidence at trial, is sufficiently close to firing status to justify a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 prohibits a convicted felon \u201cto knowingly and intentionally possess or transport <em>any </em>firearm.\u201d (Emphasis added). While the statute does not define firearm, the adjacent \u201cinstant check\u201d statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2:2, provides \u201cfirearm means any handgun, shotgun or rifle which expels a projectile by action of an explosion.\u201d Similarly, the plain dictionary meaning of \u201cfirearm\u201d is: \u201cA weapon that expels a projectile (such as a bullet or pellets) by the combustion of gunpowder or other explosive.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>648 (7th ed.1999). Nothing in these or similar definitions bifurcates firearms into actual operational and not fully functional categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The application of <em>Jones </em>in subsequent cases has created a body of law that is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute and attributes a legislative intent where none exists. The practical result of the \u201coperability\u201d element has left a confusing zigzag trail for the trial courts to decipher. This is particularly apparent in decisions like <em>Redd </em>and <em>Taylor </em>where no gun is in evidence and there is no direct evidence as to whether the weapon functions, but an inference of operability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>may be drawn. For instance, if, in <em>Redd, </em>the only action of the accused had been to place the weapon on the store counter without a verbal threat, could an inference of operability properly be drawn?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Even in cases where the gun is introduced into evidence, the question of operability engenders innumerable scenarios as to when or if the weapon could become operable or capable of firing. Did the legislature intend there to be a time test, under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, on the felon\u2019s personal ability to make the weapon operable? If the weapon required more than the insertion of the firing pin or ammunition clip, would the weapon\u2019s operability be judged by the felon\u2019s ability to make the weapon fire, his access to contacts who could perform that function or his financial ability to retain a gunsmith who could timely do so? Would the felon be required to be able to make the weapon operable within a given time period (ten minutes or ten hours)? It cannot be said that the General Assembly \u201cintended\u201d such a test where the clear and unambiguous meaning of the statute is to prohibit a felon from possessing <em>any </em>firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">When the legislature has spoken plainly courts may not change or amend legislative enactments under the guise of construing them. The province of construction lies wholly within the domain of <em>ambiguity. </em>There is no ambiguity in the language that forbids a convicted felon to carry a firearm. That which is plain needs no interpretation. <em>Winston v. City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 407-08, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>Jones, </em>16 Va.App. at 358, 429 S.E.2d at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The General Assembly included no language in the statute to circumscribe the absolute prohibition of a convicted felon\u2019s possession of a firearm. It matters not whether the gun\u2019s current condition is \u201coperable\u201d or \u201cinoperable\u201d or whether a can of WD-40 or the local gunsmith could render the firearm fully functional.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">In a prosecution under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, once the Commonwealth proves the accused is a convicted felon who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>possessed an object made to \u201cexpel a projectile by the combustion of gunpowder or other explosive,\u201d then it has proven all the necessary elements of the crime based on the plain language of the statute. When enacting Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the General Assembly\u2019s intent was clear: A felon cannot possess <em>any </em>firearm. Had the legislature wished to draw a distinction between operable and inoperable firearms, it would have done so with clear and distinct language. It did not, and neither did <em>Jones. </em>The reference in <em>Jones </em>to a firearm\u2019s \u201cactual capacity to do serious harm\u201d relates to \u201ca weapon designed or intended to expel projectiles by the discharge or explosion of gunpowder\u201d not to a separate requirement of operability.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">As the foregoing reflects, we have made a detailed inquiry finding \u201ca mistake exists in our prior decisions.\u201d Accordingly, we exercise the clear authority under Code \u00a7 17.1 402(D) to overrule those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We overrule <em>Gregory </em>and <em>Williams </em>to the extent such cases are read to require the Commonwealth to prove as an element of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 that the convicted felon\u2019s firearm was presently operational, was capable of being fired, could be readily converted to firing or could readily be made operational.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We hold <em>Jones </em>established no such requirement. To the extent <em>Jones </em>is read inconsistently with this opinion, <em>Jones </em>is also overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The dissent\u2019s inference that the United States Constitution\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>protection is somehow implicated by our decision is inaccurate. None of the cases cited stand for that proposition, particularly where a prior panel decision is overruled <em>en banc </em>on the basis of clear error in application of a statute. Moreover, the appellant\u2019s conviction in the case at bar is based on acts committed prior to the decisions in <em>Gregory </em>and <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 only requires the Commonwealth to prove, as elements of the crime, that the accused is a convicted felon and that he or she possessed an object which was made with the purpose to expel a projectile by gunpowder or other explosion. In the case at bar, the Commonwealth proved these elements at trial and, therefore, the appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-15\">. Appellant was also convicted of possession of marijuana, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250.1, which is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. At trial, the Commonwealth did not rely upon the BB gun as the basis for the firearm conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\">. The appellant does not contest that he was in possession of the .22 caliber rifle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\">. Our decisions, as well as those of the Supreme Court of Virginia, have read the term \u201cfirearm,\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, to include \u201canything that the victim reasonably perceives to be a firearm, even though it may not in actuality be a weapon or be capable of firing a projectile by any means.\u201d <em>Holloman v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 199, 269 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1980). Operability or actual capacity of the firearm to fire is not an element of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, which prohibits any person (not just felons) from using a firearm while committing a felony. Accordingly, unlike the result in <em>Williams, </em>we held in <em>Miller v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 208, 475 S.E.2d 828 (1996), that a rusty, inoperable revolver used in a robbery was a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the rust on the gun did not affect its appearance and that the weapon had not \"lost its identity as a firearm.\" <em>Id. </em>at 213, 475 S.E.2d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\"><em>Jones </em>differentiated a \u201cfirearm\u201d in the possession of a convicted felon under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 from a \u201cfirearm\u201d used in the commission of a felony under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. The basis for the distinction is not whether a weapon \"designed or intended to expel projectiles by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>discharge or explosion of gunpowder\u201d actually works at the time of a felonious act. Rather, the distinction is that whatever object is used to perpetrate a felony (robbery, for instance) must reasonably create the perception in the victim of fear of harm. The victim must perceive the toy gun as a real firearm in order for the would-be robber to engender the necessary threat and intimidation to successfully complete his task and also be guilty of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">It is for this reason that the Supreme Court of Virginia in <em>Holloman </em>held the use of a BB gun, while not within the traditional definition of a firearm, was a \"firearm\u201d in the reasonable perception of the victim of a robbery and, therefore, was a firearm for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. 221 Va. at 198, 269 S.E.2d at 358.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\">.

Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 354, 429 S.E.2d 615 (1993), noted that \u201c[t]he legislature has assigned various meanings to the term \u2018firearm\u2019 in [different] sections of Title 18.2,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 356, 429 S.E.2d at 615-16, and concluded that \u201cwhether the term \u2018firearm\u2019 when used in a statute without being defined is to be given its traditional meaning or a more expansive meaning depends upon the purpose and policy underlying the particular statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 429 S.E.2d at 616. Based upon a review of the various statutes, the decision further concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">[W]hen a statute is designed only to proscribe the act of possessing a firearm or the conduct of a felon in order to reduce a real threat of harm to the public, a narrower, more traditional definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d is required. <em>See Timmons v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 196, 200-01, 421 S.E.2d 894, 897 (1992) (\u201cfirearm\u201d under statute penalizing the possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine does not include \u201c \u2018any object\u2019 that [appears to have] capability of firing a projectile, even if it lacks that capability\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">It was in the context of a review of all the firearm statutes that <em>Jones </em>construed the term \u201cfirearm\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 and held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 prohibits a felon from possessing a device that has the <em>actual capacity </em>to do serious harm because of its ability to expel a projectile by the power of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>explosion, and it is not concerned with the use or display of a device that may have the appearance of a firearm. Therefore, we hold that the term \u201cfirearm\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is used in its traditional sense. The statute does not seek to protect the public from fear of harm caused by the display of weapons; rather, it is concerned with preventing a person, who is known to have committed a serious crime in the past, from becoming dangerously armed, regardless of whether that person uses, displays, or conceals the firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 357-58, 429 S.E.2d at 617 (emphasis added). We affirmed that decision <em>en banc. Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 233, 436 S.E.2d 192 (1993) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In the eight years since <em>Jones, </em>neither the Supreme Court nor the legislature has reviewed or changed the definition of firearm that <em>Jones </em>applied to Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Indeed, because the General Assembly has revised the firearm statutes on several occasions without any indication that it has disagreed with our definition, \u201cthe General Assembly is presumed to use the language as judicially defined.\u201d <em>Williams v. Fairfax Co. Hous. Auth., </em>227 Va. 309, 314, 315 S.E.2d 202, 205 (1984). <em>See also Burns v. Stafford County, </em>227 Va. 354, 360, 315 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Our decisions in <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 796, 537 S.E.2d 21 (2000), and <em>Gregory v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 393, 504 S.E.2d 886 (1998), have been faithful to the definition of firearm that we used in <em>Jones </em>and based on the construction of the statutes. The decision in <em>Williams </em>particularly and thoroughly analyzed <em>Jones </em>and the cases that followed <em>Jones </em>in determining the type of weapon which is proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. <em>See </em>33 Va.App. at 800-08, 537 S.E.2d at 23-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The majority now interprets Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 to require \u201conly [that] ... the Commonwealth ... prove, as elements of the crime, that the accused is a convicted felon and that he or she possessed an object which was made with the purpose to expel a projectile by gunpowder or other explosion.\u201d Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>though the majority professes to follow <em>Jones, </em>it has eliminated the significant element of that decision\u2019s holding, the \u201cactual capacity\u201d of the firearm to operate. Simply put, the majority opinion has re-defined the term \u201cfirearm\u201d as used in statutes we analyzed in <em>Williams, Gregory, </em>and <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Regardless of whether the majority overrules <em>Jones </em>and its progeny or merely overrules <em>Williams </em>and <em>Gregory, </em>the majority makes no clear \u201cinquiry ... whether flagrant error or mistake exists in the [prior] decision[s].\u201d <em>Pulliam v. Coastal Emergency Servs., </em>257 Va. 1, 10, 509 S.E.2d 307, 312 (1999). Those decisions have stood \u201cwithout any indication to the bench, the bar, or the public that flagrant error or mistake exists in the decision[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 509 S.E.2d at 321. Indeed, the Commonwealth in this case does not challenge the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d enunciated in <em>Jones, Williams, </em>and <em>Gregory. </em>These factors indicate that the principle needs no revision. Furthermore, the majority has chosen to jettison precedent, not in a tort or contract case involving the payment or non-payment of money to a party, but in a criminal case involving the liberty of a citizen of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Although, strictly speaking, judicial decisions do not implicate the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause of the United States Constitution, <em>see United States v. Wasserman, </em>504 F.2d 1012, 1015 (5th Cir.1974) (citing <em>James v. United States, </em>366 U.S. 213, 247-48, 81 S.Ct. 1052, 1070-71, 6 L.Ed.2d 246 (1961) (separate opinion of JJ. Harlan and Frankfurter)), the same considerations bind the judiciary. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">[A]n unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post facto law, such as Art. I, \u00a7 10, of the Constitution forbids. An ex post facto law has been defined by this Court as one \u2018that makes an action done before the passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes such action,\u2019 or \u2018that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was, when committed.\u2019 If a state legislature is barred by the Ex Post Facto Clause from passing such a law, it must follow that a State Supreme Court is barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>the Due Process Clause from achieving precisely the same result by judicial construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><em>Bouie v. City of Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 353, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 1702,12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Prior to today\u2019s decision, the Commonwealth had to prove two discrete elements to demonstrate the existence of a firearm to convict an accused under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. <em>Gregory, </em>28 Va.App. at 400, 504 S.E.2d at 889. With the majority opinion\u2019s elimination of the \u201cactual capacity\u201d requirement from <em>Jones, </em>the Commonwealth will only have to prove one element. Such a radical lowering of the threshold for conviction changes the nature of the conduct proscribed and punishes conduct that was legal before the publication of the current opinion. As such, at the very least, it cannot apply in this case, where the evidence was insufficient to convict Armstrong under our prior interpretation of this statute. As stated in the dissent from the panel decision, \u201cthe Commonwealth failed to prove that \u2018the weapon could be readily rendered functional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1388-99-3, 2000 WL 1724998 (Va.Ct.App. Nov. 21, 2000) (quoting <em>Williams, </em>33 Va.App. at 808, 537 S.E.2d at 27). Therefore, because the Commonwealth did not bear its burden of proof, we should reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In conclusion, I believe that <em>Jones </em>and its progeny properly construed Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 and that today\u2019s majority\u2019s view, which was not advanced on brief by either party, represents merely another way of looking at the same issue we previously decided. Its only compelling feature is that it has garnered a sufficient number of votes to overrule our prior decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">For these reasons, I would reverse the conviction. I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
