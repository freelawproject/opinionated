On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a statement he made to his mother in the police interrogation room. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">In November 1999, Jason Bonelli and appellant were students at Tallwood High School in the City of Virginia Beach. Bonelli told appellant he wanted to purchase stereo equipment for his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">On November 16, 1999, appellant told Bonelli that appellant\u2019s brother, Shaheed Williams, had a compact disc player for sale. Appellant arranged with Bonelli to meet at Brandon Middle School at 6:00 p.m. that evening, where Williams would sell Bonelh the stereo. Appellant told Bonelh to bring \u201caround $200.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Bonelh drove to the school, where he met appellant and Demetrius Norman, appellant\u2019s friend. A \u201cmasked man\u201d approached Bonelh, and when appellant attempted to intervene, the assailant ran after appellant, chasing him behind some dumpsters. Norman drove away, and as Bonelh attempted to do the same, the assailant entered Bonelh\u2019s vehicle, shoved a gun in Bonelli\u2019s ribs, and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to spray you.\u201d The assailant then took $214 from Bonelh\u2019s pants pocket and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Appellant came from behind the dumpsters after the assailant left and asked Bonelh what had happened. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>appeared \u201cnot very scared.\u201d Bonelli believed he had been set up. He told appellant he knew appellant was involved in the robbery and that he would contact the police. Appellant told Bonelli to \u201cdrop it.\u201d Bonelli asked appellant \u201cwhere his brother was.\u201d Appellant did not give him an answer. Appellant then said, \u201cOh, well, he\u2019s at home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Norman testified that he picked appellant up at appellant\u2019s house and drove him to Brandon Middle School where appellant planned to rob Bonelli, but Norman admitted telling the police at least two or three different versions of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Appellant, a juvenile, was arrested and taken to police headquarters. Appellant entered through the rear door of the detective bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Detective J.L. Gandy met appellant\u2019s mother and her boyfriend in the lobby where a posted sign stated that the interview rooms were \u201celectronically monitored and may be recorded.\u201d The sign is six to twelve inches in size. The interview room is permanently equipped with a glass window through which interviews can be heard and observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">It is uncontroverted that appellant did not pass the notice sign, although his mother and her boyfriend passed through the lobby to enter the interview room. The wall on which the notice sign was posted also contained a telephone, a large mural, and other posted items. The detective did not point out the sign to appellant\u2019s mother or her boyfriend. The interview room contained no signs warning of any monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">In the interview room, the detective read appellant his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The mother\u2019s boyfriend, who identified himself as appellant\u2019s stepfather, indicated appellant would make no statements until he consulted with an attorney. Detective Gandy \u201cfelt it would be best if [appellant] consulted a lawyer before anything was said.\u201d The detective then left the interview room and went to the \u201cmonitoring room,\u201d which contained equipment that allowed him to overhear conversations in the interview room. The detective testified he allowed appellant, his mother and the mother\u2019s boyfriend to remain in the interview room because the detective had \u201csome paper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>work to complete\u201d and he wanted to see if they would talk to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Detective Gandy then electronically overheard a \u201cwhispered\u201d conversation between appellant and his mother\u2019s boyfriend. The detective testified he overheard appellant say that \u201ctheir other son may be involved also.\u201d Appellant whispered that \u201che didn\u2019t know how the police found out.\u201d He said, \u201cDemetrius must have told them.\u201d Detective Gandy indicated it appeared appellant was trying to \u201chide\u201d the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Appellant filed a motion to suppress the statements \u201coverheard\u201d by Detective Gandy. The trial court denied the motion, finding appellant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a police station, \u201cespecially in an interrogation room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The Commonwealth contends that the issue on appeal is procedurally defaulted under Rule 5A:18. When the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, defense counsel responded, \u2018Tes, sir.\u201d The Commonwealth maintains that counsel\u2019s response did not preserve appellant\u2019s claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u201cThe primary function of [Rule 5A:18] \u2018is to alert the trial judge to possible error so that the judge may consider the issue intelligently and take any corrective actions necessary to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals and mistrials.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 547, 553, 458 S.E.2d 599, 601 (1995) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">In this case, the hearing on the motion to suppress clearly alerted the trial court to the issue. Evidence was presented and arguments were heard. Requiring appellant to \u201cexcept\u201d to the court\u2019s denial of his motion \u201cwould, in effect, recreate the requirement of noting an exception to a final adverse ruling of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 524, 530, 414 S.E.2d 401, 404 (1992) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201cAs we stated in <em>Martinez v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 664, 668, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>395 S.E.2d 467, 470 (1990), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>241 Va. 557, 403 S.E.2d 358 (1991), \u2018the requirement for an exception [has been] eliminated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We, therefore, conclude this issue is not proeedurally defaulted under Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">While neither appellant nor the Commonwealth directly addressed Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-61 to 19.2-70.3, Interception of Wire, Electronic or Oral Communications, we find it necessary to address this chapter of the Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">In general, Chapter 6 of Title 19.2 regulates (1) the interception, by any electronic, mechanical, or other device, of certain \u201cwire or oral communications\u201d as defined in the chapter, and (2) the disclosure by any person of the contents of any such wire or oral communication which has been so intercepted. Except as permitted by the terms of the chapter, it is unlawful, constituting a felonious offense, for any person willfully to intercept, or willfully to disclose the contents of, any wire or oral communication. Va.Code \u00a7 19.2-62.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\"><em>Wilks v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 885, 887, 234 S.E.2d 250, 251 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-66 and 19.2-68 establish a procedure under which the Attorney General may apply for an order authorizing the interception of a wire or oral communication. In this case, it is not claimed that such an order was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Code \u00a7 19.2-65 creates an \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d for any information obtained in violation of the chapter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">Whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer, commission, regulatory body, legislative committee or other agency of this Commonwealth or a political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABu\">Code \u00a7 19.2-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-63.1 requires the Chief of Police to have direct control over any such device which is in the possession of the police department. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-63.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">We begin our analysis with the definition of \u201coral communication\u201d under Code \u00a7 19.2-61. Code \u00a7 19.2-61 states, \u201c \u2018Oral communication\u2019 means any oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under circumstances justifying such expectations but does not include any electronic communication.... \u201d \u201cThus, an oral communication is not protected by Chapter 6 unless (1) the speaker exhibits the expectation that his conversation will not be intercepted, and (2) the circumstances justify the expectation of noninterception.\u201d <em>Wilks, </em>217 Va. at 888, 234 S.E.2d at 252. \u201c[T]he justifiable expectation of noninterception contained in the statutory definition of the term \u2018oral communication\u2019 is equivalent to the constitutional expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 889, 234 S.E.2d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">In a Fourth Amendment context, protection is afforded \u201cif, first, a person has exhibited an actual, subjective expectation of privacy in the subject area and, second, if that expecta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tion is one that society is prepared to recognize as \u2018reasonable.\u2019\u201d <em>Wellford v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 297, 301, 315 S.E.2d 235, 237 (1984) (citing <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U.S. 347, 361, 88 S.Ct. 507, 516-17, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967); <em>United States v. Knotts, </em>460 U.S. 276, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983); <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 143 n. 12, 99 S.Ct. 421, 430, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978); <em>Patler v. Slayton, </em>503 F.2d 472 (4th Cir.1974); <em>State v. Brady, </em>406 So.2d 1093 (Fla.1982), <em>cert. granted sub nom. Florida v. Brady, </em>456 U.S. 988, 102 S.Ct. 2266, 73 L.Ed.2d 1282 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The record clearly establishes that appellant manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the interview room at the time he made the statements. It was uncontroverted that appellant, a juvenile, entered police headquarters through the rear door of the detective bureau and, thus, did not pass a sign posted in the lobby which indicated that conversations in the interview rooms were \u201celectronically monitored and may be recorded.\u201d Although appellant\u2019s mother and her boyfriend may have had an opportunity to see those signs, the record establishes that they made no statements to appellant about the signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Further, the record provides no indication that appellant said anything to Detective Gandy about the offense for which he had been arrested. When Detective Gandy, appellant, appellant\u2019s mother, and her boyfriend, Carl Gray, met in the interview room, Gray told Detective Gandy that appellant would not make any statements until they had consulted a lawyer. Appellant said nothing to contradict Gray\u2019s statement. When Detective Gandy left the room, appellant whispered to Gray at a level indicating to Detective Gandy that appellant was \u201ctrying to hide what [he] was saying\u201d and that appellant\u2019s whispers likely would not have been heard outside the interview room if not for the electronic monitoring equipment located inside the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Thus, the only conclusion from the evidence is that appellant manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the closed interview room. The only issue in dispute is whether this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>expectation of privacy is one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. <em>See Wellford, </em>227 Va. at 301, 315 S.E.2d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Most courts considering the issue have held that prisoners generally have no expectation of privacy in conversations with visitors because routine monitoring and recording of such conversations is a reasonable means of maintaining prison security. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hearst, </em>563 F.2d 1331, 1345-46 (9th Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 1000, 98 S.Ct. 1656, 56 L.Ed.2d 90 (1978). In dicta in <em>Lanza v. New York, </em>370 U.S. 139, 82 S.Ct. 1218, 8 L.Ed.2d 384 (1962), the United States Supreme Court addressed the Fourth Amendment implications of a jail communication that was electronically intercepted. Lanza spoke to his brother, who was an inmate in a New York jail, in a jail visiting room, and the conversation was recorded by the police, unknown to Lanza or his brother. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 82 S.Ct. at 1219. The recorded conversation was transcribed. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 82 S.Ct. at 1219-20. A copy of that transcript was given to a committee of the New York legislature investigating possible corruption in the state parole system. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Lanza was called to testify before the legislative committee, which posed a number of questions to \u00abLanza based on the transcript of the taped jail conversation. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 82 S.Ct. at 1219. Lanza refused to answer the questions and subsequently was indicted, tried and convicted for failure to testify before the legislative committee. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Lanza argued before the United States Supreme Court that the interception of his conversation violated his Fourth Amendment rights and, therefore, that the committee\u2019s use of the transcript was impermissible. <em>Id. </em>at 141-42, 82 S.Ct. at 1219-20. Essentially, Lanza argued that the visitors\u2019 room in the jail was a constitutionally protected area and that the eavesdropping was an unreasonable search and seizure. <em>Id. </em>at 142, 82 S.Ct. at 1220.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The Supreme Court noted that \u201ca jail shares none of the attributes of privacy of a home, an automobile, an office or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>hotel room.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 82 S.Ct. at 1221. The Court further stated, \u201cIn prison, official surveillance has traditionally been the order of the day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the Court continued, \u201c[I]t may be assumed that even in a jail, or perhaps especially there, the relationships which the law has endowed with particularized confidentiality must continue to receive unceasing protection....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143-44, 82 S.Ct. at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">This language in <em>Lanza </em>suggests that a privileged relationship can affect the determination of whether a reasonable expectation of privacy exists in a particular situation. However, appellant did not argue to the trial court nor in his brief that any privilege<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> applied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Only at oral argument, in response to specific questions fcom the Court, did counsel mention the parent-child relationship as a factor to consider in the analysis of a reasonable expectation of privacy. No argument or case law was presented, however, to support the existence of a parent-child privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Therefore, we cannot now consider the issue of privilege on appeal and address only whether appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the police interview room. \u201cWe do not address\u201d issues that the parties failed to raise at trial and failed to present or develop on appeal. <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 231, 232, 548 S.E.2d 926, 927 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">In <em>Ahmad A. v. Superior Court, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 528, 263 Cal.Rptr. 747, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 834, 111 S.Ct. 102, 112 L.Ed.2d 72 (1990), the California Court of Appeal considered the secret recording of a conversation between a boy and his mother in a police interrogation room. That court explained the continuing viability of <em>Lanza:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">Although <em>\u201cLanza </em>epitomized the \u2018protected areas\u2019 type of analysis repudiated in <em>[Katz v. United States </em>(1967) 389 U.S. 347, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576],\u201d federal courts \u201chave consistently followed <em>Lanza </em>and upheld admission of moni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>tored conversations in jails or police stations. \u2018It still appears to be good law that so far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned, jail officials are free to intercept conversations between a prisoner and a visitor. This was the ruling in <em>Lanza v. New York </em>[citation] and it appears to have survived <em>Katz v. United States </em>[citation].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Id. <em>[Donaldson v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, </em>35 Cal.3d 24], at pp. 29-30, 196 Cal.Rptr. 704, 672 P.2d 110.) \u201c[N]o federal case has repudiated the <em>Lanza </em>dictum or excluded a jail or police station conversation from evidence. [Citation.] If occasional state court cases such as <em>[De Lancie v. Superior Court, </em>supra, 31 Cal.3d 865, 183 Cal.Rptr. 866, 647 P.2d 142] take a different course, they do so on state, not federal grounds. Bound in matters of federal law by the United States Supreme Court, which has never rejected its dictum in <em>Lanza v. New York, </em>and influenced by decisions of the lower federal courts, we are impelled to conclude that the <em>Lanza </em>dictum continues to control in federal law.\u201d (Id., at p. 30, 196 Cal.Rptr. 704, 672 P.2d 110.) Beyond the sparse and uncontested facts attested to by the investigating officer, the record contains no evidence of a subjective expectation of privacy as to the minor\u2019s conversation with his mother. Moreover, any such belief would not have been objectively reasonable in a police station given the conclusions reached in <em>Donaldson v. Superior Court, </em>supra. (Ibid.) Indeed, in the jail house the age-old truism still obtains: \u201cWalls have ears.\u201d Thus, we hold the minor had no right to exclusion of the evidence under the Fourth Amendment. (See also <em>People v. Lucero </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 1065, 1067-1069, 235 Cal.Rptr. 751.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 751-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Generally, the federal courts continue to find a suspect has no reasonable expectation of privacy in areas controlled by the police. As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit explained when finding the surreptitious recording of a defendant\u2019s conversation in a police vehicle did not violate a reasonable expectation of privacy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>A marked police car is owned and operated by the state for the express purpose of ferreting out crime. It is essentially the trooper\u2019s office, and is frequently used as a temporary jail for housing and transporting arrestees and suspects. The general public has no reason to frequent the back seat of a patrol car, or to believe that it is a sanctuary for private discussions. A police car is not the kind of public place, like a phone booth, where a person should be able to reasonably expect that his conversation will not be monitored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\"><em>United States v. Clark, </em>22 F.3d 799, 801-02 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The whispered conversation between appellant, his mother, and her boyfriend occurred in the police station\u2019s interview room, a room designed for the disclosure, not the hiding, of information. The room had a one-way glass mirror. Detective Gandy did not suggest appellant could speak freely to his mother and her boyfriend without fear of eavesdropping. The police were in the middle of an investigation into an armed robbery, and appellant knew he was an object of that inquiry. He had no reason to believe this interrogation room was a \u201csanctuary for private discussions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Some courts have found a reasonable expectation of privacy, independent of a privilege, if, while in police custody, the officers \u201clull\u201d a suspect into believing the conversation will be private. <em>See People v. A.W., </em>982 P.2d 842, 848-49 (Colo.1999) (detective\u2019s assurances that \u201cnobody was behind the two-way mirror\u201d and \u201che would not be listening\u201d gave rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding A.W.\u2019s conversation with his father in an interrogation room); <em>People v. Plyler, </em>18 Cal.App.4th 535, 22 Cal.Rptr.2d 772, 775 (1993) (trial court appropriately found deputy did not lull Plyler into believing his phone calls would not be recorded).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">In <em>People v. Hammons, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1710, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 317, 320 (1991), after questioning by the police the defendant requested an opportunity to talk to the codefendant who was also at the police station answering questions. Both men were taken in an interview room. <em>Id. </em>at 319. The officer told the codefendants, \u201cwe\u2019re leaving\u201d and they could \u201ctalk by [them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>]selves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officer acknowledged in his testimony that he \u201cled them to believe that this was in fact a private conversation between just the [two codefendants].\u201d <em>Id. </em>He then secretly recorded their incriminating conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Here, Detective Gandy made no statements to appellant regarding his ability to converse with his mother and her boyfriend. Appellant did not ask to speak privately with his mother.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When the boyfriend indicated to Detective Gandy that appellant wanted to talk to a lawyer, the detective simply left the room. Detective Gandy did not tell them to feel free to discuss the incident privately. He simply left them alone in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Simply leaving a suspect alone with another individual while in police custody does not create a reasonable expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize. <em>Hearst, </em>563 F.2d at 1345 <em>(Lanza </em>remains good law); <em>State v.

Appellant\u2019s argument in the trial court was sufficient to preserve for appeal the question of application of this chapter of the Code. Although appellant did not cite a particular code section, he argued, \"the law is clear. It\u2019s against the law to intercept an oral conversation \u2014 and this is clearly an oral conversation [ \u2014 ] by electronic means ... without the consent of one of the participants in the conversation where the participants are in a situation where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d Furthermore, as long as an issue is properly preserved, we are not required to disregard controlling statutes or rules of court merely because the trial court or counsel failed to take cognizance of them. As long as the issue was properly preserved, an appellate court shall decide the issue according to controlling legal principles.

Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">As the majority observes, the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Lanza v. New York, </em>370 U.S. 139, 82 S.Ct. 1218, 8 L.Ed.2d 384 (1962), that \u201cit may be assumed that even in a jail, or perhaps especially there, the relationships which the law has endowed with particularized confidentiality must continue to receive unceasing protection.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143-44, 82 S.Ct. at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Although the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of prisoners\u2019 privacy and confidential relationships in <em>Lanza </em>was dicta, <em>see id. </em>(noting that Lanza did not claim violation of any special relationship), other courts have relied upon the language in <em>Lanza </em>to recognize exceptions to the generally accepted principle that no Fourth Amendment reasonable expectation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>privacy exists in prisoners\u2019 conversations with their visitors, <em>see, e.g., North v. Super. Ct., </em>8 Cal.3d 301, 104 Cal.Rptr. 833, 502 P.2d 1305,1309-12 (1972) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">In <em>North, </em>for example, the Supreme Court of California held that North had a reasonable expectation of privacy in a conversation with his wife under the circumstances of that case. <em>Id. </em>at 1311-12. The evidence established that the conversation occurred during ordinary visiting hours in a detective\u2019s office and that it was \u201ca frequent and normal practice to permit such visits to take place in a detective\u2019s office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307. During the five-minute visit, police secretly monitored and recorded North\u2019s conversation with his wife. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In holding the contents of the conversation should have been suppressed, the court emphasized that the conduct of a police detective in \u201csurrendering to petitioner and his wife [the detective\u2019s] own private office so that they might converse and then by exiting and shutting the door, leaving them entirely alone,\u201d \u201cspoke as clearly as words\u201d and had the effect of \u201clull[ing]\u201d North and his wife \u201cinto believing that their conversation would be confidential.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1311. Those circumstances, \u201ccoupled with the statutory presumption that a conversation between spouses is ... made in confidence constituted a sufficient showing by [North] to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). <em>But see Ahmad A. v.

Hammons, </em>235 Cal.App.3d 1710, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 317 (1991), a case involving codefendants, the California Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of Appeal expanded the holding in <em>North </em>to conclude that \u201cone [may] ... reasonably expect privacy in a police station [even] absent a privileged relationship\u201d when that \u201cexpectation of privacy [is] based upon express representations by police officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1716-17, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 317. Under the facts of that case, defendant Darby invoked his right to remain silent, but codefendant Hammons asked to speak to Darby before talking to police. <em>Id. </em>at 1714, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 317. Officer Bourke put the codefendants in an interview room together and left them alone. <em>Id. </em>Although Bourke could not precisely recall everything he said to the codefendants, he said, \u201c[W]e\u2019re leaving,\u201d and admitted that he \u201cled [the codefendants] to believe that this was in fact a private conversation between just the [two codefendants].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The officers then \u201csurreptitiously monitored and tape recorded\u201d the conversation, in which the codefendants incriminated themselves. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The Court of Appeal held that Bourke\u2019s statement, although its precise content was uncertain, constituted \u201can express representation that [the] conversation [would] be private\u201d and that it \u201ccreate[d] a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy\u201d which rendered \u201cthe surreptitious monitoring and recording of that conversation ... violative of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1717, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 317. <em>Compare Kirkpatrick v. Joseph A. (In re Joseph A.), </em>30 Cal.App.3d 880, 885-86, 106 Cal.Rptr. 729 (1973) (holding that <em>North </em>did not apply because no privileged relationship existed between juvenile and his uncle but that even if lack of privilege did not defeat claim, officer\u2019s actions in granting uncle\u2019s request to see juvenile \u201cby himself\u2019 in an interrogation room did not amount to implied representation of privacy because request was subject to multiple meanings and trial court construed it to mean \u201caway from other persons in custody\u201d rather than \u201cin private\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Although the issue has not previously been addressed by an appellate court in this state, I would hold that Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme compels the protection of a child\u2019s confidential communications with his parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing <em>in loco parentis. </em>The statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>governing juvenile and domestic relations district courts require that any proceedings against a juvenile originate in juvenile court, Code \u00a7 16.1-241, and that any petition filed in such a court must be served on \u201cat least one parent, guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis,\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-26S(A); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1 (requiring notice of transfer hearing to member of this group or to juvenile\u2019s attorney). Similarly, the United States Supreme Court recognizes that \u201c[d]ue process ... does not allow a hearing to be held in which a youth\u2019s freedom and his parents\u2019 right to his custody are at stake without giving them timely notice, in advance of the hearing, of the specific issues that they must meet.\u201d <em>In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 33-34, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1446-47, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967). Numerous other legal principles acknowledge the importance of the role of a parent as a confidante and counselor to his minor child. <em>See, e.g., Grogg v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 598, 613, 371 S.E.2d 549, 557 (1988) (\u201c[I]t is desirable to have a parent ... or some other interested adult or guardian present when the police interrogate a juvenile, and it is even more desirable to have an interested adult present when a juvenile waives fundamental constitutional rights and confesses to a serious crime.\u201d); <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>24 Va.App. 778, 783, 485 S.E.2d 651, 653 (1997), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>256 Va. 19, 501 S.E.2d 417 (1998) (recognizing right of parents to raise their children as both a fundamental liberty interest and a component of privacy rights); <em>cf </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-283 (permitting termination of parental rights only under extreme circumstances and after efforts by the Commonwealth to provide services necessary to permit continued custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">A New York court has concluded that protection for certain communications between parents and children, although not technically a statutory or common-law privilege like the generally accepted privileges for attorney-client and interspousal communications, arises from a constitutional \u201cright of family privacy\u201d established by \u201ca host of [United States Supreme Court] cases.\u201d <em>People v. Doe (In re A and M), </em>61 A.D.2d 426, 403 N.Y.S.2d 375, 378 (1978), <em>quoted with approval in People v. Harrell, </em>87 A.D.2d 21, 450 N.Y.S.2d 501, 504 (1982), <em>aff'd on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number><em>other grounds, </em>59 N.Y.2d 620, 463 N.Y.S.2d 185, 449 N.E.2d 1263 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">It would be difficult to think of a situation which more strikingly embodies the intimate and confidential relationship which exists among family members than that in which a troubled young person, perhaps beset with remorse and guilt, turns for counsel and guidance to his mother and father. There is nothing more natural, more consistent with our concept of the parental role, than that a child may rely on his parents for help and advice. Shall it be said to those parents, \u201cListen to your son at the risk of being compelled to testify about his confidences?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">[T]here can be no doubt what the effect on that relationship would be if the state could compel parents to disclose information given to them in the context of that confidential setting. Surely the thought of the State forcing a mother and father to reveal their child\u2019s alleged misdeeds, as confessed to them in private, to provide the basis for criminal charges is shocking to our sense of decency, fairness and propriety. It is inconsistent with the way of life we cherish and guard so carefully and raises the specter of a regime which encourages betrayal of one\u2019s offspring. And if, as seems likely, the parents refuse to divulge the child\u2019s confidences, the alternatives faced by the parents, i.e., risk of prosecution for contempt or commission of perjury, could seriously undermine public trust in our system of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">The course of constitutional law is filled with instances wherein the interests of the State in achieving a legitimate goal have been balanced against the rights of individual privacy guaranteed by the Constitution.... [Thus], if it is determined that the information sought here was divulged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>by the boy in the context of the familial setting for the purpose of obtaining support, advice or guidance, we believe that the interest of society in protecting and nurturing the parent-child relationship is of such overwhelming significance that the State\u2019s interest in fact-finding must give way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av3\"><em>A and M, </em>403 N.Y.S.2d at 378-80 (footnote added).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">In light of the approach of Virginia law to the relationship between juveniles and their parents and the constitutional principles outlined so cogently in <em>A and M, </em>I would hold that the right of family privacy protected appellant\u2019s communications with his mother and her partner in much the same way a formal privilege would have.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the reasoning of the California Supreme Court in <em>North, </em>Detective Gandy\u2019s conduct in \u201csurrendering\u201d the interview room to appellant, his mother and her partner, Carl Gray, after Gray\u2019s indication that appellant would make no statement without a lawyer, \u201cso that they might converse and then by exiting and shutting the door, leaving them entirely alone,\u201d \u201cspoke as clearly as words\u201d and had the effect of \u201clull[ing]\u201d appellant \u201cinto believing that their conversation would be confidential.\u201d <em>North, </em>104 Cal.Rptr. 833, 502 P.2d at 1311. Those circumstances, \u201ccoupled with [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>right of family privacy akin to] the statutory presumption that a conversation between spouses is ... made in confidence constituted a sufficient showing by [appellant] to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Thus, admission of Detective Gandy\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s whispered statements violated both the Fourth Amendment and Code \u00a7 19.2-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Even if no right of family privacy existed under the facts of this case to protect appellant\u2019s communications with his mother and her partner, I would hold that Detective Gandy\u2019s statements and actions, standing alone, constituted a representation sufficient to afford appellant an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. <em>See Hammons, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at 1716-17, 5 Cal.Rptr.2d 317; <em>see also People v. A.W., </em>982 P.2d 842, 848-49 (Colo.1999) <em>(en </em>banc) (holding officer\u2019s explicit assurances that no one was behind the two-way mirror and that he would not be listening in gave rise to objectively reasonable expectation of privacy for juvenile in interview room communications with his father). When Carl Gray told Detective Gandy in appellant\u2019s presence that appellant would not make a statement until after they consulted a lawyer, appellant did not contradict Gray, and Gandy acquiesced to the request by leaving the room. Gandy testified that he thought \u201cit would be best if [appellant] consulted a lawyer before anything was said.\u201d Nevertheless, Gandy \u201cwanted to see if they said anything,\u201d so he went to the monitoring room in an effort to overhear any conversation appellant, appellant\u2019s mother and Gray might have. Under these circumstances, I would hold that appellant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy in the interview room he occupied with only his mother and her boyfriend was one society was prepared to recognize as reasonable even if Detective Gandy was not so prepared. Thus, under this approach, as well, admission of Detective Gandy\u2019s testimony regarding appellant\u2019s whispered statements violated both the Fourth Amendment and Code \u00a7 19.2-65.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>For these reasons, I would hold that the trial court erroneously denied the motion to suppress, and I would reverse and remand for additional proceedings. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b496-10\">. The majority holds in footnote 2 that appellant did not preserve for appeal the issue of whether a parent-child privilege exists. As set out <em>infra </em>in the dissent, I would recognize a right of privacy rather than a true privilege. Thus, I would hold that the existence of a parent-child relationship which gives rise to a right of privacy is merely a factor for consideration in determining whether appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Because appellant properly preserved for appeal the reasonable expectation of privacy issue, I would hold we also may consider the impact of the parent-child relationship on that expectation. This is precisely the approach appellant advanced in oral argument before this Court. As the majority acknowledges in footnote 1, \u201d[a]s long as [an] issue [is] properly preserved, an appellate court shall decide the issue according to controlling legal principles.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b497-8\">. Since the decision in <em>North, </em>California\u2019s legislature has expanded the list of rights retained by prisoners and specifically \u201cguarantees that prisoners shall retain all rights except to the extent that restrictions are necessary for public safety or institutional security.\u201d <em>DeLancie v. Sup. Ct., </em>31 Cal.3d 865, 183 Cal.Rptr. 866, 647 P.2d 142, 147 n. 8 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b500-8\">. As another commentator has questioned, \"[W]hen a child comes to Mom or Dad for advice, do parents need to issue the classic warning, 'Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law\u2019? Such an intrusion seems contrary to the political focus on family values.\u201d Margaret Graham Tebo, <em>Parent Privilege: Lawmakers Seek to Protect Parent Child Conversation, </em>86 A.B.A. J. 18 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\">. Formal privileges may be \"waived\u201d or \"broken\u201d if the communication occurs in the presence of a third party to whom the privilege does not apply. <em>See, e.g., Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 518, 521-22, 453 S.E.2d 292, 294 \u2014 95 (1995). As such, if a formal privilege existed here, it could be argued that the presence of Gray, who was merely appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s partner rather than appellant\u2019s father or stepfather, would defeat any assertion of a privilege. However, in the context of the right to privacy and the principles which support that right, I would conclude that Gray was present as a <em>de facto </em>parent in whom appellant confided just as he likely, would have if Gray had been his biological father or stepfather. Gray described himself to Detective Gandy as appellant\u2019s stepfather, and Gandy's testimony about appellant's statements indicated that appellant\u2019s mother and Gray treated both appellant and Williams as \"their ... son[s].\u201d <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-241 (granting juvenile and domestic relations district court jurisdiction over \"[a]ll offenses in which one family or household member is charged with an offense in which another family or household member is the victim\u201d); Code \u00a7 16.1-228 (defining \"[fjamily or household member\u201d to include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany individual who cohabits ... with the person, and any children of either of them then residing in the same home with the person\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\">. In the absence of a family privilege, appellant's mother and Gray could be called to testify and could be held in contempt for refusing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>appear. However, if both took the stand and testified that appellant spoke to them about the weather rather than the offense for which appellant had been arrested, the Fourth Amendment and Code \u00a7 19.2-65 would bar admission of the exchange recorded and overheard by Detective Gandy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
