Simonds, appeals the denial of his motion for attorney\u2019s fees that were incurred in the course of proceedings in which a petition for a protective order filed by the Fairfax County Department of Family Services was adjudicated. Simonds contends: (1) Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21 authorizes the award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case; and (2) the circuit court erred in concluding the Department was substantially justified in filing its petition for a protective order. Because we find Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21 does not authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">On July 22, 1999, the Fairfax County Department of Family Services filed a petition in the Fairfax Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court alleging that M.S., born March 22, 1997, was an abused and/or neglected child pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1), naming her father, Chad Simonds, as respondent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing on July 28, 1999, the juvenile court determined that M.S. should be classified as an abused and/or neglected child and entered a preliminary protective order requiring that Simonds\u2019s visitation with the child be supervised and that he fully cooperate with the Department\u2019s investigation of the case. The juvenile court denied Simonds\u2019s motion for reconsideration and entered a final order on November 18, 1999. The final order continued the Department\u2019s protective supervision of the child, permitted Simonds to have supervised visitation, and ordered him to undergo mental health counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Simonds appealed the order to the circuit court where a trial <em>de novo </em>was held on June 26-27 and July 19-20, 2000. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>By order entered on August 18, 2000, the circuit court dismissed the protective order, finding the Department had failed to establish that M.S. was an abused and/or neglected child. Thereafter, Simonds filed a motion for the attorney\u2019s fees that he incurred in conjunction with the proceedings. The circuit court denied the motion by order dated September 8, 2000. Although the court found that Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21(A) applied, it denied Simonds\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. The court concluded that, although Simonds prevailed on the merits, the Department was substantially justified in bringing the action. It is from this order that Simonds appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Simonds\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, although we do so on different grounds. <em>Driscoll v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 449, 452, 417 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1992) (\u201cAn appellate court may affirm the judgment of a trial court when it has reached the right result for the wrong reason.\u201d). As explained in this opinion, we find that Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21(A) does not permit an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Simonds concedes that \u201cin the absence of a statute or contract to the contrary, a court may not award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Prospect Development Co. v. Bershader, </em>258 Va. 75, 92, 515 S.E.2d 291, 300 (1999). His reliance upon Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21 to support an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case is misplaced, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">In any civil case brought under Article 4 (\u00a7 9-6.14:15 <em>et seq.) </em>of this chapter and \u00a7 9-6.14:4.1 in which any person contests any agency action, as defined in \u00a7 9-6.14:4, such person shall be entitled to recover from that agency, as defined in the section referred to above ... reasonable costs and attorney fees if such person substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the agency\u2019s position is not substantially justified, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21(A), which is part of the Administrative Process Act (APA), does not permit an award for attorney\u2019s fees in cases that do not arise under Article 4, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:15 <em>et seq., </em>of the APA, or if the party from whom attorney\u2019s fees are sought is not an agency as defined in Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The case before us did not arise under Article 4, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:15 <em>et seq. </em>of the APA. The Simonds matter arose by original petition filed by the Fairfax County Department of Family Services in the juvenile court pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A)(1), alleging M.S. was an abused and/or neglected child. Furthermore, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:15(v) explicitly states that Article 4 \u201cdoes not apply to any agency action which ... encompasses matters subject by law to a trial <em>de novo </em>in any court.\u201d After the juvenile court found M.S. was an abused and/or neglected child within the meaning of Code \u00a7 16.1-228, Simonds appealed the juvenile court\u2019s finding and decision to issue a protective order against Simonds to the circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-296, where the circuit court conducted a trial <em>de novo </em>of the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Furthermore, the Department is not an agency as defined under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is a unit of the Fairfax County Government, and counties are explicitly exempted from the provisions of the APA under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4.1(A)(5). <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 63.1-248:2 (which defines the local department of social services as the department of the county or city); <em>see also Schwartz v. Highland County School Board, 2 </em>Va.App. 554, 556, 346 S.E.2d 544, 545 (1986) (holding that a school board is a unit of county government, rather than state government, and is, therefore, not an \u201cagency\u201d under the APA).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>We accordingly find that this case does not come within the ambit of the APA and affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">. Code \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 241(A)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">[E]ach juvenile and domestic relations district court shall have ... exclusive original jurisdiction ... over all cases, matters and proceedings involving [t]he custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child [w]ho is alleged to be abused, neglected, in need of services, in need of supervision, a status offender, or delinquent....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b281-6\">. The APA defines \"agency\u201d as \"any authority, instrumentality, officer, board or other unit of the state government empowered by the basic laws to make regulations or decide cases.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-10\">. We deny the Department\u2019s motion to dismiss Simonds's appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Department\u2019s motion is grounded on the fact that a separate action involving Simonds and his alleged abuse of M.S. is currently before the Virginia Department of Social Services. However, the present appeal involves a separate action and Simonds\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees is limited to the proceeding under Code \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 241(A)(1). Furthermore, as the matter before the Virginia Department of Social Services is still pending and is not presently before us, this opinion does not address whether Simonds would be entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees in that proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
