Purdie contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence of the cocaine and marijuana seized from his person. Because the police had probable cause to arrest Purdie at the time they conducted the search and seized the evidence, we hold the trial court properly denied Purdie\u2019s motion to suppress and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">On appeal, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). On November 13, 1998, at about 8:30 p.m., Officer Curtis Blake of the Arlington Police Department was on duty in an unmarked police car equipped with emergency lights and a siren. He saw a vehicle traveling east on 24th Street turn south onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Glebe Road. The vehicle attracted Blake\u2019s attention because it had tinted windows that the officer believed were darker than permitted by the Code of Virginia. Blake had previously written twenty to thirty summonses for \u201cexcessive tint,\u201d and believed the front window of the vehicle had \u201ctoo much tint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Blake activated his emergency lights and tapped on his siren several times in an effort to stop the vehicle. Nevertheless, the vehicle \u201ctraveled about 300 yards before it finally pulled over.... \u201d Blake did not recognize the driver, but he knew the two passengers. Purdie was in the front passenger seat, and Terry Mangun was in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Officer Blake knew Purdie was a \u201cpolice fighter,\u201d as well as a \u201cpolice runner.\u201d The officer also knew that he was involved in the distribution of narcotics and had committed \u201cviolent criminal offenses.\u201d Because Blake was the only police officer present when he stopped the vehicle, Blake was concerned for his safety. Shortly thereafter, backup officers arrived on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Officer Chris Dengeles, the next officer to approach the vehicle, also immediately recognized Purdie. According to Dengeles, Purdie had a reputation in the police community for being dangerous. Dengeles knew Purdie from his prior involvement with the police, beginning some time in late 1989 or early 1990. Specifically, Dengeles knew that Purdie had previously stabbed a police officer and had been arrested after he fled from an officer and discarded narcotics while attempting to flee. Dengeles\u2019s safety concerns were amplified by the fact that the vehicle failed to stop until it had traversed some 300 yards after Blake activated his emergency equipment. Dengeles testified that the failure to stop immediately when ordered to do so often indicates that those in the car might \u201crun\u201d or are \u201cbuying time\u201d before they encounter the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">In order to safely conduct a test of the tint level of the windshield, Blake asked the occupants to exit the vehicle. Dengeles noticed that as soon as Blake gave the order to exit, Purdie \u201cbecame very nervous.\u201d Dengeles described Purdie as \u201chesitant about getting out of the car,\u201d \u201clooking around a lot,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>and \u201chunched over slightly.\u201d He remained in a bent position as he walked from the car, giving rise to Dengeles\u2019s belief that Purdie was hiding something in the area of his waistband, lower abdomen, or groin area. Once Purdie passed Dengeles, and his back was toward the officer, Purdie straightened up, giving further credence to Dengeles\u2019s suspicion that Purdie was concealing something somewhere on the front portion of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Dengeles continued to observe Purdie as he headed toward the back of the car. Concerned about Purdie\u2019s suspicious behavior, Dengeles continued his observation as Officer Conigliaro conducted a patdown while Purdie stood next to a guardrail. When Conigliaro reached the areas of Purdie\u2019s body where Dengeles suspected Purdie was hiding something, Purdie lifted his leg and put his foot on the guardrail in a manner that concealed the groin and front waistband areas. Because Conigliaro failed to check Purdie\u2019s waist or groin areas at that time, Dengeles concluded the frisk was inadequate and his safety concerns were, therefore, not dispelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Dengeles continued to watch Purdie as he sat on the guardrail near the car. He saw Purdie look from side to side. \u201cHe started to look out of the corner of his eyes at the location of all of [the] officers\u201d and looked \u201c360 degrees all around him as well.\u201d He further observed Purdie, who was wearing a bulky jacket, move his hands, as if \u201cgathering something\u201d inside the pockets of the jacket, and remove them, his fists clenched. The officer further explained that Purdie then looked around, put his hands down by the side of the guardrail and then back into his pockets. Purdie repeated the movements \u201ca couple more times where he would gather something, bring it out, look at me and then put his hand back in his pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Based upon Purdie\u2019s behavior, and because Conigliaro never checked the area where Dengeles believed Purdie might have concealed something, Dengeles decided to conduct a second patdown. When Dengeles told Purdie to put his hands on the car, Purdie had his hands in his pockets \u201cgathering whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>he was gathering.\u201d He \u201ctook his hand out of his pocket, closed fist, and walked slowly over to the car,\u201d with Dengeles beside him. Immediately before putting his hands on the car, Purdie \u201cquickly brought his hand up to his mouth\u201d and swallowed whatever he had in his hand before the police could stop him.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Dengeles had seen the hand-to-mouth movement dozens of times, characterizing it as the manner in which drugs are destroyed before the police can seize them. Consistent with his experience, and based upon his observations of Purdie\u2019s behavior, the officer concluded that Purdie was about to swallow narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The police unsuccessfully attempted to grab Purdie\u2019s hand as it went to his mouth. After restraining him on the ground, the officers were unable to retrieve anything from Purdie\u2019s mouth and found his hand empty. Their order to \u201cspit out whatever he had in his mouth\u201d went unheeded. Dengeles reached inside the pocket from which Purdie had taken his hand before bringing it to his mouth and retrieved a piece of crack cocaine. Marijuana was also found in Purdie\u2019s left jacket pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">On appeal from a trial court\u2019s ruling denying a defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence, the defendant bears the burden of showing that the denial of the motion to suppress constituted reversible error. <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, 220 </em>Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980); <em>Motley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 439, 440-41, 437 S.E.2d 232, 233 (1993). In reviewing the legality of a search, \u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>However, we review <em>de novo </em>\u201c[ultimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197, 487 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>S.E.2d at 261; <em>see Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 470, 475, 525 S.E.2d 921, 924 (2000); <em>McNair v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 76, 82, 521 S.E.2d 303, 306 (1999) (en <em>banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Purdie does not challenge the stop of the vehicle in which he was a passenger, the request for him to exit the vehicle, or the initial patdown conducted by Officer Conigliaro. Purdie\u2019s claim is limited to the legality of Officer Dengeles\u2019s search of Purdie\u2019s jacket pocket. Purdie contends that Dengeles had neither a reasonable, articulable suspicion that Purdie was armed before conducting a second patdown, nor probable cause to search Purdie. We disagree with Purdie\u2019s contention and find that because Dengeles had probable cause to arrest Purdie, the search was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">When determining whether there was probable cause to support an arrest, we examine the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Yancey v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 510, 516, 518 S.E.2d 325, 328 (1999); <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 9-10, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1586, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">[P]robable cause is a flexible, common-sense standard. It merely requires that the facts available to the officer would \u201cwarrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u2019 that certain items may be contraband or stolen property or useful as evidence of a crime; it does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\"><em>Texas v. Brown, </em>460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 1543, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983) (citation omitted). Probable cause does not require \u201can actual showing,\u201d but, rather, \u201conly a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 243 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2335, n. 13, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <em>Quigley v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 28, 34, 414 S.E.2d 851, 855 (1992). \u201c \u2018Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, alone are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 229, 231, 443 S.E.2d 189, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>190 (1994) (citation omitted); <em>see Schaum v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 498, 500, 211 S.E.2d 73, 75 (1975). \u201cIf an officer has reason to believe that a person is committing a felony in his presence by possessing contraband or a controlled substance, the officer has probable cause to arrest the individual without a warrant.\u201d <em>Buck v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 298, 304, 456 S.E.2d 534, 536-37 (1995). When looking at the totality of circumstances, we give deference to the officer\u2019s understanding of the situation based on his or her training and experience. <em>McGuire v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 584, 593, 525 S.E.2d 43, 48 (2000); <em>see also Hollis v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 874, 877, 223 S.E.2d 887, 889 (1976) (\u201cIn determining whether probable cause exists courts will test what the totality of the circumstances meant to police officers trained in analyzing the observed conduct for purposes of crime control.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Based on the totality of the circumstances, consisting of furtive movements and suspicious conduct, which culminated in Purdie swallowing something that had been hidden in his hand, Officer Dengeles had probable cause to believe that Purdie had disposed of an illegal substance. At that point in time, Dengeles also had probable cause to arrest Purdie for possession of an illegal substance. <em>See id. </em>at 877, 223 S.E.2d at 889 (furtive gesture of throwing down hand-rolled cigarette gave officer probable cause to search vehicle); <em>Mavin v. Commonwealth, </em>31 VaApp. 161, 165-66, 521 S.E.2d 784, 786-87 (1999) (evasive actions, including furtive gestures to conceal prescription bottle, were factors to consider when determining probable cause to believe bottle contained contraband); <em>see also Lawson v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 354, 355, 358, 228 S.E.2d 685, 686, 687 (1976); <em>Buck, </em>20 VaApp. at 304, 456 S.E.2d at 536-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\"><em>Buck, </em>20 Va.App. 298, 456 S.E.2d 534, involved furtive conduct similar to the conduct observed in this case. In <em>Buck, </em>the officers were in plain clothes and were patrolling a high crime area in an unmarked car. The officers observed the defendant, whom the police did not know, standing on a street corner talking to a group of men. When the police car passed, the group dispersed. The officers circled the block and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>returning, saw the defendant talking to a second group of men. This group also dispersed as the officers drove by. When the officers drove around the block a third time, they observed the defendant in the back seat of a car. The car drove around the block and returned a few minutes later. After the defendant exited the vehicle, one of the officers approached the defendant and announced he was a police officer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">At that moment, the [defendant] quickly placed his closed fist to his mouth and began to run. The officers did not see anything in the [defendant\u2019s] hands or see him place anything in his mouth at the time, although it appeared from his motion that he was placing something in his mouth. Officer Baine pursued the [defendant] and tackled him within ten yards of the initial encounter. A scuffle ensued between the two of them. During the scuffle, the [defendant] was making a chewing motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 301, 456 S.E.2d at 535.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Based on these facts, we concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">The facts support the finding that the police officers, having observed the [defendant\u2019s] activity, reasonably believed that the [defendant] was trying to eat and destroy drugs in his mouth. Therefore, they had probable cause to arrest the [defendant] based on the objective, reasonable belief that he had been or was committing a crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 304, 456 S.E.2d at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">In this case, Officer Dengeles recognized Purdie and knew he had a reputation for fighting and running from the police whole carrying illegal narcotics. Specifically, Dengeles provided uncontroverted testimony that Purdie had previously stabbed an officer and had discarded illegal narcotics as he attempted to flee. His knowledge of Purdie\u2019s prior conduct is relevant in determining whether probable cause to arrest existed. <em>See Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 169-70, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1307-08, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949) (officer\u2019s knowledge of defendant and his past conduct may be considered as evidence supporting a finding of probable cause); <em>Schaum, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>215 Va. at 500, 211 S.E.2d at 75 (knowledge of suspect and his prior criminal acts factor to be considered in a probable cause determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In addition, Dengeles observed nervous conduct on Purdie\u2019s part from the inception of the traffic stop. <em>See Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 353, 361, 512 S.E.2d 160, 164 (1999) (nervousness of the suspect is a factor to consider when evaluating an officer\u2019s actions). Dengeles had concerns at the outset of the traffic stop because the vehicle in which Purdie was riding did not stop when directed to do so and traveled 300 yards before pulling over. These concerns were not dispelled by Purdie, who \u201cbecame very nervous\u201d when asked to get out of the vehicle. When he exited the car, he did so hesitantly and was \u201chunched over slightly.\u201d Purdie did not straighten up until after the front of his body was out of Dengeles\u2019s view. Based on this behavior, Dengeles, who had fourteen years of experience as a police officer, believed that Purdie was hiding something in the area of his waistband, lower abdomen, or groin area.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">While sitting on the guardrail, Purdie had his hands inside his jacket and appeared to \u201cgather something up\u201d in his pockets. Purdie repeated the \u201cgathering\u201d motion at least twice, in what appeared to be an attempt to discard something from his jacket pocket, while looking around and watching the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">When Dengeles told Purdie to go over to the car and put his hands on it, his hands remained in his pockets, \u201cgathering whatever he was gathering.\u201d When he took one of his hands out of the pocket, he kept it in a clenched fist as he walked toward the car and, just before placing his hands on the car, Purdie \u201cquickly\u201d put his fisted hand \u201cup to his mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Dengeles testified that he had seen individuals engage in the same hand-to-mouth movement on dozens of occasions, and described the action as a way in which people destroy drugs in order to avoid having the contraband seized by the police. <em>See Richards v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 612, 616, 383 S.E.2d 268, 271 (1989) (\u201cTrained and experienced police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>officers ... may be able to perceive and articulate meaning in given conduct which would be wholly innocent to the untrained observer.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">When Dengeles subsequently searched Purdie\u2019s pocket, he had probable cause to arrest Purdie and was entitled to conduct a complete search of his person incident to that arrest. <em>Buck, </em>20 Va.App. at 304, 456 S.E.2d at 536-37 (\u2018When an officer has probable cause to arrest a person, the officer may search the person, particularly where the evidence is of a highly evanescent nature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">It is of no consequence that Dengeles conducted the search prior to formally arresting Purdie. <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 102, 112, 510 S.E.2d 247, 252 (1999); <em>Buck, </em>20 Va.App. at 304, 456 S.E.2d at 537; <em>Poindexter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 730, 733-34, 432 S.E.2d 527, 529 (1993); <em>Rawlings v. Kentucky, </em>448 U.S. 98, 111, 100 S.Ct. 2556, 2564-65, 65 L.Ed.2d 633 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Because Officer Dengeles had probable cause to arrest Purdie at the time he conducted the search, we find the trial court properly denied Purdie\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-12\">. The Court notes that the sentencing order in Circuit Court No. CR99994 indicates that appellant was found guilty of possession of cocaine. However, as the appellant was found guilty of possession of marijuana, this matter is remanded to the trial court for the sole purpose of correcting that clerical error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
