Finley, Jr. (father). On appeal, she contends the trial court erred in dismissing her petitions for her failure to answer the discovery propounded by father because: 1) she asserted her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and 2) the discovery sought by father was not relevant to the proceeding. We agree that the trial court erred in dismissing mother\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">On August 4, 1999, mother filed a petition to amend a previous custody order of July 6, 1999, in which father was awarded custody. In support of her petition to amend, mother alleged a change in circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The July 6, 1999 order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> came on a remand from this Court after we reversed an earlier order that allowed mother to retain custody and remove the child to Ghana. On remand, the trial court gave custody to father and set forth specific visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">A number of other matters came before the trial court in addition to the petition to amend custody, including: 1) father\u2019s motion to compel discovery of mother\u2019s income and whereabouts while she was under order not to leave the country; 2) father\u2019s motion to enforce various subpoenas duces tecum; 3) father\u2019s motion to establish visitation for mother; 4) father\u2019s motion to have the civil contempt fine reduced to judgment; 5) father\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs; 6) mother\u2019s petition to show cause against father for failure to pay child support, failure to allow visitation and other actions alleged to have violated previous orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">By order of June 30, 2000, the trial court ruled it would dismiss mother\u2019s petition to amend custody and her petition to show cause against father if mother did not answer the discovery requests within ten days. Mother failed to do so, and on July 14, 2000, the trial court dismissed mother\u2019s petition to amend custody because \u201cthe [mother] failed to answer the discovery in accordance with the court\u2019s order of June 30, 2000.... \u201d In the same order, the trial court dismissed the petition to show cause against father for his alleged failure to pay child support. Mother then timely appealed the July 14, 2000 order by her notice of appeal filed on August 9, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>On September 1, 2000, the trial court resolved the remaining issues: contempt, visitation, child support, health insurance, attorney\u2019s fees and sanctions against mother. The September 1, 2000 order recited that mother\u2019s petition to amend custody had been dismissed in the July 14, 2000 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Father filed a motion to dismiss mother\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Father contends the July 14, 2000 order is \u201can interim order\u201d and that the September 1, 2000 order is the \u201cfinal order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">We first must determine whether the July 14, 2000 order is a \u201cfinal order\u201d or an interlocutory order that \u201cadjudicates the principles of a cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-405, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to hear appeals from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">3. Any final judgment, order, or decree of a circuit court involving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">a. Affirmance or annulment of a marriage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">b. Divorce;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">c. Custody;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-13\">d. Spousal or child support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-14\">e. The control or disposition of a child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-15\">f. Any other domestic relations matter arising under</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-16\">Title 16.1 or Title 20; or____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-17\">4. Any interlocutory decree or order entered in any of the cases listed in this section ... (ii) adjudicating the principles of a cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-18\">Code \u00a7 17.1-405(3)-(4).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-19\">For an interlocutory decree to adjudicate the principles of a cause, the decision must be such that \u201c \u2018the rules or methods by which the rights of the parties are to be finally worked out have been so far determined that it is only necessary to apply those rules or methods to the facts of the case in order to ascertain the relative rights of the parties, with regard to the subject matter of the suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pinkard v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>Pinkard, </em>12 Va.App. 848, 851, 407 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1991) (quoting <em>Lee v. Lee, </em>142 Va. 244, 252-53, 128 S.E. 524, 527 (1925)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-7\"><em>Erikson v. Erikson, </em>19 Va.App. 389, 391, 451 S.E.2d 711, 712-13 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u201cA final decree is one \u2018which disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief that is contemplated, and leaves nothing to be done by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390, 451 S.E .2d at 712 (quoting <em>Southwest Virginia Hosps. v. Lipps, </em>193 Va. 191, 193, 68 S.E.2d 82, 83-84 (1951) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Mother\u2019s petition requested that custody be returned to her. The July 14, 2000 order dismissed that petition. Clearly, the order disposed of the \u201cwhole subject\u201d of custody. Nothing was left for the court to act upon. The subsequent proceedings were unrelated to a determination of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">Therefore, because the July 14, 2000 order was a final appealable order, we find we have jurisdiction to determine the merits of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">We first address mother\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in dismissing her custody petition and the petition to show cause against father. She argues, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-223.1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the assertion of her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is not a proper basis for dismissing her petitions. She further maintains that the discovery sought by father was not relevant to the proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>Father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>argues that the common law \u201csword and shield\u201d doctrine permitted the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">While the trial court did not articulate its reasons for dismissal, we necessarily conclude it was under the common law doctrine of \u201csword and shield.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Father sought dismissal of the petition under Rule 4:12(b)(2)(c), but the trial court could not have dismissed the petition as a sanction under Rule 4:12 because the Rule\u2019s sanctions do not apply until an order has been entered and violated. In this case, such an order was never entered. Rather, the trial judge, in his ruling from the bench, acknowledged he was not compelling mother to \u201canswer anything\u201d or \u201cproduce anything.\u201d The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">She has the choice of either proceeding with the discovery or, in the alternative, I will grant Mr. Barker\u2019s motion for sanctions in terms of a dismissal of this action. I\u2019m not going to play a pea and shell game with her. And I cannot force her to by utilization of the coercive powers of this Court, fine or imprisonment, I cannot coerce her to produce this information. And I acknowledge that much, and I\u2019m not doing that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The Supreme Court of Virginia, in <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>233 Va. 452, 357 S.E.2d 495 (1987),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> expounded on the common law doctrine of \u201csword and shield.\u201d The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>[T]his rule recognizes that historically the privilege against self-incrimination was intended solely as a shield. The rule thus provides that a moving party cannot use it as a sword to sabotage any attempt by the other party, either during pretrial discovery or at trial, to obtain information relevant to the cause of action alleged, and relevant to possible defenses to the claim. <em>Laverne v. Incorp. Village of Laurel Hollow, </em>18 N.Y.2d 635, 638, 272 N.Y.S.2d 780, 782, 219 N.E.2d 294, 295 (1966), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>386 U.S. 682, 87 S.Ct. 1324, 18 L.Ed.2d 403 (1967). In other words, the moving party \u201cin a civil action who exercises his privilege against self-incrimination to refuse to answer questions pertinent to the issues involved will have his complaint dismissed upon timely motion.\u201d <em>Kisting v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., </em>290 F.Supp. 141, 149 (W.D.Wisc.1968), <em>aff'd, </em>416 F.2d 967 (7th Cir.1969). <em>See </em>annot., 4 A.L.R.3d 545. The idea is that it would be unjust to permit parties to use the courts to seek affirmative relief while at the same time deflecting relevant questions, the answers to which may constitute a defense to the claims asserted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 456-57, 357 S.E.2d at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Father contends mother waived her Fifth Amendment claim by promising to answer discovery. Father further contends mother did not file a timely objection to the interrogatories or to the motion for production. Father further argues that by only objecting to the discovery on relevancy grounds, she could not later object on the basis of self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">By letter dated April 20, 1999 to father\u2019s counsel, mother\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">I will have discovery answers to you by Friday, April 30, 1999, so you do not have to waste your client\u2019s money with a sanctions motion.

BurgerBusters, Inc., </em>255 Va. 616, 622-23, 499 S.E.2d 829, 833 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">It is clear that the constitutional rights are those of the individual and can only be waived by that person. Therefore, the letter from mother\u2019s counsel indicating the discovery answers would be forthcoming is not a waiver of mother\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">By initially objecting only to the relevancy of the discovery, mother did not waive her self-incrimination objection. We find nothing in the record to indicate such waiver. A challenge to the relevancy of the discovery was not a \u201cvoluntary abandonment\u201d of her privilege nor was it \u201cinconsistent\u201d with claiming the privilege. By challenging the relevancy of the discovery requests, she did no more than have the court determine whether the interrogatories and documents requested were relevant to the subject involved in the \u201cpending action\u201d or whether the information sought appeared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of \u201cadmissible evidence.\u201d Rule 4:l(b)(l). Therefore, if the trial court determined that the information sought was not relevant, mother would not have to assert the privilege. Clearly, mother did not \u201cabandon\u201d the privilege by initially objecting on relevancy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Similarly, we find no merit to father\u2019s contention that mother did not timely object to the interrogatories. Pursuant to Rules 4:8(d) and 4:9(b), discovery must be answered and/or objected to within twenty-one days. Rules 4:8(d) and 4:9(b). However, \u201c[t]he court may allow a shorter or longer time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is apparent from the record that the trial court allowed a \u201clonger time\u201d because it acknowledged mother\u2019s privilege in its ruling of June 30, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Finding that mother did not waive her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, we now address whether Code \u00a7 8.01-223.1 bars the trial court from dismissing her petitions. Essentially, we must decide whether mother\u2019s invocation of her constitutional right was \u201cused against her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u201cA primary rule of statutory construction is that courts must look first to the language of the statute. If a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court will give the statute its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Loudoun County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. v. Etzold, </em>245 Va. 80, 85, 425 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1993) (citation omitted). \u201cTherefore, we must accept its plain meaning and not consider rules of statutory construction, legislative history, or extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Perez v. Capital One Bank, </em>258 Va. 612, 616, 522 S.E.2d 874, 876 (1999) (citation omitted). \u201cCourts must give effect to legislative intent, which must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity.\u201d <em>HCA Health Servs. of Virginia, Inc. v. Levin, </em>260 Va. 215, 220, 530 S.E.2d 417, 420 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Here, mother clearly exercised a \u201cconstitutional protection\u201d in a civil action, her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. We cannot conceive of any graver consequence than dismissing the action against mother for exercising that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\u201cconstitutional protection.\u201d Her exercise was \u201cused against\u201d her in the most absolute and final way.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We conclude that Code \u00a7 8.01-223.1 barred the trial court from dismissing mother\u2019s petitions. We further conclude that, under the facts of this case, Code \u00a7 8.01-223.1 supercedes the \u201csword and shield\u201d doctrine. Therefore, we vacate the dismissal order and remand for a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Finally, mother contends the discovery sought was not relevant to the proceedings before the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In order to determine relevancy, we must again review the history of this long-standing custody battle between the child\u2019s parents. In 1997, the trial court permitted the child to remain with mother and allowed mother to remove the child to Ghana. However, the trial court forbade the removal of the child from its jurisdiction pending appeal to this Court. In an unpublished opinion, <em>Joseph E. Finley, Jr. v. Shirley J. Travis, </em>Rec. No. 3060-97-2, 1998 WL 684184 (Va.Ct.App. Oct. 6, 1998), we found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">In defiance of the staying provision of the ruling, the mother and her husband fraudulently removed the child to Ghana. The staying provision was central to the trial court\u2019s ruling and was an indispensable element of that ruling. By violating and defeating that provision, the mother has rendered the ruling a practical nullity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The trial court\u2019s ruling was reversed, and the case was remanded for further proceedings. On remand, the trial court awarded custody to father by order of July 6,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">On August 4, 1999, mother filed a petition to amend, asking that custody be returned to her. In a preliminary ruling, the trial court held that mother must show a change in circumstances from the July 6,1999 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Among other matters, mother filed on November 10,1999, a petition to show cause against father for his failure to pay-child support, failure to allow visitation and other matters alleged to violate previous court orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Essentially, father\u2019s interrogatories sought information concerning the whereabouts of mother and the child from November 1997 to the present and how mother removed the child from the United States. Father requested the production of federal income tax returns and the child\u2019s passport.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Father\u2019s defense to the contempt charge is that he did not know where the child and mother were located and did not know where to send child support payments. Clearly, the whereabouts of the child and mother are relevant to the contempt charge.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-7\">[Evidence] is relevant, ... if, when considered in relation to other evidence in the case, it tends to establish a party\u2019s claim or defense or adds force and strength to other evidence bearing upon an issue in the case. <em>McNeir v. Greer-Hale Chinchilla Ranch, </em>194 Va. 623, 628, 74 S.E.2d 165, 169 (1953). \u201cThe criterion of relevancy is whether or not the evidence tends to cast any light upon the subject of the inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 629, 74 S.E.2d at 169.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-8\"><em>Breeden v.

Bazemore, </em>32 Va.App. 451, 455-56, 528 S.E.2d 193, 195 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u201c[T]he trial court \u2018has the authority to hold [an] offending party in contempt for acting in bad faith or for willful disobedience of its order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456, 528 S.E.2d at 195 (quoting <em>Alexander, </em>12 Va.App. at 696, 406 S.E.2d at 669 (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Because the trial court must determine whether father\u2019s failure to pay child support was in \u201cbad faith\u201d or in \u201cwillful disobedience,\u201d the fact that the child might have been removed to another country and secreted from father is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">For the same reasons, the child\u2019s whereabouts and status were relevant to the custody issue. While the trial court limited the \u201cchange in circumstances\u201d to events occurring after the July 6, 1999 order, the court cannot ignore the conditions to which the child was subjected or the efforts mother undertook to separate the child from father. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-124.3(3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Similarly, the tax returns might show the travels of mother and would be relevant to the custody proceedings, as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\u201cThe granting or denying of [discovery] is a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will be reversed only if the action taken was [an abuse of discretion].\u201d <em>Rakes v. Fulcher, </em>210 Va. 542, 546, 172 S.E.2d 751, 755 (1970) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-13\">For these reasons, we find that mother did not waive her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the trial court erred in dismissing mother\u2019s petitions pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Code \u00a7 8.01-223.1. However, we hold that the trial court correctly ruled that father\u2019s discovery propounded to mother was relevant to the proceeding. We, therefore, reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of mother\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-9\">. The trial court obtained jurisdiction to hear these matters from an appeal from the juvenile and domestic relations district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-12\">. Code \u00a7 8.01-223.1 states: \"In any civil action the exercise by a party of any constitutional protection shall not be used against him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-13\">.

Produce all state, and federal tax returns you have filed jointly or individually for income of any nature you or your spouse has earned during the calendar years 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 regardless of the country or state to with which you filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">2. Produce the original passport or other document used by Jonell D. Finley or you on her behalf from 11/1/97 to present.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b231-12\">. We find Code \u00a7 8.01-401(B) does not apply because mother was not called upon by another to \"testify on his behalf.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01 \u2014 401(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b231-13\">. Because Code \u00a7 8.01-223.1 was not enacted until July 1, 1985, <em>Davis </em>does not discuss the impact of that section on the \"sword and shield\u201d doctrine. The decree appealed from was entered in January 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b236-11\">.
