Patton, Jr., contends the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission erred in ruling that his employer, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, presented sufficient competent evidence to rebut the presumption under Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) that his heart disease was an occupational disease suffered in the line of duty. We agree and reverse and remand this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>As a preliminary matter, Patton contends the commission exceeded the scope of the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and violated the law of the case by reaching a different conclusion on remand. We disagree. The Supreme Court specifically ordered that the case be remanded to the commission \u201cto reconsider the evidence presented in accordance with the principles expressed in\u201d .the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Bass v. City of Richmond Police Department, </em>258 Va. 108, 515 S.E.2d 557 (1999). The commission did exactly that. It reevaluated the evidence, applying the correct legal standards expressly set forth in <em>Bass, </em>and reached a decision contrary to its earlier decision. We conclude, upon our review of the record, that the commission, in reassessing the evidence and making appropriate findings of fact in accordance with the directive of the Supreme Court, did not exceed the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate or violate the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Patton further contends the commission improperly concluded that his employer presented sufficient evidence to overcome the occupational disease presumption established in Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B) provides, in relevant part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">Hypertension or heart disease causing the death of, or any health condition or impairment resulting in total or partial disability of ... salaried or volunteer firefighters [and] ... sheriffs and deputy sheriffs ... shall be presumed to be occupational diseases, suffered in the line of duty, that are covered by this title unless such presumption is overcome by a preponderance of competent evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In order to rebut the presumption established by Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B), \u201cthe employer must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>both </em>that (1) the claimant\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment, and (2) there was a non-work-related cause of the disease.\u201d <em>Bass, </em>258 Va. at 114, 515 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>at 562-63. Hence, \u201cif the employer does not prove by a preponderance of the evidence both parts of this two-part test, the employer has failed to overcome the statutory presumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114, 515 S.E.2d at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Here, the evidence established that Patton worked continuously for Loudoun County since the age of eighteen, the first five years as a firefighter and then as a deputy sheriff. In 1994, at the age of thirty-eight, he suffered an inferior myocardial infarction while investigating a criminal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">According to Dr. Carey M. Marder, Patton\u2019s treating cardiologist, the cause of the heart attack \u201cwas a thrombus in the right coronary artery.\u201d He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">How much of this is related to the stress of a 2nd Lieutenant\u2019s job is difficult to say____Stress as an independent risk factor is very difficult to quantitate. Certainly, however, I would consider John to have been in a considerably higher risk due to his other cardiac risk factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Dr. Stuart F. Seides, a cardiologist who, at the request of Patton\u2019s employer, examined Patton and reviewed some of his medical records, noted that Patton was found shortly after the heart attack to have \u201cmulti-vessel coronary atherosclerosis with critical obstruction of the \u2018culprit\u2019 right coronary artery.\u201d Dr. Seides further noted that Patton\u2019s \u201csymptom onset did occur in the setting of his patrol duties,\u201d but added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">it is highly likely that the myocardial infarction would have occurred in or around the same time frame regardless of his activities. Although \u201cstress\u201d is often considered to be an important trigger for myocardial infarction, most infarcts occur in the absence of an identifiable environmental event and in those cases where there is an apparent association, it may be simple coincidence. What is most important is the presence of the underlying substraight of atherosclerosis which is a multifactorial process developing over a period of many years in the setting of the risk factors outlined in this case. The relationship of occupation to the development of atherosclerosis is virtually nil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Dr. Richard A. Schwartz, who, at Patton\u2019s request, examined Patton, obtained a history from him and reviewed some of his medical records, noted, in addressing Patton\u2019s coronary artery disease, that, \u201c[i]n this patient, occupational stress, hypertension, and possibly diabetes are identifiable factors.\u201d He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">Occupational stress is one of the risk factors. It cannot be excluded with respect to this patient. There are no congenital or genetic causes that can be identified either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">In summary, then Mr. Patton has coronary artery disease that developed in the course of his employment. This is a multifactorial process and multiple factors were present in this patient. None can be specifically implicated or excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Upon reviewing the evidence on remand, the commission ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">In the present matter, we conclude that the employer has rebutted the Code \u00a7 65.2-402 presumption. Admittedly, the claimant\u2019s job was undeniably stressful. The medical evidence, however, establishes non-work related causes of the claimant\u2019s heart disease, and establishes that the claimant\u2019s disease was not caused by his employment. Specifically, Dr. Seides opined that the claimant\u2019s \u201crelatively advanced coronary atherosclerosis [was] caused by the multiple aforementioned factors\u201d including diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, a family history of premature coronary disease, and a history of cigarette smoking. Dr. Seides also opined that the \u201crelationship of occupation to the development of atherosclerosis is virtually nil.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">ij: <em>tfc </em>i\u00a1; <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">We have carefully considered the fact that Dr. Seides is not a treating physician, and that he was not aware of the details of the claimant\u2019s stressful job environment. Nevertheless, his is the only physician to have expressed a definite opinion of the cause of the claimant\u2019s heart disease. His opinion is logical in light of the numerous non-work related factors acknowledged by the other physicians. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>we conclude that the employer has established by a preponderance of the evidence non-work related causes of the disease, and that work was not a cause of the disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">However, subsequent to the commission\u2019s reconsideration of the evidence in this case on remand, we held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">Code \u00a7 65.2-402 \u201chas long been recognized as a remedial statute, enacted by the legislature to overcome the difficulty that a [police officer] would otherwise have in proving causation.\u201d In enacting the statute, \u201c[t]he legislature knew that the causes of ... cardiac diseases are unknown and that the medical community is split regarding the impact of stress and work environment on these diseases.\u201d By enacting the statutory presumption, the General Assembly resolved the split in medical opinions in favor of the employee and adopted the presumption that the stress of working as a law enforcement officer causes or contributes to the development of heart disease. Testimony which merely refutes the premise of such a legislatively enacted presumption does not constitute proper evidence in rebuttal. Where the General Assembly has concluded that there is a causal link between stress and heart disease, it is not for the commission or the courts to reconsider the issue, for to do so would defeat the intentions of the legislature. It thus follows that, \u201c[i]t is impermissible for the [commission] to accept the opinion of a physician so disposed as the basis for disallowing a claim.\u201d ... We, accordingly, hold that evidence that merely rebuts generally the underlying premise of the statute, which establishes a causal link between stress and heart disease, is not probative evidence for purposes of overcoming the presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>Medlin v. County of Henrico Police, </em>34 Va.App. 396, 406-07, 542 S.E.2d 33, 38-39 (2001) (alterations in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">We recently applied our holding in <em>Medlin </em>to Dr. Seides\u2019 medical opinion in <em>Bristol City Fire Dep\u2019t and Virginia Mun. Group Self-Ins. Ass\u2019n v. Maine, </em>35 Va.App. 109, 542 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>822 (2001). In that case, Dr. Seides opined regarding the claimant firefighter\u2019s heart disease as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">Mr. Maine has coronary atherosclerosis with obstructive coronary artery disease and a documented myocardial infarction. The cause of the condition is a progressive buildup of cholesterol-containing atherosclerotic plaque in the coronary arteries which surround the heart and provide the heart muscle with blood. Coronary atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease, in which a number of risk factors may play a role in accelerating the deposition of plaque material in constitutionally susceptible individuals____ His employment as a firefighter had nothing whatsoever to do with the genesis of either his underlying coronary atherosclerosis or his myocardial infarction. Any attempt to associate his occupation and his disease is without scientific merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 115, 542 S.E.2d at 825. We concluded that, under <em>Medlin, </em>Dr. Seides\u2019 opinion did not constitute probative evidence for purposes of rebutting the presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402 because it \u201csimply attempt[ed] to discount the presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402, rather than evaluate] whether work was a cause or risk factor of the heart disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 542 S.E.2d at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">In this case, the commission relied wholly upon Dr. Seides\u2019 medical opinion that the \u201crelationship of occupation to the development of atherosclerosis is virtually nil\u201d to conclude that Patton\u2019s heart disease was not caused by his employment. That opinion, however, like Dr. Seides\u2019 opinion in <em>Maine, </em>merely rebuts generally the underlying premise of Code \u00a7 65.2-402(B), which establishes the presumptive causal link between occupational stress and heart disease. Accordingly, Dr. Seides\u2019 opinion that the \u201crelationship of occupation to the development of atherosclerosis is virtually nil\u201d is not probative evidence for purposes of overcoming the presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402, and the commission erred in relying on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Disregarding that evidence, we cannot conclude that the employer has rebutted the presumption. Hence, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand this case \u201cto the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>mission to determine whether the employer has sufficiently rebutted the presumption in light of the remaining probative evidence.\u201d <em>Medlin, </em>34 Va.App. at 408, 542 S.E.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\">. Technically, the remand order was ours. The Supreme Court, after reversing our earlier judgment in this matter, remanded the case to us for remand to the commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b433-5\">WILLIS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ASU\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The commission\u2019s factual findings, if supported by credible evidence, are binding. <em>Jules Hairstylists, Inc. v. Galanes, </em>1 Va.App. 64, 334 S.E.2d 592 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Dr. Stuart Seides, a cardiologist, after reviewing Patton\u2019s medical records and examining him, reported, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">Mr. Patton has multiple risk factors for the development of coronary heart disease. He has documented hypertension, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, a family history of premature coronary heart disease ..., and previous tobacco abuse____[H]e was found to have multi-vessel coronary atherosclerosis with critical obstruction of the \u201cculprit\u201d right coronary artery ..., but also well developed atherosclerotic placquing in the left anterior descending and left circumflex systems____ Mr. Patton had relatively advanced coronary atherosclerosis caused by the multiple aforementioned factors____[I]t is highly likely that the myocardial infarction would have occurred in or around the same time frame regardless of his activities. Although \u201cstress\u201d is often considered to be an important trigger for myocardial infarction, most infarcts occur in the absence of an identifiable environmental event and in those cases where there is an apparent association, it may be simple coincidence. What is most important is the presence of the underlying substraight [sic] of atherosclerosis which is a multifactorial process developing over a period of many years in the setting of the risk factors outlined in this case. The relationship of occupation to the development of atherosclerosis is virtually nil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">The commission held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>We have carefully considered the fact that Dr. Seides is not a treating physician, and that he was not aware of the details of [Patton\u2019s] stressful job environment. Nevertheless, he is the only physician to have expressed a definite opinion of the cause of [Patton\u2019s] heart disease. His opinion is logical in light of the numerous non-work related factors acknowledged by the other physicians. Accordingly, we conclude that the employer has established by a preponderance of the evidence non-work related causes of the disease, and that work was not a cause of the disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">This factual finding is supported by Dr. Seides\u2019 report. As it was entitled to do, the commission believed Dr. Seides and gave his findings and conclusions preponderating evidentiary weight. The issue on appeal is whether those findings and conclusions, so weighed, are sufficient to rebut the presumption set forth in Code \u00a7 65.2-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The majority relies on <em>Medlin v. County of Henrico Police, </em>34 Va.App. 396, 542 S.E.2d 33 (2001). In <em>Medlin, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1i\">We, accordingly, hold that evidence that merely rebuts <em>generally </em>the underlying premise of the statute, which establishes a causal link between stress and heart disease, is not probative evidence for purposes of overcoming the presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 407, 542 S.E.2d at 39 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Dr. Seides\u2019 salient findings and conclusions may be stated thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">(1) Patton\u2019s coronary disease was caused exclusively by his multi-vessel coronary atherosclerosis and did not derive from any other cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">(2) Patton\u2019s atherosclerosis did not derive from his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">(3) Patton\u2019s atherosclerosis derived altogether from the non-employment-related factors described in Dr. Seides\u2019 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">In my view, Dr. Seides\u2019 report was not merely a general rebuttal of the statutory presumption, but was, rather, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>specific attribution of Patton\u2019s coronary disease exclusively to non-employment-related factors, satisfying the holding in <em>Medlin </em>and sufficiently supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">I would affirm the judgment of the commission.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
