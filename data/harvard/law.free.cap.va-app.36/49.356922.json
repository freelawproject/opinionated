Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 561, 535 S.E.2d 678 (2000). Appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing <em>en banc </em>was granted and the mandate of the October 17, 2000 opinion was stayed. <em>See Hicks v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 42, 537 S.E.2d 616 (2000). Appellant contends the trial court erred in (1) denying his motion to dismiss the prosecution on the grounds that the barment-trespass procedure violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and (2) denying his motion to remand the case to the general district court for trial before a different judge of that court and require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Commonwealth\u2019s attorney to prosecute the case. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we hold that the barment-trespass procedure employed by the City of Richmond in the instant case violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and, thus, we reverse and dismiss the trial court\u2019s conviction of appellant. The mandate of the October 17, 2000 opinion is hereby vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Whitcomb Court is a housing project owned by the Rich,mond Redevelopment and Housing Authority (RRHA). RRHA sought to \u201cprivatize\u201d the streets surrounding and adjacent to the Whitcomb Court housing project in an effort to make the community safer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 23, 1997 the City of Richmond adopted ordinance No. 97-181-197 deeding the streets surrounding Whitcomb Court to RRHA. The ordinance provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">\u00a7 1. That Carmine Street, Bethel Street, Ambrose Street, Deforrest Street, the 2100-2300 Block of Sussex Street and the 2700-2800 Block of Magnolia Street in Whitcomb Court ... be and are hereby closed to public use and travel and abandoned as streets of the City of Richmond.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">\u00a7 3. The City shall retain a full width utility easement in the streets proposed to be closed by this ordinance----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>\u00a7 4. The City shall retain a full width right of way maintenance easement in the streets proposed to be closed by this ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">\u00a7 5. That the aforesaid streets shall be designated as public highways for law enforcement purposes____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The streets deeded to Whitcomb Court at issue here were those streets surrounding and adjacent to the property owned by RRHA, not those contained within Whitcomb Court. Prior to \u201cprivatization,\u201d these streets were similar to all other streets in Richmond. After the streets were deeded to RRHA, red and white \u201cprivate property, no trespass\u201d signs were posted throughout Whitcomb Court and every \u201chundred feet on each block,\u201d informing the public that \u201cthese streets are privatized and all the property is privatized, no trespass.\u201d The signs were \u201capproximately 18 inches to almost 24 inches by about 12 inches.\u201d However, the streets were not gated, barricaded, or otherwise closed or restricted only to Whitcomb Court traffic. The streets remained open to vehicular traffic, and the sidewalks were open to access by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">After the streets were deeded to RRHA, RRHA adopted a barment-trespass procedure to prevent any \u201cunauthorized persons\u201d from entering the property. On November 13, 1998 the RRHA\u2019s Director of Housing Operations authorized</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">each and every sworn officer of the Richmond Police Department to enforce the trespass laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia ... [upon RRHA property known as] Whitcomb Court.... [E]ach and every Richmond Police Department officer [is authorized] to serve notice, either orally or in writing, to any person [found on RRHA property] when such person is not a resident, employee, or such person cannot demonstrate a legitimate business or social purpose for being on the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">According to a printed brochure issued by RRHA to the Whitcomb Court residents, \u201cunauthorized persons,\u201d who are subject to the barment proceedings, are all non-residents who cannot demonstrate that they are on the premises \u201cvisiting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>lawfully residing resident, or on the development conducting legitimate business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The police officer makes the determination whether a person is to be barred, determines whether the person is a. tenant or is there at the invitation of a tenant, or whether there is a legitimate reason for being on the property. A person simply has to fail to fit within the category of people whom RRHA has deemed entitled to be on the streets and sidewalks adjacent to the public housing development to be barred. Once barred, the person who returns is a trespasser without regard to whether, on that subsequent occasion, he or she is there on legitimate business or at the invitation of a Whitcomb Court tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Hicks was convicted of trespassing on the property of Whitcomb Court on February 10, 1998 and June 26, 1998, respectively, and of damaging property in Whitcomb Court on April 27, 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 14, 1998, Mrs. Gloria Rogers, the housing manager at Whitcomb Court,- served a written notice on Hicks advising him that he was banned from the Whitcomb Court property. He was \u201cnot to trespass on RRHA property,\u201d and if he was \u201cseen or caught on the premises, [he would] be subject to arrest by the police.\u201d Hicks\u2019 mother, his baby, and his baby\u2019s mother live at Whitcomb Court. After receiving the notice, Hicks twice returned to Whitcomb Court to speak with Mrs. Rogers to seek permission to come back on the property. His requests were denied. On January 20, 1999, Officer James Laino (Laino) observed Hicks walking westbound in the 2800 block of Bethel Street, one of the \u201cprivatized\u201d streets adjacent to Whitcomb Court. Laino knew that Hicks was barred from the property. Hicks explained to Laino that he was on the property \u201cbringing pampers to his baby.\u201d During the conversation, a female came out and approached Laino and Hicks. Hicks indicated he was visiting her. Laino issued Hicks a summons for trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Hicks was tried in the general district court without the presence of a Commonwealth\u2019s attorney. The district court judge conducted the questioning of Hicks. Hicks objected to this procedure. The judge struck Hicks\u2019 testimony at the end of the trial and convicted him. Hicks noted an appeal to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Prior to trial in the circuit court, Hicks filed a motion requesting a remand to the general district court for a new trial and an order requiring a Commonwealth\u2019s attorney to be present and to represent the Commonwealth at this new general district court trial. The circuit court denied the motion on the ground that it lacked authority to remand the trial. Hicks also moved to dismiss the charge of trespass on the ground that the RRHA\u2019s trespass policy violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The circuit court denied his motion to dismiss and found Hicks guilty of trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">II. CONSTITUTIONALITY OF RICHMOND ORDINANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Appellant argues that Richmond City Ordinance No. 97-181-197 and the RRHA barment-trespass procedure violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, we must determine whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments are violated by the trespass statute as enforced under authority granted by RRHA to Richmond City police officers to bar people on the streets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>surrounding and adjacent to Whitcomb Court and who do not fit within a narrowly defined group of people. The critical issue is whether the \u201cprivatized\u201d streets and sidewalks are public and as such are a \u201ctraditional public forum,\u201d or whether they are \u201cprivate\u201d and, thereby, a \u201cnonpublic forum.\u201d If they are \u201ctraditional public forum,\u201d then the barment-trespass procedure must satisfy the strict scrutiny requirement that the procedure be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. <em>See Daniel v. City of Tampa, </em>38 F.3d 546 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">A. \u201cPUBLIC FORUM\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The constitutionality of government regulation of First Amendment rights is analyzed under a public fora analysis. <em>See Warren v. Fairfax County, </em>196 F.3d 186, 190 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">The public forum analysis was created to recognize that the government must be able to limit the use of its property to the intended purpose for which the property was created and to limit access to those rightfully conducting business there. Toward that end, the Court has identified at least three types of fora for First Amendment purposes, each subject to a different regime of constitutional scrutiny: the traditional public forum, the designated public forum, and the nonpublic forum. The Court distinguishes between these fora based upon the physical characteristics of the property, including its location, the objective use and purposes of the property and government intent and policy with respect to the property, which may be evidenced by its historic and traditional treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 190-91 (internal citations omitted). Public streets and sidewalks are repeatedly referred to as the archetype of a traditional public forum because they \u201care among those areas of public property that traditionally have been held open to the public for expressive activities and are clearly within those areas of public property that may be considered, generally without further inquiry, to be public forum property.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>States v. Grace, </em>461 U.S. 171, 179, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 1708, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">Wherever the title of streets and parks may rest, they have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions. Such use of the streets and public places has, from ancient times, been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties of citizens. The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but it must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><em>Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, </em>307 U.S. 496, 515-16, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u201cOwnership [of streets and sidewalks] does not always mean absolute dominion.\u201d <em>Marsh v. Alabama, </em>326 U.S. 501, 506, 66 S.Ct. 276, 278, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946) (holding that privately owned streets and sidewalks in a company owned town which are built and operated primarily to benefit the public are traditional public forums that are protected by First Amendment constitutional guarantees). In <em>Grace, </em>461 U.S. 171, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 75 L.Ed.2d 736, the United States Supreme Court addressed the ability of the government to redefine certain public sidewalks in front of the United States Supreme Court Building as a non-public forum. There was no separation, fence or any other indication to persons entering the sidewalks that served as the perimeter of the Court grounds that they entered a non-public forum. \u201cThe sidewalks comprising the outer boundaries of the Court grounds are indistinguishable from any other sidewalks in Washington D.C., and ... [there is] no reason why they should be treated any differently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 103 S.Ct. at 1702. The Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cCongress[, no more than a suburban township,] may not by its own <em>ipse dixit </em>destroy the \u2018public forum\u2019 status of streets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>and parks which have historically been public forums.... \u201d The inclusion of the public sidewalks within the scope of \u00a7 13k\u2019s prohibition, however, results in the destruction of public forum status that is at least presumptively impermissible. Traditional public forum property occupies a special position in terms of First Amendment protection and will not lose its historically recognized character for the reason that it abuts government property that has been dedicated to a use other than as a forum for public expression. Nor may the government transform the character of the property by the expedient of including it within the statutory definition of what might be considered a non-public forum parcel of property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 180, 103 S.Ct. at 1702 (quoting <em>U.S. Postal Service v. Greenburgh Civic Assn\u2019s, </em>453 U.S. 114, 133, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 2687, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981)) (quotation altered to reflect original wording).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">As in <em>Grace, </em>the streets surrounding Whitcomb Court deeded to RRHA were not separated in any manner from the other streets and sidewalks in the area. The sole indication to the public that they have entered a \u201cprivate\u201d street are \u201cred and white signs ... approximately 18 inches to almost 24 inches by about 12 inches ... spaced about every hundred feet on each block\u201d and on each building indicating that \u201cthese streets are privatized and all the property is privatized,, no trespass.\u201d There is no indication to the public until after they enter onto the \u201cprivatized\u201d streets that the streets are any different from the rest of the streets in the city and are now private property. Some of the \u201cprivatized\u201d streets are \u201cprivate\u201d for only a couple of blocks and are public on both ends of the \u201cprivatized\u201d blocks. Thus, although the street signs declare the streets \u201cprivate\u201d and for the exclusive use of residents and those persons there on legitimate business, the streets and sidewalks continue to serve the same functions and are equally accessible to the public as before the City of Richmond passed the ordinance \u201cprivatizing\u201d the streets.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Once a person has entered a \u201cprivatized\u201d street he or she is subject to the barment-trespass procedure. A trespasser who receives a warning is informed that he or she is \u201cnot to trespass upon RRHA property\u201d or \u201cWhitcomb Court.\u201d However, the warning does not inform the person that the streets and sidewalks surrounding the complex are a part of RRHA property.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Because the streets appear no different from other streets in Richmond and serve the same function they did prior to \u201cprivatization,\u201d \u201cwe can discern no reason why they should be treated any differently\u201d from any other street or sidewalk. <em>Grace, </em>461 U.S. at 179, 103 S.Ct. at 1708. The City of Richmond is not permitted to transform the public streets and sidewalks in Whitcomb Court into private, non-public property simply by passing an ordinance declaring them closed, conveying them to another governmental entity, the RRHA, and placing signs along the streets. <em>See Marsh, </em>326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265; <em>Grace, </em>461 U.S. 171, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 75 L.Ed.2d 736. Thus, the streets and sidewalks surrounding Whitcomb Court did not lose their public forum status when the City of Richmond deeded them to the RRHA and put some signs on the street indicating they were now private property. Hence, the barment-trespass procedure must satisfy the rigors of strict scrutiny to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Commonwealth argues that our prior decisions in <em>Collins v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 443, 517 S.E.2d 277 (1999), and <em>Holland v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 67, 502 S.E.2d 145 (1998), allow housing authorities to restrict access to their property and designate police officers to serve barment notices and arrest persons trespassing on housing authority property. We have previously approved a process by which police officers may be designated as agents of a housing authority to serve barment notices on persons trespassing on housing authority property, <em>see Collins, </em>30 Va.App. at 449, 517 S.E.2d at 280; <em>Holland, </em>28 Va.App. at 70-76, 502 S.E.2d at 146-49. However, what distinguishes this case from those is that Hicks was found guilty of trespass for having gone upon Bethel Street and the adjacent sidewalk, whereas in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number><em>Holland </em>and <em>Collins, </em>the defendants were on the non-public grounds and in the buildings of the housing authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The Commonwealth also contends that we should follow the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Daniel, </em>38 F.3d 546. The <em>Daniel </em>court authorized a housing authority to enforce a no trespassing policy identical to the one at issue in the instant case. However, unlike the instant case, in <em>Daniel, </em>\u201cthe City-owned streets and sidewalks surrounding and intersecting with the Housing Authority property [were] open to the public\u201d and Daniel had \u201cunlimited access to the City-owned streets and sidewalks adjacent to the housing complex.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548 n. 3 <em>&amp; </em>550; <em>see also Walker v. Georgetown Hous. Auth., </em>424 Mass. 671, 677 N.E.2d 1125, 1128 (1997) (calling into question the reasoning of the <em>Daniel </em>court and the applicability of the ruling to streets and sidewalks that were kept \u201copen to the public\u201d). Thus, in <em>Daniel, </em>the no trespassing policy was limited to the non-public forum consisting of the housing authority\u2019s buildings and grounds and did not include the adjacent streets and sidewalks as the RRHA policy does in the instant case. Bethel Street is a public street that was built and maintained with public funds to provide access by the public to that part of Richmond. As with all public streets and thoroughfares, historically and traditionally public streets have served as a locale for the free exchange and dissemination of ideas and have served as an area where citizens can freely and lawfully congregate or move about and exchange discourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The fact that legal title to the streets is transferred from a municipal government to a government agency which owns and operates a public housing development does not change the public nature and character of the streets and sidewalks which provide access to the public to this part of the City. <em>See Marsh, </em>326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.E,d. 265. The City cannot transform the public streets surrounding Whitcomb Court into non-public streets by declaring them closed by ordinance and conveying them to another governmental entity when they continue to serve the same public purpose as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>B. \u201cSTRICT SCRUTINY\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Therefore, the City of Richmond\u2019s and RRHA\u2019s attempt to control access to and movement upon the streets and sidewalks of the city is \u201csubject to strict scrutiny; [it] must be narrowly tailored to serve [the] compelling state interest\u201d of providing safe housing to the development\u2019s residents. <em>Daniel, </em>38 F.3d at 549. The stated goal of the RRHA barmenttrespass procedure is to ensure a safe environment free from criminal activity for the residents of Whitcomb Court. We agree that the City of Richmond has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens and preventing criminal activity. However, it may not, in its endeavor to control crime, pass and enforce a regulation so broad in scope that it unduly restricts or criminalizes innocent constitutionally protected behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The barment-trespass procedure used in this case inhibits a person\u2019s constitutionally protected \u201c \u2018right to remove from one place to another according to inclination\u2019 \u201d and the person\u2019s right to \u201cremain in a public place of his choice.\u201d <em>Chicago v. Morales, </em>527 U.S. 41, 53, 54, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 1857, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999) (quoting <em>Williams v. Fears, </em>179 U.S. 270, 274, 21 S.Ct. 128, 129, 45 L.Ed. 186 (1900)). In <em>Morales, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a city ordinance designed to reduce crime by criminalizing \u201cloitering\u201d violates the Constitution. The Court stated that \u201cit is apparent that an individual\u2019s decision to remain in a public place of his choice is as much a part of his liberty as the freedom of movement inside frontiers that is \u2018a part of our heritage\u2019 or the right to move \u2018to whatsoever place one\u2019s own inclination may direct\u2019 \u201d and the ordinance \u201cbroadly covers a significant amount\u201d of activity that is constitutionally protected. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54, 119 S.Ct. at 1849 (internal citations ommitted). The City of Richmond and RRHA barment-trespass procedure also prevents a person from standing upon the streets surrounding Whitcomb Court without a \u201clegitimate reason.\u201d Thus, it implicates the same concerns addressed in <em>Morales.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The barment-trespass procedure is not limited so as to encompass only those persons whose conduct the City and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>RRHA were seeking to curtail. The procedure is so broad that citizens who merely drive or walk upon one of the \u201cprivatized\u201d streets fall within the defined group of people not authorized by the barment procedure to be upon the streets and sidewalks and, thus, may be deemed guilty of criminal conduct. A citizen need not commit a crime, intend to commit a crime or infringe upon the privacy of the residents of Whitcomb Court to be in violation of the barment-trespass statute and ordinance. The Commonwealth presented no evidence that appellant did anything other than exercise his constitutionally protected right to . walk upon the streets and sidewalks of the City of Richmond. Perhaps, had Bethel Street been gated, barricaded, or physically restricted to traffic where the public was not free to travel, as with gated communities, the street could be considered non-public and not a \u201ctraditional public forum.\u201d But the City can no more \u201cclose\u201d the streets in Whitcomb Court and leave them open to the public, thereby purporting to make them a \u201cnon-public forum,\u201d than it could declare \u201cclosed\u201d all streets in Richmond\u2019s troubled neighborhoods and residential areas, thereby denying access to all citizens except the residents and their invitees and others specifically approved. Neighborhood streets, such as those in Whitcomb Court, are public streets, paid for and maintained with public funds, for the use and benefit of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">While a public entity can restrict the use of public property or buildings to those who are using the property for its intended \u201cnon-public\u201d purpose, such as an office building, it cannot restrict public property that is considered a \u201ctraditional public forum,\u201d such as a street or sidewalk, that is being used in a lawful way and for a lawful purpose that is constitutionally protected. See <em>United States v. Kokinda, </em>497 U.S. 720, 727, 110 S.Ct. 3115, 3120, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990) (holding that sidewalk in front of a post office \u201cconstructed solely to provide for the passage of individuals engaged in postal business\u201d is a non-public forum). Here, in effect, the City and RRHA, by converting the streets and sidewalks to private property, attempted to confer upon RRHA the same rights as a private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>property owner who may restrict everyone from coming upon the private property owner\u2019s property except the owner\u2019s tenants and the tenants\u2019 invitees, regardless of whether the invitees had done anything unlawful. However, the United States Supreme Court has held that even a private entity which owns the entire town cannot close the streets to deny the public their constitutional rights. <em>See Marsh, </em>326 U.S. at 506, 66 S.Ct. at 276. Therefore, the barment-trespass procedure at issue here is not narrowly tailored to encompass only those activities the RRHA sought to exclude from their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Thus, we hold that Richmond\u2019s barment-trespass procedure, when strictly scrutinized, is not narrowly tailored to serve the government\u2019s compelling interest, the standard that must be met when the government attempts to regulate activity in a \u201ctraditional public forum.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The RRHA\u2019s privatization effort unconstitutionally infringes upon a citizen\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to lawfully be present in a public place. Accordingly, we hold that city ordinance No. 91-181-197 as enforced through the barment-trespass procedure is unconstitutional and-we reverse and dismiss appellant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed in part, reversed and remanded in part.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-9\">.

Appellant's barment from Whitcomb Court is not related to his damaging property at Whitcomb Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">. The Commonwealth argues that appellant is barred from contesting the validity of the barment-trespass procedure because he did not present a defense to his presence on RRHA property or challenge his original barment notice or the barment-trespass procedure itself prior to being charged with trespass on January 20, 1999. Therefore the Commonwealth argues that he is improperly collaterally attacking his conviction. We disagree. Prior to his trial for this trespass charge, appellant challenged the barment-trespass procedure as unconstitutional. At trial, appellant\u2019s defense to the trespass charge was that the barment-trespass procedure violated his constitutional rights and, thus, he could not be guilty of trespass because he had a constitutional right to be walking on Bethel Street. Thus, we End that appellant timely raised the issue of the validity of the barment-trespass procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">. In his petition for appeal, appellant also requested this Court to set aside the order revoking his suspended sentences on his two prior convictions for trespassing at Whitcomb Court and his prior conviction for damaging property at Whitcomb Court.

Therefore, we remand this case to the circuit court to reconsider the revocation of his suspended sentences in light of our holding in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\">. Because we reverse on the failure of the City of Richmond to establish the constitutionality of the barment-trespass procedure, we do not address appellant\u2019s arguments regarding errors in the general district court proceedings or whether the barment-trespass procedure violated the procedural due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>HUMPHREYS, Judge, with whom WILLIS, BRAY, BUMGARDNER and AGEE, JJ.,</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">I. <em>Constitutional Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">I must respectfully dissent from the majority opinion, which holds that the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority\u2019s (RRHA) barment proceeding and trespass policy violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">First, I do not agree that Hicks properly raised his objections to RRHA\u2019s barment procedures. Hicks concedes that the RRHA provided him with a barment notice on April 14, 1998. This barment notice was issued to Hicks pursuant to a valid ordinance adopted by the City of Richmond, both requiring and authorizing RRHA to take any necessary steps to \u201cgive the appearance that the closed streets ... are no longer public streets and that they are in fact private streets.\u201d The notice, which Hicks signed in acknowledgment of its receipt, specifically prohibited Hicks from entering onto RRHA premises for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Subsequently, on at least one occasion, Hicks approached the housing manager for the Whitcomb Court property, Gloria Rogers, to request that he be able to visit his mother, \u2022 a resident of that property. Rogers denied his request and again informed him that he was barred from entering the property pursuant to the barment notice. However, other than speaking to Rogers, Hicks took no steps to appeal his barment through official channels of the Authority or the courts. Instead, he ignored the barment and was arrested and convicted for trespassing, as well as for damaging property in Whitcomb Court, prior to his arrest for the incident of January 20, 1999. In addition, for this prior trespass conviction, Hicks received a suspended sentence on the court-ordered condition that he keep the peace and be of good behavior for three years. However, Hicks continued to ignore the barment notice, as well as the court order, and trespassed again on January 20, 1999. Now, for the first time, in connection with his conviction for the January 20, 1999 trespass, Hicks argues that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>barment violated his constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Hicks\u2019 arguments in this regard represent an untimely and improper collateral attack on his barment status. We have held, in the context of an habitual offender adjudication, that where a defendant has knowledge of an underlying order, never appeals the order, and subsequently violates the order, he cannot attack the underlying order in the new proceeding. <em>See Morgan v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 645, 507 S.E.2d 665 (1998). We based our decision in <em>Morgan </em>on <em>Mays v. Harris, </em>523 F.2d 1258 (4th Cir.1975), wherein the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that an habitual offender who failed to appeal the underlying conviction, could not, with impunity, choose to ignore the adjudication and resulting injunction \u201cfor, ... \u2018in the fair administration of justice, no man can be judge in his own case.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1259 (quoting <em>Walker v. Birmingham, </em>388 U.S. 307, 321, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 1832, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210 (1967) (holding that a party can be held in contempt of court for violating an injunction, even if the injunction was invalid under the Federal Constitution)).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">I believe the principle advanced in <em>Walker, Mays </em>and <em>Morgan </em>is equally applicable to this case. Here, Hicks was barred from the property pursuant to authority granted RRHA by ordinance which, in turn, provided an administrative procedure for contesting such barment. Hicks had knowledge of his barment from the property, he had been previously convicted of trespassing on the property prior to his trial for the trespassing incident of January 20, 1999, and in conjunction with that conviction, he had been ordered by the court to maintain good behavior for three years. Despite the opportunity presented by the prior court proceedings, as well as the availability of an administrative appellate procedure, Hicks raised no objection to the propriety of the barment until his trial for the January 20, 1999 incident. Pursuant to the principles set forth in the above-cited cases, I do not believe Hicks should be allowed to have bypassed \u201corderly judicial review of [the barment and his prior trespassing convictions] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>before disobeying [them].\u201d <em>Walker, </em>388 U.S. at 320, 87 S.Ct. at 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">I would also reject Hicks\u2019 challenges to the constitutionality of RRHA\u2019s policy. \u201cIn assessing the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance, courts must presume that the legislative action is valid. Consequently, the burden is on the challenger to demonstrate the constitutional defect.\u201d <em>Coleman v. City of Richmond, </em>5 Va.App. 459, 462, 364 S.E.2d 239, 241 (1988). I would hold that Hicks failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Hicks essentially argues, on brief and orally, that because the streets of Whitcomb Court were once public streets and sidewalks owned by the City of Richmond, any statute restricting his presence thereon is unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. Hicks further alleges that because the policy is overbroad and vague, it impinges upon his First Amendment guarantees of free speech and implied guarantee of free association, as well as his Fourteenth Amendment due process protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u201c[G]enerally, a litigant may challenge the constitutionality of a law only as it applies to him or her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 364 S.E.2d at 241. \u201cThe traditional rule is that a person to whom a [policy] may be constitutionally applied may not challenge that [policy] on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the Court.\u201d <em>New York v. Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 769, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3360, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982). Yet,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-7\">[w]hat has come to be known as the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine -is one of the few exceptions to this principle and must be justified by weighty countervailing policies. The doctrine is predicated on the sensitive nature of protected expression ... [and][i]t is for this reason that we have allowed persons to attack overly broad statutes even though the conduct of the person making the attack is clearly unprotected and could be proscribed by a law drawn with the requisite specificity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-8\"><em>Id. </em>The United States Supreme Court has also allowed a facial attack on the grounds of vagueness even though the litigant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>own speech was unprotected. <em>See Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Nevertheless, \u201cwhere conduct and not merely speech is involved, ... the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the [policy\u2019s] plainly legitimate sweep.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 770, 102 S.Ct. at 3348. This distinction is ignored by the majority. \u201cWe have never held that a [policy] should be invalid on its face merely because it is possible to conceive of a single impermissible application____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771, 102 S.Ct. at 3348. Instead, \u201c[i]n a facial challenge to the overbreadth and vagueness of a law, a court\u2019s first task is to determine whether the enactment reaches a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.\u201d <em>Houston v. Hill, </em>482 U.S. 451, 458, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2508, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">A policy will be deemed unconstitutionally overbroad if it is \u201cone that is designed to burden or punish activities which are not constitutionally protected, but the [policy] includes within its scope activities which are protected by the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Parker v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 681, 690, 485 S.E.2d 150, 154-55 (1997). A policy will be deemed unconstitutionally vague if \u201cit does not define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Santillo v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 470, 482, 517 S.E.2d 733, 739 (1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">It is axiomatic that in making such a determination, an appellate court should refrain from speculation outside of the record before it. Here, contrary to Hicks\u2019 argument, the policy clearly does not bar individuals from freely associating with their friends or loved ones living on RRHA property, nor does it prohibit persons from exercising free expression. Further, the policy does not automatically delineate every nonresident who uses a sidewalk owned by RRHA to be a trespasser, as suggested by the majority. Instead, it merely authorizes the Richmond police, as agents of the RRHA, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ban persons from the property who enter upon the property without permission from a resident or the RRHA. Significantly, any unauthorized individuals are not automatically arrested, but they are warned that they are not to enter the property in the future.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, those who have been formally banned from the property are not without recourse and can request, through the proper RRHA channels, to have the ban removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Thus, I would consider this policy as a \u201cparadigmatic case of [one] whose legitimate reach dwarfs its arguably impermissible applications.\u201d <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. at 773, 102 S.Ct. at 3348. Under these circumstances, I would find that the policy is not \u201csubstantially overbroad\u201d and/or vague and that \u201cwhatever overbreadth [or vagueness] may exist should be cured through a case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied.\u201d <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 615-16, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2918, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The majority has found that the Whitcomb Court property is a traditional public forum simply because the property in question is a sidewalk adjoining a street constructed and once owned by the City of Richmond. However, neither the evidence in this record nor the precedents of the United States Supreme Court compel such a finding. I agree that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has adopted a forum analysis as a means of determining when the Government\u2019s interest in limiting the use of its property to its intended purpose outweighs the interest of those wishing to use the property for other purposes. Accordingly, the extent to which the Government can control access depends on the nature of the relevant forum.\u201d <em>Paff v. Kaltenbach, </em>204 F.3d 425, 431 (3rd Cir.2000) (citing <em>Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3448, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>(1985)). However, \u201c[w]hen the relevant public property is determined to be a \u2018non-public forum,\u2019 rather than an \u2018open forum\u2019 or a \u2018designated forum,\u2019 the government has greater freedom to restrict speech.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">A traditional public forum is property which has the physical characteristics of a public thoroughfare, which has the objective use and purpose of open public access or some other objective use and purpose inherently compatible with expressive conduct, and by which history and tradition has been used for expressive conduct. <em>See Warren v. Fairfax County, </em>169 F.3d 190, 198 (4th Cir.1999) (Murnaghan, J., dissenting), <em>adopted and incorporated by reference by the majority in Warren v. Fairfax County, </em>196 F.3d 186, 191 (4th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>As the majority also correctly points out, a sidewalk adjoining a public street will generally fall into this category. <em>See Frisby v. Schultz, </em>487 U.S. 474, 481, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2500-01 (1988). However, the sidewalk at issue here is not the \u201cquintessential\u201d public sidewalk which has been \u201cimmemorially held in trust for the use of the public,\u201d or which has been traditionally \u201cused for public assembly and debate, the hallmarks of a traditional public forum.\u201d <em>See Frisby, </em>487 U.S. at 480-81, 108 S.Ct. at 2500; <em>see also United States v. Grace, </em>461 U.S. 171, 179-80, 103 S.Ct. 1702, 1709, 75 L.Ed.2d 736 (1983) (instructing that it is incorrect to assert that every \u201cpublic sidewalk\u201d is a public forum).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">While it is true that the City of Richmond cannot transform public streets and sidewalks into private, non-public property simply by passing an ordinance declaring them private or closed property, this is but one factor to consider in determining the nature of the sidewalks at issue. <em>See Marsh v. Alabama, </em>326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946); <em>see also United States v. Kokinda, </em>497 U.S. 720, 727, 110 S.Ct. 3115, 3120, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990). Moreover, contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, \u201c[t]he mere physical characteristics of the property cannot dictate forum analysis.\u201d <em>Kokinda, </em>497 U.S. at 727,110 S.Ct. at 3115. Instead, we must also consider the location and purpose of the sidewalk, in order to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>its character as public or private. <em>See id. </em>at 728-29, 110 S.Ct. at 3115.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">I agree with the majority that a \u201ccritical issue\u201d is also whether the privatized streets continue in their previous character as a traditional public forum. However, contrary to the majority, I would find that neither the purpose, the treatment, nor the physical characteristics of the Whitcomb Court sidewalks support the majority\u2019s conclusion that they fall within the parameters of a traditional public forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">First, the Whitcomb Court property, including its streets and sidewalks, has been deeded from the City to the RRHA. Although ignored by the majority, a condition for the closure of the streets by the City required RRHA to \u201cmake provisions to give the appearance that the closed streets, particularly at the entrances, [were] no longer public streets and that they [were] in fact, private streets.\u201d In order to meet this requirement, although the streets and sidewalks of the development were not physically barricaded, RRHA posted red and white signs, \u201capproximately 18 inches to almost 24 inches by about 12 inches\u201d in size, on each side of the buildings, as well as on the streets of the property, on each block, about every 100 feet. These signs clearly indicated that the street and sidewalks had been privatized and that trespassing was prohibited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record further indicates that RRHA held meetings with residents and provided pamphlets explaining the privatization. The pamphlet encouraged residents to explain the privatization to their neighbors and guests in order to facilitate the change. Finally, for at least a year prior to Hicks\u2019 present arrest, RRHA and the Richmond police treated the property as private property by determining whether visitors were authorized and by banning unauthorized persons from the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>In concluding that \u201c[t]here is no indication to the public until after they enter onto the \u2018privatized\u2019 streets that [they] are any different from the rest of the streets in the city,\u201d the majority both improperly assumes a fact-finding function outside the record in this case and improperly shifts the burden of proof concerning the character of the forum away from Hicks. A review of the character of the \u201cprivatized\u201d streets and sidewalks, restricted to the record of the trial court, reveals that other than exceptions for school buses, delivery trucks, city service vehicles and law enforcement, there is absolutely no evidence that the streets and/or sidewalks of the Whitcomb Court property remained open to a public flow of traffic, as the majority suggests. Furthermore, even though sidewalks \u201cmay be open to the public, [that] fact alone does not establish that such areas must be treated as traditional public fora under the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Kokinda, </em>497 U.S. at 729,110 S.Ct. at 3115.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Thus, given the clear intent by the City of Richmond to remove the streets of Whitcomb Court from the category of thoroughfares available for use by the general public and given the notice to the residents and the public at large in the form of repeated and obvious signage that the streets and sidewalks were no longer \u201cpublic\u201d in character, I would hold that the restrictions imposed by RRHA must be analyzed under the test for non-public property: they must be reasonable and \u201cnot an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker\u2019s view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730, 110 S.Ct. at 3115 (citing <em>Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">There is no dispute here that the stated purpose for RRHA\u2019s trespassing enforcement effort, which was to \u201cprovide a safe environment for citizens in a place often used to sell drugs,\u201d is reasonable and legitimate. In fact, we have previously upheld the delegation of authority by a public housing complex to police officers to bar unauthorized individuals from the property for the purpose of preventing crime, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>protecting property and preserving the peace. <em>See Holland v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 67, 502 S.E.2d 145 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Moreover, as stated above, the record is clear that a person is not considered \u201cunauthorized\u201d until he or she has entered the property without the permission of either a resident or an RRHA official. Even then, and notwithstanding numerous and obvious signs that acquaint anyone able to read that the character of the property is private and not public, unless the individual is engaged in some type of criminal activity, that individual is not formally barred from the property until after he or she has been warned not to enter the property without permission. Once an individual is barred from the property, a procedure is available to request removal of the barment. Further, Hicks produced no evidence that either RRHA or the Richmond police have ever banned any form of expression based on its content.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Based on this record, I would find that any potential interference with an individual\u2019s right of expression and/or intimate association -with residents of Whitcomb Court, or to \u201cloiter\u201d on the property, which, although publicly owned, in my judgment constitutes a \u201cnon-public forum\u201d for First Amendment purposes, is reasonable, limited and justified to achieve the legitimate purpose of protecting these residents from crime. Therefore, I would hold that Hicks\u2019 conduct at the time of his arrest \u2014 namely, knowingly trespassing on private property\u2014 was not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">II. <em>Motion to Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Because I would hold that RRHA\u2019s barment \"proceeding and trespass policy with respect to Hicks do not violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments, I would address the remaining assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Hicks argues that he was entitled to have his case remanded to the general district court for a new trial before another judge because the judge of that court who presided over the initial trial improperly assumed the role of a prosecutor by \u201ccross-examining\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The Supreme Court of Virginia has long held that there is no inherent damage to a fair trial when a judge asks questions of a witness.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">[A] trial judge [may] ask questions of a witness either on his examination in chief or on cross-examination. The practice is common and perfectly permissible. Indeed, there are times when it is his duty to do so. He is not to sit there and see a failure of justice on account of omissions to prove facts plainly within the knowledge of a witness, but the character of his questions should not be such as to disclose bias on his part, or to discredit the truthfulness of the witness. \u201cFor the purpose of eliciting evidence which has not otherwise been brought out, it is proper for the judge to put the questions to a witness either on his examination in chief or on his cross-examination, and where anything material has been omitted, it is sometimes his duty to examine a witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-6\"><em>Mazer v. Commonwealth, </em>142 Va. 649, 655, 128 S.E. 514, 516 (1925) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In addition, we have held that \u201cthe trial court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, may permit jurors to submit written questions to be asked of a witness.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 577, 582, 484 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1997). We also noted in <em>Williams </em>that \u201c[t]he function of a jury is to assure a fair and equitable resolution of all factual issues. The jury serves as the final arbiter of the facts, \u2018charged with weighing the evidence, judging the credibility of the witnesses, and reaching a verdict\u2019 in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 484 S.E.2d at 155. This function belongs no less to the court when serving as the fact finder. We need not determine here whether the general district court judge\u2019s questions demonstrated an inappropriate bias or prejudice because the court granted Hicks\u2019 motion to strike the questions as well as his answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">In addition, the remedy provided to any defendant in a criminal case who perceives error on the part of a trial court is to exercise the right to appeal the matter to a higher tribunal. In the context of misdemeanors tried in the district courts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>General Assembly has established a right to a trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A <em>de novo </em>hearing means a trial anew. On appeal, a conviction in the district court is annulled, and a new trial is held in the circuit court. <em>See Ledbetter v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 805, 447 S.E.2d 250 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">While it would clearly be preferable and in its interest for the Commonwealth to be represented by counsel in every case in which it is a party, the General Assembly has declined to mandate such representation. Code \u00a7 15.2-1627(B) recites the duties of Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys and their assistants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This statute only requires Commonwealth\u2019s Attorneys to prosecute felonies and provides that a prosecutor \u201cmay in his discretion, prosecute Class 1, 2 and 3 misdemeanors.\u201d Thus, the General Assembly decided as a matter of policy to place the discretion for the representation of the Commonwealth in misdemeanor cases in the hands of the executive branch rather than the judicial branch of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Hicks relies on the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Ward v. Village of Monroeville, </em>409 U.S. 57, 93 S.Ct. 80, 34 L.Ed.2d 267 (1972), as authority for his argument that a trial <em>de novo </em>does not cure errors committed in a lower court. I find his reliance on <em>Ward </em>is misplaced. In <em>Ward, </em>the Supreme Court addressed a systemic problem of bias inherent in the infrastructure of local mayors\u2019 courts. There, mayors of villages sat as judges in the courts, and a major portion of village income was derived from the collection of these fines. In finding that such a scheme violates the due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>process rights of criminal defendants in the mayors\u2019 courts, Justice Brennan noted that the constitutional infirmity was grounded in the separation of powers doctrine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">Although \u201cthe mere union of the executive power and the judicial power in him cannot be said to violate due process of law,\u201d the test is whether the mayor\u2019s situation is one \u201cwhich would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused.\u201d Plainly that \u201cpossible temptation\u201d may also exist when the mayor\u2019s executive responsibilities for village finances may make him partisan to maintain the high level of contribution from the mayor\u2019s court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 60, 93 S.Ct. at 80 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Hicks does not allege, nor do I find, such systemic bias in the procedural structure of the district courts in the Commonwealth. Thus, assuming without deciding that the questions propounded by the general district court judge constituted error, I would hold that the trial <em>de novo </em>in the circuit court provided an adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">For all of these reasons, I dissent and would affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">. Contrary to the majority\u2019s statement otherwise, Hicks presented no evidence suggesting that the warning does not inform persons that the streets and sidewalks surrounding the complex are part of RRHA property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\">. Officer Llaino testified to the size, number and location of the signs and that the substance of the message on the signs was that \"all the property had been privatized and that trespass[ing was] prohibited.\u201d This evidence was uncontradicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">. Code \u00a7 16.1-136 provides in pertinent part: \"Any appeal taken under the provisions of this chapter shall be heard <em>de novo </em>in the appellate court and shall be tried without formal pleadings in writing; and, ... the accused shall be entitled to trial by a jury in the same manner as if he had been indicted for the offense in the circuit court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\">.
