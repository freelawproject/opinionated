Blaustein, appeals the denial of benefits by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission for an injury she suffered on February 5, 1997, while on her way to work. Blaustein contends the commission erred in finding that her injury did not arise out of her employment under an exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">The Mitre Corporation, a federally funded research and development center, hired Blaustein as a scientist in March 1992. At the time of the accident on February 5, 1997, she resided in Silver Spring, Maryland. From 1992 to 1995, she commuted by car to Mitre\u2019s office in Tysons Corner, Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">In 1995, in accordance with an inter-governmental Personnel Assignment Agreement (IPA), she began working at the National Science Foundation (NSF), an agency of the federal government located in Arlington, Virginia. The IPA Agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>ment for Blaustein originally was to run from November 1995 through November 1996, but was extended for one year through November 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Before the IPA assignment, Blaustein parked her car free of charge at Mitre\u2019s facility in Tysons Corner in a parking lot adjacent to the company\u2019s building. Parking at NSF was either on the street, if available, or for a fee in a public garage under the NSF building. When Blaustein accepted the assignment at NSF, Mitre agreed to reimburse her for either the cost of garage parking at NSF or the cost of Metro subway transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The manner, mode, and route of travel to NSF were solely within the discretion of Blaustein. In making the daily commute to NSF over the fifteen-month period prior to her accident, Blaustein frequently drove from Silver Spring to Arlington and parked her vehicle in the basement of the NSF building. On the days she did not drive to NSF, she drove to the Wheaton Metro station, parked her car in the Metro parking lot or on the public street, and took the subway to NSF. She was reimbursed for the parking fee at the NSF garage for the days she drove, and for the Metro fare on the days she took the subway. She received neither mileage nor gasoline costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">After taking the NSF assignment, Blaustein maintained her office at the Mitre building. She only spent one or two days per month at the Mitre facility, but maintained daily contact with her Mitre colleagues both over the telephone and by email. Blaustein typically worked on some Mitre-related tasks while working at NSF, in addition to attending her NSF related responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">On the morning of February 5, 1997, Blaustein left her home in Silver Spring to travel to work at NSF. She drove approximately one mile to the Wheaton Metro station and parked her car on a residential street. While crossing at a public intersection on her way to the subway station, she was struck by an automobile. She was taken to the hospital where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>she began treatment for her injuries. The extent of her injuries is not at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Blaustein filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim against Mitre Corporation and their workers\u2019 compensation carrier, Travelers Indemnity Company, seeking benefits for the injury. An evidentiary hearing was held before a deputy commissioner on September 13, 1999, and he issued an opinion on December 1, 1999. The deputy commissioner found the \u201cspecial errand\u201d exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule applied and awarded disability and medical benefits to Blaustein.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Mitre and Travelers requested review before the full commission on three issues: (1) whether Blaustein was an employee of Mitre at the time of her accident; (2) whether Blaustein\u2019s accident arose out of and in the course of her employment under an exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule; and (3) whether Blaustein was entitled to temporary total disability benefits. In its opinion dated November 15, 2000, the full commission found Blaustein to be an employee of Mitre; however, it ruled the accident did not fall within an exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule and, therefore, denied benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Blaustein appealed to this Court on the sole issue of whether her accident fell within an exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">Whether an injury arises out of and in the course of employment involves a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Norfolk Community Hosp. v. Smith, </em>33 Va.App. 1, 4, 531 S.E.2d 576, 578 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">An employee may recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits when the injuries result from an event \u201carising out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 employment. Generally, an injury sustained by an employee while \u201ccoming and going\u201d to work does not arise out of or in the course of the claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>employment and is not compensable. <em>Sentara Leigh Hosp. v. Nichols, </em>13 Va.App. 630, 636, 414 S.E.2d 426, 429 (1992) <em>(en banc); see also </em>Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 13.01 (2000) (\u201cgoing to and from work is covered only <em>on the employer\u2019s premises\u201d). </em>This general rule, also known as the \u201cpremises\u201d rule, has three exceptions: (1) where the means of transportation are provided by the employer or the time consumed by travel is paid for and is included in the employee\u2019s wages; (2) where the way used to and from employment is the sole and exclusive means of ingress and egress; and (3) where the employee is engaged in some duty or task in connection with his or her employment, i.e., when the employee is on a special errand. <em>Sentara, </em>13 Va.App. at 636, 414 S.E.2d at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Blaustein contends the first and third exceptions apply to her accident. We disagree and find that her injury did not arise out of or in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>A. The Transportation Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Blaustein contends that because Mitre reimbursed her for her subway fare on the days she took the Metro to NSF, her accident, which occurred while she was traveling from her home to a Metro station on her way to NSF, is compensable under the \u201ctransportation\u201d exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule. We disagree and find Blaustein\u2019s injury does not fall under the \u201ctransportation\u201d exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The issue raised in this case is one of first impression in Virginia. Earlier cases addressed the right to compensation as a result of an injury sustained by an employee being transported to and from a place of employment in a vehicle furnished or driven by the employer. In <em>Scott v. Willis, </em>150 Va. 260, 142 S.E. 400 (1928), for example, the employer was required by the employment contract with the employee to provide transportation for the employee to and from his home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>each day. The employee had exited the employer\u2019s truck and began to cross the highway to his home, which was two blocks away. An oncoming car struck the employee as he crossed the road. The employer contended that benefits should not be awarded because the employee had left the truck. The Virginia Supreme Court disagreed and held the accident arose out of and in the course of the claimant\u2019s employment based on the employment agreement between the parties. <em>See also Bristow v. Cross, </em>210 Va. 718, 173 S.E.2d 815 (1970) (employee injured while being transported in employer\u2019s truck); <em>Hann v. Times-Dispatch Pub. Co., </em>166 Va. 102, 184 S.E. 183 (1936) (same); <em>Boyd\u2019s Roofing Co. v. Lewis, </em>1 Va.App. 93, 335 S.E.2d 281 (1985) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Barnard, </em>236 Va. 41, 372 S.E.2d 369 (1988), the Virginia Supreme Court extended compensation to situations where the employer \u201cagrees to provide the employee transportation by company vehicle or public conveyance; or to pay the employee wages or salary for the time spent in travel required by the work; or to reimburse the employee expenses incurred in the operation of his own vehicle in the performance of his duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 372 S.E.2d at 372-73. <em>See also Cardillo v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 U.S. 469, 482-83, 67 S.Ct. 801, 809-10, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (1947) (\u201cWhere there is that obligation [to provide transportation], it becomes irrelevant in this setting whether the employer performs the obligation by supplying its own vehicle, hiring the vehicle of an independent contractor, making arrangements with a common carrier, reimbursing employees for the use of their own vehicles, or reimbursing employees for the costs of transportation by any means they desire to use.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The principles to be derived from <em>Scott </em>are based primarily on contract principles. In <em>Scott, </em>the \u201ccontract of employment provided that [Scott] was to receive free transportation to and from his home ... and the place where he was required to work.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>150 Va. at 263, 142 S.E. at 400. Based on the contract, the Virginia Supreme Court found the right to compensation well established, stating, \u201cin view of the contract of the employer to transport the claimant back to his home, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the injury occurred during the transportation, it arose out of and in the course of his employment, and is, therefore, compensable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265, 142 S.E. at 401; <em>see also Cardillo, </em>330 U.S. 469, 67 S.Ct. 801, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (through a union contract, employer had agreed to pay claimant\u2019s full transportation expenses to and from work); <em>Katz v. Katz, </em>137 Conn. 134, 75 A.2d 57, 58 (1950) (employer agreed to transport claimant home each night); <em>Sihler v. Lincoln-Alliance Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>280 N.Y. 173, 19 N.E.2d 1008, 1008 (1939) (employer agreed to ensure that claimant \u201cgot home safe\u201d if claimant would agree to stay and work overtime).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In rejecting the employer\u2019s contention in <em>Scott </em>that the contract to provide transportation did not extend coverage to the moment in time when the worker was leaving the vehicle provided by the employer, the Virginia Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADV\">To sustain [the employer\u2019s] contention would be too narrow a construction of the act, which is everywhere liberally construed in favor of the employee. It is also too narrow a construction of the evidence in this case____It could hardly be doubted, we think, that if the injury had occurred while the claimant was approaching the automobile for the purpose of commencing his journey, either to his work or to his home or while in the act of boarding it, that this would be compensable. It is difficult to fix the precise moment at which liability in such a case would cease that is, the very instant when the homeward journey is ended; and in this case, under the facts, the question is very close____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\"><em>Scott, </em>150 Va. at 266, 142 S.E. at 401. Under the contract in <em>Scott, </em>\u201cthe transportation of [the] claimant to his home was not completed until he had reached a point which exempted him from the risks incident to that particular journey.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">In addition to employing contract principles in reaching its decision, the Supreme Court analogized the circumstances underlying liability in <em>Scott </em>to those associated with working on the employer\u2019s premises. The premises theory of liability recognizes implicitly that the employer is liable for injuries and attendant risks occurring in places over which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>has control or for harm to the employee caused by risks that it generated in some way.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">[Ejmployment includes not only the actual doing of the work, but a reasonable margin of time and space necessary to be used in passing to and from the place where the work is to be done. If the employee be injured while passing, with the express or implied consent of the employer, to or from his work by a way over the employer\u2019s premises, or over those of another in such proximity and relation as to be in practical effect a part of the employer\u2019s premises, the injury is one arising out of and in the course of employment as much as though it had happened while the employee was engaged in his work at the place of its performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 268, 142 S.E. at 402; <em>see also </em>Larson, <em>swpra, </em>\u00a7 15.01[1] (the rationale behind the transportation exception \u201cdepends upon the extension of risks under the employer\u2019s control\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>The analogy to the employer\u2019s premises operates less effectively in cases such as the one presently before us. As noted by Professor Larson, \u201cit would be undesirable to start the dangerous and unending game of fixing a \u2018reasonable distance\u2019 to which protection is extended.\u201d Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 15.04.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In such cases, to determine liability courts generally look to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>contract that entitled the employee to employer-provided transportation to and from work. <em>State Highway Commission v. Saylor, </em>252 Ky. 743, 68 S.W.2d 26 (1933); <em>Morris v. Hermann Forwarding Co., </em>18 N.J. 195, 113 A.2d 513 (1955); <em>Sihler, </em>280 N.Y. 173, 19 N.E.2d 1008; <em>Oefinger v. Texas Employers\u2019 Ins. Ass\u2019n, </em>243 S.W.2d 469 (Tex.Civ.App.1951); <em>Ogden Transit Co. v. Industrial Commission, </em>95 Utah 66, 79 P.2d 17 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We hold that the contract to provide transportation to Blaustein controls the outcome and that liability in this case is precluded by the terms of the employment agreement, which limited the risks Mitre agreed to assume. Mitre did not agree to provide Blaustein with transportation between her home and NSF. It only agreed to pay for Blaustein\u2019s Metro fare or her costs to park at NSF.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It did not agree to compensate her for the time she spent en route, or to reimburse her for gas, mileage costs, or parking at the Metro station. By contract, Mitre defined the \u201creasonable margin of time and space,\u201d <em>Scott, </em>150 Va. at 268, 142 S.E. at 402, that formed the employment environment. It follows from the limitations Mitre placed on its agreement that Mitre specifically excluded risks that might arise in places and times remote from the specific transportation mode it agreed to pay for, to wit, taking the Metro or parking in the lot adjacent to NSF. Unlike the agreement in <em>Scott, </em>there was no portal to portal employer funded transportation contract between Mitre and Blaustein. The evidence fails to establish in this case an agreement to extend the coverage for injuries occurring on the employer\u2019s \u201cpremises\u201d to the roadway leading to the Metro station. <em>See also Saylor, </em>68 S.W.2d at 27 (transportation obligation fulfilled once employee exited employer\u2019s vehicle across the road from employee\u2019s house where transportation agreement merely consisted of the following: \u201cIf ... the men lived along the road and in the direction of the work to be done, [the employer] would stop for them at the point nearest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>their residence and transport them to the point at which the work at said time was to be done, transporting them back in like manner when the work was finished.\u201d); <em>Morris, </em>113 A.2d at 515 (employee denied compensation for injuries sustained on way home from train station where \u201c[t]he extent of the defendant\u2019s reimbursement of Morris\u2019 traveling expenses was expressly confined by the agreement between Morris and the defendant to expenses on the railroad and in Morris\u2019 work area and omitted commutation between Morris\u2019 home and the New Brunswick railroad station\u201d); <em>Oefinger, </em>243 S.W.2d at 471 (where employer compensated claimant for bus fare only, injuries held not compensable where claimant was injured on way home from bus station); <em>Ogden Transit Co., </em>79 P.2d at 20 (although employer provided claimant with free bus fare, transportation exception did not extend to injuries sustained once employee departed bus and was crossing street on his way home); <em>cf. Barnard, </em>236 Va. at 47, 372 S.E.2d at 372 (accident held compensable where employee was compensated for travel time and was paid a mileage allowance); <em>Sihler, </em>19 N.E.2d at 1009 (injuries held compensable where employee was injured while crossing road after departing employer\u2019s vehicle; court distinguished <em>Sihler </em>from similar case in which compensation had been denied by pointing to a \u201cspecial agreement\u201d to transport employee \u201cto his home\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>B. The Special Errand Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In the alternative, Blaustein contends she was on a \u201cspecial errand\u201d on the days she traveled to NSF and, therefore, her injuries are compensable under the third exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule. We disagree and find that the \u201cspecial errand\u201d exception does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The \u201cspecial errand\u201d exception applies when the employee on his or her way to or from work is charged with some duty or task in connection with his or her employment. <em>Kendrick v. Nationwide Homes, Inc., 4 </em>Va.App. 189, 191, 355 S.E.2d 347, 348 (1987). The special errand rule may be described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>When an employee, having identifiable time and space limits on the employment, makes an off premises journey which would normally not be covered under the usual going and coming rule, the journey may be brought within the course of employment by the fact that the trouble and time of making the journey, or the special inconvenience, hazard, or urgency of making it in the particular circumstances, is itself sufficiently substantial to be viewed as an integral part of the services itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[1].</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We applied the special errand exception in <em>Harbin v. Jamestown Village Joint Venture, </em>16 Va.App. 190, 428 S.E.2d 754 (1993). In <em>Harbin, </em>the claimant was hit by a car and killed while walking to his supervisor\u2019s office, located some distance away from claimant\u2019s normal work site, in order to attend a special meeting. The claimant regularly worked in Virginia<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and had been asked to attend thirteen hearings in the District of Columbia over a several month period. We found that the claimant\u2019s attendance at the meetings was \u201cnot a regular part of\u2019 his job. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 428 S.E.2d at 757. Accordingly, we found the claimant was on a special errand when he was injured while traveling to one of the hearings and, therefore, awarded benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">This case may be distinguished from <em>Harbin. </em>As Professor Larson has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">There is less difficulty [in determining whether an employee is on a special errand] when the trip is one which is made every day, is not in itself unusually long or burdensome, and is not made for the performance of some such brief service ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">* ^ * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>If this judgment is to be made accurately in a close case, several variables must be taken into account. One is the relative regularity or unusualness of the particular journey. If it is relatively regular, whether every day ... or at frequent intervals ... the case begins with a strong presumption that the employee\u2019s going and coming trip is expected to be no different from that of any other employee with reasonably regular hours and place of work____The other two principal variables, however, are the relative onerousness of the journey compared with the service to be performed at the end of the journey.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.05[3].</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Blaustein traveled to NSF almost daily over the fifteen months preceding her accident. Blaustein\u2019s daily commute from her home to NSF was not a special occurrence, nor was she charged with any duty or task while traveling to or from NSF. As the full commission noted, \u201cthere is no evidence that the commute to NSF was significantly onerous, long or burdensome, or different from the commute to Mitre.\u201d Accordingly, we find the \u201cspecial errand\u201d exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">In sum, we find no exception to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule applies in this case. Therefore, we find that Blaustein\u2019s injuries are not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and we affirm the commission\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\">. We do not decide whether Blaustein\u2019s injury would be compensable had she been injured while at the subway station waiting to board the Metro.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">. By treating employer-provided transportation as an extension of the employer\u2019s premises, courts have extended the employer\u2019s liability to employees boarding and alighting from vehicles furnished by the employer. <em>See Ferrara v. City of New Orleans, </em>100 So.2d 896 (La.Ct.App. 1958) (employee injured while alighting from employer\u2019s truck); <em>Gibbs v. Pizzolato, </em>67 So.2d 139 (La.Ct.App.1953) (employee injured as she stepped from employer's vehicle). Liability has also been found to exist when the injury occurs on pathways used by the employee upon exiting the vehicle at the invitation or direction of the employer or with the employer\u2019s acquiescence. <em>See Flanagan v. Webster &amp; Webster, </em>107 Conn. 502, 142 A. 201, 204 (1928) (where employer stopped truck across the road from the employee, this constituted an \u201cinvitation\u201d or \"order\u201d to cross the road to board the employer\u2019s vehicle); <em>Povia Bros. Farms v. Velez, </em>74 So.2d 103, 105 (Fla.1954) (employer\u2019s truck stopped across the road from the claimant\u2019s home, constituting an \"invitation\u201d for claimant to cross road to board truck); <em>Baldwin v. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., </em>234 S.C. 320, 108 S.E.2d 409, 410 (1959) (\u201cWhen the truck, driven by his superior, was stopped for him to board it, it was an implied direction of the employer to him to cross the street and do so; he was no longer master of his movements. The crossing of the street thereby became incidental to the employment....\u201d). In other cases, liability has been extended where a special hazard exists, either associated with or created by the employer-provided transportation. <em>See Katz, </em>75 A.2d at 58 (employer directed employee to walk to corner and take bus home; because sidewalk leading to bus stop was unshoveled, employee was forced to walk on side of road, where he was struck by passing vehicle); <em>Becker v.

Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 15.04 states:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The confusion that characterizes this class of cases could be cleared up by forthrightly following the analogy of exceptions to the main premises rule itself. If one thinks of the employer\u2019s truck as a floating fragment of the premises, the analogy will supply answers in several familiar types of cases. When the employer\u2019s truck pulls up across the street from the plant gate, the most fitting analogy is that of travel between two parts of the premises. Let us suppose that there is an employer-maintained parking lot on the same side of the street where the truck boards and discharges employees. An employee parking his or her own car in that lot would be within the course of employment crossing the street in most jurisdictions. With equal reason the employee crossing between plant gate and truck is in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">However, when the employee approaches the truck from home in the morning, or leaves the truck at night, the analogy just invoked does not apply. For reasons discussed in connection with the main premises problem, it would be undesirable to start the dangerous and unending game of fixing a \"reasonable distance\u201d to which protection is extended. One analogy that might sometimes apply would be that of the special hazard necessarily encountered in the access route. For example, if the employer\u2019s truck stopped at such a point that the employee necessarily had to cross a railroad track just after leaving the truck, the special hazard rule could appropriately be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\"># \u2756 $ si* \u2756 sfc Hs</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Approaching these cases on entering and leaving the employer\u2019s conveyance along the guide lines supplied by specific exceptions to the main premises rule will make for precision and consistency, and will avoid both the vagueness of the \u201creasonable distance\u201d concept and the sweeping and paternalistic implications of the quotation from the Arkansas case with which this section began, which seemed to read into the simple issuance of a free pass, which could be utilized at any time, a complete safe-conduct from the employer's gate, across city streets, throughout the street car journey, and, presumably, to the employee's front door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">.
