Because the record fails to prove a voluntary waiver, we reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-15\">A grand jury indicted Robinson for the felony of aggravated sexual battery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3. On the day of trial, Robinson\u2019s attorney moved for a continuance because a' witness, whom he had expected to appear without a subpoena, was not present. The trial judge denied the motion for a continuance, adding that if he later determined the testimony of the witness would be necessary he would grant a continuance. When the trial judge mentioned a second indictment that had not been served on Robinson, the prosecutor moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>to <em>nolle pros </em>that indictment. The trial judge then ruled that Robinson, who had been taken into custody that day because of the second indictment, would continue \u201con bond,\u201d which we interpret to be a reference to Robinson\u2019s bail status.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">After the clerk announced the style of the case, Robinson\u2019s attorney informed the judge that Robinson had a request. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">[ROBINSON]: Request a jury for trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">[JUDGE]: I think you\u2019re coming in late. The Court\u2019s going to deny that. You\u2019re coming in, you\u2019re here. You\u2019re ready for trial this morning. You asked for a continuance, didn\u2019t get it. Now you want a jury. I\u2019ll give you a jury. I can\u2019t stop your right of trial by jury. But I won\u2019t give you bond. [PROSECUTOR]: Thank you, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">[JUDGE]: What do you want to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\"><em>% </em>\u00cdJ\u00cd sj* s|c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: He\u2019ll try the case and take exception for the record if Your Honor, please that he be held without bond and that he ask for a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am\">[JUDGE]: Well, the reason I do that is motion for trial date is that people don\u2019t show up and this is a delay tactic, but he\u2019s entitled to trial by jury and I\u2019ll give him a date quick as I possibly can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-12\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: I understand that, Judge, but he\u2019s made bond. He\u2019s always come to court and he\u2019s on bond now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-13\">[JUDGE]: I do recall that, but I find that my experience has been when you come in like this, you don\u2019t show up for the date of trial, that\u2019s witnesses inconvenience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-14\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: He\u2019s made every appearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar\">[JUDGE]: All right. Well, let\u2019s go on. If he wants that, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll do it. Any way he wants to go, I\u2019ll go. Make your choice, it\u2019s up to him. I said without bond, I\u2019ll set a higher bond. I don\u2019t believe in holding people without bond. I would set a bond, it would be higher. All right, what do want to do? What is your bond now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>THE CLERK: 5,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">[JUDGE]: What does he want to do with the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: What would be the Court\u2019s favor as far as bond is concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">[JUDGE]: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll wait and see what he wants to do. Probably 25,000 or so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Judge, for the record, he cannot make a $25,000 bond. He has made every court appearance up until now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">[JUDGE]: I agree to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">[DEFENSE ATTORNEY]: Diligently cooperated with myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">[JUDGE]: Well, we\u2019ve been over this once and I\u2019ve set out the Court\u2019s reason. No sense in doing this again. Does he plead guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">During the ensuing arraignment, the following occurred:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">THE CLERK: On your plea of not guilty, you have a right to be tried by Judge, jury, what\u2019s your choice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAo\">[ROBINSON]: Under protest, ask for Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">[JUDGE]: All right. The record will show the situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-13\">After the arraignment, the trial proceeded without a jury. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, Robinson testified. After Robinson testified, his attorney renewed his motion for a continuance to obtain the witness. The trial judge granted the motion and ruled that Robinson \u201ccan stay under the same bond,\u201d noting, \u201cI\u2019m going to let him go. He\u2019s all right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-14\">Two weeks later when the trial resumed, Robinson again testified and presented testimony of two witnesses. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge convicted Robinson of aggravated sexual battery. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-16\">Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution of Virginia provides \u201c[t]hat in criminal prosecutions [an accused] ... shall enjoy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the right to ... an impartial jury.\u201d Although recognizing that the Constitution also provides that the accused may \u201cwaive a jury,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201c[u]nder the Constitution of Virginia the right to trial by jury in criminal cases is guaranteed.\u201d <em>Hodges v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 316, 320, 191 S.E.2d 794, 797 (1972) (citing Va. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8). This constitutional guarantee is reinforced by the following rule of court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">(a) Right to Jury; Duty of Court in Nonjury Trial. \u2014 The accused is entitled to a trial by jury only in a circuit court on a plea of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">(b) Waiver of Jury in Circuit Court. \u2014 If an accused who has pleaded not guilty in a circuit court consents to trial without a jury, the court may, with the concurrence of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, try the case without a jury. The court shall determine before trial that the accused\u2019s consent was voluntarily and intelligently given, and his consent and the concurrence of the court and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney shall be entered of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Rule 3A:13. To protect these guarantees to a jury trial, we have unambiguously held that reversible error occurs unless \u201c[t]he record ... indicated] that the accused made a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of the right to trial by jury.\u201d <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 303, 306, 357 S.E.2d 547, 549 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">At the very outset of the calling of the case, Robinson explicitly requested a jury. The trial judge initially said the request was not timely and denied that request. The record contains no indication, however, that prior to the day of trial Robinson was required to elect whether he wanted a jury or bench trial. In other words, \u201c[t]his is not a case where an accused validly waive[d] a jury trial and then [sought] to withdraw that waiver.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 636, 641, 484 S.E.2d 618, 621 (1997). We, therefore, do not need to determine whether Robinson requested a jury trial \u201c \u2018in due season so as not to substantially delay or impede the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>cause of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 506, 514, 534 S.E.2d 369, 372 (2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The transcript of the incidents at trial provides the exclusive basis upon which we determine whether Robinson waived his guaranteed right to a trial by jury in accordance with the law. It reflects that the trial judge retreated from his initial denial of Robinson\u2019s request for a jury trial and ruled, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a jury .... [b]ut I won\u2019t give you bond.\u201d Reconsidering this ruling, the trial judge retreated further and ruled that Robinson\u2019s bail would not be revoked but that it would be increased. The trial judge agreed with Robinson\u2019s attorney at least three times that Robinson had made every required appearance and that he personally had not demonstrated any risk of flight. Nonetheless, the judge threatened to revoke Robinson\u2019s bail and then threatened to increase the amount of bail. The judge did so only after Robinson requested a jury trial. In this manner, the trial judge hampered Robinson\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right to a jury trial. In view of this patent coercion, we hold that the record fails to establish that Robinson\u2019s election of a bench trial was a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to a jury trial. \u201cWhere there is coercion there cannot be consent.\u201d <em>Bumper v. North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 550, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 1792, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968). The trial judge\u2019s statements establish a clear connection between the jury and bail issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Furthermore, Robinson\u2019s attorney expressly objected to the judge\u2019s rulings and Robinson, himself, objected at arraignment by responding, \u201cUnder protest, [I] ask for [a] Judge\u201d trial. \u201cTo conclude from the[se] statement[s] ... that [Robinson] knowingly and intelligently waived his right to a jury trial ... defies reason.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>4 Va.App. at 307, 357 S.E.2d at 550. The statement, \u201c[u]nder protest,\u201d indicates unequivocally the involuntary nature of Robinson\u2019s request for a bench trial. The judge erred by accepting Robinson\u2019s request, \u201cunder protest,\u201d as a waiver of his right to a jury trial. It neither accords with the Rule 3A:13 standard of \u201cvoluntarily and intelligently given\u201d nor constitutional stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>dards for waiver. \u201c[W]aiver of a constitutional guarantee requires express and intelligent consent by the accused.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>24 Va.App. at 641, 484 S.E.2d at 621. <em>See also McCormick v. City of Virginia Beach, </em>5 Va.App. 369, 372, 363 S.E.2d 124, 125 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The Commonwealth argues that Robinson\u2019s request was merely a stalling tactic. Such a motivation, even assuming its existence, does not render the right to a jury trial in a felony case any less fundamental. We reiterate a concern that we expressed in <em>Wright.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">We recognize that a last minute request for a jury trial may cause hardships and scheduling difficulties, but we also believe that it is not a problem without a solution. Under the scheme mandated by our constitution and augmented by statute and the Rules of the Supreme Court, circuit courts must assume that trial will be by jury unless and until the accused knowingly and intelligently waives that right and the attorney for the Commonwealth and the trial court concur in the decision to forego a jury trial. Unless the circuit courts are willing to accept delay and the inconvenience of rescheduling, they should not transfer to the attorney for the Commonwealth or to defense counsel the sole responsibility to timely determine the need for a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">4 Va.App. at 309, 357 S.E.2d at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">The record in this case, which plainly shows that the trial judge\u2019s threat of bail sanctions caused Robinson to request a bench trial under protest, established a denial of Robinson\u2019s right to a jury trial. Accordingly, we reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
