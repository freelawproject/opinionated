Hughes\u2019 (appellant) parental rights to her two daughters. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-266(A), the circuit court appointed Stephen K. Smith as guardian <em>ad litem </em>to protect the interests of the children. At the May 4, 2000 hearing before the circuit court, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>joined the department in requesting that appellant\u2019s parental rights be terminated. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>also endorsed the final decree terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights under the heading, \u2018We ask for this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u2022 Appellant filed a notice of appeal on June 19, 2000. She did not list the name and address of the guardian <em>ad litem </em>on the certificate. On October 10, 2000, we notified counsel for appellant, counsel for the department, and the guardian <em>ad litem </em>that the record of proceedings in this case had been received from the trial court. In that same notice, in bold print, we advised counsel for appellant to <em>\u201cconsult Part 5A of the Rules </em>[of the Supreme Court of Virginia] <em>for information on filing times and other </em>requirements\u201d and indicated that <em>\u201c[fjailure to comply with the rules may result in various sanctions, including dismissal of the appeal.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Upon filing the opening brief, counsel for appellant included a certificate indicating that he served the department with copies of the brief. The certificate made no reference to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>guardian <em>ad litem. </em>At that time, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>remained a counsel of record in the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u201cNo appeal shall be allowed unless, within 30 days after entry of final judgment or other appealable order or decree, counsel [for appellant] files with the clerk of the trial court a notice of appeal, and at the same time mails or delivers a copy of such notice to all opposing counsel____\u201d Rule 5A:6(a). The notice of appeal must contain a certificate listing all appellees and stating that the notice has been mailed or delivered to all opposing counsel. Rule 5A:6(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Rule 5A:19(e) provides that copies of the opening brief \u201cshall be mailed or delivered to opposing counsel on or before the date of filing.\u201d The term \u201copposing counsel\u201d is defined in Rule 5A:1 as \u201cdepending on the context, \u2018counsel for the appellant\u2019 or \u2018counsel for the appellee.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The term \u201cappellee\u201d is not specifically defined in the rules. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>95 (7th ed.1999), defines appellee as a \u201cparty against whom an appeal is taken and whose role is to respond to that appeal, usu[ally] seeking affirmance of the lower court\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">An appellate court cannot adjudicate an appeal unless all necessary parties are properly before the court. <em>Asch v. Friends of the Community of the Mount Vernon Yacht Club, </em>251 Va. 89, 91, 465 S.E.2d 817, 818 (1996). A necessary party is one whose interests are likely to be defeated or diminished by a successful appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 90, 465 S.E.2d at 818. In <em>Asch, </em>the Supreme Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-10\">\u201c \u2018[a necessary party\u2019s] interests in the subject matter of the suit, and in the relief sought, are so bound up with that of the other parties, that their legal presence as parties to the proceeding is an absolute necessity, without which the court cannot proceed. In such cases the court refuses to enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>tain the suit, when these parties cannot be subjected to its jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 91, 465 S.E.2d at 818 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>representing the interests of the children is an indispensable party to the appeal of the final decree. <em>See Verrocchio v. Verrocchio, </em>16 Va.App. 314, 320, 429 S.E.2d 482, 486 (1993) (\u201cCode \u00a7 16.1-266 \u2018recognizes that the substantive rights and interests of the child are often separate and distinct from those of the other parties to the litigation ... [and] that these rights and interests are best protected by an independent party.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Stanley v. Fairfax County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>10 Va.App. 596, 601, 395 S.E.2d 199, 202 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>242 Va. 60, 405 S.E.2d 621 (1991))). Indeed, in such a case, the interests of the children are paramount. <em>See Wright v. Alexandria Div. of Soc. Servs., </em>16 Va.App. 821, 825, 433 S.E.2d 500, 503 (1993). Where the guardian <em>ad litem </em>has taken a position on behalf of the children in opposition to the appealing party, then the interests of the children are subject to being \u201c \u2018defeated or diminished\u2019 \u201d by the appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">We hold, therefore, that the definition of appellee in Rule 5A:1 includes any indispensable party to the appeal. <em>See Asch, </em>251 Va. at 90-91, 465 S.E.2d at 818. Thus, in the present case, the guardian <em>ad litem </em>constituted an appellee and \u201copposing counsel\u201d for purposes of Rules 5A:6 and 5A:19. The record reflects that appellant failed to provide the guardian <em>ad litem </em>with the notice of appeal or the opening brief. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>was not, therefore, made a party to the appeal. Because the guardian <em>ad litem </em>was an indispensable party, we cannot entertain this appeal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\">. See Rule 1:5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
