Smallwood (appellant) was convicted after a jury trial of the murder of Debra Smallwood (Debra), in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32, and use of a firearm during the commission of that murder, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. He contends on appeal that the trial court erred in 1) declaring a Commonwealth\u2019s witness adverse and permitting the Commonwealth to impeach that witness and 2) admitting into evidence the decedent\u2019s change of beneficiary form. For the following reasons, we reverse these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">This Court reversed and remanded appellant\u2019s initial convictions of murder and use of a firearm. <em>Smallwood v. Commonwealth, </em>No. 1616-96-1, 1998 WL 60908 (Va.Ct.App. Feb.17, 1998). On retrial, the evidence proved the following facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">The police were called to the Smallwoods\u2019 home in the City of Hampton on the afternoon of August 31, 1995. When they arrived, appellant told Officer John Proctor that he was arguing with a \u201cfriend\u201d when she pulled out a gun, placed it against her head, and pulled the trigger. The officer went into the house and found Debra Smallwood dead on the floor of an upstairs bedroom with a gun lying between her legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Another officer began talking to appellant, questioning him about events that afternoon. Appellant said his wife had come home from Kecoughtan High School where she taught, and they were discussing some confusion over luncheon plans. The gun was \u201csitting there,\u201d according to appellant, and his wife \u201cjust grabbed it, and bang.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Later, appellant was taken to the police station for further questioning. He made another statement, saying he and Debra were arguing about his desire to find a ministry in Florida, when she picked up the gun and shot herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Eventually, appellant was arrested. He then claimed that the gun went off during a struggle with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced evidence that appellant had continued his close friendships with at least two women after he married Debra. During the Commonwealth\u2019s direct examination of one of these women, Linda Norton (Norton), the prosecutor asked, \u201c[D]id you have any knowledge about the marriage between the defendant and Debra Smallwood?\u201d Norton responded, \u201cNo, I did not. No, I did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The Commonwealth then asked the court \u201cto declare that Ms. Norton is an adverse witness of the Commonwealth, because of her statement that she made regarding her knowledge of the marriage of the defendant and the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">The trial court ruled the witness proved adverse and \u201cthey [could] impeach their own witness.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury at the end of the examination and again with the general instructions that a witness\u2019 prior statements were not evidence of facts but only evidence affecting the credibility of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">An employee of the Hampton City Schools\u2019 payroll and finance office also testified, over appellant\u2019s objection. She explained she had received a form from Debra a week prior to the killing, requesting a change of beneficiary for her life insurance policy. The form was signed by Debra but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>notarized, so the beneficiary was never changed to appellant as the form requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The form was introduced into evidence over appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to impeach Norton and in admitting evidence of the change of beneficiary form.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">This Court reviews a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion in admitting the evidence. <em>Quinones v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 634, 639, 547 S.E.2d 524, 527 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Generally, a party cannot call a witness simply to impeach her. <em>Maxey v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 514, 521, 495 S.E.2d 536, 540 (1998). In such a case, no evidence relevant to the proceeding would be introduced \u2014 the jury simply would hear the person was not a credible witness, without hearing any substantive information on which they must decide the issue of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Here, however, the Commonwealth had a legitimate reason for calling Norton to the stand. The prosecutor asked her questions regarding her relationship with appellant that were relevant to motive. She testified they were \u201cbest friends\u201d and that she gave him money on several occasions. This relationship continued after appellant married the decedent. Norton also testified she contacted him, not at his home with Debra but at the home of \u201cMrs. Knuckles.\u201d All of this testimony was relevant to the relationship between appellant and his wife as well as a possible motive for murder. The Commonwealth properly called Norton during the case-in-chief as she provided information relevant to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Norton was not called as an \u201cadverse witness\u201d under Code \u00a7 8.01-401,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> despite her friendship with appellant. <em>Whitehead v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 311, 316-17, 522 S.E.2d 904, 906-07 (2000). After Norton began testifying, however, the Commonwealth asked the trial court \u201cto declare Ms. Norton is an adverse witness,\u201d pointing to \u201cher statement that she made [on direct examination] regarding her knowledge of the marriage of the defendant and the victim. I have a good faith belief that that statement is not true.\u201d The prosecutor also argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">[H]er testimony and her statement that she did not know about the marriage is injurious to the Commonwealth\u2019s case, because of her prior statements that were made which go to definitively to the Commonwealth\u2019s idea of motive in this case, the defendant trying to get the victim\u2019s money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">sH # ^ 4*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">Her prior statements were that she had discussed with the defendant for three months in advance of his marriage to Debra in order to get Debra\u2019s money, that he would then divorce Debra and marry her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Clearly, although the Commonwealth used the term, \u201cadverse witness,\u201d the prosecutor actually asked the trial court to find Norton had provided adverse testimony and to allow the Commonwealth to impeach its own witness. The prosecutor never asked for permission to use leading questions during her direct examination of Norton.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">The trial court ruled \u201cthe witness has proved adverse\u201d and, apparently referring to Code \u00a7 8.01-403,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which allows the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>impeachment of a party\u2019s own witness under certain circumstances, explained how further examination of the witness would proceed. The Commonwealth then began to impeach Norton.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u201cAdverse witness\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cadverse testimony.\u201d <em>Whitehead, </em>31 Va.App. at 317, 522 S.E.2d at 907. Norton could be asked leading questions if she was an adverse witness, but she could be impeached by a prior inconsistent statement only when her testimony \u201cprove[d] adverse.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01^03.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">[O]ne is not permitted to impeach his own witness merely because the latter does not come up to his expectation. It is only when the testimony of the witness is injurious or damaging to the case of the party introducing him that the witness can be said to be adverse so as to justify his impeachment. If the testimony is of a negative character and has no probative value, there is no need to discredit the witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-8\"><em>Virginia Electric and Power Co. v. Hall, </em>184 Va. 102, 105-06, 34 S.E.2d 382, 383 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">For example, in <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>this Court found the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to impeach its witness when he changed his testimony, claiming on the stand that he did not see the stabbing and did not know the parties. 6 Va.App. 82, 86, 366 S.E.2d 716, 719 (1988). This testimony, although contradicting the witness\u2019 previous statement to the police, \u201chad no probative value [as it] could not have assisted the trier of fact in determining Brown\u2019s guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The testimony given by the witness did not prove or disprove Brown\u2019s guilt; instead, it added nothing to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>description of the events. <em>See also Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 920-21, 434 S.E.2d 675, 680 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Norton\u2019s testimony that she did not know about appellant\u2019s marriage to Debra in no way damaged or injured the Commonwealth\u2019s case, nor did it help the case. The appellant and the decedent were married; no one disputed that fact. Norton simply claimed she did not know they had married. This testimony had no probative value for the issue of whether appellant, who knew he was married, murdered his wife. The Commonwealth\u2019s case was not damaged by this testimony, although the prosecutor\u2019s expectation was disappointed. The trial court erred when it allowed the Commonwealth to impeach Norton.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">When a trial court errs in allowing the presentation of evidence to the jury, this Court must decide whether that error was harmless. As this issue involves non-constitutional error, if appellant \u201chad a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached,\u201d his convictions will not be reversed. Code \u00a7 8.01-678. The Commonwealth has the burden \u201cto prove that the error was non-prejudicial.\u201d <em>Beverly v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 160, 163-64, 403 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Norton denied having \u201cany knowledge about the marriage between the defendant and Debra Smallwood.\u201d The trial court then ruled her testimony had proved adverse and allowed the Commonwealth to impeach her with a prior statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The Commonwealth asked Norton about her statement to the police in which she said appellant planned to \u201cmarry Debra so that he would have more money to live on, that after he married Debra and after he had gotten a church, that he would then divorce her and [Norton] could be married to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The following exchange then took place between the prosecutor and Norton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-10\">Q. So, ma\u2019am, you told them that you suggested [appellant] marry the victim for her money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>A. Because that\u2019s what they wanted to hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">Q. Ma\u2019am, do you also recall telling the detectives that you thought [appellant] was going to divorce Debra?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">A. No, I don\u2019t remember saying that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">Q. Do you remember telling them again that you thought [appellant] was going to marry her, referring to Debra, and get the money from her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">A. I do not remember saying that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">Q. Do you remember saying that [appellant] was going to get at least forty thousand dollars from Debra?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">A. No. How would I know what amount, if any?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">Q. Do you remember telling the detectives forty thousand because that\u2019s what you owed in your credit cards and your loans?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">A. I have no idea what I owe on my credit cards or loans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKU\">Q. Do you recall telling the detectives that you didn\u2019t believe that [appellant] would actually marry Debra Smith, but in your heart you knew he would, but you didn\u2019t want to believe it, that that would have been the only way he would have been able to get enough money to pay you back, and that hopefully you would get a church, that he would divorce her, and then you would be together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">A. I have no idea. I don\u2019t remember. All I remember was being threatened by them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">Q. Do you remember telling the detectives again, \u201cSo [appellant] was to marry Debra, correct?\u201d And your response was, \u201cCorrect\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-15\">A. I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-16\">Q. And do you remember the question, \u201cAnd marrying Debra because she had what?\u201d And you responded, \u201cMoney\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-17\">A. No, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-18\">Q. Do you recall saying, \u201cThe money that you needed to do what?\u201d And your response was, to clear up your debts and help him survive financially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>A. No, but I do remember after making a tape I called Detective Seals the next day\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">$ $ H* \u00ed* H* ^ #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">Q. Do you recall telling Detective Seals and Detective Meadows that, \u201cOnce Debra and [appellant] were married that he would do what?\u201d And you told them that he would get a church, and after the marriage occurred and he got his church, and he was set up financially, you were asked, What was he going to do? And your response was, I thought he was going to get a divorce. Do you recall saying that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYG\">A. No, I don\u2019t recall saying that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">Q. Do you recall telling the detectives that you assumed that he was getting a divorce so he could be with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUH\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">Q. Do you recall telling Detective Seals and Detective Meadows that you had discussed the entire situation with [appellant], that he was going to get a divorce from Debra Smallwood once married, and set up his church, and that then you would marry him and your debts would be paid off?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">A. No. How would I know what he\u2019s going to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-10\">Q. Do you recall telling Detective Seals and Detective Meadows that you and [appellant] had discussed over the telephone three months prior that he was to be with Ms. Smith and should marry Ms. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">A. No, I don\u2019t remember that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-12\">Q. Do you also recall telling the detectives that you discussed over the phone [appellant] was to marry Ms. Smith so that he could get a church in Virginia; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtN\">A. I know he was looking for a church in Virginia, but I didn\u2019t know he was going to marry Debra.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-13\">Q. Do you recall your response when the detectives asked you, \u201cShe,\u201d referring to Debra, \u201chad the money that was needed by [appellant] to repay your debts so that you would be financially stable again, correct?\u201d And your response was, \u201cCorrect\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>A. I don\u2019t know if she had any money or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">ij; <em>% </em>ifc <em>% </em>ifc i{c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">Q. And do you recall telling the detectives that the money part didn\u2019t bother you as much, but that you were willing to let him marry somebody else so that you could eventually be together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-10\">A. No, I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">Finally, the Commonwealth asked, \u201cMa\u2019am, you previously testified just today that you had no knowledge about this marriage between [appellant] and the victim in this case; is that right?\u201d Norton responded, \u201cThat\u2019s correct. I did not know when they got married, or if in fact they had been married.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">The Commonwealth never called the detectives to testify about Norton\u2019s statements to them nor was a transcript of their interview introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">None of the questions that the Commonwealth asked Norton impeached her testimony that she did not know appellant and Debra had married. Although the Commonwealth asked numerous times about her prior statement to the police, nothing in that statement suggested she knew they actually had married. In addition, the Commonwealth never asked Norton what she and appellant had discussed about the marriage; the prosecutor only asked whether she had made particular statements to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">While the examination at issue did not impeach Norton, the form of the questions exposed the jury to highly prejudicial, hearsay statements allegedly made to the police. Although the trial court told appellant, \u201cI will instruct the jury as the Code also requires that they are not to consider the evidence as [sic] such inconsistent statements except for the purpose of contradicting the witness,\u201d this instruction was not given until the end of the Commonwealth\u2019s examination of Norton.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">Although a jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions, in this situation, where the questioning was continuous, lengthy, and highly prejudicial, instructing the jury at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>the end of the examination and before deliberation does not provide enough protection to appellant. <em>LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983). We cannot say this error did not affect the jury\u2019s verdict, especially as the questions did not actually impeach the witness. <em>See Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Appellant also argues the trial court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce irrelevant hearsay evidence of Debra\u2019s intent to change her life insurance beneficiary. The Commonwealth argues that the evidence was not hearsay. Assuming without deciding that the evidence was not hearsay, we find the trial court erred in admitting this document because its relevance was not established.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In response to appellant\u2019s argument that knowledge of the change of beneficiary was not \u201clinked to this defendant,\u201d the Commonwealth explained that the evidence was \u201cabsolutely admissible because it goes to demonstrate motive.\u201d The trial court found the evidence was offered to establish motive and was admissible. The Commonwealth has never suggested the evidence was relevant to any other issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The Supreme Court has explained when evidence of motive may be introduced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">[Wjhere the motive of a party is a material inquiry in a cause, whether civil or criminal, any evidence which tends in any degree to throw light upon that question is admissible. But before a fact or circumstance is admissible in evidence against a party to show motive, such fact or circumstance must be shown to have probably been known to him; otherwise, it could not have influenced him. For a man cannot be influenced or moved to act by a fact or circumstance of which he is ignorant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-9\"><em>Muttins v. Commonwealth, </em>113 Va. 787, 789-90, 75 S.E. 193, 195 (1912) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The Commonwealth argues, because Debra and appellant were married, knowledge of the policy can be imputed to appellant. However, the case law does not support this presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">No Virginia cases directly address this issue. The Commonwealth cites <em>Mullis v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 564, 351 S.E.2d 919 (1987), but this case is not relevant to the facts here. Mull\u00eds testified and was asked whether she knew about the decedent\u2019s life insurance policy naming her as beneficiary. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 351 S.E.2d at 925. This question was relevant to Mullis\u2019s bias and credibility as a witness, as well as to whether she had a motive for murder. The jury could believe her testimony or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Here, the record contains no evidence that appellant ever confirmed or denied the existence of the policy. He never mentioned an insurance policy in his statements to police, and he did not testify at trial. He did not try to collect any money from the insurance company, and no witness came forward to suggest appellant knew Debra was making him the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Other states have held that prosecutors must establish a defendant probably knew about a spouse\u2019s insurance policy prior to presenting this type of evidence to the jury. <em>See, e.g., People v. Coleman, </em>49 Ill.2d 565, 276 N.E.2d 721, 724 (1971); <em>State v. Leuch, </em>198 Wash. 331, 88 P.2d 440, 442-43 (1939). This rule conforms to the general rule that to introduce evidence of motive, some foundation must be laid to establish the defendant knew about the circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">While the Commonwealth did not need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant knew he was the beneficiary, some evidence of his knowledge needed to be offered to the trial court before allowing the jury to hear about the change of beneficiary. <em>See Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 554, 558, 322 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1984) (acknowledging the test established in Mullins).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Here, no evidence suggested appellant knew about the policy. The fact that he was her husband is not enough by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>itself to establish relevance. The Commonwealth produced no evidence, direct or circumstantial, to establish appellant knew about the proposed change. Although Debra submitted the form less than a week prior to the murder, that circumstance allows only for idle speculation that appellant knew about the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">While motive is a relevant issue, knowledge of the change of beneficiary attempt by the decedent was not attributable to appellant. A proper foundation for the introduction of the evidence was not laid \u2014 nothing indicates appellant had any knowledge of the policy change prior to the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We cannot say this error was harmless. The entire case rested on appellant\u2019s alleged financial motive for killing his wife. The only direct evidence that he would receive any money from her death was the insurance policy. Clearly, allowing the jury to hear about that policy was not harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so inclined.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\">.
