Tooley, </em>297 Or 602, 687 P2d 1068 (1984), that, when a driver\u2019s license is to be suspended, due process requires that the licensee be given notice of and opportunity for a presuspension hearing. Concluding that defendants were not given either notice or opportunity, the court dismissed the charges. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Defendants received orders of suspension from the Motor Vehicles Division (MVD) informing each that, pursuant to <em>former </em>ORS 484.415(1) and (2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> their respective licenses would be suspended for failure to comply with a court order. In the case of Albert, the order of suspension informed her that she could prevent suspension by obtaining a clearance from the court before the effective date of the suspension. She did not seek a clearance, and her license was suspended. Under our recent decision in <em>State v. JoneS, </em>76 Or App 157, 708 P2d 1168 (1985), which involved the same essential facts and the identical issues as those raised by Albert, it was error to dismiss her DWS charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Concerning Steele\u2019s claims, we conclude that, although the suspension of his license was also for failure to comply with a court order, the notice that he received did not contain directions to obtain a clearance in order to prevent suspension. Instead, the reverse side of the order of suspension informed him that he was entitled to a formal hearing in connection with the suspension, if he requested a hearing within 20 days of the date of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>In <em>State v. Jones, supra, </em>we held that <em>Tooley, </em>as clarified, was a statutory case and that the failure accurately to notify a licensee of a statutory right to a hearing invalidates any suspension based on such notice. 76 Or App at 163. Because <em>former </em>ORS 484.415(1) and (2) did not require MVD to provide a pre-suspension hearing, we concluded that <em>Tooley </em>was inapplicable. We reach the same conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The next inquiry is whether Steele was denied due process. This issue is controlled by <em>State v. Cowie, </em>80 Or App 111, 720 P2d 1323 (1986). The only difference between <em>Cowie </em>and defendant Steele\u2019s case is that, in <em>Cowie, </em>the defendant\u2019s license was suspended for failure to appear, <em>former </em>ORS 484.210(2), and Steele\u2019s license was suspended for failure to comply. Because the risk of erroneous deprivation is equally minimal in failure to comply cases, Steele was not entitled to a pre-suspension opportunity to be heard. The trial court also erred as to Steele.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Reversed and remanded as to both defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 487.560 was repealed by Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 978, and replaced by Or Laws 1983, ch 338, \u00a7 598, <em>as amended by </em>Or Laws 1985, ch 16 \u00a7 304; ch 672, \u00a7 6 (now ORS 811.175), effective January 1, 1986.
