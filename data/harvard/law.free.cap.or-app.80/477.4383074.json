His first assignment is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">As to the second, the state concedes that only one minimum sentence may be imposed, pursuant to ORS 161.610, when a defendant is sentenced for separate crimes in a single sentencing proceeding. <em>State v. Haywood, </em>73 Or App 6, 697 P2d 977 (1975). However, the state suggests that we modify the trial court judgment and affirm it as modified. We cannot do that. <em>State v.
