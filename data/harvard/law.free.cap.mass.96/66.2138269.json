Sts. c. 146, \u00a7 38, and that an order of notice upon the petition be issued, returnable at the next term of court. No such order of notice was issued, and no proceedings were had at the next term of the supreme court; and after the adjournment of that term, this action was brought. At November term 1866 of this court, the order of notice was renewed, returnable at May term 1867. The case is now on the docket of this court, and has been so ever since the petition was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">Upon these facts, the judge found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-6\"><em>C.

While the petition for review is pending, and the court has allowed a second order of notice to issue upon it, the obligors have not failed to prosecute it to final judgment. To do so <em>\u201c </em>forthwith \u201d is a stipulation satisfied by doing so within such time as the court having jurisdiction of the petition may order. <em>Exceptions overruled</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
