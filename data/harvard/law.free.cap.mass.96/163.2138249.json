The deed to the defendant was executed bv said Lucy alone, she being therein described as a married <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Woman. There was no written assent by her husband to the conveyance, and he was then absent from the Commonwealth. Her title to the land was by a deed to her in 1842, in which she was described as a married woman, but the conveyance was not made to her sole and separate use. Said Lucy died in August 1863, and her husband died in July 1864. This action was brought in October 1865. The defendant has cut from the land and sold wood and lumber equal to the amount of the consideration of the deed to him and interest thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-5\">Upon these facts, judgment was rendered for the defendant and the plaintiff appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-6\"><em>J.

It was given to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate as a part of the price of a piece of land which the defendant undertook to buy of her, and which she professed to convey to him by deed. She was a married woman, and her husband did not join in the deed. The land was not her separate property, but was conveyed to her during coverture, in the year 1842, before the date of any of the statutes providing for the separate estates of married women. The conveyance to her therefore gave her husband a seisin in her right for her life. Her separate deed was wholly void, and had no validity or effect whatever. <em>Townsley </em>v. <em>Chapin, </em>12 Allen, 476. It did not even give the defendant a license to enter on the land. <em>Concord Bank </em>v. <em>Bellis, </em>10 Cush. 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">The defendant, then, has received nothing of any value whatever for his note. The facts find that he has entered upon the land and taken a large amount of wood; but he acquired no right to do so under the deed. Paying the note would give him no title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
