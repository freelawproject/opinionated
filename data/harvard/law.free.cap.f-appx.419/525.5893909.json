Although Aidas argues that both sentences are substantively unreasonable, he does not argue that the district court made a procedural error in determining his advisory sentencing range. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-53 (5th Cir.2009) (explaining the bifurcated analysis under which this court reviews a sentence). Because Arias did not object to either sentence in the district court, his challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentences is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 792 (5th Cir.2007). Arias\u2019s argument that <em>Peltier </em>is no longer good law and that an objection was not necessary to preserve his challenge is unavailing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-20\">The substantive reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). A discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-21\">Even if Arias is correct in his argument that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically grounded, such does not necessarily render his sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Additionally, this court has rejected the argument that double counting of prior convictions necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-25\">As to Arias\u2019s argument that there existed other factors warranting a lower sentence, Arias advances no persuasive reason for this court to disturb the district court\u2019s choice of sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Although the instant offense was not necessarily a crime of violence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Arias has a history of repetitive criminal conduct, including alien smuggling. The district court\u2019s choice of sentence upon revocation also was within the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>602 F.3d 643, 647 n. 5 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 929 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b548-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
