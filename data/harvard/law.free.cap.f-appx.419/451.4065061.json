Mrs. LeMeilleur sued the insurance company to recover an accidental death benefit from a Group Mortgage Accidental Death Policy (\u201cPolicy\u201d) which her deceased husband held. We AFFIRM the district court because that court properly determined that Mrs. LeMeilleur\u2019s claim fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-17\">Mrs. LeMeilleur and her husband purchased the insurance policy from Monumental. If Mr. or Mrs. LeMeilleur suffered an accidental death, the Policy states it would pay for the balance of the couple\u2019s home mortgage. The Policy also states that Monumental will pay the accidental death benefit when they \u201creceive proof that the Insured died as a result of an Injury.\u201d The Policy defines an \u201cInjury\u201d as a \u201cbodily Injury caused by an accident, independently of all other causes\u201d and further stipulates that the \u201cInjury must be the sole and direct cause of death.\u201d In September 2005, Mr. LeMeill-eur fell and broke his hip, which required surgery. In July 2006, he died. According to Mr. LeMeilleur\u2019s death certificate, his death was due to a heart attack with hypertension as an underlying cause. Mrs. LeMeilleur submitted a claim for a death benefit for Mr. LeMeilleur\u2019s death, which Monumental denied. Subsequently, Mrs. LeMeilleur sued Monumental in Texas state court, seeking to recover the death benefit under the Policy. Monumental removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Then, Monumental moved for summary judgment, arguing that the insurance claim failed as a matter of law because Mr. LeMeilleur\u2019s death was not solely caused by an accidental \u201cInjury.\u201d Before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the district court, Mrs. LeMeilleur argued that she was entitled to the death benefit because her husband\u2019s death was due to an insured accident \u2014 the fall. Mrs. LeM-eilleur supported her assertion with testimony from Dr. Milton Shaw, Mr. LeMeill-eur\u2019s attending physician. The district court disagreed with Mrs. LeMeilleur\u2019s assertions and granted summary judgment in favor of Monumental.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We review a summary judgment order <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court. <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>276 F.3d 193, 195 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cSummary judgment is proper when no issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Questions of fact are viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and questions of law are reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d Deas v. River West, L.P., </em>152 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir.1998). When a case is removed to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction, the Erie doctrine requires federal courts to apply substantive state law when adjudicating state law claims. <em>Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 78, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938); <em>see also Universal Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Pan Am. Ins. Co., </em>450 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1971). Here, Texas contract law applies to LeMeilleur\u2019s claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In Texas, \u201call parts of the contract are to be taken together, and such meaning shall be given to them as will carry out and effectuate to the fullest extent the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Gen. Am. Indem. Co. v. Pepper, </em>161 Tex. 263, 339 S.W.2d 660, 661 (1960). \u201cIt is well established that a contract is to be construed in accordance with its plain language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Policy language that is susceptible to more than one construction should be interpreted strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured. <em>Kelly Assocs., Ltd. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>681 S.W.2d 593, 596 (Tex.1984). But a court may only apply the rules of construction when the meaning of a contract is uncertain. <em>Gen. Am. Indem. Co., </em>339 S.W.2d at 661. In an accidental death benefit claim, the combination of an accident and pre-existing conditions are insufficient for recovery. <em>Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Accident Ass\u2019n v. Hudman, </em>398 S.W.2d 110, 112 (Tex.1965). Instead, an accident must be more than a \u201cproximate cause\u201d of death, it must be the \u201csole proximate cause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Mrs. LeMeilleur argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the Policy\u2019s language concerning pre-existing conditions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mrs. LeMeilleur alleges that her husband\u2019s death was caused by pre-exist-ing medical conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under Mrs. LeMeilleur\u2019s interpretation, this means Monumental is barred from denying Mrs. LeMeilleur\u2019s claim due to her husband\u2019s pre-existing heart and lung problems. Indeed, the Policy prohibits denial of a claim due to pre-existing conditions under certain conditions. But, contrary to Mrs. LeMeilleur\u2019s assertions, Monumental did not deny the claim because of pre-existing illnesses or conditions. Monumental denied the claim because the accident in question, Mr. LeMeilleur\u2019s fall, was not the sole cause of death. Rather, Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>LeMeilleur died due to heart failure and hypertension.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Additionally, the district court did not err by concluding that the evidence failed to create a material question of fact as to whether the fall was the sole cause of death. Mr. LeMeilleur\u2019s death certificate does not reference the fall and lists a heart attack as the immediate cause of death. And, Mrs. LeMeilleur\u2019s own expert, Dr. Shaw, testified that the fall was merely a contributing factor to Mr. LeMeilleur\u2019s death, not the sole cause of death. The connection between the fall and Mr. LeM-eilleur\u2019s death more than nine months later is too attenuated. Mrs. LeMeilleur\u2019s claim fails because there is no evidence to support her contention that the fall was the sole cause of death. Accordingly, the district court did not err by concluding that as a matter of law, Mr. LeMeilleur\u2019s death was not covered under the Policy\u2019s terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">We AFFIRM district court\u2019s summary judgment order in favor of Monumental.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b474-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">. LeMeilleur also submits that the Policy is ambiguous, but she failed to allege this argument before the trial court. Thus, she has waived the argument on appeal. <em>LeMaire v. Louisiana, </em>480 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2007). Plain language rules in this case because under Texas law, mere disagreement over the extent of coverage does not create ambiguity. <em>Travelers Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Pacific Employers Ins. Co., </em>602 F.3d 677, 681 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-12\">.
