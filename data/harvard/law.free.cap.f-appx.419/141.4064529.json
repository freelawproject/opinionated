For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm with regard to these three defendants, but will vacate in part and remand for further proceedings with regard to two additional defendants who were never served with process.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">On February 5, 2008, Jones was assaulted at SCI-Dallas by Woodrow Mitchell, a fellow inmate and non-party. Jones had exited his cell and was proceeding towards the officers\u2019 desk when he was hit in the head by a television, heaved by Mitchell from a higher floor on the cell block. The impact knocked Jones to the ground, and he briefly lost consciousness. Mitchell then returned to his cell, gathering additional material (including a \u201cconverter box,\u201d a shoe, and hot water) to throw onto the prone Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">At least three correctional officers witnessed the incident. Officer Christopher Hashagen was on Jones\u2019s level of the cell block, and was alerted to the attack by the \u201cloud crash\u201d of the television, whereupon he saw \u201cInmate Jones falling forward with a television set rolling off of him.\u201d Un-sworn Decl. of Officer Christopher Hasha-gen \u00b63, ECF No. 43 Ex. 1. Hashagen looked up, and while he could not see Mitchell, he could \u201chear him yelling\u201d; immediately afterward, Mitchell reappeared and continued the assault. <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 5-6. Hashagen ordered Mitchell to stop, and Mitchell returned to his cell. Hashagen then called for assistance to take Jones to the infirmary. <em>Id. </em>\u00b67-10. Officer Lin-hert, on Mitchell\u2019s tier before the assault, was now stationed near Mitchell\u2019s cell, while Unit Manager Semon was far back in the cell block. See Depo. of Christopher Jones [hereinafter \u201cDepo.\u201d] 12:17-24, 22:5-17, ECF No. 43 Ex. 3. However, Semon was close enough to observe both the attack and Linhert\u2019s and Hashagen\u2019s reactions. DC-804 Part 2, ECF No. 43 Ex. 6. The entire incident lasted around <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>thirty seconds, and was over quickly. <em>See, e.g., </em>Unsworn Decl. of Officer Christopher Hashagen \u00b6 11; Unsworn Deck of Woodrow Mitchell \u00b6 3, ECF No. 43 Ex. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Following his submission of grievances,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jones filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 on May 7, 2009, naming the following defendants: Officer Hashagen, Officer Linhert, Unit Manager Semon, Superintendant Michael Klopotoski, and Doctor Dempsey (the treating physician). All defendants were sued in their individual and official capacities. With regard to the first three defendants, Jones did not argue a materially different set of facts than those recited above, but instead appeared simply to view the officers\u2019 responses as insufficient. He claimed that Hashagen, Linhert, and Sem-on were \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d during the assault for \u201cfailfing] to stop the attack immediately,\u201d and were moreover deliberately indifferent along with Klopotoski in \u201cfail[ing] to take action to curb Inmate Mitchell\u2019s pattern of assaults\u201d \u2014 in other words, he alleged that the defendants knew that Mitchell was dangerous, and that their indifference to the threat Mitchell posed led to Jones\u2019s injury. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32, ECF No. 1. He separately accused Dempsey of exercising \u201cdeliberate indifference to [his] health by failing to provide adequate medical care to him following the attack by Mitchell.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Shortly after commencement, Jones moved to proceed in forma pauperis [hereinafter \u201cIFF\u201d]. <em>See </em>Appl. to Proceed IFP, ECF No. 4. The District Court granted IFP status on June 10, 2009, instructing \u201cthe Clerk of the Court ... [to] prepare the summons and forward it to the U.S. Marshal ... for service upon the defendants.\u201d Order, ECF No. 7. However, only Hashagen, Semon, and Klopotoski returned waivers of service. <em>See </em>Waiver of the Service of Summons, ECF No. 11. Neither Dempsey nor Linhert responded, nor did they enter appearances or otherwise take part in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">The participating defendants moved to dismiss; the motion was partially granted, dismissing Klopotoski as a defendant and dismissing suits against the defendants in their official capacities. <em>Jones v. Hashagen, </em>No. 4:09-cv-00887, 2010 WL 128316, at *5, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2328, at *14-15 (M.D.Pa. Jan. 12, 2010). Following the completion of discovery, Hashagen and Semon moved for summary judgment, which was granted. <em>Jones v. Hashagen, </em>No. 4:09-ev-00887, 2010 WL 4683762, at *5, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119348, at *14 (M.D.Pa. Nov. 10, 2010). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">We fully agree with the District Court\u2019s well-reasoned opinions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Inasmuch as Jones attempted to maintain claims-against those defendants employed by the Commonwealth in their official capacities, those claims were barred by sovereign immunity. <em>See Betts v. New Castle Youth Dev. Ctr., </em>621 F.3d 249, 254 (3d Cir.2010). Jones\u2019s complaint failed to state a viable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Eighth Amendment claim against Klopoto-ski. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2019 And, finally, the discovery material \u2014 showing, inter alia, no significant history of assault on Mitchell\u2019s part, while tending to confirm the rapid response of block officers to a brief-yet-unexpected event\u2014 demonstrated no deliberate indifference on the part of Hashagen or Semon with regard to either anticipating or stopping the assault. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120, 133 (3d Cir.2001).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As no substantial issue exists on these grounds, we will summarily affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">But Klopotoski, Hashagen, and Semon were not the only parties that Jones attempted to sue; two others, Linhert and Dempsey, were apparently never served. When a plaintiff proceeds IFP, \u201c[t]he officers of the court shall issue and serve all process.\u201d 28 U-.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(3). In <em>Young v. Quin-lan, </em>while discussing service of process in IFP cases, we wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">Since the district court granted Young leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>it was the district court\u2019s responsibility to serve process upon all defendants and thus Young should not be penalized for failure to effect service where it failed through no fault of his own.... Young merely needed to request service upon the appropriate defendant and attempt to remedy any apparent service defects of which [he had] knowledge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">960 F.2d 351, 359 (3d Cir.1992) (internal citations, quotations omitted); <em>see also Byrd v. Stone, </em>94 F.3d 217, 219 (6th Cir.1996) (\u201c[W]hen a plaintiff is proceeding [IFP,] the court is obligated to issue plaintiffs process to a United States Marshal who must in turn effectuate service upon the defendants, thereby relieving a plaintiff of the burden to serve process once reasonable steps have been taken to identify for the court the defendants named in the complaint.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The District Court record fails to reveal why process was not served on the two missing defendants. When moving to dismiss, the responding defendants observed that Linhert (whose name may have been misspelled) was \u201cimproperly named [and a]s a result, that Defendant has not been identified and served yet.\u201d Br. in Supp. of Corrections Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Dismiss Pl.\u2019s Compl. [hereinafter \u201cMTD\u201d] 1 n.1, ECF No. 16. But Jones claims to have been well acquainted with Linhert, who was one of the regular officers on the cell block. Depo. 21:12-24. Moreover, Semon himself identified Linhert in his response to Jones\u2019s grievance. DC-804 (\u201cCO Linhert, who was on the upper tier, near cell 64, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>moved to stop Inmate Mitchell, while giving him verbal orders to stop.\u201d). With regard to Dempsey, the physician who treated Jones after the assault, the defendants averred in the present tense that he \u201cis represented separately.\u201d MTD 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The District Court did not extensively address the situation in its two opinions. It originally observed that Jones did not object to the defendants\u2019 contention that Linhert was \u201cimproperly named,\u201d even though the Magistrate Judge had not addressed the issue in his report. <em>Jones, </em>2010 WL 128316, at *1, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2328, at *1-2 n. 1. Later, it noted that \u201cdefendants Linhart [sic ] and Dempsey were never served or are unidentified; at the very least, no counsel has entered an appearance on their behalf.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>2010 WL 4683762, at *1 n. 1, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119348, at *1 n. 1. It made no further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We disagree with the District Court\u2019s handling of this issue. The IFP statute specifically vests the responsibility for service with the court and its officers. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). Thus, a failure to serve should not prejudice a faultless plaintiff. <em>See Olsen v. Mapes, </em>333 F.3d 1199, 1204 (10th Cir.2003) (as \u201cresponsibility for the failure to serve ... rests with the Marshal or with the district court,\u201d such a failure, absent showing of Plaintiff\u2019s fault, is good cause for failure to comply with rules of civil procedure); <em>Sellers v. United States, </em>902 F.2d 598, 602 (7th Cir.1990) (\u201c[W]hen the district court instructs the Marshal to serve papers on behalf of a prisoner, the prisoner need furnish no more than the information necessary to identify the defendant ... [and][t]he Marshal\u2019s failure to accomplish the task is automatically \u2018good cause\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 4(j).\u201d). Here, there is no indication that Jones was culpable in any sense, or that he was ever actually instructed to furnish additional information \u2014 and the cursory treatment of the issue cannot be viewed as notice sufficient to make him aware of the seriousness of non-service. This is not a case where an incarcerated plaintiff has accused a phalanx of John Does; Jones\u2019s complaint provides names and positions, while detailing the circumstances of his encounters with the various defendants. <em>See Laurence v. Wall, </em>551 F.3d 92, 94 (1st Cir.2008) (per curiam) (\u201cThe IFP plaintiff is, however, required to cooperate with the court and the United States Marshal in effectuating service, including providing the addresses of the named defendants, if needed, and completing any necessary paperwork and forms.\u201d). We must therefore conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to constructively dismiss those defendants from the suit, <em>cf. Ayres v. Jacobs &amp; Crumplar, P.A., </em>99 F.3d 565, 568 (3d Cir.1996); <em>Petrucelli v. Bohringer &amp; Ratzinger, </em>46 F.3d 1298, 1308 (3d Cir.1995), and we will vacate and remand on this ground.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\">. Since we will affirm on the merits, we will not decide the question (which was vigorously litigated below) of whether Jones is in compliance with the exhaustion requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e, on which point the District Court declined to grant summary judgment. <em>See Jones v. Hashagen, </em>No. 4:09-cv-00887, 2010 WL 4683762, at *4, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 119348, at *11 (M.D.Pa. Nov. 10, 2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-12\">. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. On appeal, \"[o]ur review of a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment is plenary.\u201d <em>Gallo v. City of Phila., </em>161 F.3d 217, 221 (3d Cir.1998). We may summarily affirm under Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6 when it is clear that the appeal presents no substantial question. <em>See United States v. Baptiste, </em>223 F.3d 188, 190 n. 3 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b166-6\">. Jones's claim against Klopotoski was actually dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend, but Jones declined to file an amended complaint. To the extent that his objections to the first Report and Recommendation, in which he claimed that \"Mitchel[l] had a pattern of assaults which ... should have been known to the defendants including Klopotoski,\u201d Pet'r's Objections to Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation 2, ECF No. 23, could have been construed as an attempt to constructively amend the complaint, we observe that the material uncovered during discovery would compel dismissal or summary judgment in favor of Klopotoski.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\">. Jones later attempted to insinuate that the officers\u2019 positions during the assault were \"deliberate,\u201d presumably to slow their response times. <em>See </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s Objections to Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation 2, ECF No. 51.
