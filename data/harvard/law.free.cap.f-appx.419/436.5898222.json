Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Geoghagan did not challenge the magistrate judge\u2019s adverse rulings before the district court, and there is no evidence in the record that Geogha-gan consented to proceed before the magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1). Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to consider the magistrate judge\u2019s ruling. <em>See Gregg v. Linder, </em>349 F.3d 860, 862 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Geoghagan also challenges the district court\u2019s failure to appoint counsel <em>sua sponte </em>at trial. A district court may appoint counsel in a \u00a7 1983 case if exceptional circumstances exist. <em>Branch v. Cole, </em>686 F.2d 264, 266 (5th Cir.1982). We review a district court\u2019s decision not to appoint counsel in a \u00a7 1983 action for abuse of discretion. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 293 (5th Cir.1997). Geoghagan has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in failing to appoint counsel <em>sua sponte. </em>The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. In light of the foregoing, Geoghagan\u2019s motion for appointment of appellate counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
