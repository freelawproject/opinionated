He argues that the statute is unconstitutional because it exceeds Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause, and violates the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">We review the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo. United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270,1271 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Here, as Hunt recognizes, his arguments are clearly foreclosed by our binding precedent. First, we have binding precedent squarely concerning 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) that precludes his challenges to the statute\u2019s constitutionality on Commerce Clause and Tenth Amendment grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 1273-74 (reaffirming our holding that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is a facially valid exercise of Congress\u2019 power under the Commerce Clause; <em>Hiley v. Barrett, </em>155 F.3d 1276, 1277 (11th Cir. 1998)) (affirming district court\u2019s conclusion, in <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Inc. v. Barrett, </em>968 F.Supp. 1564, 1577-78 (N.D.Ga.1997), that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) did not violate the Tenth Amendment because it was a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>see also New York v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 144, 174, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (holding that a congressional act that is valid under the Commerce Clause does not violate the Tenth Amendment). In addition, since the Ninth Amendment does not provide an inherent right to self defense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) cannot be unconstitutional on these grounds. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>117 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.1997), <em>vacated in part on other grounds by </em>133 F.3d 1412 (11th Cir. 1998). Indeed, the Tenth Circuit has persuasively rejected the argument that the specific statute at issue in this case violates the Ninth Amendment. <em>United States v. Baer, </em>235 F.3d 561, 564 (10th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Wright, </em>117 F.3d at 1275). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-8\">. Though <em>Barrett </em>addressed the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), this distinction makes no practical difference in addressing Tenth Amendment concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
