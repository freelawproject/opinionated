Tigner contends that the district court erred by failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the public safety factor under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 in resentencing him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-16\">A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). A district court may modify a term of imprisonment if a defendant received a sentence based on a guidelines range that was later lowered by the Sentencing Commission so long as the reduction is consistent with the Commission\u2019s applicable policy statements. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1321-22 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe law permits, but does not require, the district court to resentence a defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">In deciding a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the district court must first recalculate the applicable guidelines range, substituting the amended guideline for the one originally used. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). The district court then must decide in its discretion whether to retain the original sentence or to impose a new sentence within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>the amended range, considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as well as public safety considerations. <em>Id. </em>(citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 1(B)). The district court is \u201cnot required to articulate the applicability of each factor, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). We must vacate and remand \u201c[i]f it is not possible to determine from the record whether the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Douglas, </em>576 F.3d 1216, 1219 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">In <em>Eggersdorf, </em>the district court\u2019s order did not specifically reference any of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but it stated that it had reviewed the relevant documents, including the motions and the record. <em>Eggers-dorf, </em>126 F.3d at 1322-23. We held that the district court\u2019s indication that it had reviewed the relevant documents was sufficient to demonstrate that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors because the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u201cset out the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors word for word,\u201d and because the government\u2019s motion in opposition made specific arguments based on those factors. <em>Id. </em>We noted that the district court judge who decided the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion was familiar with the offense and the defendant because that judge had originally sentenced the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">In this case, Tigner set out the pertinent factors word for word and made specific arguments based on those factors in his motion for a sentence reduction and his motion for reconsideration. The district court expressly stated in its order granting the sentence reduction and its order denying reconsideration that it had \u201cconsidered\u201d Tigner\u2019s motions. By stating it had considered those motions, the district court adequately demonstrated that it weighed the relevant factors. Additionally, as in <em>Eggersdorf, </em>the district court judge was familiar with both Tigner and his offense because he was the judge who had originally sentenced Tigner.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-12\">. Tigner also argues that the district court failed to consider his post-sentencing conduct, but that is something the district court does not have to consider. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. l(B)(iii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
