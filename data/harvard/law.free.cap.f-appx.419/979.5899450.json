Siman appeals his 84-month, above-guideline sentence imposed after pleading guilty to wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. Siman argues: (1) for the first time on appeal that district court\u2019s deviation above the guideline range constitutes an upward departure of which he was entitled to advance notice per Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(h); (2) in the alternative, that the above-guideline sentence is substantively unreasonable; and (3) that the district court violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(C) and his right to due process by considering undisclosed victim letters to determine his sentence without first providing Siman with copies of all of the letters. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">We review objections not raised at the sentencing hearing and raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valentine, </em>21 F.3d 395, 397 (11th Cir.1994). Under the plain error standard, the appellant must show (1) an error that (2) is plain, (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under \u201ca deferential abuse-of-discretion standard\u201d considering the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d and giving \u201cdue deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify\u201d the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090-91 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Finally, we review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cWe are precluded, however, from reviewing an issue raised on appeal if it has been waived through the doctrine of invited error.\u201d <em>United States v. Braman, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">First, we reject Siman\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred in failing to give notice that it was considering imposing an upward departure. It is undeniable that a district court is required to give reasonable notice to the defendant when it contemplates departing from the sentencing range on grounds not identified for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>departure in the PSI or other presentenc-ing submissions. Fed.R.Crim.P. 82(h). However, this notice requirement applies only to departures, not to discretionary variances. <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2006), <em>ajfd, </em>553 U.S. 708, 716, 128 S.Ct. 2198, 171 L.Ed.2d 28 (2008). We have held that an above-guideline sentence was the result of a variance, rather than a departure, when the district court did not cite to a specific guideline departure provision and stated that the guideline range did not adequately account for the severity of the offense. <em>United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 788 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d at 1211-12 (holding that the district court imposed a discretionary variance rather than a departure, because it considered the adequacy of the range in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the evidence presented of \u201cthe future risk Defendant posed to the public\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Similarly, in this case, the district court calculated the correct advisory guideline range and considered the victim statements and the statements presented by the defense. The district court said that after considering the statements of the parties and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the case warranted a sentence above the guideline maximum and set forth its reasoning at length, specifically citing the seriousness and magnitude of the crime, as well as the need for just punishment and adequate deterrence. Although the district court repeatedly referred to the above-guidelines sentence as an \u201cupward departure,\u201d the district court did not cite to a guideline departure provision or indicate that it was following the departure framework in U.S.S.G. Chapter 5. <em>See Eldick, </em>443 F.3d at 788 n. 2. Considering the entire record, then, the district court clearly \u201cexercised its <em>post-Booker </em>discretion to impose a reasonable sentence outside the sentencing guideline range\u201d in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d at 1211-12. As a result, the sentence was the result of a variance, which did not trigger the notice requirement in Rule 32(h), and the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in failing to give notice of its intent to impose an above-guideline sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Furthermore, Siman has failed to show that the district court committed a clear error of judgment or that the 84-month, above-guideline sentence imposed is outside the range of reasonable sentences based on the facts of this case. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en banc), petition for cert, filed, </em>(U.S. Nov. 24, 2010) (No. 10-727). The district court was not bound by the government\u2019s recommendation of a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range. <em>See Eldick, </em>443 F.3d at 789. Additionally, the district court is permitted to impose an upward variance where the guidelines do not adequately address the seriousness and magnitude of the harm caused by the defendant. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">As the record shows, the district court heard the defendant\u2019s statement, victims\u2019 statements, and the government\u2019s recommendation, and determined that the need for adequate deterrence and just punishment would not be satisfied by a sentence within the guideline range. And despite Siman\u2019s contentions, the factors under \u00a7 3553(a) do not require \u201cvulnerable victims\u201d or \u201cspecial factors.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The evidence presented at the hearing indicated that Siman took advantage of and, in some cases, took the entire life savings from \u201cinnocent people, hardworking people trying to accumulate funds for a college education, for retirement, to make their lives better.\u201d The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>court found that Siman\u2019s fraud was \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cegregious.\u201d Finally, although Siman\u2019s 84-month sentence is 21 months above the maximum of the guideline range, it is well below the 20-year statutory maximum sentence. Thus, Siman\u2019s 84-month sentence is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Finally, Siman waived his rights under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(C) to review the undisclosed victim impact letters, and thus, invited the error to which he now appeals. This \u201cdoctrine of invited error is implicated when a party induces or invites the district court into making an error.\u201d <em>Brannan, </em>562 F.3d at 1306. \u201cThus, if a party waives a procedural right or agrees to the admissibility of certain evidence, he cannot later complain that any resulting error is reversible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Indeed, even if the district court erred by considering the <em>ex parte </em>victim impact letters, Siman repeatedly failed to object prior to the district court imposing sentence, despite frequent discussion of the letters during the course of the sentencing hearing. When Siman finally objected after the sentence was imposed, he subsequently waived his objection by declining to review the letters and provide a rebuttal when offered the opportunity by the district court. Accordingly, Siman invited the error from which he now appeals, and moreover, has failed to show how the error resulted in any prejudice to him at sentencing. We affirm Siman\u2019s 84-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
