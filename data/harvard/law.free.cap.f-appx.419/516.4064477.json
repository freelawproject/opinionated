He argues for the first time on appeal that the district court erred by applying al6-level adjustment to his sentence because his Montana conviction for conspiracy did not qualify as a drug traf-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>ticking offense for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). He asserts that the Montana statute under which he was convicted encompasses two substances that are not prohibited under the federal controlled substances act and that the district court could not rely upon the information in the presentence report (PSR) indicating that his Montana conviction involved marijuana. Because Orozco-Campos did not object on this basis in district court, we review this issue only for plain error. <em>United States v. Henao-Melo, </em>591 F.3d 798, 801 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Although the district court was not permitted to rely solely upon the PSR to determine whether the prior conviction constituted a drug trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2, it may \u201cuse all facts admitted by the defendant in determining whether the prior conviction qualifies as an enumerated offense under \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Vega, </em>471 F.3d 559, 563 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Orozco-Campos\u2019s explicit adoption of the PSR was sufficient to support the \u00a7 2L1.2 adjustment for purposes of plain error review. <em>See United States v. Sanchez, </em>389 Fed.Appx. 378, 380 (5th Cir.2010); <em>Martinez-Vega, </em>471 F.3d at 563; <em>cf. United States v. Velasquez-Torrez, </em>609 F.3d 743, 747-48 (5th Cir.) (holding that, because defendant and counsel specifically affirmed that they had reviewed the PSR for accuracy and made no objections to it, the district court did not commit reversible plain error by relying upon the defendant\u2019s admission of his prior removal following a felony conviction, as stated in the PSR), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 438, 178 L.Ed.2d 339 (2010); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>557 F.3d 200, 204-05 (5th Cir.2009) (same). He has therefore failed to show error that was clear or obvious in this regard. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
