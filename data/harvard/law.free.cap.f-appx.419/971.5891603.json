He and two co-conspirators \u2014 Andrew Holt and Amanda Cosgrove \u2014 robbed a commercial business and two federally insured banks. On appeal, Black argues that the district court committed clear error in sentencing him as an \u201corganizer\u201d or \u201cleader\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). He also contends that his 97-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because it creates an unwarranted disparity between Black and one of his coconspirators, who received a 27-month sentence. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s determination that Black acted as \u201can organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d for the purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d 930, 938 (11th Cir. 1999) (en banc). \u201cA finding is \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">The Sentencing Guidelines allow for an increase in the offense level based on the defendant\u2019s role in a given crime. A two-level enhancement is applied if the defendant \u201cwas an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). In deciding whether such an increase is appropriate, the district court considers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-13\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.1 n. 4. \u201cThere can, of course, be more than one person who qualifies as a leader or organizer of a criminal association or conspiracy,\u201d however, the enhancement \u201cdoes not apply to a defendant who merely suggests committing the offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">This Court has held that \u201cthe assertion of control or influence\u201d over a single individual is sufficient to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) enhancement. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir.2000). For example, a defendant\u2019s decision to recruit, prompt others to purchase weapons, and brief another on the plan details is sufficient to warrant the offense-level increase. <em>United States v. Mandhai, </em>375 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">Despite the existence of isolated facts indicating that any given member was a \u201cleader,\u201d we seriously doubt that it is pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>sible to extend the leadership enhancement to every member of a conspiracy, Here, however, we cannot conclude that the district court clearly erred as Black\u2019s actions sufficiently support its determination. Black concedes that he \u201cwas not a mere follower,\u201d and the pre-sentence investigation report confirms that. He suggested committing the crime, and while this alone is insufficient to justify the enhancement, he went further and, <em>inter alia, </em>enlisted the two other co-conspirators. He involved himself in the planning and execution of each of the robberies. He encouraged Holt to procure a gun. Black\u2019s argument that Cosgrove played a greater leadership role does not foreclose the conclusion that the enhancement is appropriate for Black. Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s application of the sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The review is deferential, and a defendant challenging his sentence bears the burden of showing that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 788. At sentencing, the district court must consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which include avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities between similarly situated defendants. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). However, there cannot be an unwarranted sentencing disparity between defendants that are not similarly situated. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009). In other words, \u201c \u2018[a] well-founded claim of disparity ... assumes that apples are being compared to apples.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Docampo, </em>573 F.3d 1091,1101 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Mateo-Espejo, </em>426 F.3d 508, 514 (1st Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Here, Black focuses on the disparity between his sentence and the 27-month sentence Holt received. Black, however, fails to appreciate that he and Holt are not similarly situated. Most importantly, Black pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit three robberies while Holt pleaded guilty to one robbery. Furthermore, Holt provided more assistance to the government than Black in an unrelated investigation, resulting in the government filing a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial-assistance motion based on \u201cvery significant\u201d assistance\u2014 rather than \u201csignificant\u201d assistance \u2014 on Holt\u2019s behalf. As the two are not similarly situated, Black\u2019s argument is misguided and fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">We determine that the district court did not clearly err in sentencing Black as a \u201cleader\u201d or \u201corganizer\u201d for his role in the three robberies at issue. Furthermore, the sentence imposed for his criminal conduct is reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
