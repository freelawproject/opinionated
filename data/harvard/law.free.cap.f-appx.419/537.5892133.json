The district court denied his request to proceed IFP on appeal, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. Johnson\u2019s IFP motion in this court is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-23\">As Johnson has not adequately addressed the reasons for the district court\u2019s certification decision, it is the same as if he had not challenged that decision. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987); <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Because Johnson has not shown that he will present any nonfrivolous issue on appeal, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is denied and this appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-24\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepeg-ba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Johnson is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-25\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
