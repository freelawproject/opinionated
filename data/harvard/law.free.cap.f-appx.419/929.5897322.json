Chen argues that the Board erroneously found that her application for asylum was untimely and that her testimony at her removal hearing was incredible. Chen also contends that she established past persecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. We dismiss in part and deny in part Chen\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-21\">We lack jurisdiction to review the finding that Chen\u2019s application for asylum was untimely. An application for asylum must be \u201cfiled within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An untimely application \u201cmay be considered ... if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Attorney General either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Section 1158(a)(3) \u201cdivests our Court of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>plied with the one-year time limit or established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). We dismiss Chen\u2019s petition to review the finding that her application for asylum was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">When the Board enters a written opinion and expressly adopts the reasoning of the immigration judge, we review the decisions of both the Board and the immigration judge. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the findings of the Board and the immigration judge under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). Under that test, we will not disturb a finding if it is \u201csupported \u25a0 by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. An adverse credibility determination \u201c\u2018can be reversed only if the evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231 (quoting <em>Sepulveda v. U S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005)). An adverse credibility determination may be based on any inconsistency, regardless of whether the inconsistency goes to the heart of the claim. <em>Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1277 (11th Cir.2009); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Even when an applicant is not credible, the Board must examine all evidence in the record before denying an application. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). In addition, \u201cthe burden is on the applicant alien to show that the credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Substantial evidence supports the finding by the Board and the immigration judge that Chen\u2019s testimony was incredible. Chen initially alleged fear of forced sterilization if returned to China, but later alleged past persecution based on religion. Chen also provided inconsistent evidence about her religion and contradictory explanations about the inconsistency. Chen failed to mention in either her first application or asylum interview her alleged earlier arrest, detention, and beating in China, and Chen implausibly alleged that she resided in Orlando while her three children resided in New York. The Board and the immigration judge provided specific and cogent reasons for finding Chen\u2019s testimony incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">Chen\u2019s remaining evidence does not compel a finding of past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The Board and the immigration judge reviewed Chen\u2019s remaining evidence and reasonably explained that Chen failed to offer authentic documentary evidence or credible testimony that she will likely be singled out for persecution if returned to China. We deny Chen\u2019s petition to review the denial of her application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">PETITION DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
