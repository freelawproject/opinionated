The Morgans also argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying their motions under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Whether the court properly granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Ryals, </em>480 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2007). A tax assessment made by the IRS constitutes a \u201cdetermination that a taxpayer owes the Federal Government a certain amount of unpaid taxes,\u201d and such a determination \u201cis entitled to a legal presumption of correctness.\u201d <em>United States v. Fior D\u2019Ralia, Inc., </em>536 U.S. 238, 242, 122 S.Ct. 2117, 2122, 153 L.Ed.2d 280 (2002). Accordingly, taxpayers have the burden of proving that the IRS\u2019s computations in this regard were erroneous. <em>Pollard v. Comm\u2019r, IRS, </em>786 F.2d 1063, 1066 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The Morgans\u2019 arguments that the IRS\u2019s assessments were incorrect are frivolous. Their arguments raise issues of statutory interpretation related to the meaning of the words: (1) \u201cincludes\u201d and \u201cincluding\u201d; (2) \u201cemployment\u201d and \u201cself-employment\u201d; (3) \u201ctrade or business\u201d; (4) \u201cself-employment income,\u201d \u201cnet earnings from self-employment,\u201d and \u201cwages\u201d; (5) \u201cUnited States\u201d; and (6) \u201cState.\u201d Their specific argument that income from work in the private sector is not subject to income tax has been rejected as frivolous by this Court in <em>United States v. Morse, </em>532 F.3d 1130, 1132-33 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam), and <em>Motes v. United States, </em>785 F.2d 928, 928 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam) (rejecting as frivolous the claim that \u201conly public servants are subject to tax liability\u201d). The specific argument that only employment within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa qualifies as employment \u201cwithin the United States\u201d is likewise frivolous under <em>United States v. Ward, </em>833 F.2d 1538,1539 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (finding \u201cutterly without merit\u201d the claim that the Income Tax Code limits the definition of \u201cUnited States\u201d to the District of Columbia and the aforementioned territories).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Accordingly, because the government\u2019s assessments were presumptively correct, and because the Morgans did not meet their burden of showing that the assessments were incorrect, the government possessed valid liens on the Morgans\u2019 property and the district court properly granted summary judgment. <em>See Pollard, </em>786 F.2d at 1066; I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6321, 6322.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">We review the denial of a Rule 59(e) or Rule 52(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Lambert v. Fulton Cnty., Ga., </em>253 F.3d 588, 598 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Trigo v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>847 F.2d 1499, 1504 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>(11th Cir.1988). Furthermore, in order for a Rule 59(e) motion to be granted, a party must identify \u201cnewly-discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact.\u201d <em>Arthur v. King, </em>500 F.3d 1335, 1343 (11th Cir. 2007). Rule 59(e) may not be used \u201cto relitigate old matters, raise arguments] or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment.\u201d <em>Michael Linet, Inc. v. Vill. of Wellington, Fla., </em>408 F.3d 757, 763 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">In both motions, the Morgans sought to relitigate old arguments that the court had already found to be frivolous and to add facts to the record that were not material to the outcome of the case. In their amended Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration, the Morgans failed to allege, much less show, that they could not have submitted their purported newly discovered evidence prior to the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-7\">. Although the Morgans\u2019 notice of appeal references only the date of the order denying their motion for the court to declare the law of the case, their brief clearly is intended as an appeal of the district court\u2019s summary judgment order, and both parties have briefed the issues on appeal as such. For that reason, we consider the Morgans\u2019 appeal to be of the district court\u2019s summary judgment order. <em>See KH Outdoor, LLC v. City of Trussville, </em>465 F.3d 1256, 1260 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
