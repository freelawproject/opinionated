The district court\u2019s findings of fact are x-eviewed for clear error; matters of law, <em>de novo. Venegas v. Henman, </em>126 F.3d 760, 761 (5th Cir.1997). Because the USPC has \u201cabsolute discretion\u201d in parole determinations, however, its conclusions are reviewed \u201cwith extreme deference, reviewing them only to determine whether there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>some evidence in the record to support [its] decision\u201d. <em>Simpson v. Ortiz, </em>995 F.2d 606, 608 (5th Cir.1993) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Johnson contends: because he had served 30 years of his original 99-year sentence, imposed in 1976, his release on parole was mandatory, pursuant to former 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(d). Although that statute provides that a prisoner who has served the required portion of his sentence \u201cshall\u201d be released on parole, it also states that a prisoner \u201cshall not\u201d be released if the USPC determines he \u201chas seriously or frequently violated institution rules and regulations\u201d. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206(d). Following Johnson\u2019s 2007 mandatory parole hearing, the USPC denied parole, stating he had \u201cfrequently and seriously violated the rules of the institution in which [he was] confined\u201d. (Johnson incurred 16 disciplinary infractions between 1981 and 1998 for, <em>inter alia, </em>possession of narcotics, possession of a weapon, engaging in sexual acts, refusing orders, and fighting.) Therefore, to the extent Johnson contends parole was mandatory, his contention fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Johnson also contends the district court failed to address whether the parole denial was based on the sentencing court\u2019s recommendation that he never receive parole. There is nothing in the record indicating the USPC relied on that recommendation; however, the USPC may do so pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Johnson further contends the USPC erred by denying parole based on his older disciplinary infractions, instead of considering his claimed more recent record of good behavior. As noted, a prisoner\u2019s frequent or serious violations of institutional rules is one of the listed bases for denying parole. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4206(d). Johnson has cited no authority to support the USPC\u2019s not being allowed to rely on past infractions. In addition, to the extent Johnson\u2019s contention may be construed as a request for our court to reevaluate the USPC\u2019s decision to deny parole, we decline to do so. <em>See Simpson, </em>995 F.2d at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">In his statement of issues, Johnson asserts that an allegedly pending state de-tainer is \u201clegally questionable\u201d and that the district court erred by adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report without making independent findings and conclusions. Because Johnson has provided no additional briefing in support of these assertions, we do not consider them. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993) (contentions not presented in body of <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s brief deemed abandoned).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
