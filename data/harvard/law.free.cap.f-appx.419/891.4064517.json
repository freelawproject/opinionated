The IJ\u2019s decision denied Rodriguez-Chavarria\u2019s motion to terminate his reopened removal proceedings. After careful review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-11\">Rodriguez-Chavarria, a native and citizen of Colombia, was admitted into the United States as a lawful permanent resident on September 23, 1990. On May 13, 2003, Rodriguez-Chavarria was convicted of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.021. Based on that conviction, the Department of Homeland Security issued a notice to appear in May 2003, charging Rodriguez-Chavarria with removability under Section 237(a)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At his removal hearing on June 19, 2003, Rodriguez-Chavarria conceded that he was removable under the INA. On July 10, 2003, he filed an application for cancellation of removal. The IJ granted that application, after a hearing, on July 23, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">On October 24, 2008, DHS filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings and to vacate the IJ\u2019s cancellation of removal order. In support of its motion, DHS submitted a judgment of conviction from New Jersey showing that Rodriguez-Chavarria was arrested in 1995 and convicted in 1998 for possession of cocaine. DHS stated that: \u201c[o]n or about July 23, 2003, [it] ran a background check and [Rodriguez-Chavar-ria\u2019s] cocaine possession conviction did not appear.\u201d DHS asserted that \u201c[t]he existence of the 1995 cocaine arrest and subsequent 1998 conviction is material, and was not available for discussion back in July, 2003.\u201d The IJ granted DHS\u2019s motion to reopen on November 17, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">On February 3, 2009, Rodriguez-Cha-varria filed a motion to terminate his reopened removal proceedings, arguing that DHS\u2019s motion to reopen should not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>been granted because his 1998 cocaine conviction was discoverable at the time of his original removal proceedings. After a hearing, the IJ denied Rodriguez-Chavar-ria\u2019s motion and ordered that he be removed to Colombia. In explaining his decision, the IJ stated that it was Rodriguez-Chavarria\u2019s burden to disclose his prior conviction and establish that he was statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ observed that Rodriguez-Chavarria could not \u201csit back and blame the DHS for its failure to discover his conviction and thus avoid his individual responsibility to disclose the conviction record.\u201d The IJ also pointed out that Rodriguez-Chavarria was asked at his original removal proceedings about his arrest history, and he did not disclose his 1995 arrest for cocaine possession.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nor did he disclose the arrest on his application for cancellation of removal. The IJ stated that: \u201c[t]he existence of the 1995 cocaine arrest and subsequent 1998 conviction was material and was not available for discussion back in July of 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Rodriguez-Chavarria appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. He now petitions for review of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">We review a decision to reopen removal proceedings for an abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). When the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review only the decision of the IJ. <em>Silva v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>448 F.3d 1229, 1235 (11th Cir. 2006). We review questions of law <em>de novo. Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321,1326 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The Code of Federal Regulations provides that an IJ may reopen proceedings \u201cupon his or her own motion at any time.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1). However, if a motion to reopen is filed by either party, the regulations provide: \u201c[a] motion to reopen will not be granted unless the [IJ] is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3). To be \u201cmaterial,\u201d the offered evidence must be the kind that, if the proceedings were reopened, would likely change the result in the case. <em>See Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006). Evidence that was available and could have been presented at a former hearing is not considered \u201cnew.\u201d <em>Verano-Velasco v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 1372, 1377 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009) (explaining that because motions to reopen are disfavored, the moving party bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">Rodriguez-Chavarria contends that the IJ improperly granted DHS\u2019s motion to reopen because the evidence offered \u2014 his 1995 arrest and subsequent conviction in 1998 for cocaine possession \u2014 was not \u201cnew\u201d evidence. Because both occurred before his original removal proceeding in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>July 2003, he argues that evidence was available and could have been discovered before the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">It is undisputed that Rodriguez-Chavar-ria\u2019s New Jersey cocaine possession arrest and conviction is \u201cmaterial\u201d evidence. Had it been before the IJ in July 2003, the IJ could not have granted his application for cancellation of removal. The issue in this case is whether it was evidence that \u201cwas not available and [that] could not have been discovered or presented,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3), at his July 2003 removal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">We reject Rodriguez-Chavarria\u2019s argument that his arrest and conviction could have been discovered before his removal proceeding solely because they occurred first in time. The record shows that DHS performed a background check before Rodriguez-Chavarria\u2019s removal proceeding and that the arrest and conviction did not appear on the report. The record also shows that Rodriguez-Chavarria did not disclose his arrest or conviction on his application for cancellation of removal. To satisfy \u00a7 1003.23(b)(3), DHS did not have to prove to a metaphysical certainty that no amount of searching would have revealed Rodriguez-Chavarria\u2019s arrest and conviction. DHS exercised reasonable diligence to determine Rodriguez-Chavarria\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal by running a background check. Had Rodriguez-Chavarria disclosed his prior arrest and conviction on his application for cancellation of removal \u2014 as he was required to do \u2014 his ineligibility would have been apparent. Under the circumstances of this case, we find that Rodriguez-Chavar-ria\u2019s arrest and conviction was evidence that \u201ccould not have been discovered.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that DHS\u2019s motion to reopen was properly granted and therefore deny Rodriguez-Chavarria\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-12\">.
