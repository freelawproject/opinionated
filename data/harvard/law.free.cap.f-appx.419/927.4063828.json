We granted a certificate of appealability to address the question of whether the district court erred in determining that the actual-innocence exception to the procedural-default rule does not apply to King\u2019s claim that his non-capital sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1), violated his right to due process. King acknowledges that he procedurally defaulted his claim that he was illegally sentenced under the ACCA by failing to raise it on direct appeal, but he contends that the district court\u2019s failure to address his claim resulted in a fundamental miscarriage of justice because he was ineligible for, and, therefore, actually innocent of, the ACCA sentence enhancement. He argues that the actual-innocence exception to the procedural-default rule should be extended to apply to challenges to non-capital sentences because death is not different from non-capital sentences for purposes of enforcing <em>habeas corpus </em>rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">\u201cWhen reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo.\u201d Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009). A prisoner who fails to raise an issue on direct appeal is procedurally barred from raising that claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion, absent a showing of cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>Jones v. United States, </em>153 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.1998). A petitioner may show a fundamental miscarriage of justice by demonstrating that \u201ca constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\u201d <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225,1234 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has recognized that a petitioner who is guilty of an offense and sentenced to death can show a fundamental miscarriage of justice by demonstrating that, but for a constitutional error, he is actually innocent of the capital sentence. <em>See Sawyer v. Whitley, </em>505 U.S. 333, 336, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 2517, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>(1992). A petitioner may establish actual innocence in the capital-sentencing context by demonstrating that, \u201cbut for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found [him] eligible for the death penalty under the applicable ... law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">In light of the Government\u2019s concession on appeal that the actual-innocence exception should be available to petitioners raising procedurally defaulted claims challenging non-capital sentences enhanced under the ACCA, we remand King\u2019s case to the district court for a determination of whether King is actually innocent of the ACCA sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
