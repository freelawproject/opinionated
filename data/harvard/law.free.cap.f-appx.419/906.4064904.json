After review, we deny the petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-22\">We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). We must \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cWe view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Ade-femi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>Accordingly, \u201c[t]o conclude the BIA\u2019s decision should be reversed, we must find that the record not only supports the conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">An applicant is eligible for asylum if she \u201ccan show that the persecution [was], at least in part, motivated by a protected ground.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation and emphasis omitted). \u201cThe fact that the guerillas\u2019 actions are motivated by the guerillas\u2019 political belief is \u2018irrelevant\u2019 to the question of whether the alien was persecuted on account of the alien\u2019s political belief.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007). Nevertheless, an asylum applicant can prove refugee status based on an imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed to the applicant. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262,1289 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">In <em>Rodriguez Morales, </em>the petitioner, who was a dentist, was approached by members of the FARC who demanded that the petitioner join the FARC and provide dental services to their members. 488 F.3d at 887. The petitioner refused despite numerous threats on the petitioner\u2019s life. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the petitioner argued the FARC had a \u201cpolitical motive\u201d in persecuting him because they \u201cwanted him to help in spreading their political views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 889, 891. We stated such \u201cevidence of the FARC\u2019s motive does not constitute evidence that the guerrillas persecuted him \u2018because of <em>his </em>political opinion,\u201d and concluded the record did not compel the conclusion that the petitioner established a nexus between his political opinion and his persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 891 (citing <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Accordingly, mere refusal to cooperate or to provide services is insufficient to establish a nexus between persecution and a political opinion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">In this case, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding, adopted by the BIA, that no nexus existed between Arenas\u2019s political opinion and her alleged persecution. Arenas presented no evidence that the FARC was aware of her political opinions or that the FARC instructed her to stop any political activity. Rather, Arenas testified the FARC \u201cwanted [her] to do [her] same job, but for their benefit,\u201d which she refused to do. Because the record does not compel a finding that the FARC targeted Arenas because of an imputed political opinion, the BIA properly denied her application for asylum.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b928-15\">. We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of CAT relief because Arenas failed to present the issue to the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b928-23\">. We review both the IJ and BIA\u2019s decisions concerning nexus because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasoning with respect to the nexus determination. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, 257 </em>F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b929-7\">. Because Arenas failed to meet the burden to prove eligibility for asylum, the BIA properly denied Arenas\u2019s claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93 (noting that a petitioner\u2019s inability to meet the standard of proof for asylum generally pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>eludes the petitioner from qualifying for withholding of removal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
