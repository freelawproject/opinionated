The district court enhanced Sanchez\u2019s sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) based on his having been deported following an aggravated felony, a conviction in Texas for burglary of a vehicle. The court sentenced Sanchez within the guideline range to twenty-four months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. The court stated, at sentencing and in a post-sentencing order, that it would have imposed the same sentence without the enhancement as a variance from the guideline range under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-21\">Sanchez argues that, whether his sentence was a guideline sentence or a variance, the district court erred when it applied \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Sanchez acknowledges that when he was sentenced, his conviction of burglary counted as an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. He contends that his 365-day suspended sentence for that conviction, however, was revoked and that he was given a new sentence of 270 days, which was less than the one year required under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) to be an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-24\">Under <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), this court must first ensure that the court properly calculated the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752-54 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656 (5th Cir.2008). Because Sanchez challenged the enhancement in the district court, we review that court\u2019s application of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>602 F.3d 346, 362 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-27\">This court has rejected the argument Sanchez advances. <em>See United States v. Arriola-Cardona, </em>184 Fed.Appx. 373, 374\u201475 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Retta-Hernandez, </em>106 Fed.Appx. 879, 880-83 (5th Cir.2004). Finding the reasoning in those cases to be persuasive, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"A3V\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
