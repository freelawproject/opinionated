Wood stated that he intended to file a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action, asserting retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights and denial of due process in connection with the denial of parole, but that he could not do so without first conducting court-ordered discovery. The petition was filed by the clerk of court as a \u00a7 1983 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-24\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>informa pauper-is, </em>Wood appeals the district court\u2019s: dismissal of his action for failure to comply with the magistrate judge\u2019s order to file a proper \u00a7 1983 complaint; and denial of his Rule 27 motion concerning pre-action discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Wood states he complied with the magistrate judge\u2019s order by filing a proper \u00a7 1988 lawsuit, albeit in the Beaumont, rather than the Lufkin, Division. The clerk\u2019s office confirms Wood\u2019s \u00a7 1988 action is pending in the Beaumont Division. Because our court cannot grant further relief on that issue, that portion of this appeal is dismissed as moot. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">The denial of the Rule 27 motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Hibernia Nat. Bank v. Robinson, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 241, - (5th Cir.2003). Wood did <em>not </em>show he required pre-action discovery to prevent the failure or delay of justice; specifically, he failed to show the pre-action discovery he sought would otherwise be lost. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 27(a)(3). Wood\u2019s contentions appear predicated on his believing he has an absolute right to such discovery; that belief is incorrect. <em>See In re Eisenberg, </em>654 F.2d 1107, 1112 (5th Cir.1981). There was nothing to prevent Wood from filing a complaint and seeking discovery after the court completed its judicial screening of the case. <em>See id. </em>Because Wood has <em>not </em>shown the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 27 motion was an abuse of discretion, that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. <em>See In re Price, </em>723 F.2d 1193, 1194 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
