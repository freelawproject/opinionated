He contends the court erred by: failing to entirely recalculate his Guidelines range, including the amount of cocaine for which he is liable, in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny; and denying his requested hearing as part of the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. The district court\u2019s decision to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-19\">Contrary to Blair\u2019s assertions, the Government did <em>not </em>stipulate that he was accountable for only 50 grams of crack cocaine. He was <em>not </em>entitled to a full resentencing, but only to the two-level reduction in his offense level provided by Amendment 706. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(3), (b)(1). Because a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction does <em>not </em>constitute a full resentencing, the mandatory limitations on sentence reductions set forth in \u00a7 1B1.10 were <em>not </em>affected by <em>Booker, </em>and the bifurcated reasonableness review mandated by <em>Booker </em>and its progeny does <em>not </em>apply here. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 670-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">The record shows the court implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and did <em>not </em>abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence within the amended Guidelines range of 188-235 months. <em>See id. </em>at 673-74; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). Moreover, Blair has identified no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>factual dispute that would have been resolvable by the district court; therefore, he was <em>not </em>entitled to a hearing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b)(4); <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>42 F.3d 246, 248-49 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b488-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
