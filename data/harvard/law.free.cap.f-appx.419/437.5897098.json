The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied Cabrera\u2019s application, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed her administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-22\">Cabrera argues in her petition for review that the BIA erred in concluding, based on the documents submitted by the Government, that she had failed to meet her burden of showing a continuous pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>ence in the United States. The alien bears the burden of proving eligibility for cancellation of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.8(d). Whether a petitioner has been continually present for a period of not less than 10 years is a factual determination reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Garcia-Melendez v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 657, 661 (5th Cir.2003). Under that standard, a finding that the alien has not been continually present for the requisite period will be affirmed if there is no error of law and if reasonable, substantial, probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole, supports the IJ\u2019s factual findings. <em>Id. </em>The IJ\u2019s decision will not be reversed \u201cunless the petitioner provides evidence so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The IJ based his decision on evidence that Cabrera\u2019s presence in the United States was not continuous, as that concept is understood for the purposes of \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). Contrary to Cabrera\u2019s contentions, she had the opportunity to challenge or rebut this evidence, but she did not. Cabrera has not presented compelling evidence to show that she met her burden of proof to establish a continuous presence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Cabrera argues that the IJ abused his discretion in denying a continuance on February 23, 2009. \u201cThe grant of a continuance lies within the sound discretion of the IJ, who may grant a continuance fox-good cause shown.\u201d <em>Masih v. Mukasey, </em>536 F.3d 370, 373 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. Cabrera has not shown that the IJ abused his discx-etion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Cabrera\u2019s petition is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
