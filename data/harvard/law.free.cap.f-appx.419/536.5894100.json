Following Regions\u2019s foreclosure, in which it purchased the encumbered property at the trustee\u2019s sale for $550,000, Regions sued McKeever to recover $335,416.84 as the deficiency remaining following that purchase. Responding to the suit, McKeever asserted a number of defenses including, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) the Supreme Court of Texas has never addressed the applicable portions of the Texas Property Code regarding waiver, (2) the waiver provision of the applicable section is void as an unenforceable penalty, (3) he did not clearly and unequivocally waive his right to have the deficiency measured by the fair market value of the property, and (4) genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-21\">We have carefully reviewed the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and \u2014 especially\u2014the district court\u2019s Order Granting Motion For Summary Judgment of May 3, 2010. As a result of our de novo review, we are satisfied that district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was providently granted for essentially the same reasons patiently and completely set forth in its Order. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>the Final Judgment of the district court and all orders issued in connection with this action are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
