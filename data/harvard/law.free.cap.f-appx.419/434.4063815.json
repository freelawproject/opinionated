He was convicted in 1994 of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine and was sentenced to life imprisonment. By moving to proceed IFP, Routt is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-23\">Routt argues that the district court erred in finding that he was ineligible for a reduction in his offense level pursuant to the amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines. Routt also argues that the holding of <em>Booker </em>should be applicable in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. Routt further contends that the court erred in determining that his notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). In the instant case, the court determined that the amount of powder cocaine for which Routt was held responsible prevented the applicability of the amendments to the crack cocaine guidelines. This decision was correct. Routt was responsible for 150 kilograms of cocaine, which results in a base offense level of 38, the maximum base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Therefore, he was not entitled to a reduction in his offense level under Amendments 706 or 715. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 10(D) (ii) (II)). Additionally, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Routt\u2019s challenge to the finding that his notice of appeal was not timely filed is mooted by the district court\u2019s determination on remand that the late filing was due to excusable neglect and that his notice of appeal was timely. Routt has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
