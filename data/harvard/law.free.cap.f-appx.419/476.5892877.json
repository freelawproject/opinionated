Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141 (5th Cir.1994) (per curiam). Brooks\u2019s motion was \u201can unauthorized motion which the district court was without jurisdiction to entertain.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 142. Brooks does not argue that the Government\u2019s refusal to file such a motion was based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Grant, </em>493 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir.2007). He has also failed to show that the Government bargained away its discretion concerning whether to file the motion. <em>See United States v. Price, </em>95 F.3d 364, 368 &amp; n. 2 (5th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Brooks\u2019s motion. <em>See Early, </em>27 F.3d at 142; <em>see also Brewster v. Dretke, </em>587 F.3d 764, 769 n. 3 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3368, 176 L.Ed.2d 1254 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b498-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
