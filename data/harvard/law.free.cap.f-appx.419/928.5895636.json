At Brand\u2019s sentence hearing he admitted, through his counsel, that a 60-month sentence was the minimum sentence required by law and \u201cask[ed] the Court to go ahead and sentence him to 60 months.\u201d <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). And he did not object when he was given a 60-month sentence. He now contends, however, that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 by failing to ask him personally whether he wished to speak at the sentence hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s failure to afford a defendant the right of allocution will be reviewed only for plain error where the defendant did not timely object.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 938 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Prouty, </em>303 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2002)). \u2018We will correct plain error only where (1) there is an error; (2) the error is plain or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>obvious; (3) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Even assuming that the district court erred by not giving Brand an opportunity to allocute, he was not prejudiced because he could not have received a sentence of less than 60 months imprisonment \u2014 the minimum sentence required by law. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). In fact, Brand does not even argue that he was prejudiced. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
