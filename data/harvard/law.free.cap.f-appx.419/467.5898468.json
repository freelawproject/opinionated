She argues that she was actually innocent of the offense of possession of a controlled substance in connection with her illegal possession of a firearm and that the resulting enhancement of her sentence represents a miscarriage of justice. Lee also argues that the district court erred at sentencing by applying the enhancement where she had not been convicted of another offense involving the illegally possessed firearm. This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition on the pleadings de novo. <em>Kinder v. Pur-dy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 212 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">A motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 \u201cis the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence. Section 2241 is used to attack the manner in which a sentence is executed.\u201d <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255, however, a prisoner may seek relief under \u00a7 2241 from custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if she can show that the remedies provided under \u00a7 2255 are \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [her] detention.\u201d <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990) (quotation marks omitted). Lee has not shown that her \u00a7 2241 petition falls within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
