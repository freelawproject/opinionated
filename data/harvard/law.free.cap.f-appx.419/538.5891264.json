The case was tried before a jury which returned a verdict in favor of Defendants-Appellants, and the district court entered a take-nothing judgment dismissing Thomas\u2019s action. Proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis on appeal, Thomas contends only that the jury verdict was against the great weight of the evidence and that it should be reversed and his case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">Our review of the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and the applicable law, convinces us that there is no basis for our reversing the verdict of the jury or the judgment of the district court entered pursuant thereto. Accordingly, that judgment is, in all respects, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b560-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
