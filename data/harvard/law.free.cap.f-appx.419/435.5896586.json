Brito was incarcerated in Oregon at the time he filed his \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court, therefore, correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his \u00a7 2241 petition, including the issue of whether his claims are properly brought under \u00a7 2241 via the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425-26 (5th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice to refiling in the appropriate district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
