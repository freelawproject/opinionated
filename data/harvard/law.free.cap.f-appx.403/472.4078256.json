The Board found that Padilla was not a member of a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">The Padillas challenge the findings that the social group fashioned by Padilla was not \u201cdefined ... with sufficient particularity\u201d and was \u201cinsufficiently socially visible.\u201d The Padillas do not challenge the finding that their application for asylum was untimely, which we lack jurisdiction to review. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). With respect to the petition to review the denial of withholding of removal, we deny the petition for Padilla\u2019s wife because the regulation for this form of relief does not provide for derivative benefits. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c); <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 862 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">Substantial evidence supports the decision to deny Padilla\u2019s application for withholding of removal based on membership in a protected social group. A group qualifies as a \u201cparticular social group\u201d if its members share an immutable characteristic and are visible socially. <em>Castillo-Arias v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1196 (11th Cir.2006). Padilla included as members of his social group those professionals who were unwilling to collaborate and share their knowledge and skills with revolutionaries against the Colombian government. Although members of Padilla\u2019s proposed group might have undergone similar education and training, their defining attribute is \u201c[t]he risk of persecution\u201d they face, which \u201calone does not create a particular social group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198. In addition, the group described by Padilla lacks social visibility because countless persons could declare membership based on any occupational skill they possess that is desired by the revolutionaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
