The district court denied the motion based on its determination that Ellison\u2019s sentence resulted not from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in his offense but from his status as a career offender. Ellison contends that, even though he was sentenced as a career offender, his sentence was nevertheless based on the quantity of crack cocaine attributable to him and that he was therefore entitled to the benefit of the retroactive crack cocaine guidelines amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-22\">Ellison is correct that his sentence resulted in part from the amount of crack cocaine involved in his offense. Nevertheless, even had Ellison been awarded the two-level reduction resulting from the retroactive amendment, his offense level would have been reduced from 42 to 40, which, with a criminal history category of VI, would have subjected him to the same guidelines range he originally faced, 360 months to life imprisonment. Thus, the retroactive crack amendment did not have the effect of lowering Ellison\u2019s sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>range, and he was ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.lA). Because Ellison was not eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, his motion was properly-denied, and any error in the reasons given for the district court\u2019s denial was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CrimP. 52(a); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 984 (5th Cir.1997). To the extent that Ellison argues that the district court could have further reduced his sentence, considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his post-sentencing conduct, the argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-38 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b931-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
