The Petitioners claim that they will file a new notice of removal as a result of this pleading. Specifically, the Petitioners \u201crespectfully suggest their Petition for Writ of Mandamus is moot, but reserve the right to re-file same should the District Court remand the ... claims pending in the underlying litigation in the future prior to a proper adjudication.\u201d We read this representation as a request by the Petitioners to withdraw the instant petition, and we dismiss the petition on that basis. We do not address at this time whether this court otherwise lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s remand order.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-20\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b977-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
