Lewis filed a motion for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s retroactive amendments to the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses. He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of that motion and of his motion for reconsideration of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Lewis did not file a notice of appeal within ten days after the district court denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion or within ten days after the district court denied his motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(l)(A)(i) (2008); Fed. R.App. P. 26(a)(2) (2008); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (noting that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is a step in a criminal case). Lewis did request an extension of time to file his notice of appeal. However, the district court denied the motion because it was filed beyond the 10-day period for filing a notice of appeal and beyond the 30-day period in which Lewis could have obtained such an extension. More than four months after the district court denied his motion for reconsideration, Lewis filed an untimely notice of appeal in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Although Rule 4(b) is not jurisdictional, a defendant is not entitled to have his untimeliness disregarded. <em>United States v. Leijano-Cruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Lewis\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
