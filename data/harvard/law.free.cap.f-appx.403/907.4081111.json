Rogers argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on Amendments 706 and 715 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. He asserts that the refusal of the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>to grant him a sentence reduction based upon these amendments was contrary to the policy statements of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a). The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance or, alternatively, for an extension of time within which to file a brief. The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Rogers has not demonstrated that the district court wrongly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Rogers was not eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The sentence that Rogers received \u2014 i.e., the statutory maximum sentence \u2014 would remain the applicable sentence after any sentence reduction because Rogers\u2019s post-amendment guidelines range continued to exceed the statutory maximum. Thus, because the crack cocaine amendments would not have the effect of reducing Rogers\u2019s advisory guidelines range, the district court properly found that Rogers was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Rogers also argues that the district court committed procedural error and abused its discretion by failing to address the factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and by failing to adhere to the prescriptions of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, because the amendments did not impact Rogers\u2019s guidelines range, and thereby rendered him ineligible for a sentence reduction, the district court was not required to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B). Furthermore, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because such proceedings are not full resentencings. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>see also Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-93, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Rogers\u2019s arguments therefore are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">In light of the foregoing, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
