California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Muniz has filed a response. Muniz\u2019s claim that he should have received credit for the time he spent in state custody was not cognizable before the district court, and it is not cognizable on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>503 U.S. 329, 332-37, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>S.Ct. 1351, 117 L.Ed.2d 593 (1992). If Muniz seeks judicial review of the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 determination regarding credit for the time he spent in state custody, he may file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition for writ of habeas corpus after exhausting his administrative remedies. <em>See id. </em>at 335-36, 112 S.Ct. 1351. Our independent review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief, and Muniz\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
