On appeal, Sheffield argues the district court erred in finding that he could not use the single filing rule to excuse his failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Specifically, Sheffield contends that he was not required to attempt to intervene in a suit before invoking its Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) charge. He argues that the district court erred in finding that he was required to do so, and, consequently, the district court erred in dismissing his age discrimination suit. After a careful review of the record, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Sheffield filed a complaint against his former employer, United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d), alleging age discrimination and retaliation. Sheffield, who stated that he was \u201ca member of a protected class due to his age,\u201d alleged that UPS terminated him on the basis of \u201chis age and/or retaliation after voicing opposition to unlawful employment practices.\u201d Prior to bringing this cause of action, Sheffield did not file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, so he did not allege that he personally exhausted his administrative remedies. Instead he alleged that he was relying on the single filing rule to bring his claim, and identified a timely charge of discrimination filed by fellow UPS employee Vicki Washington. UPS moved to dismiss on the basis that Sheffield failed to file the required charge of discrimination with the EEOC, and that this failure was not excused because the single filing rule did not apply to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">In response, Sheffield agreed he was unable to piggyback on the Washington charge because she filed her charge of discrimination at least 180 days after Sheffield was discharged. Sheffield alleged, however, that he could piggyback on John Newton\u2019s August 30, 2006, charge of discrimination because Newton\u2019s allegations were sufficient to put UPS on notice of other claims. He also argued he was not required to intervene into an existing lawsuit as long as he satisfied the requirements of the single filing rule set forth in <em>Calloway v. Partners National Health Plans, </em>986 F.2d 446 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The district court granted UPS\u2019s motion to dismiss, reasoning that Sheffield failed demonstrate that the single filing rule applied to his case. The court found the rule inapplicable because Sheffield never attempted to intervene in any of the lawsuits upon which he sought to piggyback. On appeal, Sheffield argues the district court committed reversible error in finding that moving to intervene, and being denied, was a prerequisite to Sheffield\u2019s ability to piggyback in his separate lawsuit. Because the charge upon which Sheffield attempted to piggyback did not arise within the same time frame as his claim, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">\u2018We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss under [Rule] 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Spain v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>363 F.3d 1183, 1187 (11th Cir.2004) (citation and quotation omitted). When a district court bases its Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal solely on the plaintiffs pleading, it is not required to convert the motion to dismiss to one seeking summary judgment under Rule 56. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number><em>See Harper v. Lawrence County, Ala., </em>592 F.3d 1227, 1232 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">To withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a plaintiff must plead enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citation omitted). In evaluating the sufficiency of a plaintiffs pleadings we \u201cmake reasonable inferences\u201d in the plaintiffs favor, but the court is not required to accept the plaintiffs legal conclusions. <em>Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>578 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). We may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record. <em>Koziara v. City of Casselberry, </em>392 F.3d 1302, 1306 n. 2 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">The ADEA protects individuals who are at least 40 years of age from age discrimination in employment. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 631(a). It is firmly established that, in order to bring an action for age discrimination or retaliation under the ADEA, a plaintiff must first file a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC or appropriate state or local agency. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(d); <em>see also Bost v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>372 F.3d 1233, 1238 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe ADEA requires that an individual exhaust available administrative remedies by filing a charge of unlawful discrimination with the EEOC before filing a lawsuit\u201d). If a party fails to comply with the charge-filing requirement, he cannot assert a claim in court. <em>Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 109, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 2070, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (\u201cA claim is time barred if it is not filed within [the 180 \u2014 or 300 \u2014 day] time limits.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">The \u201csingle filing rule,\u201d sometimes referred to as the \u201cpiggybacking rule,\u201d provides a limited exception to the ADEA\u2019s charge-filing requirement. The rule provides that, in some circumstances, a plaintiff who did not file a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC may \u201cpiggyback\u201d onto a timely charge filed by another individual. <em>Calloway, </em>986 F.2d at 449-50. To qualify for this exception a plaintiff must show that \u201c(1) the relied upon charge is not invalid, and (2) the individual claims of the filing and non-filing plaintiff arise out of similar discriminatory treatment in the same time frame.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">In <em>Hipp v. Liberty National Life Insurance Co., </em>252 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir.2001) (per curiam), this Court clarified the \u201csame time frame\u201d requirement of the single filing rule. As to the proper rearward cutoff date, we concluded that application of the single filing rule \u201cshould be limited to those plaintiffs who allege discriminatory treatment within the 180 or 300 days before the representative [EEOC] charge [was] filed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1220. The \u201cforward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>scope\u201d of the single filing rule ends on the date the representative charge was filed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1225. In other words, in order to piggyback \u201ca plaintiff must have been able to file his or her charge of discrimination on the date the representative plaintiff filed the [EEOC] charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1214.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Because Sheffield\u2019s and Newton\u2019s claims did not arise within the same time frame for purposes of the single filing rule, we hold that Sheffield could not have piggybacked on Newton\u2019s charge as a matter of law. Newton was terminated on February 12, 2006, nearly eleven months before Sheffield\u2019s January 4, 2007 termination date. Newton filed his charge of discrimination with a state agency on August 30, 2006, more than four months before Sheffield was terminated. Since the forward temporal scope of the piggybacking window ends on the day the charge is filed, <em>see id. </em>at 1225, Sheffield could not piggyback on Newton\u2019s charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Sheffield argues, however, that in <em>Hipp </em>we established an exception to the general forward temporal scope where the representative charge \u201cclearly alleges a continuing, concrete policy that is illegal, such as in <em>McDonald [v. United Air Lines, Inc., </em>587 F.2d 357 (7th Cir.1978)].\u201d <em>Hipp, </em>252 F.3d at 1226. We have discussed, but declined to adopt, a \u201ccontinuing violation theory\u201d with regard to the forward scope of the single filing rule. <em>Id. </em>Under this theory, a plaintiff could utilize an EEOC charge that was filed before he was discriminated against, in order to fulfill the single filing rule. <em>Id. </em>Despite Sheffield\u2019s arguments to the contrary, in <em>Hipp </em>we specifically noted we were not deciding whether to adopt such an extension to the forward temporal scope of the single filing rule, and we decline to do so here as well.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">As noted above, one of the requirements of the single filing rule is that the claims of the plaintiff who seeks to invoke the rule and the individual who filed the charge must \u201carise out of similar discriminatory treatment in the same time frame.\u201d <em>Calloway, </em>986 F.2d at 450. Because Sheffield was discharged <em>after </em>Newton filed his charge of discrimination, and because we decline to adopt the continuing violation theory, Sheffield\u2019s termination did not arise within the same time frame as Newton\u2019s termination for purposes of the single filing rule. Since Sheffield could not have piggybacked on Newton\u2019s charge as a matter of law for this reason, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the single filing rule required Sheffield to attempt to intervene in Newton\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Consequently, we find that the district court did <em>not err </em>by granting UPS\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b480-8\">. Although \u201cfiling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court,\u201d it is a statutory requirement. <em>Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 385, 393, 398, 102 S.Ct. 1127, 1132, 1135, 71 L.Ed.2d 234 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\">. \"Whether a plaintiff must allege discriminatory treatment within 180 days or within 300 days depends on whether that plaintiff lives in a \"deferral\u201d or \"non-deferral\u201d state.\u201d <em>Hipp, </em>252 F.3d at 1214 n. 2. Georgia is a non-deferral state because it is without \"laws banning age discrimination in employment and without state entities authorized to grant or seek relief for victims of age discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Sheffield had only 180 days from the alleged discriminatory treatment to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>charge of discrimination with the EEOC. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\">. The representative charge is the EEOC charge relied upon to meet the single filing rule. <em>Id. </em>at 1225.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. Even were we to look to the Seventh Circuit's analysis in <em>McDonald </em>for guidance in this case, it is clear that the facts in <em>McDonald </em>are not analogous to the facts presented here. In <em>McDonald, </em>United Air Lines had an \"explicit discriminatory policy: a no-marriage rule for flight attendants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1226 n. 22 (citation omitted). As we explained in <em>Hipp, </em>\"[i]t was certainly reasonable to expect United to be on notice, from the filing of the first charge, that it could expect flight attendants to continue to challenge the policy until the policy was withdrawn.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast to the explicit, facially discriminatory policy challenged in <em>McDonald, </em>Newton\u2019s charge (upon which Sheffield seeks to piggyback) states only that \"[Charging party] asserts that a current pattern and practice of disparately favoring younger managers and females in [UPS\u2019s] workplace existfs] in the making of [UPS\u2019s] personnel decisions.\u201d This allegation does not come close to identifying a \"continuing, concrete policy that is illegal.\u201d Thus, even if we were to adopt the exception described in <em>McDonald, </em>it would not apply here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
