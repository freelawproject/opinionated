He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines governing crack cocaine. The Government has moved for summary affirmance or, in the alternative, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Because Mosley was sentenced to a mandatory statutory minimum, the district court lacked authority to grant a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 579-81 (5th Cir.2010); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment (n. 1(A)). Mosley\u2019s reliance on the principles set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is without merit; <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">The motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b961-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
