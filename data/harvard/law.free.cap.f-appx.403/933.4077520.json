The district court reduced Davis\u2019s sentence to 235 months of imprisonment, which constitutes the bottom of the revised guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>By moving to proceed IFP, Davis is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Contrary to Davis\u2019s assertion, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), does not apply to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Because the district court reduced Davis\u2019s sentence to the maximum extent allowed by the revised guidelines range, he is not entitled to any further reduction. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Davis has failed to demonstrate that his appeal involves legal points that are not frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See 5th Cir. </em>R. 42.2. Davis\u2019s motions for a continuance and remand are also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b959-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under die limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
