Delgado argues that the revocation sentence was unreasonable because the district court ordered that 9 months of this sentence run consecutively to a 30-month sentence imposed for a separate illegal reentry conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">We have yet to determine whether sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release are to be reviewed under the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d standard of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Prior to <em>Booker, </em>we applied a \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 119-20 (5th Cir.2005). However, we need not decide the correct standard today because Delgado\u2019s sentence is appropriate under any standard. <em>See id. </em>at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">\u201cThe district court has the discretion to order that a sentence imposed upon the revocation of supervised release run concurrently with or consecutively to other sentences.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 260 (5th Cir.2009). The district court\u2019s decision to run the revocation sentence partially consecutive to the sentence on the underlying charge was authorized by statute and is preferred under the guidelines policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) &amp; comment, (n.4.). Additionally, the sentencing transcript reflects that the district court at least implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and when imposing Delgado\u2019s revocation sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>250 F.3d 923, 930 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b908-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
