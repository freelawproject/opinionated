In determining Cheatham\u2019s sentencing guideline range, the court found that he was responsible for 30 kilograms of crack, which corresponded to a base offense level of 38. After calculating the guideline range as 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment, the court sentenced Cheatham to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">In 2008, Cheatham filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for a reduction in sentence, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), arguing that Amendment 706 of the sentencing guidelines lowered the base offense levels for crack offenses. The district court denied the motion, finding that Cheatham was ineligible for a reduction because the amendment had not lowered his base offense level due to the amount of drugs involved. Cheatham now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2129, 176 L.Ed.2d 750 (2010). A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a sentence reduction is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">A district court may modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment where the Sentencing Commission has subsequently lowered the sentencing range upon which the defendant\u2019s sentence was based as long as the reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction in the term of imprisonment is not consistent with applicable policy statements \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-17\">Amendment 706, which applies retroactively, provides for a two-level reduction in the base offense level assigned to certain amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 706; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Before Amendment 706 took effect, a defendant received a base offense level of 38 if he was held accountable for 1.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine; under the amended version of the guidelines, a base offense level of 38 applies to a defendant held accountable for 4.5 kilograms or more of crack cocaine. <em>See Davis, </em>587 F.3d at 1303 (citing U.S.S.G.App. C, Amends. 706, 711, 713; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-18\">Here, the district court determined that Cheatham was not entitled to relief. We agree. First, when the district court origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>nally determined Cheatham\u2019s sentence, it held him responsible for 30 kilograms of crack. Although Cheatham continues to dispute this quantity, we cannot revisit the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs for which Cheatham was held responsible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Davis, </em>587 F.3d at 1303 (explaining that \u201cin a \u00a7 3582(c) resentencing proceeding, the district court must maintain all original sentencing determinations apart from the original Guidelines range\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Second, because Cheatham was held responsible for more than 4.5 kilograms of crack, his base offense level remained 38 even under the amended version of \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). Thus, Cheatham\u2019s sentence was not based on a range subsequently lowered by Amendment 706, and the district court properly denied Cheatham\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-15\">. We note that Cheatham failed to raise this argument in his original appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
