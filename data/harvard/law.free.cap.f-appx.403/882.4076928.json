The district court construed Falcetta\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition as arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and dismissed the constructive \u00a7 2255 motion as successive and unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Falcetta challenges the apparent decision of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to have him serve his 191-month federal sentence consecutively to his 44-year state sentence. We previously affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of a previous \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition. <em>Falcetta v. United States, </em>155 Fed.Appx. 762 (5th Cir.2005). We construe the current petition as challenging the execution of Falcetta\u2019s sentence and thus arising under \u00a7 2241. <em>See Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Falcetta argues that the district court\u2019s intent in sentencing him, as expressed in a newspaper article, was to impose his federal sentences to run concurrently with his state sentences; that federal law presumes the concurrent service of federal and state sentences based on the same course of conduct; and that the BOP is acting in violation of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>274 F.3d 897 (5th Cir.2001), by effectively imposing more than the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d allowed by an upward departure from the sentencing range in his federal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Falcetta raised his contentions about the district court\u2019s intent and the legal presumption of concurrent sentences in his first \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Falcetta, </em>155 Fed. Appx. at 762. The instant petition is an abuse of the writ to the extent it raises issues already decided. <em>See Jennings v. Menifee, </em>214 Fed.Appx. 406, 407 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-11\">Falcetta raises his contention about BOP\u2019s alleged noncompliance with this court\u2019s <em>Martinez </em>opinion for the first time on appeal. We do not consider Falcetta\u2019s claim. <em>See Leverette. v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-12\">Falcetta\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 n. 24 (5th Cir.1997); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
