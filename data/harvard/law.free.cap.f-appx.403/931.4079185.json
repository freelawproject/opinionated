Dickson, federal prisoner # 10265-079, appeals the denial of his attempt to have his sentence reduced on the ground that the Government violated his plea agreement by allowing his sentence to be enhanced pursuant to the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines after promising to dismiss count two of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-25\">Following his conviction in 2003, Dickson did not file a direct appeal or a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He filed his first motion to reduce his sentence in 2009 and followed it with several other motions citing different provisions of federal law in an attempt to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-26\">Federal pleadings are construed \u201cliberally according to ... substance rather than ... form or label.\u201d <em>Hussain v. Boston Old Colony Ins. Co., </em>311 F.3d 623, 633 n. 39 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>459 F.3d 538, 543 (5th Cir.2006) (construing pro se pleadings liberally). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>However, if a motion cannot be construed in such a way that relief is possible, it is a \u201cmeaningless, unauthorized motion\u201d properly denied by the district court. <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141-42 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The district court correctly determined that Dickson was not entitled to relief under any of the exceptions to the rule of finality in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582. He did not file a direct appeal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(b). The Bureau of Prisons did not move to reduce his sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). Dickson did not file the motion to modify his sentence within 14 days of being sentenced. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B); Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a). The Government did not move for a sentence reduction for substantial assistance. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B); Fed.R.CrimP. 35(b). Finally, the relevant guideline was not lowered after Dickson was sentenced. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). With respect to Dickson\u2019s recent argument that he was entitled to relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), the scope of the rules of civil procedure is limited to civil actions.
