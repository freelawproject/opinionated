He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion, while its interpretation or application of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">Miles argues that the district court committed reversible error by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. He maintains that the sentencing court never made any express findings regarding the quantity of crack cocaine attributable to him, specifically whether Miles was responsible for 20 of the 22 kilograms of crack cocaine attributed to him in the presentence report (PSR). Miles also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence only where the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is actually lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2). Here, the sentencing court explicitly adopted the facts and conclusions in the PSR, including the finding that Miles was responsible for at least 22 kilograms of crack cocaine. Accordingly, because Miles was accountable for more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction based upon the crack cocaine amendments. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 706; \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) &amp; comment, (n. 10(D)(ii)). His base offense level consequently was not modified, and his advisory guidelines range was not lowered as a result of the amendments. Thus, the district court did not err in determining that Miles was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">To the extent that Miles challenges the calculation of the relevant drug quantity at his initial sentencing, that issue is beyond the scope of the guidelines amendment and is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(3), (b)(1); <em>see also United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.) (observing that \u00a7 1B1.10 is made mandatory by \u00a7 3582), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009); <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674 (\u201cA \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not the appropriate vehicle for raising [issues related to the original sentencing].\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Additionally, Miles\u2019 argument that the issue preclusion standard discussed in <em>Bobby v. Bies, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2145, 2152, 173 L.Ed.2d 1173 (2009), should be applied in his case is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-17\">Lastly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Miles\u2019s motion for a reduction in sentence without conducting an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Dickens v. Lewis, </em>750 F.2d 1251, 1255 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b978-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
