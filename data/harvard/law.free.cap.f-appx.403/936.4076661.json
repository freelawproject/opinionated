He also moves for the appointment of counsel. Crittenden pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 77 grams of cocaine base (crack cocaine) and was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to 210 months of imprisonment. By moving to proceed IFP, Crittenden is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Crittenden argues that he was entitled to a sentence reduction despite the fact that he was sentenced as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">Crittenden\u2019s guidelines imprisonment range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in the offense but rather from his status as a career offender. Therefore, the district court was correct in concluding that a sentencing reduction was not permitted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-20\">Crittenden has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Crittenden\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
