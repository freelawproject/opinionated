Brian Albritton, David Paul Rhodes, Susan Roark Waldron, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b447-6\">Before BARKETT, PRYOR and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b447-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Bharatt Dial appeals from the district court\u2019s order affirming the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s denial of his application for disability insurance benefits, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). \u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">In this case, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Dial\u2019s application on the ground that he could perform his past relevant work and other jobs in the regional economy. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ relied exclusively on the testimony of a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). However, it is undisputed that the ALJ failed to include all of Dial\u2019s employment limitations in the hypothetical questions posed to the VE. Thus, the VE\u2019s testimony did not constitute substantial evidence upon which the ALJ could rely. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1229 (11th Cir.1999); <em>Pendley v. Heckler, </em>767 F.2d 1561, 1562-63 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Nonetheless, the district court found, and the Commissioner contends, that this error was harmless because, according to the job descriptions contained in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d), Dial\u2019s past relevant work and other jobs in the regional economy would not require him to perform duties inconsistent with his employment limitations. However, while the ALJ could have chosen to rely on the DOT, he instead relied only on the testimony of the VE, who was not instructed on all of Dial\u2019s limitations. Thus, we cannot say that the ALJ\u2019s error was harmless. <em>Cf. Diorio v. Heckler, </em>721 F.2d 726, 728 (11th Cir.1983) (concluding that the ALJ\u2019s factual errors were harmless only because they were irrelevant to the ALJ\u2019s legal determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
