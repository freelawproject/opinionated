Orozlo argues that the district court clearly erred in enhancing his offense level for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony offense. Orozlo also argues that his sentence at the high end of the guideline range is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">A few different standards of review govern this appeal. We review interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Rhind, </em>289 F.3d 690, 693 (11th Cir.2002). A finding that a defendant used a firearm in connection with another felony offense is a factual finding that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Whitfield, </em>50 F.3d 947, 949 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cFor a factual finding to be clearly erroneous, [we], after reviewing all of the evidence, must be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential standard of review for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">Orozlo\u2019s argument that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for his possession of a firearm in connection with another felony fails. The Sentencing Guidelines require a four-level increase to the base offense level for an offense of unlawful possession of a firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), if \u201cthe defendant used or possessed any firearm in connection with another felony offense\u201d or possessed a firearm with \u201creason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). The guideline for attempt, solicitation, and conspiracy, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2X1.1, is applied if \u201cthe defendant used or possessed any firearm in connection with an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>other felony offense\u201d and if \u201cthe resulting offense level is greater than that determined\u201d under section 2K2.1. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(c)(1)(A). Under section 2X1.1, the base offense level is determined by the guideline applicable to the substantive offense and any enhancements \u201cestablished with reasonable certainty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Xl.l(a). The guideline for robbery offenses, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2B3.1, provides a base offense level of 20 and a three-level enhancement if \u201ca dangerous weapon was brandished or possessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2B3.1(a), (b)(2)(E). The phrase \u201canother felony offense\u201d is defined to include state offenses, and the phrase \u201canother offense\u201d is defined as \u201cany Federal, state, or local offense\u201d other than the underlying offense. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n. 14(C). Under Florida law, robbery is the \u201ctaking of money or other property which may be the subject of larceny from the person or custody of another\u201d with the intent to \u201cdeprive the person or owner of the money or other property\u201d by \u201cuse of force, violence, assault, or putting in fear.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 812.13 (West 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Orozlo possessed a firearm in connection with an attempted robbery. That finding is supported by the testimony at the sentencing hearing, which established that Orozlo was armed and intended to commit a robbery in his work as a debt collector for the Mexican Mafia. After our review of the record, we are not left with a firm conviction that the district court committed a mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Orozlo\u2019s sentence is also procedurally and substantively reasonable. The district court correctly calculated Orozlo\u2019s guideline range, treated the guidelines as advisory, and adequately explained its consideration of the relevant sentencing factors. Orozlo\u2019s sentence at the high end of the guideline range also is substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
