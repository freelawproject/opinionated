After the Sentencing Commission reduced the guidelines ranges applicable to cocaine base offenses, Williams filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) seeking a reduction of his sentence. The district court determined that Williams was not eligible for a reduction of his sentence because of the quantity of cocaine base involved in the offense. Williams gave timely notice of his appeal and has requested appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-22\">Williams contends that the district court erred in failing to reexamine its \u201cprevious mandatory guidelines sentencing calculation\u201d and relevant conduct determination. Williams invokes <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). \u201cA \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). <em>Booker </em>does not apply in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-26\">Because Williams\u2019s offense involved more than 4.5 kilograms of cocaine base, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>he was ineligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., Supp. to App. C, Amend. 706; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n. 10(D)(ii)(I)). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED. Williams\u2019s request for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b944-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
