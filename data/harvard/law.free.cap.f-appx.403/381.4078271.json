Quick argues that the Administrative Law Judge erred by giving \u201clittle weight\u201d to the opinion of Quick\u2019s treating physician and by finding Quick\u2019s testimony not fully credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-18\">Quick filed an application for disability insurance benefits on August 8, 2005. The relevant time period for this appeal is from July 26, 2003, the date he alleges his disability began, through December 31, 2004, the date he was last insured for disability insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">Quick has a long history of medical problems that includes obesity and issues with his elbows, hands, knees, legs, shoulders, and back. Before, during, and after the relevant time period, Quick was treated by Dr. Walter Choung, an orthopaedic surgeon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ gave little weight to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the opinion of Dr. Choung because it was not supported by his own clinical treatment notes. The ALJ also discredited Quick\u2019s testimony regarding the persistence, intensity, and limiting effects of his symptoms during the relevant time period because that testimony was inconsistent with what he told Dr. Choung. Based in part on these findings the ALJ denied Quick\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Appeals Council denied Quick\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. On judicial review, the parties consented to having a magistrate judge decide the matter. The magistrate judge affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u201cWe review the Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on proper legal standards.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997)). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1439) \u201cEven if the evidence preponderates against the Commissioner\u2019s findings, we must affirm if the decision reached is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1159-60 (quoting <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\u201c[T]he testimony of a treating physician must be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>125 F.3d at 1440. We have \u201cfound good cause where the doctors\u2019 opinions were conclusory or inconsistent with their own medical records.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">Here, the ALJ had good cause to give \u201clittle weight\u201d to Dr. Choung\u2019s contentions because his written evaluation of Quick was inconsistent with his own clinical treatment notes. Specifically, in a residual functional capacity evaluation prepared by Dr. Choung, he wrote that based on Quick\u2019s condition from June 29, 2001 to January 27, 2005, Quick could not work for more than one hour per day. According to the report, the sole basis for Dr. Choung\u2019s assessment was that Quick had degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">The record, however, shows that although Dr. Choung examined Quick on sixteen different occasions during the relevant time period, he never wrote in his clinical treatment notes that Quick had complained about his back, nor did he ever write that he had physically examined Quick\u2019s back. Instead, Dr. Choung received complaints about, and examined, Quick\u2019s right elbow, right hand, left shoulder, and left knee. <em>After </em>the relevant time period, however, on eight occasions Dr. Choung wrote in his clinical notes that Quick had complaints about his back.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">The ALJ may discredit the claimant\u2019s subjective testimony, but \u201che must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002). Here, the ALJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>found that Quick\u2019s testimony was contradicted by evidence indicating that his back problems did not escalate until after the relevant time period. Quick testified that during the relevant time period he was disabled due to his \u201clower back,\u201d where his pain was a \u201cnine\u201d out of ten, with ten being the greatest amount of pain he could experience. If this were true, it is reasonable to expect that Quick would have complained to Dr. Choung about his back problems as he did on eight different occasions after the relevant time period. However, as we have discussed, during the relevant time period there is no indication that he ever complained to Dr. Choung about his back or that Dr. Choung ever physically examined Quick\u2019s back.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The ALJ also found that Quick\u2019s testimony concerning the persistence, intensity, and limiting effects of his symptoms during the relevant time period not to be fully credible because it was contradicted by improvements in his conditions noted by Dr. Choung. That finding is also supported by the record. Dr. Cheung\u2019s clinical notes on August 29, 2003 state \u201c[t]he patient has noted some improvement in regards to pain radiation to the dorsum of the forearm,\u201d and his notes on April 22, 2004 state \u201c[t]here has been significant improvement since his last visit,\u201d and his notes on May 6, 2004 state \u201c[Quick] has made improvements since his last visit,\u201d and his notes on June 24, 2004 state \u201c[Quick] has noted some improvement,\u201d and his notes on August 16, 2004 state \u201c[Quick] notes that he continues to improve.\u201d Accordingly, the ALJ articulated adequate reasons for discrediting Quick\u2019s testimony and substantial evidence supports his finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-10\">. Quick was also treated by Dr. M. Allam Reheem, a pain management specialist. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Quick also argues that the ALJ erred by discrediting the opinion of Dr. Raheem. Quick, however, failed to preserve that argument by raising it in the district court. <em>See Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-16\">.
