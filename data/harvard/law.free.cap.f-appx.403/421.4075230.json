Appellant First American Title Insurance Company (\u201cFirst American\u201d) argues that the district court erred in denying requests for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to section 768.79, Florida Statutes. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">Plaintiff Hon Realty Corp. commenced this action by filing a Petition for Declaratory Judgment in federal court. (R.l-1.) The parties\u2019 basic dispute was whether the title insurance that Hon Realty purchased from First American in 2005 covered the encumbrances or liens that were the subject of an Enforcement Order the City of Miami issued in July 2005, but not recorded until fourteen days after Hon Realty purchased the subject property in October 2005. Based on the language of an explicit exclusion from coverage in the policy, the district court concluded that coverage did not exist for any defect that was not recorded in the public records on the effective date of the policy and, consequently, that First American afforded no coverage for the Hon Realty\u2019s claim. (R.2-52 at 4-7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">Upon entry of judgment in its favor, First American moved for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees based on a $500 Offer of Judgment made to Hon Realty in July 2007, that Hon Realty did not accept. (R.2-53.) While the district court was deciding the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, Hon Realty had appealed the entry of summary judgment to this court. We affirmed, and remanded to the district court First American\u2019s application for appellate attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cfor a determination of entitlement and the reasonable amount of appellate attorney\u2019s fees, if any, to be awarded.\u201d (R.2-71 at 1.) For the same reasons stated in its order denying attorneys\u2019 fees for work in the district court, the district court denied First American\u2019s motion for appellate attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\">Upon careful consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree with the district court\u2019s well-reasoned analysis, concluding that First American was not entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees or appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees from Hon Realty because this case \u201cis the type of declaratory judgment action to which Florida\u2019s fee-shifting statute ... do[es] <em>not </em>apply....\u201d (R.2-6S at 12.) Under Florida law, an offer of judgment is unenforceable for taxing attorneys\u2019 fees and costs if the case is not a civil action for damages. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 768.79 (\u201cIn any civil action for damages ... if a defendant files an offer of judgment which is not accepted by the plaintiff ... the defendant shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees ... \u201d); <em>Nat\u2019l Indem. Co. of the S. v. Consol. Ins. Svcs., </em>778 So.2d 404, 408 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001) (holding that a declaratory judgment is not a civil action for damages). Because this ease is, at its heart, a declaratory action and not a civil action for damages as First American argues, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
