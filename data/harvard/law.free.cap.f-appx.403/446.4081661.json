The district court sentenced Berra-Ozuna to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment and he appeals on two grounds. First, he argues that his sentence was proeedurally unreasonable be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>cause the district court based it on \u201cunwarranted conclusions\u201d and \u201cunreliable information.\u201d Second, he argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is longer than necessary to comply with the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Upon review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Additionally, we review the sentencing court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See id. </em>On appeal, determining reasonableness is a two-step inquiry. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We first examine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error. <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is procedurally sound, we then review for substantive reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Berra-Ozuna, a native of Mexico, has been deported or removed from the United States seven times. Most recently, he was arrested for possessing a vehicle containing a false or secret compartment in violation of Georgia law. Berra-Ozuna pleaded guilty to illegal re-entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2). At the sentencing hearing, the district court departed upward <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>: it increased Berra-Ozuna\u2019s criminal-history category by two levels and sentenced him to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> BerraOzuna filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-12\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Berra-Ozuna argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court based his sentence, in part, on facts that were not set forth in the pre-sentence investigation report. A sentence is procedurally reasonable if the district court, <em>inter alia, </em>did not select a sentence based upon clearly erroneous facts. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">Berra-Ozuna\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable because it was not based on clearly erroneous facts. The district court based its sentence on BerraOzuna\u2019s prior conviction for discharging a weapon on a public highway, his gang membership, his arrest in a ear that contained a secret compartment, and, most pertinently, his prior conviction for re-entry. All of these facts were either admitted by Berra-Ozuna in his post-arrest statement or contained in the PSI, which neither party objected to before sentencing. Further, the court adequately articulated its reasons for departing upward at the sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, Berra-Ozuna\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-15\">We now turn to the substantive reasonableness of Berra-Ozuna\u2019s sentence. He argues that the district court\u2019s sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>tence of 24 month\u2019s imprisonment was too long to be reasonable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). A sentence is substantively reasonable if it is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. The weight accorded to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is left to the district court\u2019s discretion, <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d, 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005), and the court need not explicitly address each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, so long as it is clear from the record that the court considered the defendant\u2019s arguments in light of the factors. <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">During Berra-Ozuna\u2019s sentencing, the district court considered Berra-Ozuna\u2019s history and characteristics as required by \u00a7 3553(a). The court focused on his criminal history and repeated illegal entry into the United States. Furthermore, the court discussed the need to promote respect for the law and deter future criminal conduct: \u201c[I]f you have a prior conviction for illegal reentry, that shows that it\u2019s going to take something more to get your attention than whatever the previous sentence was.\u201d Berra-Ozuna\u2019s sentence, eight months longer than the recommended sentence under the guidelines and 18 years less than the statutory maximum, is substantively reasonable for a defendant who has been repeatedly removed from the United States and commits crimes while here illegally.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\">. Though the district judge did not reference a specific guideline provision, the court's sentence appears to be an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l), which is warranted when \"reliable information indicates that the defendant's criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b473-17\">. The probation officer calculated a guidelines range of 10-16 months; the statutory maximum is 20 years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b474-7\">. Under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(D), a sentence should to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed education or vocational training or medical care.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
