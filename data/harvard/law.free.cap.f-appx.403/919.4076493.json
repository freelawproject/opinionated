Following amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines reducing the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, Jackson filed a motion for a sentencing reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The court granted the motion and reduced Jackson\u2019s sentence on the drug possession count to 137 months, within the amended range of 110 to 137 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-23\">Jackson now appeals. He argues that the district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors was insufficient; that the court failed to give sufficient consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, particularly his postsentencing rehabilitation efforts; that because the Guidelines are advisory after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court had authority to reduce his sentence below the amended range; and that his resulting sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-24\">Jackson\u2019s arguments are without merit. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a full re-sentencing subject to the mandates of <em>Booker. Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). We review for abuse of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>rather than under the <em>Booker </em>reasonableness standard, and we find none. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). The district court expressly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Jackson\u2019s postsentencing conduct. This was sufficient. <em>See id. </em>at 673-74. Further, as the court had no obligation to reduce Jackson\u2019s sentence at all, it did not abuse its discretion by failing to reduce it further within the amended guidelines range. <em>See id. </em>at 673. Finally, the district court had no authority to reduce Jackson\u2019s sentence below the amended range. <em>See Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b945-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
