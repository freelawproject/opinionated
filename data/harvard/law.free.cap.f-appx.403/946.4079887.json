He argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion; that the district court should have reduced his sentence based on the recent crack cocaine guidelines amendments; and that his statutory mandatory minimum sentence was improperly based on his pri- or conviction for simple possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). Because Sandle was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 240 months of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), the district court lacked authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum sentence. <em>See United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 577, 579-81 (5th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Robinson, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 941, 942 (5th Cir.2009). Sandle\u2019s reliance on <em>Spears v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 840, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009), is misplaced as <em>Spears </em>did not involve a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Spears, </em>129 S.Ct. at 841-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-10\">Sandle\u2019s argument challenging his original sentencing may not be raised in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion \u201cis not a second opportunity to present mitigating factors to the sentencing judge, nor is it a challenge to the appropriateness of the original sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, this argument is not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
