On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in determining that it lacked the authority to sentence him below the statutory minimum sentence because his sentence was unreasonable and violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">We review the legality of a criminal sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1360 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008). Additionally, the constitutionality of a statute is a question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Cespedes, </em>151 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), a court \u201cshall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes set forth in the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), a conviction for manufacturing 5 grams or more of cocaine base carries a statutory minimum sentence of 5 years, and maximum sentence of 40 years, in prison. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (2009). In the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Congress raised the threshold required to trigger the 5-year statutory minimum sentence for cocaine base from 5 grams to 28 grams. Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, \u00a7 2(b), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). It also eliminated the mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack cocaine. Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have held that district courts remain bound by statutes designating mandatory-minimum sentences. <em>Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1362. Noting that <em>Booker </em>made advisory the Sentencing Guidelines, but not mandatory m\u00ednimums enacted by Congress, we held that <em>Booker\u2019s </em>instruction that district courts must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in fashioning a reasonable sentence does not authorize using those factors to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory minimum. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, we have directly held that the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of \u00a7 841(b)(1) do not violate due process by depriving defendants of individualized sentencing proceedings because they merely establish the minimum and maximum number of years to which a defendant may be sentenced. <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>838 F.2d 1175, 1177 (11th Cir.1988). We have also held that the manda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>tory minimum sentencing provisions of \u00a7 841(b)(1) do not deprive defendants of their Sixth Amendment right to assistance of counsel, or violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment or the separation of powers doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The Supreme Court has held that the crack cocaine guidelines, like other guidelines, are merely advisory, and that district courts have the discretion to vary from those guidelines pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a) if they result in a sentence greater than necessary to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes. <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 107-09, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). And in <em>Spears v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court affirmed that its holding in <em>Kimbrough </em>recognized that district courts have the authority to vary from the crack cocaine guidelines based on a policy disagreement with those guidelines, and do not need to make an individualized determination that they produce an excessive sentence in a particular case. 555 U.S. 261, 129 S.Ct. 840, 842-43, 172 L.Ed.2d 596 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">The U.S. Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o Bill of Attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.\u201d U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3. \u201cA bill of attainder is a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.\u201d <em>Houston v. Williams, </em>547 F.3d 1357, 1364 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Gordon concedes that his argument that the district court had the authority to impose a sentence below the statutory minimum is foreclosed by our precedent, as is his claim that his mandatory-minimum sentence is unconstitutional. <em>Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1362. While Gordon argues that the Sixth Amendment and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors have been strengthened since we last addressed that issue, he does not cite any new precedent or changes in the law to support this contention. Furthermore, the changes in crack cocaine sentencing pursuant to the recent Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, even if applied to Gordon, would not have changed his statutory minimum sentence because he was convicted of a manufacturing offense involving 33 grams of cocaine base, which remains over the new 28-gram threshold required to trigger a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 \u00a7 2(b). We therefore follow our precedent and hold that \u00a7 3553(a) did not give the district court the discretion to impose a sentence below Gordon\u2019s five-year statutory minimum sentence. <em>Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Moreover, the district court was not required to apply the cocaine guidelines in place of the cocaine base guidelines. Although <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Spears </em>give district courts the authority to vary from the crack cocaine guidelines ratio, they do not require that district courts do so. Notably, the district court stated at sentencing that the five-year minimum sentence complied with the statutory purposes of sentencing reflected in \u00a7 3553(a), and Gordon has offered no legal basis to show that the district court\u2019s assessment was incorrect on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Finally, as for his claim that requiring his sentence to conform to the statutory minimum violates the constitutional prohibition against bills of attainder, there is no plain error since the statutory minimum sentence in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), which does not itself determine the guilt of or inflict punishment upon any identifiable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>individual, is not a bill of attainder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ah1\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-17\">. Because Gordon raises this argument for the first time on appeal, we review it only for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). To establish plain error, Gordon \"must show that there is (1) error (2) that is plain and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights.\" <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotations omitted). If those conditions are met, we have discretion to address the forfeited error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Error is not plain in the \"absence of any controlling precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
