No reversible error has been shown; we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-21\">Petitioner, who had lawful permanent resident status, was convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. According to the criminal information, Petitioner attempted to cash two improperly obtained checks, totaling $408,000; but his efforts were unsuccessful. His offense resulted in no actual monetary loss to the bank. The BIA concluded that the conviction qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(U) (\u201csubsection (U)),\u201d as it related to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M) (\u201csubsection (M)\u201d), because the conviction involved an attempt to deprive the victim of more than $10,000. The BIA determined that a conviction under subsection (U) required proof of only potential, and not actual, losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">We first address the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal, in part, for lack of jurisdiction. While we lack jurisdiction over final removal orders against aliens who are removable for committing certain criminal offenses, we do have jurisdiction over questions of law. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D). And whether a petitioner\u2019s conviction constitutes an aggravated felony \u2014 the issue Petitioner raises in this appeal \u2014 is a question of law that falls within our jurisdiction. <em>Balogun v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>425 F.3d 1356, 1360 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Cir.2005). So we deny the government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">On appeal, Petitioner argues that his conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony because he was convicted of substantive bank fraud (not conspiracy or attempt), which required an actual loss under subsection (M). He also contends that, even if his conviction did constitute an attempt under subsection (U), an actual loss still was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s interpretation of a statute <em>de novo, </em>but we defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation \u201cif it is reasonable and does not contradict the clear intent of Congress.\u201d Jagg<em>ernauth v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.2005). The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is removable must be supported by \u201cclear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.\u201d <em>See Woodby v. INS, </em>385 U.S. 276, 87 S.Ct. 483, 488, 17 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Subsections (M) and (U) define the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">(M) an offense that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqE\">(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000; ... [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">(U) an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0f9\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M), (U).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">We conclude that the BIA committed no error in determining that Petitioner\u2019s conviction constituted an aggravated felony. Petitioner notes correctly that he was not convicted of conspiracy pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; but his conviction still qualifled as an \u201cattempt or conspiracy\u201d for purposes of subsection (U). The judgment indicated that Petitioner was adjudged guilty of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of section 1344. The information to which he pleaded guilty charged him with \u201cknowingly and intentionally conspiring] to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud a financial institution.\u201d And the statute of conviction encompassed both bank fraud and \u201cattempts to execute\u201d bank fraud. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344. Therefore, because Petitioner\u2019s crime was described as a conspiracy, and he was convicted under a statute that included attempt, the BIA reasonably concluded that the conviction constituted \u201can attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense\u201d under subsection (U).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">That an intended loss suffices for purposes of an attempted-fraud offense is plain from reading subsections (M) and (U) together. The phrase \u201cattempt or conspiracy to commit\u201d in subsection (U) modifies the entire description of the other offenses listed in that section. So, subsection (U), read in conjunction with subsection (M), refers to \u201can attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense\u201d that, if successful, would \u201cinvolve[ ] fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M), (U). A contrary conclusion would mean, as in this case, that an unsuccessful attempt to commit fraud in excess of $10,000 would never constitute an aggravated felony so long as there was no actual loss. This reading would render subsection (U) meaningless when fraud is the underlying offense, violating the well-established prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>ciple of avoiding statutory interpretations that render portions of the statute meaningless. <em>See Huff v. DeKalb County, </em>516 F.3d 1273, 1280 (11th Cir.2008) (explaining that statutes should be read as a \u201cconsistent whole\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Here, the information showed that Petitioner attempted to cash checks well in excess of the requisite $10,000. And contrary to Petitioner\u2019s argument, the BIA was not barred from considering the information in determining whether the loss amount exceeded $10,000. <em>See Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 2298, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009) (concluding that the $10,000 amount in subsection (M) refers not to a statutory element of the underlying crime of fraud or deceit, but instead, \u201cto the particular circumstances in which an offender committed a (more broadly defined) fraud or deceit crime on a particular occasion\u201d). Where there is a guilty plea, as in this case, the BIA is not limited to considering the written plea documents and the plea colloquy in determining the amount of loss under subsection (M). <em>Id. </em>at 2302-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">Because Petitioner\u2019s conviction constituted an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense involving fraud that had an intended loss exceeding $10,000, the BIA did not err in concluding that the conviction constituted an aggravated felony under subsection (U). Petitioner\u2019s argument that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility hinges on his argument that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony. Because Petitioner was convicted of an aggravated felony, he is precluded from receiving a waiver of inadmissibility. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">PETITION DENIED, MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\">. Petitioner argues that it is unclear under which subsection the BIA found him removable. That the BIA concluded Petitioner's conviction qualified as an aggravated felony as defined in subsection (U), not (M), is clear from its order. But because subsection (U) encompassed \"an attempt or conspiracy to commit\u201d an offense listed in section 1101(a)(43), the BIA necessarily discussed the offense in conjunction with subsection (M), which described the underlying offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\">. This reading of the statute also comports with the BIA\u2019s interpretation that subsection (U) requires only an intended loss. <em>See In re: Onyido, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 552, 554-55 (1999) (subsection (U) does not require an actual loss exceeding $10,000 because a conviction for attempt naturally \"involves an unsuccessful effort to commit a crime\u201d). And we must defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation as long as it is reasonable and does not contradict Congress\u2019s clear intent. <em>Jaggernauth, </em>432 F.3d at 1350.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b491-24\">. The BIA also determined that Petitioner was removable because his conviction constituted a crime of moral turpitude, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i). On appeal, Petitioner does not contest this determination. A conviction for a crime of moral turpitude does not automatically preclude a waiver of inadmissibility; but Petitioner\u2019s conviction for an aggravated felony does.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
