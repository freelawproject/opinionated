Grado-Saenz concedes that precedent forecloses his argument that the lack of an empirical basis for U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 precludes an appellate presumption that his sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-26\">Grado-Saenz contends that his sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Grado-Saenz avers that the guidelines range overstated the seriousness of his offense because his conduct was not violent and that the guidelines range did not properly account for his personal history and characteristics, including his motive for reentering.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-27\">We review the sentence for reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 56, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because it is within the properly calculated guidelines range, Grado-Saenz\u2019s sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 350-51, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366. Grado-Saenz offers no persuasive reason for us to disturb that presumption. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-28\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b927-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
