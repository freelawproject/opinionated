(\u201cSunTrust\u201d) and denial of their motion to vacate this award. Appellants argue that the district court erred when it declined to vacate the award because the arbitrator displayed \u201cevident partiality\u201d toward Sun-Trust and committed misconduct in violation of 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10(a)(2) and (a)(3). SunTrust argues that Appellants\u2019 challenge to the arbitration award is frivolous and seeks sanctions. After thorough review, we affirm and remand to the district court for imposition of sanctions in an amount to be determined by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">\u201cWe review confirmations of arbitration awards and denials of motions to vacate arbitration awards under the same standard, reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Frazier v. CitiFinancial Corp., </em>604 F.3d 1313, 1321 (11th Cir.2010). The Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) provides that upon either party\u2019s motion, the court must confirm the arbitrator\u2019s award \u201cunless [it] is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of [the statute].\u201d <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 9. Section 10 of the FAA provides for vacatur of an arbitration award only in four narrow circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">(1) where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; (2) where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them; (3) where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) where the arbitrators exceeded their powers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-15\">The FAA presumes that arbitration awards will be confirmed, and \u201cfederal courts should defer to an arbitrator\u2019s decision whenever possible.\u201d <em>Frazier, </em>604 F.3d at 1321 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">Appellants argue that the arbitrator was partial toward SunTrust because she determined that Ogum was not a party to the arbitration and failed to consider Ogum\u2019s claims. Appellants further argue that the arbitrator was partial because she did not allow Appellants to conduct a deposition, even though she allowed SunTrust to conduct \u201cextensive\u201d depositions of the Appellants. Appellants also argue that the arbitrator committed misconduct, and showed favoritism, by not postponing the arbitration hearing. SunTrust disputes these allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">We conclude that Appellants have failed to prove any grounds justifying vacatur of the arbitration award under the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10. \u201c[A]n arbitration award may be vacated due to the \u2018evident partiality\u2019 of an arbitrator only when either (1) an actual conflict exists, or (2) the arbitrator knows of, but fails to disclose, information which would lead a reasonable person to believe that a potential conflict exists.\u201d <em>Univ. Commons-Urbana, Ltd. v. Universal Constructors, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 1331, 1337 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Appellants have provided no evidence to support their claims of partiality and misconduct. They point to only the arbitration award itself as evidence, but the award on its face does not reveal any actual or potential conflict of interest or impropriety. The language of the arbitration award undercuts Appellants\u2019 argument that the arbitrator excluded Ogum\u2019s claims. The award states that both World Business and Ogum were parties to the action. The award also explains that the arbitrator found in favor of SunTrust on <em>\u201cClaimants\u2019 </em>claims against [the bank].\u201d The award settled \u201call claims and counterclaims submitted to this Arbitration\u201d and denied \u201call claims not expressly addressed herein.\u201d Nor does the language of the award support Appellants\u2019 claims that their requests for depositions and postponement of the hearing were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Further, as the district court noted, Appellants have failed to present any transcript of the arbitration proceedings that would allow this Court to meaningfully review the challenged rulings of the arbitrator. <em>Cf. id. </em>(denying motion to vacate arbitration award in part because, absent hearing transcript, courts \u201ccannot ascertain from the bare-bones statement of the award what principle of law the arbitrators purportedly chose to ignore\u201d). Thus Appellants have not provided this Court with any evidentiary support for their assertions. This lack of evidence is especially problematic where, as here, the opposing party disputes the factual basis for the claims of misconduct and partiality. We conclude that Appellants have failed to support their claims of misconduct and partiality and have therefore failed to establish adequate grounds to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">SunTrust asks this Court to impose sanctions on Appellants for assuming a \u201cnever-say-die attitude\u201d after losing the arbitration award and \u201cdrag[ging] the dispute through the court system without an objectively reasonable belief [they] will prevail.\u201d <em>See B.L. Harbert Intern., LLC v. Hercules Steel Co., </em>441 F.3d 905, 913 (11th Cir.2006), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Frazier v. CitiFinancial Corp., </em>604 F.3d 1313, 1321 (11th Cir.2010). We have warned litigants that we are \u201cready, willing, and able to consider imposing sanctions in appropriate cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 914. We have recognized that \u201cArbitration\u2019s allure is dependent upon the arbitrator being the last decision maker in all but the most unusual cases\u201d and that when litigants pursue baseless contests of arbitration awards, \u201cthe promise of arbitration is broken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">In <em>Hercules Steel, </em>we considered but ultimately declined to impose sanctions. We justified our decision by highlighting that the party contesting the award had marshaled some support, albeit weak, for its position; the opposing party never requested sanctions; and the contesting party did not have the benefit of the notice and warning that our opinion in <em>Hercules Steel </em>provides. <em>Id. </em>at 914. Our <em>Hercules Steel </em>decision put parties on notice \u201cthat this Court is exasperated by those who attempt to salvage arbitration losses through litigation that has no sound basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>in the law applicable to arbitration awards.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The factors we considered in <em>Hercules Steel </em>weigh in favor of a finding that Appellants\u2019 conduct warrants sanctions. Unlike in <em>Hercules Steel, </em>Appellants have failed to muster any controlling authority to support their position. Appellants cite to only one case, decided by a California state court, for support in their entire six-page long appellate brief. Appellants never filed a reply brief. Although SunTrust did not move for sanctions in the district court, it has expressly requested for this Court to impose sanctions on appeal. Further, Appellants had the benefit of the notice and warning that our <em>Hercules Steel </em>opinion provides about our willingness to impose sanctions to deter baseless contests of arbitration awards. Based on this record, we conclude that sanctions should be imposed upon Appellants for bringing this frivolous appeal. We remand to the district court with directions to determine the appropriate amount of the sanction to be awarded to SunTrust.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
