He appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the Government\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on the retroactive amendment to the crack cocaine guideline. The district court granted a two-level reduction to his total offense level and sentenced him to the lowest available sentence under the amended guidelines range, 324 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-24\">Ruiz contends that the district court erred by granting the Government\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without providing him notice, the opportunity to respond, or an evidentiary hearing. He argues that the district court failed to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and his postconviction conduct in imposing the reduced sentence and further argues that the district court\u2019s failure to provide notice and a hearing foreclosed him from seeking an additional sentencing reduction, urging that the two-level reduction awarded was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>Ruiz has failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the district court\u2019s part. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). The record demonstrates that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 298 (5th Cir.2009). The true nature of Ruiz\u2019s argument is not that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in formulating the sentence imposed but that the district court failed to vary below the amended guidelines range based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and its progeny. The argument is meritless. <em>Booker </em>does not apply to sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and a district court considering such a motion may not impose a sentence below the amended guideline range. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">Moreover, because the district court granted Ruiz all possible available relief under the retroactive amendment to the crack guideline, any error resulting from its failure to provide him with notice, the opportunity to respond, or a hearing was harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim,P. 52(a); <em>see also United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 984 (5th Cir.1997). The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b932-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
