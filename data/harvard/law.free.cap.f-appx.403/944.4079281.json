Ortiz contends that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by 16 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii), because he was convicted prior to his removal of the Texas offense of aggravated assault. The Government contends that this issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Guillen-Alvarez, </em>489 F.3d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">Ortiz concedes that this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1428, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To show plain error, Ortiz must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Because Ortiz\u2019s argument attempting to distinguish <em>Guillen-Alvarez </em>involves an extension of the law, it could not have been clear or obvious error. <em>See United States v. Trejo, </em>610 F.3d 308, 319 (5th Cir.2010). The motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED and the alternative motion for an extension of time within which to file an appellate brief is DENIED AS UNNECESSARY. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b971-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
