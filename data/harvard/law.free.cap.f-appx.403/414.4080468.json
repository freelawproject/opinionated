She argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because it exceeds what is necessary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, she claims that the district court placed overly great weight on her criminal history without properly taking into consideration her ongoing mental treatment and psychological problems caused by various traumatic life events.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">We review a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, we must determine whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the [sentencing] Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court need not have discussed each \u00a7 3553(a) factor individually, but need only have acknowledged that it considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">If we determine that the district court\u2019s decision was procedurally sound, we next consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, taking into account \u201cthe totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Where the sentence falls within the guideline range, we are free to apply a presumption of reasonableness, <em>id:, </em>the district court need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). To ensure that the sentence imposed is reasonable, we may compare it to the statutory maximum. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006) (upholding a sentence as reasonable in part because it was \u201cappreciably below\u201d the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">Because our review is deferential \u2014 not <em>de novo </em>\u2014 we will not substitute our judgment for the discretion of the district court in according weight to the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). Although a district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on any one \u00a7 3553(a) factor can indicate an unreasonable sentence, <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008), a district court is free to attach \u201cgreat weight\u201d to one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>factor over others. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009) (citations omitted). Moreover, the fact that we might \u201creasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. A district court should consider \u201cevery convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, 128 S.Ct. 586. (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201c[t]he uniqueness of the individual case ... does not change the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review that applies to all sentencing decisions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Finally, the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include, <em>inter alia: </em>the applicable sentencing-guidelines range; the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records; the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history and characteristics of the defendant; and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense and adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2), (4) &amp; (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Upon sentencing Munoz-Angeles, the district court acknowledged that it had considered the statements of the parties, the pre-sentence investigation report with its advisory guidelines, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Since the district court committed no procedural error \u2014 and Munoz-Angeles does not argue otherwise \u2014 the only question remaining for us is whether the sentence was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the record and \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported a sentence of 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. A sentence of 16 months falls within the guidelines range and is far below the statutory maximum of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Moreover, the record does not support Munoz-Angeles\u2019s claim that the district court placed unjustifiably great weight on her criminal history \u2014 the court acted within its discretion when it accorded weight to her history and characteristics, including her criminal record. As her sentencing hearing was advanced only by five days, Munoz-Angeles had sufficient time (over two months between the plea hearing and sentencing hearing), to submit documentation about her mental health and treatment. However, Munoz-Angeles failed to submit any such evidence at the sentencing hearing, and she did not object to the statements in the pre-sentence investigation report that she had not been diagnosed with any mental disorder. The district court took account of Munoz-Angeles\u2019s individual circumstances when deciding her sentence; we will not substitute our judgment for its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing her to 16 months\u2019 imprisonment. Munoz-Angeles has failed to carry the burden of establishing that her sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
