The district court reduced Love\u2019s base offense level by two levels in accordance with the amendments to the Guideline governing cocaine base offenses, and it reduced Love\u2019s sentence to 220 months of imprisonment, which was within the amended guidelines range. We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, and its interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671-72 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-27\">Love argues that the district court should have reduced his sentence to the bottom of the amended guidelines range. He also contends that the district court erred because it failed to address the application of an enhancement for reckless endangerment.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>The district court was under no obligation to reduce Love\u2019s sentence at all under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), and thus, it was under no obligation to reduce it even further within the recalculated range. <em>See id. </em>at 673. Because issues relating to the original sentencing are not cognizable under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court did not err in failing to address the reckless endangerment enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Love\u2019s motion to file a supplemental brief, and his motion to supplement and/or clarify the Government\u2019s brief, are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
