Because Reed\u2019s appeal fails on the merits, we need not reach the Government\u2019s timeliness-of-appeal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">Reed is serving a 240-month sentence for possession, with intent to distribute, less than five grams of cocaine base. In March 2008, he filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based upon Amendment 706 to the Guidelines (lowering the base offense levels applicable to cocaine-base offenses).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">Reed contends the district court abused its discretion in: denying his motion for reconsideration without stating reasons; denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because the court made only a general reference to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and stating he was a public safety threat without support in the record. Further, Reed maintains the district court erred by <em>not </em>appointing him counsel in connection with his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion and <em>not </em>allowing him to respond to the Government\u2019s opposition to his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-17\">A district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). There is <em>no </em>abuse of discretion if the record shows the court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors (nature and circumstances of the offense, defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, adequate deterrence, public protection, rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>vant Guidelines policy statements, and avoidance of sentence disparities). <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995). In this case, the district court did <em>not </em>abuse its discretion because the court expressly stated it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and relevant public safety concerns before denying Reed\u2019s request for sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Reed did <em>not </em>request appointment of counsel in connection with his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion; accordingly, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hereford, </em>385 Fed.Appx. 366, 367-68 (5th Cir.2010). To establish plain error, Reed must show, <em>inter alia, </em>a clear or obvious error affecting his substantial rights. <em>E.g., Puckett v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Because a defendant has <em>no </em>statutory or constitutional right to appointed counsel in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, there is no plain error. <em>Hereford, </em>385 Fed.Appx. at 367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Last, Reed fails to show the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without first allowing him to respond to the Government\u2019s opposition motion: he has <em>not </em>demonstrated a response would have affected the outcome of the district court\u2019s decision; and he is <em>not </em>entitled to a hearing in connection with his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.CrimP. 43(b)(4); <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>No. 97-60326, 1998 WL 546471, *3 (5th Cir. 6 Aug. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b992-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
