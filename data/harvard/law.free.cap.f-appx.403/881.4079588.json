The BIA found Heredia ineligible for cancellation of removal because his 1997 Texas conviction of possession of marijuana constituted an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.</p>\n<p id=\"A41\">Because none of Heredia\u2019s Texas drug convictions were based upon the fact of a prior conviction, the BIA erred by determining that he had committed an aggravated felony and that, as a result, he was ineligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 2580, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). Heredia\u2019s petition for review is GRANTED. The order of the BIA is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to allow him to pursue cancellation of removal in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Carachuri-Rosendo.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b907-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
