Section 3582(c)(2) allows a district court to reduce a term of imprisonment that was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by\u201d an amendment to the Guidelines. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Eligibility for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction \u201cis triggered only by an amendment ... that lowers the applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)); <em>see United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Although the crack cocaine amendment reduced Garrett\u2019s offense level, it did not reduce his sentencing range, which remained 360 months to life in prison. Therefore, he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (n. 1(A)); <em>Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">Garrett argues that the sentencing court should have exercised its discretion under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and imposed a \u201creasonable\u201d sentence below the guidelines range based on the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that his sentence was not reasonable due to the disparity between it and the sentences imposed on co-conspirators. <em>Booker </em>does not apply to a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Accordingly, a movant under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is entitled at most to the reduction allowed by the amended guidelines range, and a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce the sentence any further than that allowed by the amendment. <em>Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238. Because Garrett was not entitled to a sentence reduction based on the crack amendment, no relief is available under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b948-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
