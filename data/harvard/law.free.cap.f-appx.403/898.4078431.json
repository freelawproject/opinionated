He contends that (1) his criminal history was overstated due to the double-counting of his prior sexual assault conviction in both his criminal history and his offense level calculations; (2) his short incarceration for 120 days for the sexual assault conviction indicated that his 46-month sentence was greater than necessary to deter future crime or protect the public; and (3) nothing in the record demonstrated that his sentence was necessary to provide him with educational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Lopez argues that although he did not object to the reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, no such objection was necessary to preserve the issue for review. He also argues that an appellate presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his sentence because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not supported by empirical data. Lopez correctly acknowledges, however, that these arguments are foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent, and he asserts that he is raising them only to preserve them for future review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">The record demonstrates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and Lopez\u2019s arguments at sentencing before determining that Lopez\u2019s within-guidelines sentence was fair and reasonable, and thus Lopez has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that this court applies to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir. 2008). As a result, Lopez has not shown that the district court committed plain error by imposing an unreasonable sentence. <em>See Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b924-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
