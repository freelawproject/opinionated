Phillips appeals pro se from the order of the District Court dismissing his complaint. We will affirm. <em>See </em>3d Cir. LAR 27.4 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-14\">Phillips filed a complaint against Richard James and two Pennsylvania state judges, the Honorable Gene Strassburger and the Honorable Paul Lutty. Phillips, who alleges that he suffers from a mental disability, entered into a contract with James to buy a house from him. He alleges that James violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cADA\u201d) because, with knowledge of his disability, James (1) entered into the contract with the intent to defraud him, and (2) provoked an argument that resulted in James filing a state-court action against him for slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">Phillips\u2019s claims against Judges Strassburger and Lutty arise from that state-court action. Phillips alleges that an arbitration panel initially found in his favor but that James appealed to the Court of Common Pleas and obtained a judgment against him. He alleges that Judge Strassburger deprived him of due process during that proceeding by denying him a continuance without determining his mental competence. He further alleges that Judge Lutty committed \u201cobstruction of justice\u201d by overruling the arbitrators, decision without legal explanation, holding a non-jury trial despite Phillips\u2019s jury demand, and \u201cwithholding\u201d the award from the docket to prevent an appeal. For relief, Phillips requested monetary damages and a \u201cremand\u201d to state court for a psychological evaluation and a \u201cretrial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-16\">All defendants filed motions to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). By order entered July 8, 2010, the District Court granted their motions and dismissed Phillips\u2019s complaint on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. The District Court also denied a motion for leave to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>that Phillips had filed as moot. Phillips appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We agree that Phillips\u2019s claim against Judges Lutty and Strassburger are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. That doctrine deprives federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction over claims when: \u201c(1) the federal plaintiff lost in state court; (2) the plaintiff \u2018complains of injuries caused by the state court judgments\u2019; (3) those judgments were rendered before the federal suit was filed; and (4) the plaintiff is inviting the district court to review and reject the state judgments.\u201d <em>Great W. Mining &amp; Mineral Co., </em>615 F.3d at 166 (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005)). Although this doctrine is \u201cnarrow,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 169, Phillips\u2019s claims against the judicial defendants fit squarely within it. As to those defendants, Phillips claims no injury apart from the rulings he believes were erroneous and expressly requests a \u201cremand\u201d to state court for a psychological evaluation and \u201cretrial by jury.\u201d Thus, we agree that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred the District Court\u2019s consideration of these claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">We do not reach the same conclusion with respect to Phillips\u2019s claims against James because those claims allege injuries apart from the state-court judgment. Nevertheless, we will affirm on the alternate ground that Phillips failed to state a federal claim that is sufficiently substantial to invoke the District Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Beazer East, Inc. v. Mead Corp., </em>525 F.3d 255, 261-62 (3d Cir.2008). Phillips alleges that James violated the ADA because he entered into a contract with the intent to defraud him and provoked an argument that apparently led to the action for slander. The ADA, however, \u201c \u2018prohibit[s] discrimination in employment against members of certain classes,\u2019 \u201d <em>Wishkin v. Potter, </em>476 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.2007) (citation omitted), not any of the conduct alleged here. These allegations also do not state a colorable claim under any other federal law, and we are satisfied that any attempt to do so by amending them would be futile.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-11\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) and questions of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Great W. Mining &amp; Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, </em>615 F.3d 159, 163 (3d Cir.2010). In doing so, we may affirm on alternate grounds. <em>See In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig., </em>221 F.3d 449, 461 (3d Cir.2000). We review the District Court\u2019s denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>See Great </em>W. <em>Mining &amp; Mineral Co., </em>615 F.3d at 163.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-9\">. Phillips filed a \u201cMotion to Strike and Amend Defendants,\" in which he asked the District Court to remove the judicial defendants and substitute the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a defendant in their place. The District Court docket reflects no ruling on that motion, but we perceive no reversible error in that regard because the result would have been the same even if he had proceeded with these claims against the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-14\">.In his motion for leave to amend his complaint (which was effectively his second such motion), James did not add any allegations regarding James. He referred to another Pennsylvania state judge whom he alleges ruled against him in a suit involving his contract with James, but did not seek any relief in that regard except to request a \"federal investigation.\u201d In any event, any claims that his motion might be read in that regard would be barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine for the reasons discussed above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
