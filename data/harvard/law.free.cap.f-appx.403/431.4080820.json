Delgado and others stole the shrimp from a transportation depot in Jacksonville and arranged for its transport to a man named Carl Cruz in Miami. Cruz arranged for the shrimp\u2019s storage and attempted to sell it, but law enforcement seized the stolen shrimp before it could be sold. Delgado did not believe Cruz that the shrimp had actually been seized, and so Delgado extorted Cruz.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-21\">On appeal, Delgado argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court placed undue weight on his prior conviction for dealing in stolen property to the exclusion of mitigating family circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-22\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). While the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s unjustified reliance on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a \u2018symptom\u2019 of an unreasonable sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>..., the weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (internal citations, quotation, and alteration omitted). We ordinarily expect a sentence within the guideline range to reasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">In this case, Delgado has not met his burden of establishing that his sentence was unreasonable. He contends that the court gave too much weight to his prior conviction for dealing in stolen property, but the court\u2019s reliance on that prior conviction was not \u201cunjustified.\u201d The district court properly recognized that the prior offense was similar to the instant offenses, and it therefore \u201cdemonstrate^] recidivism.\u201d The court also pointed out that, despite receiving no jail time for that prior conviction, Delgado failed to \u201cturn over a new leaf\u2019 and move forward. Moreover, the district court did not rely on Delgado\u2019s prior conviction to the exclusion of the other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court pointed out that Delgado expressed no remorse for the theft victims, failed to recognize the health risks that his operation imposed on potential shrimp consumers, and physically struck Cruz and threatened his family. Furthermore, and contrary to Delgado\u2019s contention, the district court did consider (and even sympathize with) his family circumstances, but nonetheless found that Delgado should have thought of his family before committing the offenses. Because Delgado has not shown that the district court abused its discretion, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
