He argues that the amendments conflict with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and impermissibly preclude the district court from reducing his sentence below the amended guidelines range of imprisonment. Manners\u2019s arguments are foreclosed by <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010), which held that <em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-25\">Manners has moved for the appointment of counsel. Manners has failed to show that the interests of justice require the appointment of counsel. His motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-26\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b947-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
