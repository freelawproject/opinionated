Rios filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-23\">On appeal, Rios challenges only the sentence imposed. He maintains that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>within-guidelines sentence should not be presumed reasonable because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and is thus flawed under <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). He acknowledges, however, that we have rejected this argument. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">Rios also argues that the 46-month sentence imposed was greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He points out his difficult childhood and his problem with alcohol. He also maintains that the prior conviction that resulted in a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) was too temporally remote to warrant such an increase in his sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Rios\u2019s arguments concerning the district court\u2019s weighing of his mitigating sentencing factors amount to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of these factors and the appropriateness of his within-guidelines sentence. This disagreement does not suffice to show error in connection with his sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Rios has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence, nor has he shown that his sentence was unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
