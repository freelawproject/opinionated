He asserts that his sentence, despite being within the applicable guidelines range, was substantively unreasonable because the district court improperly based the sentence on Moreno\u2019s personal factors rather than on the severity of the offense. Additionally, Moreno hypothesizes that such a lengthy sentence could give rise to a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">Because Moreno did not object to the imposed sentence as unreasonable, we review this claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Moreno\u2019s disagreement with the within-guidelines sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court is required to consider the factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(1). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
