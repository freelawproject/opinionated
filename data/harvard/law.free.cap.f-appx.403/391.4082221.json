We granted a certificate of appealability to resolve \u201c[w]hether the district court erred in finding that Nelson\u2019s claim of an unlawful sentence was procedurally defaulted\u201d when the state court ruled that \u201cthe claim was procedurally defaulted <em>or </em>barred by <em>res judicata.\u201d </em>In his brief, Nelson concedes that his claim of an unlawful sentence is procedurally defaulted, \u201cso that issue has been abandoned and is no longer before us.\u201d <em>Pugh v. Smith, </em>465 F.3d 1295, 1298 (11th Cir.2006). Nelson instead challenges his conviction and sentence, but we will not address his arguments because they are outside the scope of the certificate of appealability. <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2009). We affirm the denial of Nelson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
