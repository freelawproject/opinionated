Plaintiff Elizabeth Gnall attacks the award of limited duration alimony, suggesting she should have been awarded permanent alimony. She also argues the judge abused his discretion in restricting her access to the awarded supplemental child support in this high income case, and in allocating her equitable entitlement to defendant\u2019s 2007 and 2008 bonus income. Defendant James Gnall has abandoned his cross-appeal challenging the amount of alimony, but continues to maintain the child support calculations were erroneous. He also contends the judge abused his discretion when ordering him to pay plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees, and mistakenly set the amount of life insurance he must obtain to guarantee the ordered support obligations. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The facts are taken from the trial record. Our limited recital is tailored to address only those issues raised on appeal, rather than all issues addressed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The parties married on June 5, 1993, and have three children, who are now ages fourteen, thirteen, and eleven. In 2008, plaintiff filed a complaint and defendant filed a counterclaim for divorce, each alleging irreconcilable differences. At the time trial commenced on April 8, 2009, both parties were forty-two years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">The trial focused on factors necessary to discern the appropriate nature and amount of alimony. The parties presented factual and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>expert testimony regarding plaintiffs past employment and future employability prospects once she returned to the workforce; defendant\u2019s current and anticipated future earnings; and the needs of plaintiff and the children. The parties and their experts testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Prior to the parties\u2019 marriage, plaintiff received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and, while working full-time as an engineer for IBM, obtained a master\u2019s degree in computer science. At the time of the marriage, she was employed as a software programmer and systems analyst for the foreign exchange sales group of Goldman Sachs, earning approximately $62,000 per year. She later worked as a senior programmer and analyst for the Government Securities Clearing Corporation, and then as Assistant Vice President at Bankers Trust Corporation, performing computer programming, creating web sites, and developing web interfaces. In 1999, while pregnant with the parties\u2019 second child, she left her corporate position to join a friend\u2019s start-up company, known as \u201cVisual Tonic.\u201d Her salary in 1997 was $115,048. She earned $94,000 for part of 1998 and $52,202 for part of 1999, the years the two older children were born. Thereafter, with defendant\u2019s assent, she stopped working outside the home to principally care for the children. The parties\u2019 third child was born in 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">At trial, plaintiff explained she believed her programming skills were \u201cobsolete\u201d and needed to be \u201ctotally retrained\u201d prior to reentry into the rapidly changing computer field. Moreover, she assumed she would be competing with younger candidates for available entry-level positions. Consequently, she was dissuaded from returning to computer programming and, instead, proposed to pursue a career as a math teacher. She chose teaching based on a perception there existed a \u201chigh demand\u201d for such professionals and, more important, because her prospective work schedule would coincide with the children\u2019s school day, thereby minimizing childcare costs and any disruption to the children\u2019s routine. Plaintiff had investigated the requirements to obtain a teaching certification and believed she could acquire the necessary training <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>through part-time study in four years or less, depending upon the acceptance of previously earned college credits. She initially intended to obtain the necessary degree from William Paterson University, which was proximate to her home, but ultimately enrolled in a three-year online program sponsored by Western Governors University in Utah. Plaintiff estimated the cost to obtain her degree, excluding books, was approximately $18,610, representing tuition for six semesters at $2935 per block, plus a $1000 student teaching fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Plaintiff described her health concerns. She underwent skull-based neurosurgery to remove a mass in November 2006. Resultant nerve damage caused her to experience facial numbness, occasional eye pain, and intermittent noises in one ear. She returns for annual medical reviews of her condition and undergoes an MRI every year. She attended counseling to address stress caused by the divorce and the accompanying litigation. Plaintiff did not believe her medical conditions impeded her ability to resume employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Prior to trial, plaintiff participated in employment evaluations, during which she expressed her interest was \u201craising her children.\u201d Elaborating, she said she \u201chad absolutely no interest ... and ha[d]n\u2019t given much thought to her career!,]\u201d although she had taken a community college course providing an overview of veterinary technician careers. She did not desire that job and suggested to defendant\u2019s expert she was interested in culinary arts. She expressed a similar sentiment when evaluated by her own expert, stating she might like to work \u201cat some point in the future,\u201d but presently was concerned about the care of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">Each party presented expert testimony addressing plaintiffs employment prospects. Defendant offered the opinion of David B. Stein, Ph.D., of Vocational Consulting Group, Inc. Plaintiff then offered the opinion of Charles Kincaid, Ph.D., of Kincaid Vocational &amp; Rehabilitation Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Dr. Stein obtained plaintiffs work history and educational background, and developed a \u201cworker trade profile\u201d to identify available jobs matching plaintiffs qualifications or positions she could reasonably become qualified to perform based on her past education and experience. Using United States Department of Labor categories of employment, Dr. Stein opined plaintiff was \u201cvery qualified\u201d for and would be \u201cbest suited\u201d to continue as a computer programmer or computer software engineer because she had a \u201cvery high level of training.\u201d He believed plaintiff could readily \u201cupdate her skills\u201d by obtaining necessary retraining, either online or at universities in the geographic area, in approximately six to twelve weeks, at a cost of $1,000 to $4,000, depending on the type of skills she developed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Dr. Stein observed computer programming and software engineering positions \u201cexist[ed] in large numbers\u201d and, according to recent projections from the Department of Labor, were among the occupations expected to grow the fastest over the upcoming decade. He noted computer programmers earned less than software engineers. Nationally, positions in these fields carried an annual salary of between $80,000 and $93,740, with even higher wages, on average, in Bergen County. Because she possessed a \u201cvery strong academic, as well as job performance background,\u201d Dr. Stein did not view plaintiffs absence from the job market as having a \u201cpreclusive\u201d effect on her ability to obtain employment. Dr. Stein opined plaintiff could expect an initial annual salary of between $58,000 and $69,000, but, judging by her past performance, she could anticipate rapid wage growth and, within two or three years, perhaps earn an annual salary in excess of $115,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Plaintiffs expert, Dr. Kincaid, similarly focused on plaintiffs return to employment in the computer field, even though he noted she expressed disinterest in such work and \u201cwanted a change[.]\u201d He disagreed with Dr. Stein\u2019s conclusions regarding plaintiffs employability, as well as the probable length and cost of retraining, noting hiring trends for computer programmers did not show anticipated growth over the ensuing decade. He agreed, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\u201cfaster than average growth\u201d and \u201cvery good prospects\u201d of employment were predicted for computer systems analysts, a position similar to plaintiffs IBM position, and also for computer software engineers, a field in which plaintiffs skills and educational background were compatible, despite her lack of direct experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Using the reported requirements and salaries found in local job advertisements, Dr. Kincaid concluded plaintiff needed to engage in approximately one to two years of retraining to upgrade her skills, at a cost of $10,000 to $15,000. He too discussed plaintiffs possible employment as a software engineer, for which entry level positions included an estimated annual salary of $56,764, and a mean salary of $67,763.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Next, defendant testified as to his employment and income. A certified public accountant, he was working as Chief Financial Officer for the America Financial Group of Deutsche Bank. Defendant\u2019s annual compensation included his fixed annual salary and a discretionary bonus paid in February following the close of the calendar year. His bonus payment included cash and deferred equity units, or stock options, restricted by a three- to five-year period of vesting. The following chart sets forth defendant\u2019s remuneration from employment as paid in calendar years 2005 through 2010, understanding cash bonuses and equity units were paid in the February following the close of the actual compensation year on which they were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">\n<em>YEAR SALARY CASH BONUS EQUITY UNITS TOTAL COMPENSATION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWI\">2005 $185,000 $ 325,000 $ 510,000</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">2006 $185,000 $ 481,100 $ 84,900 $ 751,000</p>\n<p id=\"A7Yh\">2007 $200,000 $ 718,702 $ 97,298 $1,016,000</p>\n<p id=\"AMR\">2008 $200,000 $ 766,507 $108,493 $1,075,000</p>\n<p id=\"Als\">2009 $200,000 $1,296,806 $303,194 $1,800,000</p>\n<p id=\"AOG\">2010 $400,000 $ 788,899 $683,326 &amp; $227,775 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> $2,100,000</p>\n<p id=\"b181-24\">Defendant specifically addressed his 2008 bonus. He stated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>terms of the bonus were negotiated in July 2008, as part of his promotion, which post-dated plaintiffs complaint for divorce. The 2008 bonus check (received in February 2009) was not directly deposited into the parties\u2019 joint checking account, as was the custom with prior bonuses. Rather, defendant deposited the check into an account titled solely in his name. Although a portion of the cash bonus may have been used for pendente lite support, defendant argued plaintiff was not entitled to an equitable share of the funds because he received the money as part of his promotion, not as a result of his past performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Evidence of the parties\u2019 expenses and the marital lifestyle was also presented. Both parties marked into evidence their respective original and revised Case Information Statements (CIS), and plaintiff presented expert testimony from Rufino Fernandez, Jr., CPA, a forensic accountant.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">At the time of trial, the parties\u2019 Ridgewood marital home had been sold, plaintiff and the children were renting a smaller residence in Ridgewood, and defendant had moved to an apartment in Manhattan\u2019s upper west side. Plaintiffs initial CIS was based on the costs of the marital home and listed monthly expenses totaling approximately $35,000. Her budget was revised to $21,041 per month to reflect her change in residence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the other hand, defendant reported the family\u2019s joint marital lifestyle while living in Ridgewood was $23,664 per month, of which he allocated $10,906 for his needs. He too modified his budget after moving to New York City, claiming monthly expenditures of $19,803.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">During the marriage, plaintiff handled the family\u2019s finances. Defendant\u2019s paycheck was directly deposited into the joint checking account, from which plaintiff paid utilities, food, and smaller landscaping bills. Similarly, the cash portion of defendant\u2019s bonus was directly deposited into the joint checking account and disbursed by plaintiff to cover current and future anticipated ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>penses. For example, in 2007, a portion of the bonus remuneration was placed in savings; $10,000 was placed in each of the children\u2019s uniform gift to minor\u2019s accounts (UGMA); $10,000 was used to reduce the principal balance of the mortgages; a sum was set aside to satisfy the resultant tax obligations; and the remainder was used to pay credit card bills, car expenses, the monthly mortgages, real estate taxes and insurances, large landscaping bills, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Defendant drove a 2008 Infiniti M45 after trading in a 1998 Nissan Maxima. His monthly car payment was $1,039. Plaintiff drove a 2007 Cadillac Escalade, which was encumbered by a loan requiring a monthly payment of $1,583. Plaintiff explained groceries were purchased from Whole Foods or Kings, clothing was bought from Talbots, Nordstrom, Macy\u2019s, Ann Taylor, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Lilly Pulitzer, and the Gap, and defendant\u2019s suits were purchased from Barney\u2019s in New York City. The family enjoyed multiple vacations each year, which had included ski trips to Aspen and Switzerland, stays at Disney World, ocean front rentals in the Outer Banks, North Carolina, and shorter trips to Rhode Island and Boston. Plaintiff insisted the parties always had money to buy whatever they wanted and never worried; they always paid their expenses when incurred; and other than the mortgages and car loans, they had no debts. The children attended public school and were involved in several other extracurricular activities, such as sports and music lessons. Each child was engaged in counseling to address issues arising from their parents\u2019 divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Plaintiffs expert, Fernandez, prepared a lifestyle analysis after interviewing plaintiff and reviewing the historic Quicken checking expenses, other bank account records, and investment documentation for the period from 2004 to 2007. Fernandez admitted plaintiff reviewed his preliminary drafts to verify the accuracy of his proposed expense allocations, he did not consult with defendant. In order for plaintiff and the children to maintain the marital lifestyle, Fernandez opined she would need $24,252 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>month, plus additional monies for savings and income tax obligations resulting from the alimony receipts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">On cross-examination, the accuracy of Fernandez\u2019s report was attacked. Defendant showed Fernandez had artificially inflated the total needs of plaintiff and the children by: including miscellaneous expenses that were actually transfers between accounts, not expenses; including costs expended for the benefit of defendant; and doubling actual vacation costs and a portion of the cash expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Defendant\u2019s testimony emphasized his financial success was recent and not representative of the marital lifestyle. He also argued the parties had recently increased their household expenditures by using a home equity loan to build an addition to the home, and by buying newer ears. He asserted these expenses should not be considered when calculating the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Reviewing the evidence submitted, the trial judge concluded the parties enjoyed \u201can upper middle class\u201d lifestyle that was more modest than what could be afforded on defendant\u2019s more recent remuneration. He fixed the monthly needs of plaintiff and the three children at $18,000. After concluding plaintiff could return to the computer field and earn \u201cbetween $61,200 and $94,000,\u201d he considered the alimony factors, understanding his obligation to make statutory findings. He found the parties\u2019 fifteen-year marital relationship was \u201cnot short term[.]\u201d Nevertheless, when he weighed the \u201crelatively young\u201d age of the parties, and their good health and education, which allowed them to obtain employment \u201cat good salaries\u201d and thereby support \u201cexcellent lifestyles for themselves and their children[,]\u201d the judge concluded \u201cthe parties were not married long enough and are not old enough for [defendant] to be responsible to maintain that lifestyle permanently for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>[plaintiff].\u201d He therefore concluded, \u201cthis is not a permanent alimony case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The judge also rejected an award for rehabilitative alimony. Even though he acknowledged plaintiff needed retraining, he found plaintiff could take classes online at her own pace. The judge also noted plaintiff had failed to work toward obtaining employment during the two years the case was pending. Consequently, he imputed $65,000 annual income to her, effective immediately, and awarded $18,000 per month limited duration alimony for eleven years. The alimony award was to terminate on September 1, 2021, coincident with the youngest child\u2019s anticipated departure for college. Further, the award would not be subject to modification based on plaintiffs future earnings; rather, modification would be permitted only upon either party\u2019s death or plaintiffs remarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The initial child support calculations made following trial were challenged in post-judgment motions. At that time, the judge corrected an error and re-calculated child support under the guidelines as $997 per week. He added a supplemental support award of $1600 per month per child, requiring the maximum gift tax amount (currently, $13,000 per year) be deposited into the children\u2019s UGMA accounts, unless the parties agreed otherwise. Any remaining sums would be paid monthly to plaintiff to use as she saw fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The judge concluded the marital portion of defendant\u2019s 2008 bonus (paid in February 2009) was limited to the proportionate amount represented by the period prior to the filing date of the complaint, that is January 1, to March 10, 2009. The judge calculated the total marital portion as $216,700 and concluded, \u201cat best plaintiffs share would be fifty percent, or $108,300.\u201d However, the judge determined plaintiffs interest was offset by her past receipt of tax-free pendente lite support and other lump sum payments made during the two-year litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Defendant was ordered to maintain $3 million in life insurance during the limited duration alimony term. When alimony ended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>he was permitted to reduce the life insurance to $1 million until the emancipation of the children. Finally, defendant was ordered to satisfy the outstanding $105,423.86 balance plaintiff owed to her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Motions were filed for reconsideration of some determinations and for clarification of others. As noted, the amount of child support was adjusted. Also, the judge denied defendant\u2019s cross-motion to reduce the life insurance obligation to the actual amount of alimony due. Thereafter, plaintiff appealed and defendant cross-appealed from designated provisions of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Our review of a trial court\u2019s factual findings is limited. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. M.M., </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>261, 278-79, 914 A.2d 1265 (2007) (citation omitted). \u201cThe general rule is that findings by the trial court are binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial, credible evidence.\u201d <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 411-12, 713 A.2d 390 (1998) (citing <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)). We defer to credibility determinations because a trial court \u201c\u2018hears the case, sees and observes the witnesses, [and] hears them testify,\u2019\u201d affording it \u201c\u2018a better perspective than a reviewing court in evaluating the veracity of witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 713 A.2d 390 (quoting <em>Pascale v. Pascale, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>20, 33, 549 A.2d 782 (1988) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Further, we recognize the \u201cspecial expertise\u201d of judges in addressing discretionary matters in the Family Part. Therefore, if the trial judge\u2019s conclusions are evidentially supported, we are inclined to accept them. <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, we do \u201cnot disturb the \u2018factual findings and legal conclusions of the trial judge unless ... convinced that they are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cOnly when the [trial] court\u2019s conclusions are so \u2018clearly mistaken\u2019 or \u2018wide of the mark\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>that the judge was obviously mistaken, should we interfere and make our own findings to \u201censure that there is not a denial of justice.\u201d <em>N.J.

R.W., </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>232, 245-46, 52 A.3d 1043 (2012) (citing <em>Balsamides v. Protameen Chems., </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>352, 372, 734 A.2d 721 (1999)). We are not bound by \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts[,]\u201d which \u201care not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Plaintiffs principal challenge on appeal attacks as error the judge\u2019s award of limited duration alimony. Plaintiff succinctly asserts: \u201cThis is a permanent alimony case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u201cAlimony is a claim arising upon divorce, which is rooted in the parties\u2019 prior [financial] interdependence\u201d created during their marital relationship. <em>Reese v. Weis, </em>430 <em>N.J.Super. </em>552, 569, 66 A.3d 157 (App.Div.2013). Whether alimony should be awarded is governed by distinct, objective standards defined by the Legislature in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23b. When alimony is requested, the statute demands the court consider and make specific findings regarding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">(1) The actual need and ability of the parties to pay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">(2) The duration of the marriage or civil union;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">(3) The age, physical and emotional health of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-13\">(4) The standard of living established in the marriage or civil union and the likelihood that each party can maintain a reasonably comparable standard of living;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">(5) The earning capacities, educational levels, vocational skills, and employability of the parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-17\">(6) The length of absence from the job market of the party seeking maintenance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-18\">(7) The parental responsibilities for the children;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>(8) The time and expense necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance to find appropriate employment ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">(9) The history of the financial or non-financial contributions to the marriage or civil union by each party including contributions to the care and education of the children and interruption of personal careers or educational opportunities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">(10) The equitable distribution of property ordered ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">(11) The income available to either party through investment of any assets held by that party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">(12) The tax treatment and consequences to both parties of any alimony award ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">(13) Any other factors which the court may deem relevant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23b.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">The law compels judges to weigh all of these statutory factors to determine whether alimony is appropriate and, if so, ascertain the nature and calculate the amount of alimony needed by the dependent spouse. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23c (requiring the court to \u201cmake specific findings on the evidence\u201d regarding statutory factors relevant to an alimony award). This process is designed to account for the unique needs and abilities affecting each dependent spouse,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as the financially secure spouse called on to continue support after the marriage ends in divorce. Certainly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-12\">[a] trial court\u2019s findings regarding alimony should not be vacated unless the court clearly abused its discretion, failed to consider all of the controlling legal principles, made mistaken findings, or reached a conclusion that could not reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record after considering the proofs as a whole. <em>Heinl v.

The economic dependence created as a result of the marital relationship is a crucial finding necessary to impose the ongoing financial entanglement of an alimony award. The law attributes a party\u2019s individual success to have been achieved by virtue of the joint union \u2014 \u201ca shared enterprise, a joint undertaking, that in many ways ... is akin to a partnership.\u201d <em>Rothman v.

Briefly, limited duration alimony was designed \u201cto fill a \u2018void\u2019 identified by the Commission to Study the Law of Divorce.\u201d <em>Gordon v.

The undeniable rationale in adding limited duration alimony as a remedy was to address a dependent spouse\u2019s post-divorce needs following \u201c\u2018\u201cshorter-term marriages where permanent or rehabilitative alimony would be inappropriate or inapplicable but where, nonetheless, economic assistance for a limited period of time would be just.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>J.E.V., supra, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 485-86, 45 A.3d 1001 (quoting <em>Cox, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 477, 762 A.2d 1040 (quoting S.

As such,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">[l]imited duration alimony is not intended to facilitate the earning capacity of a dependent spouse or to make a sacrificing spouse whole, but rather to address those circumstances where an economic need for alimony is established, <em>but the marriage was of short-term duration such that permanent alimony is not appropriate. </em>Those circumstances stand in sharp contrast to marriages of long duration where economic need is also demonstrated. In the former instance, limited duration alimony provides an equitable and proper remedy. In the latter circumstances, permanent alimony is appropriate and an award of limited duration alimony is clearly circumscribed, both by equitable considerations and by statute. <em>[Cox, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 476, 762 A.2d 1040 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Implicated by plaintiffs argument on appeal in this matter is whether a marriage lasting three months shy of fifteen years is the type of \u201cshorter-term marriagef ]\u201d for which limited duration alimony was adopted by the Legislature. In both <em>Cox </em>and <em>J.E.V., </em>the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s award of limited duration alimony was challenged. In each case, a significant determining factor was the length of the respective marriage. Certainly, \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u2018defining distinction\u2019 between permanent and limited duration alimony is the length of the marriage.\u201d <em>J.E.V., supra, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 488, 45 A.3d 1001 (quoting <em>Cox, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 483, 762 A.2d 1040). The Coxes had been married for twenty-two years, a circumstance clearly removing any possibility of a limited duration alimony award. <em>Cox, supra, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 483, 762 A.2d 1040. In <em>J.E.V., supra, </em>we reviewed the trial judge\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs request for permanent alimony in <em>favor of an </em>award of limited duration alimony following an almost ten-year marriage. 426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 480-81, 45 A.3d 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Assessing the facts here, the trial judge correctly identified this marriage\u2019s length as \u201cnot short-term.\u201d He further acknowledged plaintiff would be unable \u201cto maintain the marital lifestyle without alimony now and probably not for some time[.]\u201d Nevertheless, he concluded, consideration of an award of permanent alimony was obviated by the parties\u2019 relatively young ages and the fact that they were not married long enough \u2014 commenting theirs was not a twenty-five to thirty-year relationship. This conclusion was error and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Contrary to the judge\u2019s belief, permanent alimony awards are not reserved solely for long-term marriages of twenty-five to thirty years. While marital relationships of such duration, when coupled with a created economic dependence by one party, typically result in permanent alimony awards, there is no per se rule that permanent alimony is unwarranted unless the twentieth anniversary milestone is reached. Moreover, any attempt to reduce the shared marital experience to a formulaic calculation of compensation based on the number of years \u201cin the marriage,\u201d completely disregards the public policy considerations supporting continuation of economic support beyond the spouses\u2019 joined personal lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Although \u201c[c]ourts must consider the duration of the marriage\u201d when fixing alimony, \u201cthe length of the marriage and the proper amount or duration of alimony do not correlate in any mathematical formula.\u201d <em>Lynn v. Lynn, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>510, 517-18, 453 A.2d 539 (1982). The Legislature\u2019s confining limited duration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>alimony awards to those \u201cshorter-term marriages,\u201d where the facts make a permanent alimony award <em>\u201cinappropriate or inapplicable,\u201d </em>reinforces this concept. <em>J.E.V., supra, </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 485-86, 45 A.3d 1001 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">We do not intend to draw specific lines delineating \u201cshort-term\u201d and \u201clong-term\u201d marriages in an effort to define those cases warranting only limited duration rather than permanent alimony. We also underscore it is not merely the years from the wedding to the parties\u2019 separation or commencement of divorce that dictates the applicability or inapplicability of permanent alimony. Nevertheless, we do not hesitate to declare a fifteen-year marriage is not short-term, a conclusion which precludes consideration of an award of limited duration alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">A dependent spouse\u2019s age alone also cannot obviate permanent alimony. <em>See Robertson v. Robertson, </em>381 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 207-08, 885 A.2d 470 (App.Div.2005) (finding thirty-nine-year-old woman who surrendered employment opportunities was entitled to permanent alimony after a twelve-year marriage). Admittedly, a spouse\u2019s youth, along with prior education and skills, may tip the scale toward a lesser amount of alimony based on the prospects of viable future employment. But youth is merely one factor weighed in the alimony calculus.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">All facts regarding each unique marital partnership must be evaluated when considering evidence regarding a claim of economic dependence warranting long-lasting support. Compliance with the statute is not accomplished by a listing of facts. Rather, the statute mandates an analysis of the relationship of these facts, culminating in an assessment of their respective importance. For example, when considering the applicability of a permanent alimony award, the length of the marriage and the parties\u2019 ages are finite facts that must be considered. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23b(2), (3). However, the statute\u2019s enumerated considerations implicate other aspects of the marital relationship that also must be weighed. These include factors such as the duration and cause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>claimed economic dependence; sacrifices made to assure the non-dependent spouse\u2019s financial success; whether the dependent spouse\u2019s return to full-time employment causes disruption to the needs of the children; and the nature and extent of the dependent spouse\u2019s predicted financial independence, measured against the non-dependent spouse\u2019s continued ability to provide financial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In this matter, facts relevant to plaintiffs request for permanent alimony are many. A significant relevant fact is her monthly budget, representing the marital standard of living of $18,000 per month, or $216,000 per year. This amount was found to represent an \u201cupper-middle-class\u201d marital standard of living, which was more modest than current earnings would be able to maintain. Nevertheless it is an amount plaintiff cannot achieve independent of defendant\u2019s support.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Also, for more than two-thirds of the marriage, plaintiff functioned as the primary caretaker for the children and homemaker for the family, foregoing any earning capacity and professional success she may have achieved during this period. She had not worked since 1999. She initially left employment largely because the parties decided their two children, separated in age by only a year, needed her care and attention. Thereafter, plaintiff was the homemaker and primary caretaker for the parties\u2019 three children.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Under the divorce judgment, defendant\u2019s parenting time was set as every other weekend and, when he was able, dinner on Wednesdays. Plaintiff, on the other hand, continued to bear the lion\u2019s share of parenting responsibilities for their three minor children. The parenting time schedule permits defendant to continue his professional endeavors, substantially free of daily child rearing concerns, such as assisting with homework, planning and preparing meals, scheduling activity, and shopping for the children\u2019s needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Undoubtedly, plaintiff is intelligent, educated, and capable of professional employment, but under any conceivable scenario, her re-employment requires retooling before reentry into the job <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>market. Further, it is unrealistic to assume plaintiff could generate earnings sufficient to maintain the determined marital standard of living. Expert testimony, credited by the judge, estimated plaintiffs return to the computer field could, after a few years, eventually result in earnings of $115,000. This is a far cry from the marital standard of living calculated by the court, necessitating $216,000 net per year. Thus, the record does not support that plaintiff would be able to resume working and earn an amount to sustain herself in a manner approaching that which the parties created and enjoyed during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Throughout the marriage, defendant pursued his career, uninterrupted by responsibilities of bearing and caring for children. His intelligence, drive, and abilities have allowed him to achieve notable professional success, which is accompanied by significant remuneration. The surge in his earnings and the accompanying increase in the marital standard of living began in the latter third of the marriage, with his employment at Deutsche Bank in 2003. He is fortunate, as there is no contesting the fact he can, without sacrifice, support plaintiff and the children, as well as himself in accordance with the marital standard of living.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Each of these considerations must be weighed when considering plaintiffs request for permanent alimony. Following our review, we conclude the judge, however, incorrectly evaluated the evidence, primarily rejecting permanent alimony because of the misconception that a fifteen-year marriage would not support a permanent alimony award. This legal error permeated his overall consideration of other statutory factors, resulting in an impermissibly conclusory and cursory analysis. <em>See Carter v. Carter, </em>318 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 42, 722 A.2d 977 (App.Div.1999) (criticizing trial judge\u2019s failure to adhere to statutory mandate of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23b).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">We conclude the trial judge failed to fully assess all evidence regarding the fifteen-year marital enterprise, including plaintiffs inability to achieve something close to the marital standard of living in the future, without the benefit of defendant\u2019s economic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>assistance. The failure to adhere to the statutory obligation to \u201cmake specific findings on the evidence about [all] the above factors[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23c, was error. Accordingly, the award of limited duration alimony is reversed and the matter is remanded for an evaluation of an award of permanent alimony. <em>See Gotlib v. Gotlib, </em>399 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 309, 944 A.2d 654 (App.Div.2008) (providing if a \u201ccourt ignores applicable standards, we are compelled to reverse and remand for further proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Plaintiff next argues the judge abused his discretion in averaging the parties\u2019 expenses over several years when computing the marital lifestyle and plaintiffs needs. She suggests the judge\u2019s calculations \u201cperpetuate the impoverishment of the dependent spouse.\u201d We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">We reject plaintiffs suggestion that the marital standard of living, as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23b(4), is defined by the dollar amount of expenses incurred immediately prior to filing for divorce. The \u201cstandard of living enjoyed during the marriage\u201d is a concept that certainly includes objective criteria, such as the actual amount spent for mortgages, real estate taxes, car payments, and food expenses. However, it also encompasses more subtle components such as the intervals between ear purchases, whether there has been a preference for new or pre-owned vehicles, and the frequency of and nature of restaurants when dining out.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">This record reflects the trial judge\u2019s keen awareness of all aspects of the parties\u2019 standard of living. He stated the parties lived well, but not extravagantly, and spent less than what defendant\u2019s salary suggested could be afforded. He accepted much of plaintiffs claimed budget, though reduced to disallow certain inflated or inapplicable expenses. The judge\u2019s assessment of the substantial, credible evidence resulted in a reduction from plaintiffs asserted monthly expenses of $21,041 to the $18,000 budget the judge found to more accurately reflected expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Further, the judge fully assessed plaintiffs needs in reaching his findings. The judge understood plaintiffs CIS budget addressed the needs of plaintiff and the children, and did not include a reserve for income taxes or savings. We determine that once the children\u2019s needs, satisfied by the basic and supplemental child support awards, are removed, the monthly sum awarded sufficiently includes estimated income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">However, we cannot discern from the opinion what findings and conclusions were drawn regarding plaintiffs requested savings component, supported by Fernandez\u2019s testimony, which opined on the level of savings by the parties over the last four years. Indeed, a court may design an award sufficient to permit the supported spouse to bolster his or her savings to \u201cprotect ... against the day when alimony payments may cease\u201d due to the supporting spouse\u2019s death or other change in circumstances. <em>Khalaf v. Khalaf, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>63, 70, 275 A.2d 132 (1971) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u201cTrial judges are under a duty to make findings of fact and to state reasons in support of their conclusions.\u201d <em>Heinl v.

On remand, we direct the judge to review and make findings regarding <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-23b(8), which requires alimony awards take into consideration \u201cthe opportunity for future acquisitions of capital assets and income[.]\u201d The court must clearly set forth factual findings and legal conclusions for the benefit of the parties and to aid appellate review. <em>See R. </em>1:7-4(a) (denoting a trial court\u2019s obligation to make findings of fact and state conclusions of law following hearings resulting in orders appealable as of right).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Plaintiff argues the court erred in imputing income to her of $65,000 per year. Further, the judge \u201cunfairly\u201d concluded she had \u201cdone nothing\u201d pendente lite to obtain employment, and erred in immediately imputing this level of earnings, without allowing any period for retraining and workforce reentry. Although we would have preferred more detailed factual findings regarding imputed income, we cannot agree the income imputation or its amount was erroneous. However, we must remand regarding the effective date of imputation, as there is no evidence to support the court\u2019s conclusion plaintiff could immediately commence earning $65,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In computing alimony, \u201c[i]ncome may be imputed to a party who is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed.\u201d <em>Golian v.

Although plaintiff had been absent from the workforce for many years, she retains the obligation to contribute to her support. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Both when sotting child support and in reaching a proper alimony-award, a judge must examine not only each party\u2019s income, but also his or her earning ability. <em>See Lynn v.

He chose to impute income toward the lower end of this range, $65,000, understanding time had elapsed since plaintiff last performed the tasks of this job. We conclude the substantial, credible evidence in the record supports this finding, which will not be disturbed. <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 412, 713 A.2d 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">We also reject as unfounded plaintiffs argument that the judge should have imputed income based on plaintiffs plans to become a teacher, rather than a computer programmer.

We are aware of no authority mandating a dependent spouse, absent from the workforce, by agreement, for a significant period of time, to immediately prepare for and return to work pendente lite, absent notice of this expectation presented by motion or court directive. We are not suggesting able spouses do not hold a responsibility to support themselves; we are only finding there is no support in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>this record for the judge\u2019s conclusion resulting in the immediate imputation of $65,000 annual income.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Both employability experts agreed plaintiff needed a period of retraining before she would be able to secure employment. Plaintiff had not worked in ten years and her past skills were stale. Plaintiffs lack of outside employment over this period in part resulted from the need to care for three children, and likely was reinforced by defendant\u2019s financial success. Beginning in 2007, defendant\u2019s total annual compensation topped $1 million. Also, in 2006, plaintiff underwent brain surgery. Moreover, the issue of plaintiffs return to work was never broached pendente lite. The pendente lite record contains no request by defendant for plaintiffs resumption of employment, and there are no orders mandating she secure retraining or allocating funds to enable her to seek training or \u201cprepare herself to re-enter the workforce,\u201d as the trial judge found she neglected to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Overall, we do not view these facts as obviously presenting a mandate for plaintiffs resumption of employment pendente lite. Unlike a short-term marital relationship, one where both parties had continuously worked but one suddenly stopped, or one where the parties had no children and their needs could not be sustained solely by one working spouse, the facts here do not suggest the parties themselves anticipated an immediate resumption of employment by the dependent spouse. Rather, these facts strongly suggest the parties held no expectation plaintiff should immediately return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">This determination does not diminish plaintiffs ultimate responsibility, and we agree the obligation to contribute to her own and the children\u2019s support has been satisfactorily shown. We conclude, however, the judge abused his discretion by immediately imputing a prospective salary attainable only upon retraining, as no evidence supports the finding plaintiff ignored her pendente lite responsibilities to obtain work. This portion of the judgment is reversed. On remand, the effective date of imputation must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>made based on the evidential record, after consideration of the time and cost for plaintiffs retraining.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Next, both parties challenge the amount awarded for child support: plaintiff argues the award was too low, and defendant argues it was too high. The lack of meaningful factual findings requires this issue also be reexamined.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Initially, the court calculated a basic support award, using the Child Support Guidelines (guidelines), <em>R. </em>5:6A, of $501 per week. The judge further ordered a supplemental award of $25,000 per child per year, from which the maximum allowable federal gift tax exclusion was to be deposited into each of the children\u2019s existing UGMA for higher education, and the balance remitted to plaintiff in equal monthly installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Following plaintiffs post-judgment motion, an error in the basic child support calculation was identified and corrected to $997 per week. The court then adjusted the supplemental award, reducing it to $1600 per month, or $19,200, presumably per child per year. Plaintiff agrees the amount of the supplemental award should have been modified after correction to the base guidelines amount. However, she claims an abuse of discretion occurred because total support was reduced and the supplemental support was restricted to require deposit into the children\u2019s UGMA accounts, absent the parties\u2019 agreement otherwise. Plaintiff seeks unrestricted control of the entire supplemental child support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Defendant argues the child support exceeds what is necessary to meet the family\u2019s lifestyle, and the basis for the amount of the supplemental award was not sufficiently stated, making it unfounded. Also, he argues, following the correction, child support was increased by $8392 per year, without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">Even though a supplemental support amount in addition to the guideline\u2019s base amount is authorized because of the parties\u2019 high level of income, the judge must identify the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>children\u2019s supplemental needs to be satisfied by the supplemental support awarded. <em>See Caplan, supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 272, 864 A.2d 1108 (noting that the trial court may take any reasonable approach in arriving at an appropriate award); <em>Strahan, supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 309-10, 953 A.2d 1219 (same). We reject claims that the judge improperly considered the parties\u2019 past practice of funding the children\u2019s anticipated higher education costs through annual deposits into the UGMA accounts. <em>See Strahan, supra, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 311, 953 A.2d 1219 (criticizing an above-guidelines child support award absent evidence of some \u201cmarital standard\u201d regarding \u201cthe way the parties treated the children\u201d). We merely require the court to express those needs, in addition to the annual past practice of saving for the children\u2019s education, to be satisfied by the supplemental support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Following our review, we agree necessary factfinding to sustain the supplemental support award must be enhanced. The judge must explain how the amount of the supplemental award was calculated, and the circumstances considered in restricting an amount designated for deposit into the UGMA accounts. Finally, the judge must explain why the total support amount changed, after it was corrected to comply with the guidelines.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We generally reject defendant\u2019s argument that the basic child support amount was too high in light of the court\u2019s findings regarding the family\u2019s budget. The $18,000 per month needs did not include the tax obligation associated with plaintiffs alimony receipt. 26 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 71(a) (stating \u201c[g]ross income includes amounts received as alimony\u201d). We reject as specious defendant\u2019s contention the total alimony and child support receipts exceeded plaintiffs budget. Nevertheless, based on our conclusions regarding the need to review the alimony award, we note that if the amount of alimony is adjusted, the amount of basic child support must be recomputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>E.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">In her final points, plaintiff argues the court abused its discretion in: (1) awarding her one-half of the remainder of defendant\u2019s 2007 cash bonus paid in 2008, as support, rather than granting her allocable share as equitable distribution; and (2) concluding she received her interest in defendant\u2019s 2008 bonus as pendent lite support. Plaintiff also urges modification of the division of the 2009 income tax refunds.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Pendente lite, the motion judge ordered an equal distribution of the funds remaining from the 2007 cash bonus, in lieu of immediately calculating defendant\u2019s monthly support obligation. The dispute centered on whether the bonus received and deposited into the joint checking account was an asset subject to equitable distribution, for which plaintiff\u2019s entitlement was distinct. Plaintiff maintains allowing use of the monies to satisfy defendant\u2019s pendente lite support obligations was legal error. She argues defendant retained his base salary and half of his bonus and did not pay support.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Shortly after the gross bonus of $766,507 was received in February 2008, the complaint for divorce was filed and pendente lite requests were considered. Because the court divided the balance of the monies held in the checking account to satisfy pendente lite support, plaintiff states she exhausted her share of the asset to meet ongoing household expenses that should have been provided by defendant\u2019s current income. On the other hand, defendant was not only freed from paying pendente lite support, but also retained his salary and his share of the asset for his own use and enjoyment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Following trial, the judge did not consider this issue, though it had been reserved for final determination in the pendente lite order. On remand, the treatment and allocation of the 2007 bonus paid in February 2008 must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">As for the 2008 bonus, the judge determined the amount subject to equitable distribution was limited to the period of the marriage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>ending upon the initiation of the divorce action. The complaint was filed on March 10, 2008, so plaintiffs one-half interest in the sum earned between January 1, and March 10, 2008, was calculated as $108,300. The judge then concluded, \u201cwhatever amount was due [plaintiff] from the 2008 bonus ha[d] been more than offset by the more than two years of tax[-]free payments, both lump sum and periodic, [she] ha[d] received during the pendency of the divorce action[,]\u201d computed to average approximately $22,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">At trial, defendant argued he negotiated his bonus, paid in February 2009, at the time of his promotion in May 2008 \u2014 two months following plaintiffs filing for divorce. The trial judge\u2019s opinion does not make specific credibility findings, but the inference to be made from the decision is that the judge accepted defendant\u2019s testimony regarding his negotiation of the 2008 bonus. The record contains no contrary information. On appeal, plaintiff urges a different treatment of the bonus funds, baldly asserting the bonus amount resulted from \u201cthe momentum and impact of the marriage.\u201d We reject this proposition as without evidential support, and decline to alter the judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Plaintiff lastly argues she held an entitlement to refunds resulting from the parties\u2019 joint 2009 state and federal tax returns. During the post-judgment reconsideration motions, defendant sought retention of the refund because plaintiff had no taxable income. The judge agreed. On appeal, plaintiff suggests defendant\u2019s proofs were insufficient to support the result. We conclude the argument lacks sufficient merit to warrant discussion in our opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">In his cross-appeal, defendant attacks the order to pay plaintiffs counsel fees and challenges the amount of life insurance he was ordered to provide. We disagree the judge abused his discretion by ordering defendant to satisfy the balance of plaintiffs outstanding attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We determine, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>er, a factual error occurred in the review of the life insurance issue, necessitating reversal and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Fees in family actions are normally awarded to permit parties with unequal financial positions to litigate on an equal footing. A counsel fee award is left to the sound discretion of the trial court, after consideration of the factors identified in <em>Rule </em>5:3-5(c). We will disturb a trial court\u2019s determination of a counsel fee award \u201conly on the rarest occasions, and then only because of a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Rendine v. Pantzer, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>292, 317, 661 A.2d 1202 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Here, the judge properly and carefully considered all applicable factors and exercised reasonable discretion in ordering defendant to pay the balance of plaintiffs outstanding counsel fees. We identify no basis to set aside that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The final issue raised in defendant\u2019s cross-appeal focuses on his obligation to retain life insurance to secure his support obligations. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-25 (providing authority for requiring life insurance as security for an alimony or child support obligation). The judge denied defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration seeking to annually reduce the amount of insurance designed to guarantee alimony, apparently because he misunderstood the motion. In denying the motion, the judge stated, \u201c[defendant]\u2019s application that [plaintiff] maintain life insurance in the amount of $500,000 per each of the three children until a child is emancipated misses the fact that he is the dominant income earner and supporting parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">This issue too is subject to review on remand. First, defendant\u2019s request on reconsideration was not addressed. Second, an allocation of the total amount of life insurance between plaintiff and the children must be made. The ambiguous require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>ment that plaintiff be named a beneficiary \u201cto the extent of her interest\u201d cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In summary, we reverse the order of limited duration alimony and remand for consideration of an award of permanent alimony. Regarding this issue, we affirm the calculations fixing the marital lifestyle, except with respect to the issue of savings. The judge must consider plaintiffs budget request and provide specific findings and conclusions on this issue. The determination to impute income to plaintiff is affirmed. However, we reverse as to the commencement of income imputation. On remand, the judge must consider the time and money necessary for plaintiff to update her skills to enable her to obtain employment at the level so imputed. The basic child support amount is affirmed, subject to recompilation in the event of changes in the amount of alimony. Also on remand, the judge must articulate findings and conclusions regarding the nature of the supplemental child support award and must analyze the basis for restriction of a substantial portion of that award. We affirm the determination regarding the 2008 bonus and remand for findings and conclusions on the distribution of the 2007 bonus. We affirm the determination regarding the 2009 income tax refund. On the cross-appeal, we affirm the award of counsel fees. We remand for clarification of defendant\u2019s life insurance obligations. The judge must consider defendant\u2019s request to annually reduce the life insurance component securing his alimony obligation and specifically allocate the amount of life insurance between plaintiff and the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.
