The federal limits were succinctly described in <em>A.B. v.

[PRWORA] was designed to reduce the impact of \u201caliens ... applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1601(3). PRWORA \u201cimposes several limitations on the availability of Medicaid benefits to aliens.\u201d <em>Soskin v. Reinertson, </em>353 F.3d 1242, 1245-46 (10th Cir.2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">There are two classes of aliens: \u201cqualified aliens\u201d and \u201cunqualified aliens.\u201d The definition of \u201cqualified aliens\u201d includes, among others, aliens who were \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>1641(b)(1)-(4). \u201cUnqualified aliens\u201d are all aliens who do not fall within the definition of \u201cqualified aliens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1611(a).

The State expanded coverage in 2005 to delete the five-year requirement, based on the Legislature\u2019s findings that limiting State subsidized healthcare coverage had resulted in increased costs for emergency hospital charity care. <em>Id. </em>at 251, 23 A.3d 451; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-9e.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In 2010, in response to a budget crisis, the State reinstated the five-year residency requirement for most adult legal aliens. However, the State continued to provide coverage for legal aliens who were pregnant women or children under the age of nineteen, and existing enrollees who were receiving treatment for life threatening illnesses or were receiving on-going life sustaining treatment. As part of the economic cut-backs, the State also closed the NJ Familycare program to all adults \u201cwhose benefits are not funded or payable under Title XIX of the Social Security Act.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-1.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In <em>Guaman I, </em>we recognized that ordinarily, alienage is a suspect classification, and discrimination against aliens must be justified under a strict scrutiny standard of review. <em>Guaman I, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 262, 23 A.3d 451. However, we also acknowledged that due to Congress\u2019s broad constitutional power over immigration, the rational basis standard of review applies to Congressional enactments affecting immigrants, and to State enactments authorized by a uniform federal policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">Even though lawful immigrants comprise a suspect class otherwise triggering strict scrutiny analysis, the Supreme Court applies a dichotomized standard of review. Because of the federal government\u2019s plenary power to regulate immigration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>classifications based on alienage in federal programs are subject to rational basis review. <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>67, 85-87, 96 <em>S.Ct </em>1883, 1894-95, 48 L.Ed.2d 478, 493-94 (1976). Because the states lack plenary power over immigration policy, similar classifications in a State\u2019s benefits programs are subject to strict scrutiny. <em>[Graham v. Richardson, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>365, 376, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1848, 1854, 29 <em>L.E.2d </em>534, 544 (1971).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">Therefore, despite the federal government\u2019s broad power over immigration and naturalization, <em>\u201cCongress does not have the power to authorize the vidividual States to violate the Federal Equal Protection Clause.\u201d Graham, supra, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>at 382, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1857, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 548 (emphasis added);.... However, \u201cif the Federal Government has by uniform rule prescribed what it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of an alien subclass, the States may, of course, follow the federal direction.\u201d <em>Plyler, supra </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>at 219 n. 19, <em>102 S.Ct. </em>at 2396 n. 19, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 800-01 n. 19 (citing <em>De Canas v. Bica </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>351, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>933, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>43 (1976)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 262-63, 23 A.3d 451 (quoting <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>202, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2382, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>786 (1982)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Noting the difficulty in determining whether Congress had adopted a \u201cuniform policy\u201d with respect to the five-year eligibility requirement, we nonetheless were persuaded that the State scheme was likely to pass constitutional muster. We found convincing the rationale expressed in <em>Soskin v. Reinertson, </em>353 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir.2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">[I]n <em>Soskin v. Reinertson, [supra </em>353 F.3d at 1244] the court applied a rational basis standard in reviewing equal protection challenges to a Colorado law that repealed jointly funded Medicaid coverage to otherwise legal aliens. The <em>Soskin </em>court determined that that case fell somewhere between <em>Graham </em>and <em>Mathews, </em>because unlike the state statute at issue in <em>Graham, </em>PRWORA. provided specific Congressional authorization for the state\u2019s action, and unlike <em>Mathews, </em>it involved a state-administered program. <em>Id. </em>at 1255. The court noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">Some benefits for aliens are required, some are prohibited. In between, the states are permitted to be more restrictive (or, depending on one\u2019s point of view, more generous). Relying on <em>Graham, </em>one could say, as Plaintiffs do, that when a state elects not to provide aliens with the maximum benefits permitted by federal law, it is discriminating against aliens and the federal government\u2019s imprimatur for such discrimination cannot reduce the level of scrutiny to which the state\u2019s choice is subjected under the Equal Protection Clause____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">We do not share that view. The reason for applying rational-basis review to federal law regarding aliens is that such laws reflect national policy that Congress has the constitutional power to enact. Once Congress has expressed that policy, the courts must be deferential. What Plaintiffs fail to consider is that a state\u2019s exercise of discretion can also effectuate national policy. Recall that the PRWORA does not give the states unfettered discretion. Some coverage must be provided to aliens; some coverage is forbidden. State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>discretion is limited to the remaining optional range of coverage. In exercising that discretion each state is to make its own assessment of whether it can bear the burden of providing any optional coverage. When a state determines that the burden is too high and decides against optional coverage, it is addressing the Congressional concern (not just a parochial state concern) that \u201cindividual aliens not burden the public benefits system.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1601(4). This may be bad policy, but it is Congressional policy; and we review it only to determine whether it is rational.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 264-65, 23 A.3d 451 (quoting <em>Soskin, supra, </em>353 F.3d at 1244) (additional citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">After reviewing the conflicting decisions from the courts of other states, we concluded that <em>Soskin </em>was persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">Given the Federal goals explicitly stated in PRWORA, and the complicated nature of the funding for the FamilyCare program that implicates Federal and State resources, we find the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Soskin, supra, </em>353 F.3d at 1255, that the appropriate standard of review lies somewhere between <em>Graham, </em>and <em>Mathews, </em>to be compelling. FamilyCare is a state program created to provide subsidized health insurance coverage to low-income children, their parents, and other adults whose family incomes are too high for them to be eligible for traditional Medicaid. The program is jointly funded by the state and federal government. NJ FamilyCare, http://www.njfamilycare.org/ (last visited June 23, 2011). Lawful permanent residents, otherwise eligible for Medicaid but for the five-year bar, were eligible for coverage under FamilyCare, but only with the use of state funds. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-1.1. Within the complex funding structure, defendants have now chosen to impose an eligibility requirement for state-funded benefits which directly conforms to federal requirements, 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1613(a), and has been upheld by the federal courts. <em>See, e.g., Mathews, supra, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>at 69, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1886, 48 L.Ed.2d at 484. We have upheld the five-year bar in other jointly-funded, state-administered Medicaid programs. <em>A.B., supra, </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 349-50 [971 A.2d 403]. The adoption of the federal five-year eligibility bar in the state program, while not mandated, mirrors federal objectives, corresponds to an identifiable congressional policy, and \u201coperate[s] harmoniously\u201d within the federal program. <em>Plyler, supra, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>at 226, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2399, 72 L.Ed.2d at 805; <em>see Sudomir v. McMahon, </em>767 <em>F.</em>2d 1456, 1466 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cIt would make no sense to say that Congress has plenary power in the area of immigration and naturalization and then hold that the Constitution impels the states to refrain from adhering to the federal guidelines.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">We conclude, therefore, that plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their equal protection claims under the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 266-67, 23 A.3d 451.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">We were likewise unpersuaded by plaintiffs\u2019 arguments premised on the State Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">In analyzing equal protection challenges under the state constitution, our courts have rejected the federal multi-tiered analysis (strict scrutiny, intermediate scruti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ny, rational basis), and employ a more flexible balancing test that considers three factors: \u201c(1) the nature of the right asserted; (2) the extent to which the statute intrudes upon that right; and (3) the public need for the intrusion.\u201d Although the federal and state tests are different, they \u201cweigh the same factors and often produce the same result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">Here, the means selected by defendants \u2014 adopting the federal eligibility criteria for aliens \u2014 bears a real and substantial relationship to PRWORA\u2019s \u201ccompelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy,\u201d and New Jersey\u2019s interest in providing subsidized health insurance within the limits of the appropriations as set forth in the enabling act. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-16. We conclude that under the more flexible standard of review applied to plaintiffs\u2019 state constitutional claims, they are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 267-68, 23 A.3d 451 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Without unnecessarily plowing over the same ground we covered in <em>Guaman I, </em>we return to <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>67, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976), and some newer cases that we deem pertinent. <em>Mathews </em>reminds us, in powerful language, of the deference due Congress\u2019s authority over immigration-related benefit issues. <em>Mathews </em>addressed a Federal statute that created a uniform residency requirement for aliens applying for the Medicare Part B supplemental medical insurance program. The plaintiffs challenged \u201c42 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1395o (2) (1970 ed., Supp. IV), which grants eligibility to resident citizens who are 65 or older but denies eligibility to comparable aliens unless they have been admitted for permanent residence and also have resided in the United States for at least five years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883. In that context, the Court addressed \u201cwhether Congress may discriminate in favor of citizens and against aliens in providing welfare benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">The Court began by reviewing the many permissible ways in which aliens may lawfully be treated differently than citizens.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATq\">In the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens. The exclusion of aliens and the reservation of the power to deport have no permissible counterpart in the Federal Government\u2019s power to regulate the conduct of its own citizenry. The fact that an Act of Congress treats aliens differently from citizens does not in itself imply that such disparate treatment is \u201cinvidious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 79-80, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The Court then considered Congress\u2019s broad power to differentiate between classes of aliens in determining how to distribute welfare benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">In particular, the fact that Congress has provided some welfare benefits for citizens does not require it to provide like benefits for all aliens. Neither the overnight visitor, the unfriendly agent of a hostile foreign power, the resident diplomat, nor the illegal entrant, can advance even a colorable constitutional claim to a share in the bounty that a conscientious sovereign makes available to its own citizens and some of its guests. The decision to share that bounty with our guests may take into account the character of the relationship between the alien and this country: Congress may decide that as the alien\u2019s tie grows stronger, so does the strength of his claim to an equal share of that munificence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">The real question presented by this case is not whether discrimination between citizens and aliens is permissible; rather, it is whether the statutory discrimination within the class of aliens \u2014 allowing benefits to some aliens but not to others \u2014 is permissible. We turn to that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 80, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The Court went on to consider the important national and international repercussions of federal immigration decisions and the reluctance with which courts should interfere in clearly-articulated federal immigration policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">For reasons long recognized as valid, the responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government. Since decisions in these matters may implicate our relations with foreign powers, and since a wide variety of classifications must be defined in the light of changing political and economic circumstances, such decisions are frequently of a character more appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive than to the Judiciary.... Any rule of constitutional law that would inhibit the flexibility of the political branches of government to respond to changing world conditions should be adopted only with the greatest caution. The reasons that preclude judicial review of political questions also dictate a narrow standard of review of decisions made by the Congress or the President in the area of immigration and naturalization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 81-82, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">The Court noted that the potential consequence of deciding the case adversely to the federal government would be a requirement that the government extend Medicare benefits to a huge additional pool of immigrants. <em>Id. </em>at 81 n. 20, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">Further, the Court accepted as a given that some form of residency requirement was appropriate in deciding which aliens would qualify for welfare benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Since it is obvious that Congress has no constitutional duty to provide all aliens with the welfare benefits provided to citizens, the party challenging the constitutionality of the particular line Congress has drawn has the burden of advancing principled reasoning that will at once invalidate that line and yet tolerate a different line separating some aliens from others. In this case the appellees have challenged two requirements \u2014 first, that the alien be admitted as a permanent resident, and, second, that his residence be of a duration of at least five years. But if these requirements were eliminated, surely Congress would at least require that the alien\u2019s entry be lawful; <em>even then, unless mere transients are to be held constitutionally entitled to benefits, some durational requirement would certainly be appropriate. In short, it is unquestionably reasonable for Congress to make an alien\u2019s eligibility depend on both the character and the duration of his residence. </em>Since neither requirement is wholly irrational, this case essentially involves nothing more than a claim that it would have been more reasonable for Congress to select somewhat different requirements of the same kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">We may assume that the five-year line drawn by Congress is longer than necessary to protect the fiscal integrity of the program. We may also assume that unnecessary hardship is incurred by persons just short of qualifying. But it remains true that some line is essential, that any line must produce some harsh and apparently arbitrary consequences, and, of greatest importance, that those who qualify under the test Congress has chosen may reasonably be presumed to have a greater affinity with the United States than those who do not. In short, citizens and those who are most like citizens qualify. Those who are less like citizens do not. <em>[Id. </em>at 82-83, 96 <em>S.Ct </em>1883 (footnote omitted) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We next return to our consideration of <em>Plyler v. Doe, swpra. </em>In <em>Plyler, </em>the Court suggested that, in treating aliens differently than citizens, the States may follow a uniform rule created by Congress:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">With respect to the actions of the Federal Government, alienage classifications may be intimately related to the conduct of foreign policy, to the federal prerogative to control access to the United States, and to the plenary federal power to determine who has sufficiently manifested his allegiance to become a citizen of the Nation. No State may independently exercise a like power. But if the Federal Government has by uniform rule prescribed what it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of an alien subclass, the States may, of course, follow the federal direction. <em>See De Canas v. Bica, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>351 [96 <em>S.Ct. </em>933, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>43] (1976). <em>[Plyler, supra, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>at 219 n. 19, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2396 n. 19, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 800 n. 19.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In <em>Plyler, </em>the Court searched for any Congressional policy authorizing the Texas law excluding undocumented alien children from attending the public schools, and found none. \u201cFaced with an equal protection challenge respecting the treatment of aliens, we agree that the courts must be attentive to congressional policy; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the exercise of congressional power might well affect the State\u2019s prerogatives to afford differential treatment to a particular class of aliens. But we are unable to find in the congressional immigration scheme any statement of policy that might weigh significantly in arriving at an equal protection balance concerning the State\u2019s authority to deprive these children of an education.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224-25, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2382. The Court elaborated on that finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">[T]here is no indication that the disability imposed by \u00a7 21.031 corresponds to any identifiable congressional policy. The State does not claim that the conservation of state educational resources was ever a congressional concern in restricting immigration.

Such discrimination, the Court concluded, would not only violate the Equal Protection Clause, but would also encroach upon federal authority over lawfully admitted aliens. In support of the latter conclusion, the Court noted that Congress had \u201cnot seen fit to impose any burden or restriction on aliens who become indigent after their entry into the United States,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 377 [91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1848], but rather had chosen to afford \u201clawfully admitted resident aliens ... the full and equal benefit of all state laws for the security of persons and property,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 378 [91 <em>S.Ct. </em>1848].

In describing the breadth of Congressional authority, Justice Kennedy cited PRWORA in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">Federal governance of immigration and alien status is extensive and complex. Congress has specified categories of aliens who may not be admitted to the United States. <em>See </em>8 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 1182. Unlawful entry and unlawful reentry into the country are federal offenses. \u00a7\u00a7 1325, 1326. Once here, aliens are required to register with the Federal Government and to carry proof of status on their person. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1301-1306. Failure to do so is a federal misdemeanor. \u00a7\u00a7 1304(e), 1306(a). <em>Federal law also authorizes States to deny noncitizens a range of public benefits, \u00a7 1622; </em>and it imposes sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized workers, \u00a7 1324a.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\"><em>[Arizona v.

Mauclet, </em>432 <em>U.S. </em>1, 97 <em>S.Ct. </em>2120, 53 L.Ed.2d 63 (1977). But none of those cases involved such an unmistakably clear and powerful statement of Congressional immigration policy to support the challenged state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">In light of the case law since <em>Mathews, </em>we believe it appropriate to give some further consideration to the \u201cuniform rule\u201d doctrine. We begin by looking afresh at what Congress said in PRWORA and what Congress was evidently trying to accomplish in that legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">The most critical section of PRWORA begins with a powerful and specific statement of Congress\u2019s concerns about the impact of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>immigration on the public fisc. It closes by describing state action in legalistic terms, obviously aimed at establishing that PRWORA embodies a critically important national policy and, therefore, that state statutes consistent with PRWORA should be deemed valid:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajd\">\u00a7 1601. Statements of national policy concerning welfare and immigration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">The Congress makes the following statements concerning national policy with respect to welfare and immigration:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">(1) Self-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this country\u2019s earliest immigration statutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">(2) It continues to be the immigration policy of the United States that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">(A) aliens within the Nation\u2019s borders not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of then-families, their sponsors, and private organizations, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">(B) the availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">(3) Despite the principle of self-sufficiency, aliens have been applying for and receiving public benefits from Federal, State, and local governments at increasing rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">(4) Current eligibility rules for public assistance and unenforceable financial support agreements have proved wholly incapable of assuring that individual aliens not burden the public benefits system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">(5) It is a compelling government interest to enact new rules for eligibility and sponsorship agreements in order to assure that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-14\">(6) It is a compelling government interest to remove the incentive for illegal immigration provided by the availability of public benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-15\">(7) With respect to the State authority to make determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public benefits in this title, <em>a State that chooses to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental interest </em>of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-16\">[8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1601 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">Arguably, the language Congress chose in subparagraph (7) was insensitive to separation-of-powers concerns. Nonetheless, stripped of legalese, subparagraph 7 expresses Congress\u2019s finding that when a state chooses to follow Congress\u2019s lead on this issue, by denying public benefits to legal aliens who have been in this country less than five years, it is furthering a very important national immigration policy. The issue is whether this statement of national policy, viewed pragmatically in light of the overall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>structure of Medicaid, is sufficiently \u201cuniform\u201d to constitutionally authorize states to follow Congress\u2019s policy choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">In some portions of PRWORA, Congress exercised the heavy hand of mandate, by prohibiting states from providing aliens with certain types of benefits. However, with respect to other types of benefits \u2014 notably, access to low-cost or no-cost health benefits\u2014 Congress chose the less heavy-handed approach of fiscal disincentives. <em>See Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, -, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>2566, 2579, 183 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>450, 466 (2012); <em>South Dakota v. Dole, </em>483 <em>U.S. </em>203, 205-06, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>2793, 2795, 97 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 171, 176-77 (1987). Thus, states choosing to extend health benefits to aliens who would not qualify under the Federal scheme, must do so entirely at their own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">There appears no question that Congress could absolutely and uniformly prohibit the States from providing these health benefits to legal aliens, as a matter of national immigration policy. The question before us is whether Congress\u2019s choice to use the less drastic approach of fiscal disincentives, rather than the sledgehammer of absolute prohibition, to impose its will on the States, should produce a different constitutional result. Putting the question another way, may Congress create a national immigration policy, one aspect of which allows the States some leeway in its implementation?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Answering this question involves looking at the broader picture of the Medicaid system. When Congress decreases federal funding to the States for Medicaid and related programs providing healthcare to low income persons, it places the States in the following financial bind. Federal Medicaid law requires the States to provide emergency healthcare to indigent persons, regardless of their immigration status or whether they otherwise qualify for any other form of Medicaid assistance. Because the Federal Medicaid law requires the States to provide emergency medical care \u201cto all individuals in need of such services,\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1611(b)(1)(A), cutting Federal Medicaid funding for legal aliens does not address the State-level fiscal problem posed by uninsured persons seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>urgently-needed health care in hospital emergency rooms. Our Legislature recognized, in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-9e, that reducing healthcare coverage for low-income persons results in increased expenditures for charity care in hospital emergency rooms. Consequently, as a practical matter, states can either fund healthcare for the poor on the \u201cfront end\u201d by providing them with some form of subsidized healthcare coverage, or pay on the \u201cback end\u201d in increased costs for hospital charity care. That choice may be driven by a state\u2019s current economic situation, e.g., whether it can afford to \u201cfront load\u201d healthcare costs or whether it prefers to bear higher costs in the future when its budget situation may be less dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">In turn, this paradigm may explain why Congress left the States some discretion to fund healthcare coverage for non-qualifying aliens, rather than absolutely prohibiting them from doing so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Congress\u2019s choice to structure the Medicaid program in this way does not necessarily mean it has created a \u201cnon-uniform\u201d system. As <em>Soskin </em>recognized, the uniform rule Congress has created must be viewed through a broad lens: Congress has expressed a very strong preference that resident aliens be self-sufficient and that this self-sufficiency should include obtaining their own healthcare coverage rather than relying on State or Federal Medicaid or Medicaid-like benefits. When the States follow that policy, by declining to fund coverage for aliens, they are implementing Congress\u2019s choice. In particular, when States conclude that they cannot afford those expenditures, they are implementing Congress\u2019s choice that recent immigrants should not unduly burden the public fisc. <em>See Soskin, supra, </em>353 F.3d at 1244.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Plaintiffs, joined by amici curiae, argue that this policy is fiscally short-sighted, inhumane, and unfairly singles out a group \u2014 legal resident aliens \u2014 that overall makes a major contribution to our nation\u2019s economy. However, to articulate these contentions is to identify them for what they are \u2014 policy arguments that should be addressed to Congress. Regardless of our view of the federal law, it is not our role to judge its wisdom.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">We conclude that when Congress, in the exercise of its Constitutional power over immigration, cuts off Medicaid funding for a group of aliens, the States cannot be required to restore that coverage using solely State funds. In general, the State may limit eligibility for Medicaid-related programs to only those persons whose participation is supported by federal funding. <em>See Hong Pham v. Starkowski, </em>300 <em>Conn. </em>412, 16 A.3d 635, 646 (2011) (\u201c[T]he equal protection clause does not require the states to \u2018fill the gap\u2019 in coverage for the class members that the federal government had created under the Welfare Reform Act.\u201d); <em>Doe v. Comm\u2019r of Transitional Assistance, </em>437 <em>Mass. </em>521, 773 N.E.2d 404 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The fact that the ineligible group in this ease includes legal resident aliens does not change the result. They are ineligible because the State has elected to follow a policy that Congress was constitutionally permitted to establish. Plaintiffs\u2019 analogy to discrimination against women and racial minorities is inapt here. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>regard to Congress\u2019s power to deny benefits, aliens are not analogous to women or racial minorities, because the United States Constitution substantially limits the extent to which Congress may draw distinctions regarding the latter groups. By contrast, Congress does have wide-ranging authority to treat aliens differently than citizens, in the exercise of its constitutional power over immigration. Moreover, there is no dispute that the State chose to exclude legal resident aliens from the NJFamily Care program solely for financial reasons, and not for any invidious discriminatory purpose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Plaintiffs argue that the State may not constitutionally allow existing non-federally-funded citizens and a small group of aliens with serious illnesses to remain in the NJFamily Care Program, while terminating plaintiffs\u2019 participation and refusing to allow new applicants in the program. We cannot agree. We conclude that this State action was likewise authorized by PRWORA and fell within the umbrella of the uniform policies articulated in \u00a7 1601 of PRWORA.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">We find unpersuasive the distinction some courts have recognized between the creation and then elimination of \u201calien-only\u201d benefit programs, versus the inclusion, and then exclusion, of aliens from unitary programs that provided benefits to both citizens and aliens. In our view, Congress either has the constitutional power to authorize the States to treat aliens differently for purposes of benefit programs or it does not, and likewise, the States either have the authority to follow Congress\u2019s clearly-stated immigration policy or they do not. The constitutionality of a State\u2019s action in this field should not depend on whether it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>first created a separate-but-equal (or somewhat unequal) program for aliens.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">We conclude that the Federal Equal Protection Clause does not bar a State from acting consistent with the clearly-expressed federal policy, embodied in PRWORA, to deny Medicaid benefits to legal aliens who do not meet the federal residency requirement. Even if the State responds reluctantly and only partially to the economic disincentives created in PRWORA, to the extent it does follow those disincentives, it is implementing the will of Congress. We also conclude that undermining Congress\u2019s authority to create uniform but flexible rules limiting social welfare benefits to immigrants could interfere with its future ability to mold national immigration policy. <em>See Mathews, supra, </em>426 <em>U.S. </em>at 81 n. 20, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1892 n. 20, 48 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 491 n. 20. That is a timely consideration as Congress is currently reconsidering the status of millions of undocumented aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In our prior decision in this case, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">The adoption of the federal five-year eligibility bar in the state program, while not mandated, mirrors federal objectives, corresponds to an identifiable congressional policy, and \u201coperate[s] harmoniously\u201d within the federal program. <em>Plyler, supra, </em>457 <em>U.S. </em>at 226, 102 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2399, 72 L.Ed.2d at 805; <em>see Sudomir v.

NJFamily Care provides subsidized health insurance for impoverished children and their parents, as well as for impoverished pregnant women, under several plans underwritten by Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (SCHIP). <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-8 (\"Family Health Care Coverage Act\"); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-1.3 (defining plans); <em>see also S.J. v. Div. of Med. Assist. &amp; Health Servs., </em>426 <em>N.J.Super. </em>366, 374-75, 44 A.3d 643 (App.Div.) (discussing plans), <em>certif. denied, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>461, 56 A.3d 395 (2012). At one time, the program also provided coverage for some impoverished, childless adults. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-1 to -4 (repealed 2005). In 2010, the State eliminated funding for, and barred participation by, non-qualifying resident aliens who were the adult non-pregnant parents of participating children. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.2(e). The State continued to allow participation by resident alien children and pregnant women, because, by 2009, the federal government had extended Medicaid coverage for those groups regardless of their length of residency, and hence their participation was subsidized by federal funds. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A, </em>\u00a7 1396b(v)(4)(A) (CHIPRA). In addition to dropping coverage for non-pregnant adult alien parents who could not meet the five-year residency requirement, the State closed the program to any new applicants \u2014 resident aliens or citizens \u2014 whose participation would not be subsidized by federal funding. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-1.1(a). The excluded group included parents with incomes higher than 133% of the federal poverty level, as well as impoverished, childless adults. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-9f. The State had previously subsidized their participation, with no federal subsidies, but concluded that due to a fiscal crisis it could no longer afford to do so. As of July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>2010, the Division \"extended medical coverage\u201d to restricted aliens still enrolled in the NJFamily Care program who were being treated for life-threatening medical conditions, regardless of their length of U.S. residency. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.2(e)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\"> Appellants have abandoned the statutory and regulatory arguments they initially raised on this appeal.

However, in passing the Affordable Care Act, Congress did not change PRWORA's five-year residency requirement for legal aliens' eligibility for Medicaid. <em>Treatment of Noncitizens, supra. </em>Hence, it seems clear that the five-year Medicaid eligibility requirement continues to represent a strong federal policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\"> For that reason, plaintiffs' citation of <em>Right to Choose v.

In that case, the restriction on Medicaid funding for health-required abortions had no rational fiscal justification and was transparently aimed at burdening women\u2019s access to a particular medical procedure protected under our State Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b288-10\"> We also note that this issue is virtually moot. According to plaintiffs, the only current non-federally funded NJFamily Care participants are resident aliens with serious medical conditions. According to the State, in 2011, the Legislature restored to participation in NJFamily Care a very small group of persons who formerly participated in the long-closed New Jersey Health Access program. There are 47 such persons currently participating in NJFamily Care, while there are at least 100 aliens participating. All of these participants are slated to be transitioned to coverage under the Affordable Care Act. <em>See L. </em>2013, <em>c. </em>77.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b289-6\">HARRIS, J.A.D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">I. Preamble</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">To address pressing issues relating to its ability to balance the state budget, our Legislature in 2010 ordered defendant Commissioner of Human Services \u2014 steward for the poor \u2014 to cut costs. As a means to that end, the Commissioner and her Director of Medical Assistance and Health Services terminated long-provided, state-funded health insurance benefits for thousands of impoverished aliens who have a lawful right to be in this country, while leaving intact such benefits to similarly situated citizens. Unlike my colleagues in the majority, I cannot reconcile that action with principles of equality under the law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">II. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">To resolve whether this state action is valid, a full analysis of the formidable issues left (properly) unresolved by our denial of an interlocutory injunction in <em>Guaman v. Velez, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 248, 23 A.3d 451 (App.Div.2011) <em>(Guaman </em>I) is necessary. Familiarity with that opinion is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">The primary concern is whether the New Jersey Department of Human Services\u2019s 2010 (and subsequent) termination of plaintiffs\u2019 enrollment in NJ FamilyCare \u2014 a state-subsidized low cost or no cost health insurance program \u2014 passes muster under the equal protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">For purposes of Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, a two-step process must be followed. The reckoning first requires a determination of whether a strict scrutiny or a rational basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>review is to be applied to our state\u2019s mime of Congress\u2019s five-year residency classification to decline critical health care benefits to noncitizen immigrants lawfudly residing in the United States. Then, after the federal standard of review is determined, defendants\u2019 regulatory scheme is justly analyzed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Once this Fourteenth Amendment analysis is complete, the effect of our state\u2019s constitutional guarantee of equal protection is considered. While closely congruent with the federal promise, Article I, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution is, nevertheless, recognizably more protective of ensuring equal rights for equally-situated persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The panel in <em>Guarnan I </em>concluded that, for purposes of a preliminary injunction, \u201cplaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their equal protection claims under the United States Constitution,\u201d and likewise, \u201cunder the more flexible standard of review applied to plaintiffs\u2019 state constitutional claims, they are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267-68, 23 A.3d 451. Accordingly, the panel denied plaintiffs\u2019 request for an interim injunction barring the implementation of the proposed regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The basis for that panel\u2019s conclusions was that \u201c[t]he adoption of the federal five-year eligibility bar in the state program ... mirrors federal objectives, corresponds to an identifiable congressional policy, and \u2018operatefs] harmoniously\u2019 within the federal program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 23 A.3d 451 (first alteration in original) (citation omitted). Although I share some of those and the majority\u2019s views, I am unable to agree that such attributes immunize the state action from the commands of either the federal or state equal protection guaranties. Consequently, I conclude that the regulatory (and underlying legislative) contrivance is unconstitutional, and I would remand the matter to the Law Division to fashion appropriate remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">III. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">This is a putative class action that seeks a declaratory judgment and equitable remedies \u2014 primarily injunctive relief \u2014 pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983; the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article I, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, purporting to represent a class of approximately 12,000 lawful noncitizen New Jersey residents, claim that defendants\u2019 Medicaid Communication 10-01 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78\u20143.2(b)(1), which authorized termination of their enrollment in NJ FamilyCare, invidiously discriminate on the basis of alien-age.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The genesis of the present controversy is traceable to the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (the Personal Responsibility Act), <em>Pub.L. No. </em>104-193, 110 <em>Stat. </em>2105 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 8 and 42 U.S.C.A.), which expressed national policies regarding the linkage between welfare and immigration. The Personal Responsibility Act dramatically altered alien-eligibility requirements for federal public benefits and for state and local public benefits, including access to medical benefits. <em>See A.B. v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, 343, 971 A.2d 403 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>210, 976 A.2d 386 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Among the motives for enacting the Personal Responsibility Act was to restrict the availability of public benefits so that they \u201cnot constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1601(2)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Another statutory goal was to facilitate immigrant self-reliance so that \u201caliens within the Nation\u2019s borders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>not depend on public resources to meet their needs, but rather rely on their own capabilities and the resources of their families, their sponsors, and private organizations.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1601(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">One mechanism employed to further these and the other goals of Congress was to foster a novel dual system of public assistance. The Personal Responsibility Act classifies aliens into two general categories: \u201cqualified aliens\u201d and \u201cnon-qualified aliens.\u201d 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1641. Qualified aliens include aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence, asylees, refugees, aliens paroled into the United States for at least one year, aliens whose deportation is being withheld, aliens who have been granted conditional entry, certain Cuban and Haitian entrants, and certain victims of battery or extreme cruelty by a spouse or other family member. 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1641(b)-(c). All other aliens are deemed non-qualified aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Qualified status is essentially a prerequisite for federal benefits: non-qualified aliens are, with some exceptions not relevant here, ineligible for federal benefits. 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1611(a) and (b). Generally, only qualified aliens who have maintained their qualified status for five or more years are eligible for federal benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayl\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law and except as provided in subsections (b), (e), and (d), an alien who is a qualified alien (as defined in section 431 [8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1641]) and who enters the United States on or after the date of the enactment of this Act [enacted August 22, 1996] is not eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit for a period of 5 years beginning on the date of the alien\u2019s entry into the United States with a status within the meaning of the term \u201cqualified alien.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">[8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1613(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">While shutting the door to federal programs, Congress nevertheless permits individual states to decide whether qualified aliens would or would not receive various forms of state-subsidized public assistance. Thus, each state is permitted to invoke its discretionary right to provide state-funded health benefits to qualified aliens regardless of their durational presence in the country. 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1622(a). In so doing, the state is granted the putative benefit of the following congressional declaration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>With respect to the Stale authority to make determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public benefits .., a State that chooses to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">[8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1601(7).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">New Jersey, along with many other states, elected to provide all lawful aliens with some state-funded benefits without regard to how long such persons resided in the United States, while imposing durational prerequisites on other forms of public assistance. We described our state\u2019s relevant post-Personal Responsibility Act history as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">Our legislature thereafter amended the statutory definition of \u201c \u2018[q]ualified applicant\u2019 \u201d to mean \u201ca person who is a resident of this State, and either a citizen of the United States or an eligible alien[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-3(i). An \u201c \u2018[eligible alien\u2019\u201d was defined, in part, as \u201ca lawful permanent resident\u201d who entered the United States prior to August 22, 1996, or if entry occurred after August 22, 1996, \u201cwho entered the United States at least five years ago.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-3(q).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">In 2005, the Legislature adopted The Family Health Care Coverage Act (FHCCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-8 to -19, which re-established, reformed, and expanded a prior program to provide subsidized health insurance coverage to qualifying children, pregnant women, and low-income parents, guardians, and individuals, <em>\u201cwithin the limits of funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the program.\u201d N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-12(a) (emphasis added). The new FamilyCare program was intended to address the \u201cmost serious health problem\u201d facing state residents, namely, the \u201clack of access to affordable health care coverage,\u201d which forced \u201cfamilies to go without needed preventive and other nonemergency care until serious illness require[d] expensive hospital care.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-9(a). The program, which was re-opened to parents and other low-income adults, was designed, in part, to reduce State appropriations for charity care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">The FHCCA defined a \u201c \u2018Lqjualified applicant\u2019 \u201d as a low income child, parent or caretaker, or single adult or couple without children, who had no health insurance, was ineligible for Medicaid, was a resident of the state, and was \u201ca citizen of the United States, or ha[d] been lawfully admitted for permanent residence into and remain[ed] lawfully present in the United States[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-U. Thus, in contrast to other state Medicaid programs, the Legislature elected to offer FamilyCare benefits to qualified aliens otherwise ineligible for federal Medicaid because of the five-year bar. DHS readopted the prior FamilyCare regulations, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-1.1 to -11.5, and, in accordance with the statutory scheme, all otherwise-qualified aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence were eligible to participate in the program regardless of the date of entry into the country or length of residency. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.2(a) (amended 2010); 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>2606 (June 19, 2006); 38 <em>N.J.R. </em>4225 (October 2, 2006).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Eligibility for FamilyCare was expanded by the Legislature in 2008 when it enacted the \u201cNew Jersey Health Care Reform Act,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:15-1 to -2, which, in part, expanded eligibility to parents with incomes from 133% to 200% of the federal poverty level, and mandated that all children in the state have health care coverage either through private or public programs. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>26:15-l(g). The Legislature did not amend the broad definition of a \u201cqualified applicant\u201d contained in the FHCCA.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\"><em>[Guaman I, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 250-51, 23 A.3d 451 (alterations in original) (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Thus, New Jersey afforded its needy population \u2014 including all such citizens and all such lawful noncitizen immigrants \u2014 with low or no cost health care coverage for many years. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-9. As far as the record reveals, notwithstanding the Department of Human Services\u2019s internal nomenclature of \u201clegal restricted aliens\u201d as \u201cSpecial Program Code 40,\u201d NJ FamilyCare has been operated in a homogeneous fashion in accordance with its legislative plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-11 (defining \u201cqualified applicants\u201d for N.J FamilyCare as both citizens and lawful noncitizen immigrants).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Unfortunately, a time came when the state\u2019s health insurance safety net for impoverished lawful noncitizens was curtailed. Triggered mainly by 2008\u2019s recessionary tsunami, our Legislature embarked upon a strategy of belt-tightening measures that continues until this day, and which sacrificed the health care benefits of lawful aliens receiving NJ FamilyCare in the name of fiscal accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The Legislature\u2019s first reaction to the unprecedented economic downturn was its June 2009 adoption of the 2010 Appropriations Act, <em>L. </em>2009, c. 68. Among its defensive provisions, the 2010 Appropriations Act provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2Z\">the Commissioner of Human Services shall adopt immediately ... such regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to ensure that monies expended for the NJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>FamilyCare program do not exceed the amount hereinabove appropriated. Such regulation may change or adjust the financial and non-financial eligibility requirements for some or all of the applicants or beneficiaries in the program, the benefits provided, cost-sharing amounts, or may suspend in whole or in part the processing of applications for any or all categories of individuals covered by the program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">[2010 Appropriations Act, <em>L. </em>2009, <em>c. </em>68 at 108.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">An identical provision was incorporated in the 2011 Appropriations Act, <em>L. </em>2010, c. 35 at 111, adopted on June 29, 2010, the same day-plaintiffs filed their initial complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Neither of the Appropriations Acts expressly ordered the Commissioner of Human Services to target any particular group, much less lawful noncitizen immigrants, as a means to achieve a leaner budget. However, after this litigation was initiated, the Legislature\u2019s 2012 and 2013 Appropriations Acts expressly ordered the adoption of alienage-based durational restrictions. <em>See L. </em>2011, c. 85 at 111 and <em>L. </em>2012, c. 18 at 99.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">As already noted, plaintiffs take issue with the implementation of the mandates contained in the 2010 and subsequent Appropriation Acts. There is no dispute that the adoption of Medicaid Communication 10-01 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.2(b)(1), which negatively impacted (and continues to impact) plaintiffs, was intended to place, in part, the burden of budget balancing on the backs of newcomer noncitizen immigrants. Thus, in order to subsidize (and perhaps save) public benefits for citizens and longer-term\u2014 i.e., greater than five years \u2014 United States-resident aliens, the durational alienage paradigm of the Personal Responsibility Act was imported jot-for-jot to New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>IV. Contentions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Plaintiffs and amici contend that the termination of NJ Family-Care benefits based solely upon the length that a legal immigrant has resided in the United States is a species of unlawful discrimination, barred by the equal protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions. Defendants counter by asserting that New Jersey merely adopted the federal durational language of the Personal Responsibility Act and is entitled to its imprimatur. Each side spins the constitutional jurisprudence to its best advantage, with plaintiffs and amici asserting that our standard of review for the federal claim must apply strict scrutiny (sometimes touted as being \u201c \u2018strict\u2019 in theory but usually \u2018fatal\u2019 in fact,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Bernal v. Fainter, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>216, 219 n. 6, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2312, 2315 n. 6, 81 L.Ed.2d 175, 180 n. 6 (1984)). Defendants, on the other hand, claim that the state actions are to be measured by the more indulgent rational basis analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Additionally, each party trumpets one particular case to principally advance its position. Plaintiffs and amici rely upon the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s related opinions in <em>Finch v. Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, </em>459 <em>Mass. </em>655, 946 <em>N.E.</em>2d 1262 (2011) <em>(Finch I) </em>(holding that a legislative appropriation denying state subsidies for the purchase of health care to lawfully-residing noncitizen immigrants who were ineligible for federal benefits under the Personal Responsibility Act is to be tested by strict scrutiny) and <em>Finch v. Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority, </em>461 <em>Mass. </em>232, 959 N.E.2d 970 (2012) <em>(Finch </em>II) (finding that the challenged statute, in fact, failed strict scrutiny and was unconstitutional under the Massachusetts Constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Defendants stress the similarity of the facts and issues in the present appeal with those found in the Tenth Circuit\u2019s <em>Soskin v. Reinertson, </em>353 F.3d 1242 (10th Cir.2004) (applying a rational basis standard in reviewing equal protection challenges to a Colorado state law that repealed optional jointly-funded Medicaid coverage to otherwise legal aliens).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The panel in <em>Guaman I </em>rejected <em>Finch Fs </em>application of strict scrutiny to the problem at hand, concluding that \u201c[g]iven the Federal goals explicitly stated in [the Personal Responsibility Act], and the complicated nature of the funding for the [NJ] FamilyCare program that implicates Federal and State resources, we find the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Soskin </em>to be compelling.\u201d <em>Guaman I, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 266, 23 A.3d 451 (citation omitted). My review leaves me with the opposite conclusion about <em>Soskin\u2019s </em>reasoning, and instead I find the analyses of <em>Finch I </em>and <em>Finch II </em>more persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">V. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"A3B\">A <em>First Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Fundamental tenets of deference start every judicial analysis of the acts of other branches of government. The legislative department is accorded the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">As a threshold matter, we note that \u201cevery possible presumption favors the validity of an act of the Legislature.\u201d <em>N.J. Sports &amp; Exposition Auth. v. McCrane, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>1, 8 [292 A.2d 545], <em>appeal dismissed sub nom., Borough of E. Rutherford v. N.J. Sports &amp; Exposition Auth., </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>943, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>270, 34 L.Ed.2d 215 (1972). In light of the co-equal but distinct responsibilities of the judicial and legislative branches of government, \u201cwe will not declare void legislation unless its repugnancy to the Constitution is clear beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>In re P.L. 2001, Chapter 362, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>368, 392 [895 A.2d 1128] (2006) (internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\"><em>[In re T.J.S., </em>419 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 56, 16 A.3d 386 (App.Div.2011), <em>aff'd, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>334, 54 A.3d 263 (2012).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">A similar principle applies when the judiciary reviews acts of the executive department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">\u201cCourts have only a limited role to play in reviewing the actions of other branches of government. In light of the executive function of administrative agencies, judicial capacity to review administrative actions is severely limited.\u201d <em>In re Musick, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>206, 216 [670 A.2d 11] (1996).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\"><em>[Matturri v.

Thus, both noncitizens and citizens are entitled to \u201cequal protection of the laws of the State in which they reside.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Equal Protection Clause also requires that similarly situated individuals be treated alike by the laws of a state. <em>City of Cleburne v.

Methodology</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">In evaluating whether a plaintiff has presented a viable federal equal protection claim, a court must determine what level of scrutiny applies to the government action at issue. <em>See City of Cleburne, supra, </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>at 439-40, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3254, 87 L.Ed.2d at 320 (\u201cthe courts have themselves devised standards for determining the validity of state legislation or other official action that is challenged as denying equal protection\u201d). \u201cThe starting point for any equal protection analysis is to determine the standard of review, or level of scrutiny, that should be applied to the challenged classification.\u201d <em>In re Contest of Nov. 8, 2011 Gen.

Clerk of Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 325, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001) (noting that intermediate scrutiny applies \u201cwhen an act involves a semi-suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>class\u201d), was the appropriate standard of review. However, <em>Guaman I </em>did not further explicate the issue because its limited task was to assess whether plaintiffs satisfied, by clear and convincing evidence, the reasonable-probability-of-suceess-on-the-merits prong of <em>Crowe v. De Gioia, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>126, 447 A.2d 173 (1982), and its progeny. <em>Guaman I, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 247-48, 23 A.3d 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Because I can find neither decisional law nor other authority to invoke an intermediate scrutiny standard of review relating to alienage classifications, I part company with the <em>Guaman I </em>panel. Furthermore, I am unable to subscribe to the <em>Soskin </em>majority\u2019s needlessly complex analysis of the uniform-rule doctrine because its labyrinthine logic is, at best, a strained reading of the Personal Responsibility Act. Constitutional analysis is better served by applying Occam\u2019s razor to the mission: that the simplest of competing explanations is preferred to the more complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\"><em>Soskin </em>arose when Colorado decided to withdraw Medicaid-like benefits from all aliens not statutorily entitled by the Personal Responsibility Act to receive them. <em>Soskin, supra, </em>353 F.3d at 1246. After the federal statute\u2019s enactment in 1997, Colorado continued to provide uniform coverage to all of its residents\u2014 citizens and lawful noncitizens alike \u2014 despite Congress\u2019s ruling that only certain aliens were entitled to receive benefits. In 2003, however, \u201c[f]aced with an enormous budget shortfall, [Colorado] looked to its Medicaid program for savings.\u201d Ibid. Acting in what it believed was authorized by the Personal Responsibility Act, Colorado\u2019s legislature removed the optional Medicaid coverage it had been providing to lawful noncitizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Notwithstanding <em>Graham\u2019s </em>clear statement that \u201cCongress does not have the power to authorize the individual States to violate the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d <em>Graham, supra, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>at 382, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1857, 29 L.Ed.2d at 548, the <em>Soskin </em>majority posited that \u201cthe issue is more nuanced than the quoted proposition indicates.\u201d <em>Soskin, supra, </em>353 F.3d at 1254. It further explained that the quoted sentence from <em>Graham: </em>\u201cis almost tautological,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>comment is both wholly unilluminating and totally indifferent to the plain commandment of <em>Graham. Ibid. </em>Relying solely on the principle that \u201ccourts must be deferential\u201d to national immigration policy, <em>id. </em>at 1255, <em>Soskin </em>declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">What Congress has done in the [Personal Responsibility Act] is, in essence, create two welfare programs, one for citizens and one for aliens. Within the aliens-only program, states have the option of including more or fewer aliens. The decision to have separate programs for aliens and citizens is a Congressional choice, subject only to rational-basis review. A state\u2019s exercise of the option to include fewer aliens in its aliens-only program, then, should not be treated as discrimination against aliens as compared to citizens. That aspect of the discrimination is Congress\u2019s doing \u2014 by creating one program for citizens and a separate one for aliens. Rather, what the state is doing is discriminating within the aliens-only program against one class of aliens as compared to other classes of aliens. <em>[Id. </em>at 1255-56.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">I disagree with this analysis of Congressional intent because it is an invention made up out of whole cloth, and relies, in part, upon the wholly inapposite case of <em>Doe v. Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>437 <em>Mass. </em>521, 773 N.E.2d 404 (2002), which concerned <em>residency </em>classifications, not <em>alienage. Id. </em>at 414.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\"><em>Soskin </em>also repudiated the convincing opinion of the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Aliessa v. Novello, </em>96 N.Y.2d 418, 730 N.Y.S.2d 1, 754 N.E.2d 1085 (2001), which involved a funetionally-equivalent law to Colorado\u2019s statute. <em>Aliessa </em>held that the Personal Responsibility Act was not an example of a law subject to the uniform-rule doctrine because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">in administering their own programs, the States are free to discriminate in either direction \u2014 producing not uniformity, but potentially wide variation based on localized or idiosyncratic concepts of largesse, economics and politics. Considering that Congress has conferred upon the States such broad discretionary power to grant or deny aliens State Medicaid, we are unable to conclude that [the Personal Responsibility Act] reflects a uniform national policy. If the rule were uniform, each State would carry out the same policy under the mandate of Congress \u2014 the only body with authority to set immigration policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\"><em>[Id. </em>730 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>1, 754 N.E.2d at 1098.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">I agree with these observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">It is both analytically satisfying and more logical to recognize that the Personal Responsibility Act was not intended to create a uniform strategy of chaos. Instead, the congressional rule allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ing the exercise of state-by-state discretion created, not a mosaic blend of a well-planned and executed uniform policy, but a crazy quilt of state immigration approaches. The discretion reposed in fifty state legislatures, born of political compromise, belies uniformity. A national ship of state cannot sail a straight line if each laboring oar decides for itself whether to sit idle, pull in tandem with Congress, or row backwards. Uniformity is provided by lip service, nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Against this backdrop of asynchrony, it is apparent that federal lawmakers were expressly aware that they were not creating a Plyler-like uniform rule of immigration policy, and consequently a rational basis review would not be available to discriminating states. This is evident from Congress\u2019s attempt to insert a strict scrutiny antidote under 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1601(7):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">With respect to the State authority to make determinations concerning the eligibility of qualified aliens for public benefits ..., a State that chooses to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen <em>the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental interest </em>of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">It is no coincidence that the highlighted phrase incorporates language purporting <em>to </em>satisfy strict judicial scrutiny. Aside <em>from </em>whether the legislative branch can force-feed a constitutional solution to a federal or state court, 8 <em>U.S.C.A, </em>\u00a7 1601(7) plainly evinces congressional recognition that the uniform-rule doctrine was never expected to hold sway. Why else would this safe harbor provision be inserted except to attempt to satisfy the anticipated heightened standard of strict scrutiny?</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Thus, I remain unpersuaded by the <em>Soskin </em>majority on the issue of the uniform-rule doctrine and the ultimate standard of review. Instead, the direct approaches of the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Aliessa, </em>and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Finch I, </em>which are simpler and more convincing than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Soskin\u2019s </em>arcane approach,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> should be the touchstones for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The facts that undergird <em>Finch I </em>are analogous, but not identical, to the present appeal. Massachusetts requires all state residents over the age of eighteen to obtain health insurance as long as it is affordable. To further this requirement, the legislature created a premium assistance program, known locally as Commonwealth Care, to ensure that health care is accessible to low income residents of the state. While both state and federal funding support payment of the premium remainders of enrollees, the federal government does not provide funding for lawfully residing aliens. Despite the federal funding restrictions, such aliens had been eligible to receive premium assistance, but at a substantial cost to the public, as state funding completely covered their premium remainders. In 2009, the Massachusetts legislature passed an appropriations bill that altered the eligibility provisions by adopting the federal eligibility standards set forth in the Personal Responsibility Act, thereby eliminating premium assistance for needy lawfully residing noncitizens, but continuing such assistance for needy citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In addressing the uniform-rule doctrine, the court held the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-7\">[The Personal Responsibility Act] permits the States to adopt some, all, or none of the eligibility requirements established in [The Personal Responsibility Act] as long as no benefits are paid for from the Federal fisc. The statute expresses a preference for \u201c[s]elf-sufficieney\u201d but does not suggest a congressional preference that benefits not be provided to qualified aliens. Indeed, the statute does not even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>express such a preference regarding aliens who, unlike members of the plaintiff class, are \u201cnot lawfully present in the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">[The Personal Responsibility Act] states that aliens \u201cnot lawfully present\u201d are prohibited from receiving public benefits (State or Federal) but provides, in the same section, that States may through \u201caffirmative[ ] provision]\u201d restore to such aliens any benefits lost as a result of [The Personal Responsibility Act! Even regarding aliens \u201cnot lawfully present,\u201d therefore, Congress\u2019s sole interest is in the source of funds for the benefits and not in the provision or denial of the benefits themselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">Indeed, far from considering [the Personal Responsibility Act] to be a mandate to the States, in the statute\u2019s \u201cstatements of national policy\u201d Congress seeks to tip the scales of equal protection analysis where \u201ca State ... <em>chooses </em>to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of [federally ineligible] aliens for public assistance\u201d (emphasis added). [The Personal Responsibility Act], therefore, does not require that States apply Federal eligibility requirements but instead merely declares that Federal policy will not be thwarted if States decide to discriminate against qualified aliens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">In the context of Commonwealth Care, [the Personal Responsibility Act] is thus a statement by Congress that the Federal government will be subsidizing the State\u2019s provision of benefits to some residents (citizens and eligible aliens) but not to others (federally ineligible aliens). This is a financial impediment to State action but not a mandate under the supremacy clause that might require the application of rational basis review. Where the State is left with a range of options including discriminatory and nondiscriminatory policies, its selection amongst those options must be reviewed under the standards applicable to the State and not those applicable to Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-9\"><em>[Finch </em>I, <em>supra, </em>946 N.E.2d at 1276-77 <em>&amp; </em>n. 18 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Therefore, the court concluded that the local decision to adopt the time-sensitive eligibility criterion of the Personal Responsibility Act must be reviewed under the standard of review applicable to Massachusetts, and not Congress. Recognizing Massachusetts\u2019s well-established equal protection jurisprudence, the court held that a strict scrutiny standard of review should be used to determine the constitutionality of Commonwealth Care\u2019s alienage-based classification. <em>Id. </em>at 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Even if it were true that \u201c[determining whether or not [the Personal Responsibility Act] provides a \u2018uniform rule\u2019 is an elusive, and ultimately unsatisfying, exercise,\u201d <em>Guaman I, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 263, 23 A.3d 451 <em>Finch I's </em>transparent explication of the uniform-rule doctrine \u2014 resulting in the application of <em>Gra</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>ham\u2019s </em>strict scrutiny analysis \u2014 is convincing. It is not enough for the Equal Protection Clause\u2019s purposes that New Jersey\u2019s enactment of the five-year eligibility bar in NJ FamilyCare merely \u201cmirrors federal objectives, corresponds to an identifiable congressional policy, and \u2018operate[s] harmoniously\u2019 within the federal program.\u201d <em>Guaman I, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 266, 23 A.3d 451 (alteration in original). Because that federal program does not itself operate as a uniform solution to an immigration-related problem, the fact that New Jersey seeks shelter under its auspices for a discriminatory regulatory scheme enacted more than a decade after the Personal Responsibility Act\u2019s adoption does not insulate such state action from strict scrutiny. <em>See Aliessa, supra, </em>730 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>1, 754 <em>N.E.</em>2d at 1098 (noting that states \u201care free to discriminate in either direction \u2014 producing not uniformity, but potentially wide variation based on localized or idiosyncratic concepts of largesse, economics and politics\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\n<em>5. Strict Judicial Scrutiny</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Here, the actual merits analysis that was not required to be performed in <em>Guaman I </em>is conducted. Plaintiffs argue that Medicaid Communication 10-01 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.2(b)(1) fail strict judicial scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause because the alienage-based classification chosen to treat the State\u2019s fiscal infirmity is not suitably tailored to serve a compelling state interest. <em>See City of Cleburne, supra, </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>at 440, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3254, 87 L.Ed.2d at 320 (noting that classifications such as race, alienage, or national origin are \u201cso seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy \u2014 a view that those in the burdened class are not as worthy or deserving as others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Without conceding that strict scrutiny applies, defendants argue that \u201cthe need to conserve state fiscal resources and the need to assure that state expenditures do not exceed appropriations\u201d are reasons to validate the state discrimination. Defendants trumpet the need for a constitutionally balanced budget, <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>VIII, \u00a7 2, It 2, and note that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-12(e) commands (in essence) that NJ FamilyCare be made available only within the \u201cconstraints of fiscal responsibility and within the limits of available funding in any year.\u201d Defendants have not explained, however, why their reduction in the ranks of NJ FamilyCare was visited only upon noncitizen immigrants, leaving equally-positioned citizens untouched. If the effects of the post-2009 recession require shared sacrifices, the State has failed to prove why needy citizens should continue to receive their full NJ FamilyCare benefits, while needy lawful noncitizens receive nothing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Among the many teachings of <em>Graham </em>is the following: \u201ca State\u2019s desire to preserve limited welfare benefits for its own citizens is inadequate to justify [the state\u2019s discriminatory actions].\u201d <em>Graham, supra, </em>403 <em>U.S. </em>at 374, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1853, 29 L.Ed.2d at 543. The Supreme Court noted that legal aliens are in many ways indistinguishable from citizens, and then provided a few examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">[T]he justification of limiting expenses is particularly inappropriate and unreasonable when the discriminated class consists of aliens. Aliens like citizens pay taxes and may be called into the armed forces.... There can be no \u201cspecial public interest\u201d in tax revenues to which aliens have contributed on an equal basis with the residents of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\"><em>[Id </em>at 376, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1854, 29 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 544 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">I cannot accede to defendants\u2019 view that fiscal concerns qualify as a compelling state interest under the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See Bernal, supra, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>at 219, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2315, 81 L.Ed.2d at 179 (holding that a state law that discriminates on the basis of alienage can be sustained only if it can withstand strict judicial scrutiny, that is, the law must advance a compelling state interest by the least restrictive means available); <em>see also Finch II, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>959 N.E.2d at 976 (\u201cFiscal considerations alone cannot justify a State\u2019s invidious discrimination against aliens.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">I also reject defendants\u2019 claim that NJ FamilyCare\u2019s excision of newcomer noncitizens is validated by 8 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1601(7)\u2019s expression of a state\u2019s satisfaction of strict judicial scrutiny. As already noted, this congressional expression purports to invest state actions that mimic federal eligibility requirements with immunity from the otherwise-likely fatal effects of strict judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In pertinent part, the statute says that \u201ca State that chooses to follow the Federal classification in determining the eligibility of such aliens for public assistance shall be considered to have chosen the least restrictive means available for achieving the compelling governmental interest of assuring that aliens be self-reliant in accordance with national immigration policy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Defendants\u2019 Medicaid Communication 10-01 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78-3.2(b)(1), which give no lip service to national immigration policy whatsoever, do not enjoy the imprimatur of constitutional fulfillment just because the national legislature said so.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">It is always wise to take the legislative and executive branches at their word because it is a dangerous business for the judiciary to infer unspoken purposes into a regulatory matrix. There is no proof that immigration consequences \u2014 good or bad \u2014 were ever considered in the actions that are under review. My sense is that defendants\u2019 post hoe immigration rationale is an improper attempt to utilize a litigational advantage that is abhorred by the square corners doctrine. <em>See CBS Outdoor, Inc. v. Borough of Lebanon Planning Bd./Bd. of Adjustment, </em>414 <em>N.J.Super. </em>563, 585, 999 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>A.2d 1151 (App.Div.2010) (\u201cFor almost a half-century, our State\u2019s public policy jurisprudence has expressly insisted that governmental agents and units of government observe certain standards and norms \u2014 particularly during litigation \u2014 that are beyond reproach.\u201d) (citing <em>F.M.C. Stores Co. v. Borough of Morris Plains, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>418, 426, 495 A.2d 1313 (1985)); <em>see also Finch II, supra, </em>959 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 975 (\u201cStrict scrutiny requires an inquiry into the actual purpose or motivation behind the legislation rather than any purpose hypothesized post hoc during litigation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Additionally, it is highly doubtful that Congress\u2019s instruction to the courts to find a compelling interest in this particular species of fiscal motivation would withstand review under a separation of powers analysis. \u201c[T]he Judiciary is the final arbiter of the institutional commissions articulated in the Constitution.\u201d <em>Gallenthin Realty Dev., Inc. v. Borough of Paulsboro, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>344, 358, 924 A.2d 447 (2007) (citing <em>Marbury v. Madison, </em>5 <em>U.S. </em>(1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 <em>L.Ed. </em>60, 73 (1803) <em>(\u201cIt is </em>emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\u201d)). The Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate the details of immigration, not the power to decide when and where its laws are subject to a particular scope of review. The former power is reflective of the constitutional recognition that certain matters requiring political judgments are best left to the political branches. \u201cThe latter would permit a striking anomaly in our tripartite system of government, leading to a regime in which Congress ..., [not the judiciary], say[s] \u2018what the law is.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boumediene v. Bush, </em>553 <em>U.S. </em>723, 765, 128 <em>S.Ct. </em>2229, 2259, 171 L.Ed.2d 41, 77 (2008) (quoting <em>Marbury, supra, </em>5 <em>U.S. </em>at 177, 2 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 73). To automatically accede to Congress\u2019s foisting of a scope of review upon the judiciary would grant \u201ca dangerous permission slip for the arrogation of power.\u201d <em>Decker v. Northwest Envtl. Def.

Harris, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>415, 456, 908 A.2d 196 (2006). It has long been recognized that our constitution\u2019s equal protection provision, \u201clike the fourteenth amendment, seeks to protect against injustice and against the unequal treatment of those who should be treated alike.\u201d <em>State v.

Instead, we require the application of a balancing test consisting of three elements: \u201c(1) the nature of the right asserted; (2) the extent to which the statute intrudes upon that right; and (3) the public need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>for the intrusion.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hagen, supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 164, 914 A.2d 267.

According to the record, 12,000 residents depend upon N J FamilyCare for vital health care access. This heavy reliance on the program indicates how necessary and effective it is, and clearly demonstrates how substantially the restriction operates against the protected class.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Although the New Jersey Constitution does not guarantee a fundamental right to health, the Court has recognized \u201cthat New Jersey accords a high priority to the preservation of health.\u201d <em>Right to Choose, supra, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 450 A.2d 925. Indeed, when enacting the current version of NJ FamilyCare, the Legislature stated: \u201cThe expanded health care coverage provided by this act builds on New Jersey\u2019s longstanding commitment to assure access to quality health care that is provided in an efficient and effective manner and at a reasonable cost.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4J-9(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Defendants\u2019 purported need to excise 12,000 lawful noncitizens from NJ FamilyCare\u2019s protection is based \u2014 aside from the litigation-induced immigration policy argument \u2014 on fiscal concerns. \u201cAlthough preservation of fiscal integrity is a valid state interest, a State may not accomplish that goal by establishing \u2018invidious\u2019 distinctions between citizens.\u201d <em>Sanchez v.

Moreover, the durational residence requirements at work in this appeal bear no connection with any of our Legislature\u2019s purposes or goals to foster fiscal stability in a difficult economic climate.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>From a state constitutional standpoint, defendants\u2019 response to the open-ended invitation of the 2010 and 2011 Appropriations Acts to pare spending, and their faithfulness to the commands of the 2012 and 2013 Appropriations Acts to actively discriminate against short-term noncitizens, does not comport with our state\u2019s \u201ccentral guarantee\u201d of \u201c[e]quality of treatment.\u201d <em>Lewis, supra, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>at 456, 908 A.2d 196. However laudable the overall goal of ensuring the health of the state\u2019s finances, it does not trump the health care needs of lawful noncitizens who are powerless\u2014 meaning without the right to vote \u2014 to participate in the political process. Such invidious discrimination against a discrete and insular minority is repugnant to our State Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Equal treatment requires at the very least that government be as fair to all poor noncitizens as it is to all poor citizens in the provision of affordable health care opportunities. Both groups contribute to the taxes that pay for NJ FamilyCare and the record does not establish a principled distinction between the two groups to justify the five-year waiting period visited upon greenhorn aliens. The State offered no evidence that newcomer-noncitizens abuse health care benefits or disproportionately use its largess as a rationale to target the individuals who have been disadvantaged solely on the basis of an arbitrary time-dependent criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u201cThe history of the United States is in part made of the stories, talents, and lasting contributions of those who crossed oceans and deserts to come here.\u201d <em>Arizona, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 132 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2510, 183 L.Ed.2d at 379. Defendants\u2019 Medicaid Communication 10-01 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:78\u20143.2(b)(1) deny a range of public benefits to lawful permanent resident aliens, while maintaining such benefits for similarly positioned citizens. Both federal and state equal protection jurisprudence counsel against such disparate treatment, and I would declare defendants\u2019 measures unconstitutional.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> In light of the Legislature's specific adoption of alienage-based durational restrictions in L. 2011, c. 85 at 111 (the 2012 Appropriations Act) and L. 2012, c. 18 at 99 (the 2013 Appropriations Act), plaintiffs have abandoned their non-constitutional challenges.

In each instance, the Supreme Court began its discussion by reasserting its allegiance to the holding in <em>Graham: </em>laws that single out aliens for disparate treatment are presumptively unconstitutional absent a showing that the classification was \"necessary\u201d to fulfill a constitutionally \"permissible\" and \u201csubstantial\u201d purpose. <em>In re Griffiths, supra, </em>413 <em>U.S. </em>at 721-22, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2854-55, 37 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 915.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\"> I recognize that <em>Finch I </em>was not decided under the lens of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
