Plaintiffs, as aggrieved consumers of new automobiles, successfully pursued relief and were granted repurchase of their vehicles through the manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute settlement mechanism, established pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty \u2014 Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (Magnuson-Moss Act), 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2301 to 2312. We are asked to determine whether plaintiffs retain the right to file a separate action for payment of attorney\u2019s fees under the Magnuson-Moss Act or the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Warranty Act (Lemon Law), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-29 to -49, notwithstanding the informal dispute settlement mechanism expressly excluded attorney fee awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Plaintiffs Gene Fedor and Jingesh Ghandi appeal from the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant Nissan of North America, Inc., dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaints. On appeal, plaintiffs raise this issue of first impression, arguing the judge erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>because attorney\u2019s fees must be paid to a successful consumer as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">On January 10, 2009, Fedor purchased a new 2009 Nissan Quest from Windsor Nissan for $30,289.00. The vehicle was manufactured, distributed, and warranted by defendant. The warranty required dissatisfied consumers to file claims with BBB Auto Line, \u201ca special automotive complaint resolution program ... independently operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc. (BBB).\u201d As described in the warranty booklet,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">BBB AUTO LINE is an informal dispute settlement mechanism operated to comply with applicable Federal law and regulations. In states where BBB AUTO LINE is available, you are required to use BBB AUTO LINE before exercising rights or seeking remedies under [the Magnuson-Moss Act], If you choose to seek remedies other than those created by [the Magnuson-Moss Act], (for example, under state law), that Federal Act does not require you to first use BBB AUTO LINE. The program is still available to you, however, and may be of considerable assistance. Some states specify that informal dispute settlement mechanisms such as BBB AUTO LINE must be used before you may use state-operated complaint resolution processes, before you may file a lawsuit under state law, and/or before you may have certain other rights or remedies available under state law. In accordance with those states\u2019 laws, Nissan requires the prior use of BBB AUTO LINE in good faith before you resort to such other processes, file a lawsuit, or seek other remedies provided by state law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The 2009 New Vehicle Limited Warranty, located in the warranty booklet, contained almost identical language, and also stated: \u201cNissan makes available to you, and you are specifically required by Federal Law to use BBB AUTO LINE ... before exercising rights or seeking remedies under the [Magnuson-Moss Act].\u201d The warranty also makes clear that state law may not require consumers to first use Auto Line before pursuing state-created remedies. However, the warranty advised, \u201cif you seek remedies created by state law, including your state\u2019s lemon law, if applicable state law provides for using a 703 compl[ai]nt or similar process before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>filing suit[,]\u201d then you must \u201cfirst use BBB AUTO LINE in good faith!.]\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Auto Line has its own set of rules and procedures, which are available on its website. The website explains Auto Line\u2019s \u201crole ... is to open communication between you and the manufacturer representative and to facilitate the speedy resolution of your auto warranty or lemon law dispute.\u201d BBB Auto Line\u2019s Process, Better Business Bureau, http://www.bbb.org/us/auto-line-lemon-laws/process-information (last visited July 25, 2013). A consumer pays nothing to participate in the Auto Line program, which consists of mediation and arbitration. First, in mediation, Auto Line attempts to assist the consumer in resolving the claimed vehicle problems. Second, if mediation is unsuccessful, the consumer has the opportunity to present the claims to an impartial arbitrator or three-person panel. In its review of a dispute, Auto Line incorporates the manufacturer\u2019s Program Summary, which delineates those claims eligible and ineligible for arbitration, as well as the available remedies. Neither the consumer nor Nissan is legally bound by the arbitrator\u2019s written decision unless accepted by the consumer.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">In this matter, defendant\u2019s informal dispute resolution Program Summary states the arbitrator may award all available state lemon law remedies in the arbitration of a warranty claim seeking relief under a state\u2019s lemon law, \u201cexcluding attorney\u2019s fees, any penalties or multiple damages.\u201d A separate section of the manufacturer\u2019s program description, entitled \u201cCLAIMS THAT WILL NOT BE ARBITRATED!,]\u201d states \u201c[c]laims seeking punitive damages or compensation for legal fees, loss of wages, personal injury or mental anguish\u201d are not subject to Auto Line arbitration. The Program Summary further describes available relief and includes a detailed statement of each alternative remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>As a result of various, recurring problems encountered with his vehicle, all of which remained unresolved despite multiple warranty repair attempts, Fedor filed a three-count Law Division complaint against defendant on June 15, 2011. Fedor alleged violations of the Lemon Law, the Magnuson-Moss Act, and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). Following discovery, defendant moved to dismiss the Magnuson-Moss Act count based on Fedor\u2019s failure to utilize defendant\u2019s informal dispute settlement procedure through Auto Line, as required by the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Fedor objected, asserting the Auto Line program mandated by defendant\u2019s warranty did not comply with state and federal law because it failed to include an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful consumer. He maintained the court should deny defendant\u2019s motion. Alternatively, plaintiff suggested the Magnuson-Moss Act count of his complaint could be dismissed without prejudice, pending remand to defendant\u2019s informal dispute settlement procedure via Auto Line and, if plaintiff prevailed in that proceeding, the issue of counsel fees would be preserved for future review by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Defendant\u2019s motion was supported by the certification of Valerie Smith, an Arbitration Specialist I employed by defendant. Addressing prior matters filed with Auto Line in New Jersey over the previous twelve months, Smith averred: \u201cIn every claim where a prevailing consumer was represented by counsel, resolution of the claim included a payment of attorney\u2019s fees by Nissan.\u201d Further, in its supporting brief, defendant insisted it in fact has paid and will continue to pay attorney\u2019s fees to successful plaintiffs utilizing the BBB Auto Line program. Prior to the court\u2019s ruling, the parties agreed to proceed before Auto Line and defendant withdrew its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Fedor\u2019s warranty claims were submitted to Auto Line and arbitration was conducted on December 21, 2011. The arbitrator concluded Fedor was entitled to a repurchase of his vehicle. Fedor executed the \u201cAcceptance or Rejection of decision\u201d form, accepting the arbitrator\u2019s decision awarding a repurchase by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>checking the provision of the agreement that states: \u201cI ACCEPT THE ARBITRATION DECISION. I understand this means ... I ... will be legally bound, which means I give up any right to sue the business in court on any claim that has been resolved at the arbitration hearing, ... unless otherwise provided by state or federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Notwithstanding his acceptance of the arbitration decision and its accompanying terms, Fedor insisted he remained statutorily entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. First he requested a fee-shifting hearing through defendant\u2019s Auto Line program, but defendant declined to participate. Next, he sought judicial redress under his previously-filed complaint and the matter proceeded through non-binding, court-ordered arbitration, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:21A-1. The arbitrator ruled in favor of defendant, finding fees were neither authorized under the informal dispute resolution program nor mandated as a matter of law. Fedor filed a demand for trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Defendant moved for summary judgment, which was met by Fedor\u2019s cross-motion for statutory fees and costs pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12 \u2014 36(d)(4) and 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d)(2). Following oral argument, the judge granted defendant\u2019s motion and denied Fedor\u2019s cross-motion. Fedor\u2019s subsequent request for reconsideration was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The facts surrounding Ghandi\u2019s appeal are similar to those described with respect to Fedor\u2019s action. Ghandi purchased a new 2011 Infiniti EX-35 from Salerno Duane Infiniti for $35,550.00. The vehicle was manufactured, distributed, and warranted by defendant. The warranty was identical to the warranty discussed above, including the provisions directing consumers to file claims with Auto Line. After he encountered various and recurring problems, which were not effectively repaired by defendant\u2019s authorized dealer, Ghandi filed a three-count Law Division complaint, raising the same causes of action asserted by Fedor.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Arbitration was conducted by Auto Line, and the arbitrator concluded Ghandi was entitled to a repurchase of his vehicle. Ghandi executed an acceptance of the arbitrator\u2019s award, acknowledging he would be \u201clegally bound, [thereby] giv[ing] up any right to sue the business in court on any claim that has been resolved at the arbitration hearing, ... unless otherwise provided by state or federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Thereafter, Ghandi requested a fee-shifting hearing before the Auto Line arbitrator, which was declined. The matter returned to the Law Division and proceeded to non-binding court-ordered arbitration, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:21A-1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unlike Fedor\u2019s ease, the arbitrator ruled in favor of Ghandi, awarding fees. Defendant timely demanded a trial de novo, and subsequently moved for summary judgment. Ghandi opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for statutory fees and costs pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36(d)(4) and 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d)(2). A different Law Division judge considered the arguments, granting defendant\u2019s motion and denying Ghandi\u2019s cross-motion. Ghandi\u2019s timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Although Fedor\u2019s and Ghandi\u2019s actions are separate, they raise the same legal issues for our consideration. For ease in our discussion, we will refer to Fedor and Ghandi collectively as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment. Plaintiffs contend the court \u201cundervalu[ed] strong policy interests served by fee-shifting at informal dispute settlement procedures,\u201d and incorrectly allowed defendant\u2019s \u201cwarranty dispute settlement procedure [to be] exempt from the requirements of [the Lemon Law.]\u201d Further, plaintiffs argue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>court erred in concluding there was no state cause of action allowing fee-shifting \u201cfor consumers [who] prevailed at an informal dispute settlement procedure under [the Magnuson-Moss Act.]\u201d Plaintiffs seek reversal of the summary judgment dismissals of their complaints and an order reinstating their claims for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the motion judge. <em>EMC Mortg.

The statute imposes \u201c[f]ederal minimum standards!]]\u201d listing specific obligations applicable to all product warranties. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2304(a). <em>See also Poli v. Daimler-Chrysler Corp., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>169, 180, 793 A.2d 104 (App.Div.2002). For example, suppliers who choose to issue an optional written warranty must provide the promised repairs within a reasonable time and without charge, replace the car, or provide a refund. 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2304(a)(1), (4). Further, the Magnuson-Moss Act requires manufacturers warranting a product to \u201cfully and conspicuously disclose\u201d the terms of coverage \u201cin simple and readily understood language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2302(a). <em>See also Ryan, supra, </em>186 <em>N.J. </em>at 433-34, 896 A.2d 454. The statute also provides a cause of action and legal remedy for consumers harmed by a warrantor\u2019s failure to comply with its warranty obligations. 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d). <em>See also Poli, supra, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 180-81, 793 A.2d 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">In addition to its goal of elucidating consumer product warranties, Congress also set out to advance its avowed \u201cpolicy to encourage warrantors to establish procedures whereby consumer disputes [could be] fairly and expeditiously settled through informal dispute settlement mechanisms.\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(a)(1). To accomplish the objective of making available an effective, quick remedy at little or no cost to the consumer, Congress directed the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to \u201cprescribe rules setting forth minimum requirements for any informal dispute settlement procedure which is incorporated into the terms of a written warranty to which any provision of this chapter applies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2310(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The Magnuson-Moss Act apparently was not successful in resolving consumer disputes regarding chronically defective auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>mobiles. Consequently, many states enacted legislation to address perceived problems. New Jersey\u2019s Lemon Law establishes the rights and duties of manufacturers, dealers, and consumers regarding the repair and return of defective motor vehicles. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-29 to -49. The Lemon Law is designed to ease consumer efforts to obtain rectification of now automobile defects, as \u201cthe purchase of a new motor vehicle is a major, high cost consumer transaction and the inability to correct defects in these vehicles creates a major hardship and an unacceptable economic burden on the consumer.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-29. The law\u2019s threefold purpose is to: (1) \u201crequire the manufacturer of a new motor vehicle ... to correct defects originally covered under warranty which-are identified and reported within a specified period\u201d; (2) \u201cprovide procedures to expeditiously resolve disputes between a consumer and a manufacturer ... when defects in a new motor vehicle are not corrected within a reasonable time\u201d; and (3) \u201cprovide to award specific remedies where the uncorrected defect substantially impairs the use, value, or safety of the new motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">To effectuate these objectives, the statute imposes an affirmative obligation upon the vehicle manufacturer to repair substantial defects within a reasonable time. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-31. <em>See also DiVigenze v. Chrysler Corp., </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 323, 785 A.2d 37 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>442, 794 A.2d 181 (2002). \u201cIf the manufacturer is unable to repair the vehicle within the statutory timeframe, the consumer is entitled to a full refund of the purchase price of the vehicle in addition to \u2018any other charges or fees\u2019 associated with the ownership of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Thiedemann v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>234, 254, 872 A.2d 783 (2005) (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-32). The manufacturer may offer to replace the vehicle in lieu of a refund, but the consumer is free to reject such offer and demand a refund. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-32a. The vast majority of Lemon Law litigation relates to alleged non-compliance with these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>To assert a claim under the Lemon Law, a plaintiff must report the claimed motor vehicle nonconformity to the manufacturer or its dealer within the earlier of the first 24,000 miles of operation or two years following the date of delivery of the vehicle. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-31. If \u201cthe manufacturer ... or its dealer or distributor [ ] is unable to repair or correct the nonconformity within a reasonable time,\u201d a plaintiff is entitled to return the vehicle to the manufacturer and receive \u201ca full refund of the purchase price,\u201d along with any other charges or fees associated with the vehicle\u2019s ownership, \u201cless a reasonable allowance for vehicle use.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-32a.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Poli supra, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 173-74, 793 A.2d 104. A consumer meets this burden \u201cby producing evidence that the nonconformity \u2018continues to exist\u2019 after the specified number of repairs or time out of service.\u201d <em>DiVigenze, supra, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324, 785 A.2d 37 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-33a, -33b). <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-33a(1) (presuming the manufacturer \u201cis unable to repair or correct a nonconformity within a reasonable time if, within the first 24,000 miles of operation or during the period of two years following the date of original delivery ...

Further, we consider the statutory provisions regarding an award of counsel fees to a successful claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">As we noted, under the Magnuson-Moss Act, Congress expressly \u201cdeclare[d] it to be its policy to encourage warrantors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>establish procedures whereby consumer disputes are fairly and expeditiously settled through informal dispute settlement mechanisms.\u201d 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(a)(1). The procedures for participation in an informal dispute settlement mechanism must be set forth in the written consumer warranty and comply with requirements promulgated by the FTC. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2310(a)(2).

The three forums are: (1) a summary dispute resolution procedure established within the Division of Consumer Affairs (Division), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-37, in what is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>known as the Lemon Law Unit, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:45A-26.4; (2) a Superior Court action, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-39; and (3) a manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute resolution procedure, if one is established, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36. <em>DiVigenze, supra, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 324, 785 A.2d 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The Lemon Law specifically references the informal dispute settlement procedures offered by the manufacturers pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>56:12-36. The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">a. If a manufacturer ... has established, or participates in, an informal dispute settlement procedure pursuant to [15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310] and the rules promulgated thereunder, <em>or the requirements of this section, </em>a consumer may submit a dispute regarding motor vehicle nonconformities ... to the dispute settlement body provided by that procedure, but a consumer shall not be required to first participate in the informal dispute settlement procedure before participating in the [T)]ivi,sion\u2019s summary hearing procedure under this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">b.

Further, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-37 grants a consumer the option of submitting any dispute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Division for resolution in the first instance. Again, the consumer cannot be required to first participate in the Division\u2019s summary administrative proceeding; however, if a consumer chooses this course of redress, it is binding, subject only to the right of appeal. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-39. A consumer \u201cshall be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees\u201d under the Lemon Law if he or she is successful in an action brought in the Superior Court or a summary proceeding before the Division. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Having outlined the parameters of the available statutory relief, we now turn to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments advanced on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">Plaintiffs argue the use of a manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute resolution mechanism cannot prevent or preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees, a remedy allowed under both the Magnuson-Moss Act and the Lemon Law. They maintain the Law Division ignored \u201cstrong policy interests served by fee-shifting[.]\u201d Further, they argue use of the Auto Line informal dispute settlement mechanism does not obviate application of 15 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2310(d)(2), which, according to plaintiffs, \u201cprovides a separate state court cause of action for fee-shifting\u201d and may not preclude an award of attorney\u2019s fees. More specifically, plaintiffs contend \u201cany informal dispute settlement procedure which alleges compliance with the [Magnuson-Moss] Act must include fee[-]shifting,\u201d and plaintiffs\u2019 rights should not be lessened because they accepted relief in an arbitral forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Following our review, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that a warrantor\u2019s informal dispute resolution mechanism adopted under the Magnuson-Moss Act, such as Auto Line, is required to include a fee-shifting component for successful consumers. We conclude the statute and regulations promulgated thereunder provide otherwise. Further, we discern no support for the suggestion that attorney\u2019s fees may be recovered under the Lemon Law by a consumer who elects to accept relief awarded through a manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>turer\u2019s informal dispute resolution mechanism created pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act and <em>Rule </em>703.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Plaintiffs attempt to find support for their argument that fees must be awarded by relying on the parenthetical provision of 16 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 703.5(d)(1), which states: \u201cA decision shall include any remedies appropriate under the circumstances, including repair, replacement, refund, reimbursement for expenses, compensation for damages, and any other remedies available under the written warranty or the Act (or rules thereunder); and a decision shall state a specified reasonable time for performance[.]\u201d However, the argument ignores that defendant\u2019s warranty and its informal dispute resolution mechanism excluded attorney fee awards, a circumstance authorized by the Magnuson-Moss Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">This straightforward interpretation is consistent with the FTC\u2019s own interpretation, which it discussed in an October 2005 letter containing an informal advisory opinion regarding the BBB Auto Line program. <em>See Unpublished Informal Advisory Opinion of Federal Trade Commission Staff re: Informal Dispute Settlement Procedure in 16 C.F.R. 703, </em>Letter from FTC Acting Associate Director (October 25, 2005). The FTC was requested to provide an advisory opinion interpreting 16 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 703.5(d)(1),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">to address an argument frequently asserted by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers seeking to circumvent the AUTO LINE program and instead immediately file a warranty suit in court. According to this argument, the AUTO LINE program does not comply with <em>[Rule </em>703] because the program is not empowered to award all remedies that might be awarded in a lawsuit for breach of warranty [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">\n<em>[FTC Staff Advisory Opinion,, supra.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">One of these omitted remedies is an award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">The FTC concluded \u201cRule 703 does not require that all remedies that a court might award a plaintiff who prevails in a warranty lawsuit must be within the power of an [informal dispute settlement mechanism] decision maker.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The FTC emphasized an informal dispute settlement mechanism, \u201coperating as a prerequisite to (but not a substitute for) legal action!,]\u201d does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>need to award attorney\u2019s fees to be fully compliant with the Magnuson-Moss Act and <em>Rule </em>703, as the objective is informal settlement of the dispute. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201c \u2018Congress envisioned [the informal dispute settlement mechanisms] as a warrantor\u2019s opportunity to cure a possible breach of warranty' \u201d and avoid litigation. <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>Informal Dispute Settlement Mechanisms, </em>40 <em>Fed. Reg. </em>60190 (proposed Dec. 31, 1975) (to be codified at 16 <em>C.F.R. </em>pt. 703)). Accordingly, the FTC concluded the Magnuson-Moss Act \u201cdoes [n]ot [contemplate the [a]ward of [attorneys\u2019 [flees or [c]osts\u201d by informal dispute settlement mechanisms; such remedies are only available to consumers who prevail in an action before the court. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We give substantial deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it is charged with carrying out, as well as to the interpretation the agency itself gives to its own regulations. <em>DiVigenze, supra, </em>345 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 330, 785 A.2d 37 (citations omitted). <em>See also N.J. Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 575, 384 A.2d 795 (1978) (\u201cIt is a fundamental maxim that the opinion as to the construction of a regulatory statute of the expert administrative agency charged with the enforcement of that statute is entitled to great weight and is a substantial factor to be considered in construing the statute.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Moreover, an agency\u2019s opinion letter \u201chas been accorded the status of an official administrative interpretation for purposes of judicial deference thereto.\u201d <em>Long, supra, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 384 A.2d 795 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 policy arguments \u2014 maintaining that to allow informal dispute resolution mechanisms to deny attorney fee awards to prevailing parties does and will continue to cause consumers to reject these forums in favor of judicial redress \u2014 ignores the benefits provided by alternative dispute resolution forums, including: there are no filing fees or costs for the consumer to initiate use of the mechanism, 16 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 703.3(a); legal representation is not required and the proceedings are tailored to self-represented consumers; an independent expert inspects the vehicle and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>records of complaints, at no cost to the consumer; decisions are swiftly made, unburdened by the formality of court process, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 703.5(d); and the result is non-binding, thus ensuring a dissatisfied consumer retains the ability to initiate full judicial review, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 703.5(g)(1), (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Examining the BBB Auto Line program\u2019s website, we note the motto epitomizing these attributes, stated in bold letters, \u201cFast. Free. Fair.\u201d BBB Auto Line, Better Business Bureau, http://www. bbb.org/us/auto-line-lemon-law (last visited July 25, 2013). The terms of participation in the Auto Line program are clearly expressed and emphasize the objective of facilitating communication between consumers and warrantors to assure compliance with warranty provisions. It is undisputed that this forum excludes other claims possibly held by the consumer, including a demand for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">In this light, we conclude Congress established procedures for and encouraged the creation of informal dispute resolution mechanisms by warrantors to give consumers quick, yet effective, relief, without requiring these mechanisms to mimic legal redress. The absence of an attorney fee award neither violates the statute and its regulations nor offends public policy. Use of informal dispute resolution mechanisms was a compromise between consumers and warrantors. As noted, use of Auto Line was required prior to filing suit under the Magnusson-Moss Act, but was not a prerequisite to an action under the Lemon Law. Plaintiffs elected to use the warranty-provided informal dispute resolution program conducted by Auto Line, knowing it expressly stated attorney\u2019s fees are not awarded. Plaintiffs also accepted the Auto Line award granting repurchase of the defective vehicles, knowing that by doing so they agreed to forego the opportunity to file suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Here, plaintiffs were free to reject the Auto Line award and proceed with a private right of action for breach of warranty in the hope of obtaining additional relief, including attorney\u2019s fees. However, by electing to accept the informal dispute settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>determination of repurchase, they have waived all further remedies under the Magnuson-Moss Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Plaintiffs also argue the Lemon Law \u201cimposes a nonwaivable fee[-]shifting requirement on informal dispute settlement procedures.\u201d Citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36a and -36d(4), plaintiffs reason the Lemon Law incorporates the informal dispute settlement procedures of the Magnuson-Moss Act as minimum standards and requires fee-shifting. We reject this argument, as it too ignores the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36a addresses a manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute settlement procedure established pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act and <em>Rule </em>703, and does not preclude a consumer\u2019s participation in such a program. Subsection b alternatively addresses informal dispute settlement programs \u201cestablished pursuant to this section\u201d of the Lemon Law. This makes clear the two are not one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Following the well-settled rules of statutory construction, we examine \u201cthe plain language of the statute, which is typically the best indicator of intent,\u201d and give the words used \u201ctheir ordinary, generally accepted meaning.\u201d <em>In re Plan for the Abolition of the Council on Affordable Hous., </em>214 <em>N.J. </em>444, 467, 70 A.3d 559, 2013 <em>WL </em>3717751 (2013) (citations omitted). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>1:1-1. We note the specific use of two distinct provisions to discuss informal dispute resolution programs, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36a and - 36b, reflects the Legislature\u2019s recognition of two separate informal dispute settlement forums: those established pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act, and those designed to comply with the Lemon Law. The conclusion is further reinforced by the language of other sections of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36d includes qualifying language describing \u201cany informal dispute settlement procedure <em>established pursuant to this section\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Subsection e imposes record retention requirements on all manufacturers who establish an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>informal dispute resolution procedure, \u201cwhether it meets the requirements of this section or not[.j\u201d The inescapable conclusion from these references is the Lemon Law calls for an informal dispute settlement procedure that may be separate and distinct from those established pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">If an informal dispute resolution program is established by a manufacturer under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36 of the Lemon Law, the settlement body must consider an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful consumer. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12 \u2014 36d(4). However, the Lemon Law does not impose a universal requirement for a fee award in any other informal dispute resolution programs, including those established under the Magnuson-Moss Act. Rather, the only relief to which all successful consumers are entitled, mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36c where the consumer is found to be entitled to relief under the Lemon Law, is \u201ca refund as authorized by section 4 <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-32] of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Here, BBB Auto Line was not created under the Lemon Law. Rather, it was established pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act. The use of its own internal rules and procedures, including those regarding the exclusion of certain claims, is acceptable and fully compliant with <em>Rule </em>703.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Plaintiffs contend if the Lemon Law provides for attorney\u2019s fees in some circumstances, such as administrative proceedings before the Division, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-42, Superior Court actions, <em>ibid., </em>and informal dispute settlement procedures established under the Lemon Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:12-36d, then attorney\u2019s fees must be available under all circumstances, including resolution by an informal dispute settlement mechanism established pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act. Plaintiffs assert the manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute resolution mechanism \u201cmust still comply with and offer remedies afforded by the host state\u2019s lemon laws.\u201d We reject this proposition as unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Plaintiffs do not offer and we are unaware of any authority suggesting New Jersey\u2019s Lemon Law, as a matter of public policy, intended to allow an award of attorney\u2019s fees to all consumers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>utilizing any manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute settlement procedure, even one established pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act. This assertion lacks statutory, regulatory, judicial, and legislative history support.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">We further note, New Jersey\u2019s Lemon Law does not impose upon all manufacturers who offer an informal dispute resolution mechanism a requirement to comply with the State\u2019s Lemon Law. <em>Contra, </em>1986 <em>N.Y. Laws, </em>ch. 799 (amending various subsections of New York\u2019s lemon law, GBL \u00a7 198-a, particularly subsection (g), to provide if a manufacturer adopts an informal dispute resolution mechanism, it must, at a minimum, comply with the New York state lemon law, as well as FTC regulations). While a state is free to implement a lemon law requiring all informal dispute settlement procedures, including those established pursuant to the Magnuson-Moss Act, to comply with additional requirements imposed by state law, such as fee-shifting, New Jersey\u2019s Legislature has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We make this final observation. The Magnuson-Moss Act and the Lemon Law are aimed at addressing the types of manufacturing defects experienced by plaintiffs. The procedures are well-explained in the statutes and regulations. In this matter, additional, very clear instructions governing the BBB Auto Line program were provided. Plaintiffs were aware Auto Line would not address attorney\u2019s fees (unless otherwise agreed between the manufacturer and the consumer) and they did not reach an agreement with defendant as to any provision for fee payment. The Auto Line award was rendered, addressing plaintiffs\u2019 grievances, and in both cases requiring repurchase of the defective vehicles. Plaintiffs accepted the award, knowing it was final and did not provide for an award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We reject plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that failure to award fees in every instance will encourage and increase litigation. The Lemon Law defines the remedies available to consumers proceeding under the various forums available for purposes of seeking redress. Each has its own respective benefits and burdens. Cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>tainly the statute, like its federal counterpart, presents mechanisms for negotiation and conciliation between consumers and manufacturers. The FTC\u2019s 2005 opinion letter described the <em>Rule </em>703 procedures, stating they essentially \u201cincluded a \u2018stick\u2019 \u2014 a newly available [consumer private right of action] with attorneys\u2019 fees' \u2014 and a \u2018carrot\u2019 \u2014 a last chance opportunity to cure a warranty breach before being subjected to such damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>FTC Staff Advisory Opinion, supra. </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 route to resolve their issues relating to vehicle defects was expeditious and with little cost. Their execution of the acceptance of the awards demonstrates their choice of and satisfaction with the forum. Even though plaintiffs were not bound to accept the informal dispute settlement decision, neither rejected the award of repurchase in favor of initiating legal action in the hope of also collecting attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">We may not ignore the careful language of the Legislature and Congress in crafting the informal dispute resolution mechanism provisions under the Lemon Law and Magnuson-Moss Act, respectively. In the absence of statutory authorization, general policy arguments advanced by consumers in favor of fee-shifting may not be a basis for this court\u2019s ruling. These arguments need be directed to the Legislature. <em>See Murray v.
