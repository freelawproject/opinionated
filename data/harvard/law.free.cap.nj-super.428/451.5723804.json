Defendant L.J.D. (whom we refer to as \u201cLela\u201d) was fourteen when her son, A.T.D. (whom we refer to as \u201cAlvin\u201d) was born. At that time, Lela herself was a child, who was placed in the custody and care of plaintiff, the Division of Youth and Family Services, now known as the Division of Child Protection and Permanency (the Division).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of Lela\u2019s custodial status, the Division assumed custody of Alvin at birth. After extending services to Lela over the ensuing years, the Division concluded she was not able to provide safe and stable care for Alvin. Consequently, the Division filed a complaint seeking guardianship and the termination of parental rights for the purpose of consenting to Alvin\u2019s adoption. Lela appeals from the judgment entered on June 27, 2011,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>the trial judge\u2019s findings underpinning his conclusion to terminate her parental rights. She principally argues she never harmed Alvin and the Division failed to make reasonable efforts to provide her available services, which would have helped correct circumstances that led to Alvin\u2019s placement with a resource family.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">After reviewing the record and applicable law in light of the arguments advanced on appeal, we uphold the trial court\u2019s findings that clear and convincing credible evidence satisfied the four statutory prongs necessary for termination of a parent\u2019s rights. Accordingly, the award of guardianship predicated on those findings is legally sound and must be affirmed. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. A.R.G., </em>361 <em>N.J.Super. </em>46, 78, 824 A.2d 213 (App.Div.2003), <em>aff'd in part, modified in part, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>264, 845 A.2d 106 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">The unique nature of the circumstances presented requires a comprehensive recitation of the facts leading to the Division\u2019s filing for guardianship, which are not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">In May 2008, Lela was placed in the care and custody of the Division following allegations of \u201cneglect, sexual abuse, [and] physical abuse,\u201d perpetrated by her psychiatrically impaired mother and her mother\u2019s paramour. The Division had intervened the prior year and extended counseling to Lela. A June 11, 2007 psychiatric evaluation, performed by Alexander Iofin, M.D., noted Lela admitted she had \u201ca history of fire setting,\u201d \u201csuicidal ideation,\u201d marijuana use, occasional underage drinking, juvenile delinquent conduct, and uncontrolled anger. Lela also confirmed she suffered flashbacks of being raped and \u201csome type of auditory, as well as visual hallucinations[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Lela was sexually active and the Division learned she was pregnant. The Division continued Lela\u2019s individual counseling and added prenatal support and parenting skills instruction. The Division also took steps to secure custody of Lela\u2019s baby. When Alvin was born, the Division imposed a hold preventing Alvin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>discharge from the hospital and sought a court order for his placement. On May 13, 2008, a Family Part judge found Lela could not \u201cindependently provide for herself or her son as she d[id] not have financial stability, housing, or medical insurance\u201d and temporarily awarded the Division custody, care and supervision of Alvin. Lela lived with her adult sister and Alvin was placed in a foster home pending the Division\u2019s identification of a joint placement for Lela and Alvin. In preparation for this placement, Lela and Alvin enjoyed weekly visitation and later were permitted to spend weekends together in the home of and supervised by Lela\u2019s sister.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In July 2008, Lela and Alvin were placed in the Union Industrial Home Family Partners \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program (UIH), a residential home for teen mothers and their babies. Lela had completed a psychological evaluation and was directed to engage in individual counseling. The weekend visits supervised by Lela\u2019s sister continued with the added assistance of a home health care aid to instruct Lela on the safe and necessary care of her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">On October 1, 2008, UIH terminated Lela\u2019s program participation as a result of her \u201cdefiant, non-compliant behavior and her willingness to leave the program^]\u201d While some of the identified issues were likely the result of Lela\u2019s inexperience and uncertainty in mothering (e.g., a difficulty in administering medication), other conduct, such as \u201c[rjefusing to listen to staffs direetions[,]\u201d \u201ccrank[ing] up her radio to drown [out]\u201d staff instructions, \u201cverbally threatening] both staff and residents,\u201d \u201cverbally and physically aggressive [conduct toward] peers and staff[,]\u201d and \u201c[r]efusing to follow house rules[,]\u201d resulted because of Lela\u2019s unwillingness to comply with the program\u2019s requirements. UIH\u2019s program director recommended Lela needed \u201cintensive counseling\u201d and \u201canger management\u201d and concluded she was not \u201ccapable of caring for her son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Lela returned to live with her sister. Alvin was placed with a resource family, who currently provides his care. The resource <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>family has expressed its interest in pursuing adoption, if permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The Division referred Lela to additional programs to teach her the necessities of parenting. Instruction by Babyland Family Services, Inc. and development of a comprehensive care plan by Innovative Specialists Inspirational Services, L.L.C. (ISIS) set specific skill goals for Lela through in-home therapy and group anger management counseling. Lela completed Babyland\u2019s parenting program and was cooperative with the ISIS social worker. The Division\u2019s reunification efforts continued, as it coordinated in-home therapy, visitation, life skills instruction, and intensive one-on-one parenting classes for Lela.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">On May 9, 2009, Lela\u2019s sister called the Division, requesting Lela\u2019s removal from her residence. An argument had erupted between the siblings, during which Lela punched, hit, and scratched her sister, then grabbed a pair of scissors and threatened to kill her. Lela\u2019s sister called the police and the Division when Lela refused to drop the scissors. Her sister also reported Lela was \u201cskipping school\u201d and neglecting to take prescribed medication for bi-polar disorder. The Division discovered Lela had missed many days of school; some were to attend court hearings, but others were unexplained. On May 14, 2009, she was suspended for two days and missed the entire week after being removed from her sister\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Lela was placed in the Newark YMWCA shelter program and directed to undergo anger management and individual therapy. Before month\u2019s end, Lela engaged in a physical altercation with another YMWCA resident and was asked to leave. The Division placed Lela in a foster home and scheduled another psychological evaluation, this time with Dr. Leslie A. Trott, Ed.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Dr. Trott noted Lela was \u201cquite psychologically distressed\u201d and difficult to manage during the assessment. She appeared confrontational, \u201cunruly, loud[,] and belligerent.\u201d She appeared \u201cagitated and impulsive!,]\u201d exhibited \u201cviolent, aggressive reactions,\u201d was \u201cstruggling and in need of help.\u201d Lela also reported experiencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>hallucinations, including visions of her dead grandmother and told Dr. Trott she sees spirits. Dr. Trott diagnosed Lela as suffering from mental illness, but she refused to take medication. Based upon his evaluation, Dr. Trott concluded Lela had \u201cgood cognitive potential\u201d but struggled \u201cto reason right from wrong and lack[ed] the potential to cognitively compose appropriate solutions to child management challenges. Her psychological distress deteriorates her common sense, causes poor judgment and diminishes her potential to parent.\u201d He concluded \u201c[s]he should not be visiting her infant without close supervision\u201d and suggested she \u201clive in a residence for teens where psychiatric services are available\u201d and \u201cbe evaluated by a psychiatrist for medications to intervene with her hallucinations and impulsive, confrontational tendencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">On June 7, 2009, the Division received a report from Mary M. Gibbons, L.S.W., Lela\u2019s in-home therapist. Gibbons advised Lela\u2019s attendance had been \u201csporadic[,]\u201d and she had \u201cnot made progress on the goals stipulated by the court-speeifically the anger management issues and addressing the emotional issues related to her abusive past.\u201d Gibbons related a recent illustrative incident. Lela requested Gibbons give her \u201can honest answer\u201d regarding what she was doing that jeopardized her reunification with Alvin. When Gibbons proceeded to do so, Lela \u201cbecame very angry and told [Gibbons] to leave.\u201d Despite a brief delay, Lela would not calm down and repeated her demand for Gibbons to leave. Gibbons opined Lela\u2019s \u201ccurrent level of in-home services [wa]s not sufficient^]\u201d and \u201cperhaps a more intensive day treatment program where [Lela] might receive psychiatric treatment as well as potential group and/or individual therapy would more adequately and appropriately assist her[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Other information weighed against reunification of mother and son. A June 2009 visitation report from Children\u2019s Aid and Family Services, Inc. (CAFS), the agency supervising Lela\u2019s visits with Alvin and responsible for providing \u201chands-on parenting skills training[,]\u201d stated Lela was making little progress as a mother, and \u201clack[ed] the maturity and insight to care for and parent [her] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>child.\u201d On July 9, 2009, Lela\u2019s resource mother telephoned the Division at 10:55 p.m. stating she had contacted the police because Lela left for summer school at 7:00 a.m. and had not returned, despite her 8:30 p.m. curfew. Lela arrived home shortly after midnight. The resource mother also revealed Lela had been \u201crunning away on and off\u201d and was \u201cvery abrupt and nasty\u201d with her. Based on additional reports, the Division believed Lela also had someone pretend to work for the Division, and call the resource mother to advise Lela had permission to spend time with her sister whenever she wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">By September 2, 2009, the court accepted the Division\u2019s proposed change in the permanency goal for Alvin: the Division intended to seek guardianship and termination of parental rights followed by Alvin\u2019s adoption. The family court judge found Lela had \u201cnot complied with ... services[,]\u201d had \u201cunresolved anger issues!,J\u201d \u201cdisrupted [the] mommy and me placement, and then her relative home placement!,]\u201d and lacked \u201cmaturity, stable housing or income to care for her child.\u201d Lela was again scheduled for individual counseling and anger management services.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The Division investigated alternative relative placements for Alvin. His paternal grandmother and Lela\u2019s cousin were ruled out. Lela\u2019s sister did not respond to the Division\u2019s repeated inquiries, and she too was ruled out when the Division learned she was homeless. Further, the Division also worked with Alvin\u2019s father, who initially expressed interest in parenting his son, but he failed to follow through and engage necessary services and visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Lela was re-evaluated by Dr. Iofin on September 6, 2009. When asked, she denied experiencing hallucinations, adamantly insisting she suffered no psychiatric symptoms and claimed she had been \u201cplaying\u201d with Dr. Trott. Dr. Iofin rejected this explanation as \u201chighly, highly improbable,\u201d stating Lela\u2019s response needed \u201cto be approached as a response [of a] \u2018street smart\u2019 person, [who knows] such disclosures will [not] be in her best interest.\u201d Dr. Iofin diagnosed Lela with impulse control disorder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>intermittent explosive disorder, opposition-defiant disorder, psychotic disorder, anxiety disorder, personality disorder, and narcissistic personality traits. He opined she was not \u201ca reasonable candidate for reunification with her ehild[,]\u201d and recommended her visits with Alvin be supervised by the Division \u201cin a professional setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Although she missed her first appointment, beginning on September 9, 2009, Lela attended individual therapy focused on anger management conducted by Claire M. Forte-MeRobbie, L.S.W. of Family Connections. Over the following five weeks, she attended all sessions; \u201cpresent[ed] as cooperative, open, and pleasant\u201d; \u201cengaged actively in discussions of her problem[s]\u201d; \u201cactively participated in the formulation of her treatment plan\u201d; demonstrated \u201cgood progress\u201d in therapy; and \u201cappear[ed] dedicated to being reunited with her son.\u201d By year\u2019s end, Lela missed a few sessions because of transportation problems, otherwise she demonstrated \u201csome progress\u201d in managing her anger, but continued to have \u201cdifficulty with impulse control under other circumstances, particularly in the school environment.\u201d Forte-McRobbie recommended individual therapy continue.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Lela attended individual therapy offered by Independence: A Family of Services, Inc. (IFS), which was also involved in her education. Joyce Lopez, L.C.S.W., the high school counselor, informed the Division Lela had twenty-five sessions focused on her anger and sadness given the removal of her son. Lela\u2019s motivation was to demonstrate a willingness to comply with the Division\u2019s requests and engage in a therapeutic process in anticipation of eventually reuniting with Alvin. Lopez recounted Lela\u2019s school improvement, as she exhibited no behavioral problems, had not been sent to detention, achieved perfect attendance that fall, and recently received an honor for attaining an \u201cA\u201d in her subjects. Lela also completed parenting skills courses and earned the relevant certificates. Lopez wrote Lela \u201cshould be commended for her determination to get her son back and for her acknowledgment that she would need help in raising him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>On January 6, 2010, the Division filed a complaint seeking guardianship of Alvin. The protective services matter was voluntarily dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">At the Division\u2019s request, Rachael Ann Fite, Ph.D., performed a thorough psychological evaluation on March 8, 2010. Dr. Fite was able to eliminate the possibility of psychosis or a concern posed by past fire-starting conduct, stating it did not \u201cappear to be currently of concern.\u201d She credited Lela\u2019s avoidance of substance abuse and acknowledged her commitment and success in school. Dr. Fite also noted Lela\u2019s improved behavior management, stating \u201c[ although not completely remediated, she has been able to substantially curb a long-term pattern of violent outbursts and physical assault of others.\u201d Dr. Fite identified Lela\u2019s modified behaviors, commitment to therapy, consistent visitation attendance, expressed love for her son, and sincere desire to be Alvin\u2019s caregiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">However, Dr. Fite\u2019s assessment report identified several deficiencies impeding Lela\u2019s independent parenting of Alvin. Lela\u2019s statements regarding parenting were general and abstract, void of a realistic understanding of parental responsibilities. Further, when directed to discuss specific problem areas that could affect the child\u2019s safety, Lela became defensive and often minimized her responsibility, suggesting someone else was at fault. Dr. Fite noted Lela had been able to develop \u201ca far more appropriate interaction style\u201d but \u201c[djespite her obvious efforts to manage her own behavior, ... she continues to find herself sporadically having made a significant mistake in judgment and behavior and had continued to destabilize herself in this matter.\u201d Based on her review of the visitation reports, Dr. Fite noted Lela had been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">unable to engage her son adequately to allow for visits to occur without strain and discomfort on the part of the child. It is of particular concern that the visitation supervisor reported that [Alvin] consistently runs from the room at the first suggestion that the visit is over. Additionally concerning is the continued need to discuss with [Lela] that she allow the two[-]year old to be the priority instead of herself during the visit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Evaluating the testing, the clinical interview, review of prior evaluations and assessments, and information obtained from collateral communications, Dr. Fite opined Lela \u201chas not yet managed to achieve adequate stability or parenting skills to warrant a reasonable expectation that she could safely and appropriately care for her son ..., now or in the near future.\u201d Dr. Fite recommended the Division \u201cconsider terminating her parental rights ... releasing [Alvin] for adoption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Lela continued therapy with Forte-McRobbie, missing only three of twenty-six sessions over six months. Lela \u201cresponded positively to the anger management and counseling treatment\u201d showing a \u201cstrong commitment to self-improvement[,]\u201d and her \u201cjudgment, insight, and impulse control all appeared] to have shown improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Recent reports by CAFS informed the Division Lela remained consistent with her visitation participation and deeply loved her son. She had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">continually shown obvious love and concern for her son. She showers him with affection, makes sure he is safe .... and is attentive in caring for his needs throughout the visit____She often speaks of her plans for him once she can take him home. She tries to teach him things and seems to enjoy spending time with him. She has purchased several items including shoes and clothes and took pleasure and pride in presenting them to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">However, she continued to exhibit deficits in parenting when the child was fussy or upset. Lela acted immaturely \u201cwith respect to being a self-less parent[,]\u201d holding expectations of Alvin to entertain her and give her affection and attention that were beyond his developmental ability. Further, she could not consistently separate her own needs from his. Moreover, she was idealistic and failed to recognize \u201cthe reality of parenting despite [the] worker\u2019s attempts to educate her.\u201d .The worker noted Lela</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2-\">might be able to provide adequate basic care to her son. However, the unease comes fi-om [Lelaj\u2019s lack of understanding and knowledge of a child\u2019s physical, emotional, cognitive, and social development. Although she has taken parenting classes, this worker feels that her age and maturity level make it difficult for her to absorb much of the information. There is also concern that with the stressors inherent in everyday life and lack of familial support, [Lela] would be overwhelmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>and frustrated easily, making it extremely difficult to respond appropriately when parenting her child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">These same issues surfaced in the final evaluations procured by the Division. On October 20, 2010, Mark Singer, Ed.D., was engaged to perform an evaluation of Lela\u2019s \u201cparenting ability, mental status, and treatment needs.\u201d Also, he performed a bonding evaluation of Lela and Alvin and a bonding evaluation between Alvin and his resource parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Dr. Singer concluded Alvin had formed multiple attachments viewing \u201chis caregivers and his mother as being significant parental figures in his life. The child appears, at least on an intellectual level, to recognize that he has 2, \u2018mommies,\u2019 and a \u2018daddy.\u2019\u201d Difficulties were observed in Lela\u2019s ability to provide structure for the child; she seemed unable to grasp his developmental abilities, for example, when he resisted her directions regarding play and affection. Dr. Singer found Alvin \u201cmay have, to some degree, distanced himself from his mother\u201d as a result of being separated from her. Dr. Singer concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">While there are clearly concerns regarding fLelafs ability to provide an appropriate environment for her child, and while the data does clearly indicate that, within a reasonable degree of psychological certainty, [Lela] lacks the skills and resources needed to care for any child independently at this point in time, the data does also suggest that, with appropriate continued intervention, [Lela] may become a viable parenting option for her son in the foreseeable future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Dr. Singer specifically recommended Lela be placed in a highly structured \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program, to which Alvin would be transitioned with Lela under supervised care. Dr. Singer cautioned that another removal after reuniting -with Lela would increase the risk Alvin would suffer \u201cenduring harm[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Overall, Dr. Singer determined Alvin would likely have a greater reaction to losing his foster parents than his mother. Further, he advised \u201c[s]hould there be any evidence to suggest that she cannot, or will not comply, termination of parental rights may be the only alternative available to provide [Alvin] with the permanency and consistency that the child needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Dr. Singer\u2019s recommendations prompted a third evaluation by Dr. Iofin, who was asked to offer an opinion on whether Lela could \u201cbe considered as a minimally adequate parent for [Alvin].\u201d He noted she had shown \u201csignificant improvement in her overall funetioningt,]\u201d including academic improvement, decrease in physical altercations, and absence of cognitive impairment. He cautioned that there were significant \u201cvery valid concerns about her abilities to be in a situation where she will be able to provide minimally adequate care of the child in question[.]\u201d Dr. Iofin found it significant that Lela\u2019s counselor, who has had approximately forty sessions with her, continued to note \u201congoing, very concerning, and problematic behavior[.]\u201d He cited, for example, \u201c \u2018the student routinely teases and harasses other students, creating unstable and strained relationships around herselff,]\u2019 \u201d which he found confirmed the finding she was \u201cinsensitive to the needs of others.\u201d The counselor\u2019s report also contradicted Lela\u2019s assertion she has learned to control herself as shown by the negative interactions she continued to have with her family members. Dr. Iofin also was concerned by Lela\u2019s letter writing to \u201can incarcerated older man\u201d and that school representatives caught her with an \u201cinappropriate sexualized picture of herself in electronic media format.\u201d These reflect immaturity as she suffers \u201csetbacks and loses ground frequently after having gained it[.]\u201d In summary, Dr. Iofin stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">[T]here is significant amount of different difficulties in different domains that will impair [Lela\u2019s] abilities to be a minimally adequate parent for the child in question, but as of purely psychiatric aspects of this case, I do not see direct contraindications for her to have interaction with the child in a structural program, which could be a Mommy and Me program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">This recommendation was tempered, stating \u201c[t]hese specific issues need to be addressed by a clinical psychologist who at the present time does not consider her as a viable candidate to be considered for this specific predicament, and considers termination of parental rights as the most appropriate avenue to use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The contradiction in Lela\u2019s conduct continued to be evident. For example, although Lela\u2019s resource parent described her as \u201ca pleasure to have in her home[,]\u201d she repeatedly disregarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>her curfew by staying out all night, thereby jeopardizing her placement. Although the resource mother and Division workers \u201caddressed the behavior and explained the severity of the consequences,\u201d Lela persisted. Her grades for the most recent marking period were reported as \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d because she \u201cfailed the majority of her classes.\u201d The Division arranged for Lela to attend additional training at the Family Life Education Center (FLEC). During a case management hearing, the Division agreed to consider the appropriateness of reunification and investigate the availability of a possible \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program, but declined to change its permanency plan that included termination of parental rights. Alvin\u2019s Law Guardian advocated for a permanent placement and requested the guardianship litigation proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Five days later, Lela was discharged from her therapeutic foster placement because she ran away and was missing for several days. It was learned she returned to her cousin\u2019s home, even though the Division had rejected the residence as a placement resource. Lela\u2019s conduct prompted the Division\u2019s request to have the matter listed for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Visits between Lela and Alvin continued to be held at a nearby shopping mall. Lela\u2019s in-home therapy ceased but she continued counseling with Family Connections. She later left her cousin\u2019s home, deciding instead to live with her mother, a move not approved by the Division. Lela revealed she was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Before trial, Dr. Singer again assessed Lela. He identified her \u201cdesire to care for her son,\u201d but concluded \u201cthe currently obtained data does not suggest that [she wa]s capable of parenting independently. To [Lela\u2019s] credit, she appears to be aware that she would require significant structure and support in order to care for her child. At the same time, the data does not suggest that [she] is likely to be able to persist in such an environment.\u201d He found \u201cthe data suggested that [Lela] is likely to continue to have difficulty creating stability in her own life, never mind the life of a child.\u201d Dr. Singer concluded, \u201cconsidering the totality of the data, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>including the length of time [Lela] has had to make improvements in her life that may have led to reunification, ... [she was] not likely to become a viable independent parenting option for [Alvin] in the foreseeable future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">The Law Guardian requested an updated psychological evaluation of Lela and separate bonding evaluations performed by Denise Williams Johnson, Ph.D. Lela was seventeen and informed Dr. Johnson she was two months pregnant. Lela related she and the baby\u2019s father had discussed \u201cplanning a future together\u201d and had been involved in attending prenatal visits. Dr. Johnson\u2019s psychological assessment highlighted Lela\u2019s underestimation of difficulties and overestimation of her ability. She noted Lela\u2019s failure to conform and strictly comply with boundaries, despite being aware of requirements, and disregarding the impact of noncompliance for Alvin. Dr. Johnson observed Lela \u201cappeared to focus on her own then immediate comfort, rather than focus on what she could have done differently, or focus on the implications of her choices for her role as \u2018mother\u2019 to [Alvin].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">With respect to the bonding evaluation, Dr. Johnson identified \u201cmany positive aspects\u201d to Lela\u2019s current bond with Alvin, despite her overall style with the child, which was characterized as \u201cconfrontation[al].\u201d Dr. Johnson determined Alvin\u2019s bond with Lela was \u201cinsecure\u201d and he had a \u201cconsistently strong and loving bond with both foster parents.\u201d She concluded \u201cit would not be in [AlvinJ\u2019s best interest to be placed with [Lela] at this time, or in the foreseeable future----[H]e has waited long enough for permanency with [Lela], Accordingly, adoption by [the resource parents] is recommended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The one-day trial was held on June 27, 2011, when Lela was almost eighteen years old. One hundred exhibits were introduced by the Division, without objection from any party. The documentation included the Division\u2019s ease file, past evaluation reports and testing as discussed above, and excerpts from Dr. Johnson\u2019s reports which were later introduced by the Law Guardian. Further, the Division presented testimony from its case worker, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Damion Johnson, who had worked with Lela and Alvin since February 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Johnson characterized Lela\u2019s progress as consistently \u201ctaking one step forward and two steps back,\u201d precluding possible reunification. He noted it \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem like she really thinks or considers what [Alvin] really feels at this point, what he\u2019s most comfortable with, and really take[s] into consideration ... the possibility of ... how it would effect [sic] him or impact him if he were removed[.]\u201d The Division sought to achieve permanency for Alvin through his adoption by his resource parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Johnson was specifically questioned regarding why Lela was not granted a second chance in a \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d placement. He discussed his efforts to contact numerous facilities, searching for one which would accept Lela first and then transition Alvin, but all of the programs required the mother and child to enter simultaneously with a stated goal of reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The Division also presented the testimony of its expert, Dr. Singer. Dr. Singer stated his findings from Lela\u2019s psychological assessments and the bonding evaluations. He concluded Lela\u2019s behavior, despite opportunities, had not improved in the area of stability, concluding she \u201ctends to leave when things just don\u2019t go her way or she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable\u201d despite the availability of other choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">He noted Lela was \u201ca significant figure\u201d in Alvin\u2019s life and some signs of a healthy bonded relationship existed, but there were no hugs and the child rebuffed Lela\u2019s effort to kiss him. If the court ordered termination, Dr. Singer opined Alvin \u201cwould likely have a reaction to losing [his] relationship\u201d with Lela, which would be mitigated by his resource parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Dr. Singer also reported Alvin was more securely bonded to his resource parents and he would \u201clikely have a significant reaction to losing his foster parents!,]\u201d who he clearly recognizes as his \u201cpsychological parents.\u201d The impact would \u201clikely be long[-]term\u201d and Lela \u201cwould likely have difficulty mustering the emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>resources needed to tend to [Alvin]\u2019s needs[.]\u201d Further complicating the picture was Lela\u2019s need to direct physical and emotional resources to her newborn.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Lela testified on her behalf. She explained she was about to graduate from high school and had secured summer employment. She revealed she had been accepted into a \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d placement in a Tri-Cities home in anticipation of her baby\u2019s birth. Lela asserted Alvin could also be placed in the program. She related her desire to reunite with Alvin and recognized his need for continued contact with his resource parents. She then discussed a second program she located in Willingboro,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which she found more desirable. Lela suggested she could stay in North Jersey or relocate with Alvin to South Jersey. In the fall, she would start classes to obtain a nurse\u2019s aid certificate. She believed she could locate a comparable program in South Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Addressing her failed therapeutic foster placement, Lela maintained she felt uncomfortable in the home because her foster mother made it clear she preferred younger children and was inconsistent in setting curfews. Lela advised the foster mother would frequently tell her to leave, so she did after making plans to live with her cousin. Lela stated she called her Division caseworker, LaShaun Daniels, to report the problem she was experiencing in the placement and also told Daniels she was moving.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Dr. Johnson was last to testify as the Law Guardian\u2019s expert. She detailed her findings and conclusions following the psychological assessments of Lela and the bonding evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Following summations, the trial judge issued an oral opinion. Finding Alvin was removed from his mother\u2019s custody because Lela was not ready to care for a child when Alvin was born and her environment was not safe, the trial judge also found Lela had not achieved circumstances that were \u201cstable enough for her own sake, let alone for a three[-]year[-]old and now a baby on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>way[,]\u201d determining Lela still needed to develop \u201ca level of maturity to get herself stable.\u201d He noted Lela had made some \u201cquestionable decisions\u201d that disrupted her placements without consulting with the Division. The trial judge also found Alvin needed stability and Lela\u2019s choices \u201cparticularly [in] the last three or four months\u201d reflected instability. The trial judge stated, \u201c[a]long [the] way she\u2019s going to have another child coming in, and whether or not she\u2019s going to manage that is going to be a big issue. But to place [Alvin] on top of that situation ... it\u2019s just never going to work.\u201d The judge found Lela reasonably compliant with services, emphasizing she tried but remained unsuccessful. The Division had \u201cdone everything they possibly could in providing services!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Finally, he determined Alvin was \u201cin need of permanency\u201d and further delay was not in his best interests. Crediting the experts\u2019 testimony, he concluded because of Alvin\u2019s secure bond with his resource parents, his removal would \u201ccreate severe emotional damage that I don\u2019t think [Lela] is in any way capable of mitigating in her current state of stability!,]\u201d yet the resource parents were in a position to mitigate any harm caused by severing Alvin\u2019s ties with his mother, although the resource parents may continue her relationship with Alvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Concluding the Division met each prong of the statutory test by clear and convincing evidence, the trial judge ordered Lela\u2019s parental rights terminated and placed Alvin in the Division\u2019s custody to secure his adoption. Lela appeals from the final judgment entered on June 27, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">Before addressing the issues presented by Lela, we outline the well-established guidelines governing our review.

She maintains she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>never endangered Alvin and no enduring harm exists. Further, her efforts toward improving her circumstances reflect her willingness and ability to eliminate any perceived harm. She also disputes the finding that the Division fulfilled its obligation to provide services, citing its refusal to secure a second \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d placement. Finally she rejects the proposition that severing her parental rights would not cause Alvin more harm than good. We examine each of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Under the first prong of the best interests standard, the Division must prove by clear and convincing evidence that \u201c[t]he child\u2019s safety, health or development has been or will continue to be endangered by the parental relationship[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a(l). \u201cThe harm shown ... must be one that threatens the child\u2019s health and will likely have continuing deleterious effects on the child.\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 352, 736 A.2d 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In this matter, it is undisputed that Alvin was removed from Lela\u2019s custody at birth solely because she was a minor in the Division\u2019s custody and he too needed the Division\u2019s protection. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.8a. Without question, Lela did not affirmatively cause harm to her son resulting in his removal. However, the \u201cabsence of physical abuse or neglect is not conclusive[,]\u201d AW., <em>supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 512 A.2d 438, as \u201cthe psychological aspect of parenthood is more important in terms of the development of the child and [his] mental and emotional health than the coincidence of biological or natural parenthood.\u201d <em>Sees v. Baber, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>201, 222, 377 A.2d 628 (1977) (citations omitted). \u201cSerious and lasting emotional or psychological harm to children as the result of the action or inaction of their biological parents can constitute injury sufficient to authorize the termination of parental rights.\u201d <em>In re Guardianship of K.L.F., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>32, 44, 608 A.2d 1327 (1992) (citing <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 18, 608 A.2d 1312). Consequently, trial courts must consider the potential psychological <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>damage that may result from reunification as the \u201cpotential return of a child to a parent may be so injurious that it would bar such an alternative.\u201d <em>A.W., supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 512 A.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The trauma fourteen-year-old Lela suffered at the hands of her parents was discovered at the time she bore Alvin. The psychological and psychiatric assessments from 2007 and 2008 vividly depict a young teen who understandably displayed sexualized behaviors, aggressive confrontational lashing out, immaturity, and impulsivity. She needed to unwind her own emotional needs, including the conflict regarding her mother who failed to protect her from harm, as well as struggle to discern appropriate societal behaviors in the absence of role models and family support. Clearly, structure and selflessness\u2014key concepts in childrearing\u2014were foreign. The Division devised a course to address the multitude of needs presented by Alvin and Lela.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Lela does not disagree that she was not ready to care for Alvin when he was born. Rather she maintains the Division failed to show Alvin was harmed in her care and her youth cannot adequately justify the presence of harm. We agree a parent\u2019s age alone will not define whether she can provide adequate parenting or the capacity to avoid physical or emotional harm to her child. In this matter, Lela\u2019s impulsivity, rebellion, and poor judgment compromised Alvin\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Lela\u2019s impulsive, aggressive behaviors continued almost unabated for more than a year following Alvin\u2019s birth. Her confrontational defiance precluded her success in the \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program; prevented her sister from continuing as a resource in rearing Alvin; and terminated her placement at the YMWCA and a therapeutic foster home. Lela disregarded her obligation to attend school, assaulted those with whom she disagreed, disobeyed her resource parents, disregarded curfews, ran away, and battled against the structure of school. To her credit, Lela did not turn to substance abuse and other illegal conduct, continued counseling and began to accept its benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>We reject the notion that the Division merely removed Alvin because Lela was young when she gave birth. From Alvin\u2019s birth until the Division filed for guardianship, Lela was not able or willing to comport her behavior to focus on her son\u2019s needs. Our review of the record leaves little doubt Alvin was removed because his safety would have been compromised if placed in Lela\u2019s care. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15(c) (requiring proof of the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child, not necessarily the presence of parental fault).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Another important factor necessitating Alvin\u2019s removal was Lela\u2019s displayed symptoms of mental illness from 2007 to 2009. Lela\u2019s mother suffered from paranoid schizophrenia. When examined by Dr. Iofin on June 11, 2007, Lela reported signs of psychiatric problems such that Dr. Iofin found Lela \u201cpresented with a significant' amount of different psychiatric symptoms!,] which include[ed] her acknowledgment of visual and tactile hallucinations ..., a presence of flashbacks pointing towards Post Traumatic Stress problems, and having problems with Impulse Control.\u201d Hallucination experiences were repeated to Dr. Trott during his June 1, 2009 evaluation. Medication was prescribed for what was believed to be psychosis, which Lela did not take.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">By September 6, 2009, Lela disavowed the information she had previously imparted to evaluating mental health professionals and suggested she was just \u201cplaying\u201d with them. This statement speaks volumes: either Lela began withholding information she perceived would \u201churt her chances\u201d or she did not seriously appreciate the importance of the evaluations by professionals when considering her ability to parent her infant son. In either case, Alvin was at risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Despite Lela\u2019s lack of culpability for Alvin\u2019s initial removal, the ensuing years reflected minimal change in her ability to resolve the identified safety concerns or to achieve necessary competency in parenting. The Division is not required to wait until a child actually suffers an injury to substantiate harm justifying his removal from parental custody, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a(l). <em>See also </em>A.W., <em>supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 616 n. 14, 512 A.2d 438 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>(stating \u201cit would make no sense to wait until [the child] had been injured\u201d to effectuate removal). We determine the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the Division\u2019s satisfaction of this factor is clearly and convincingly supported by the evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The second factor of the best interests standard focuses on parental unfitness and overlaps with the proofs supporting the first prong. <em>D.M.H., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 379, 736 A.2d 1261. The court considers not only \u201cwhether the parent is fit, but also whether he or she can become fit within time to assume the parental role necessary to meet the child\u2019s needs.\u201d <em>R.L., supra, </em>388 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 87, 906 A.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Under the second prong, the standard is whether it is \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d that a parent can \u201ccease to inflict harm upon\u201d the child and demonstrate adequate parenting that would not place the child\u2019s physical or mental health in \u201csubstantial jeopardy[.]\u201d A.W., <em>supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 607, 512 A.2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">To satisfy its burden, the Division must show harm to the child \u201ccontinue[s] because the parent is unable or unwilling to overcome or remove [it].\u201d <em>N.J.

Lela repeatedly expressed love for her son and began to back up her words with her conduct in an effort to achieve reunification. She refocused on school achievements, regularly attended therapy, rarely missed visitations, and completed additional parenting skills. Dr. Fite was able to eliminate psychosis or mental illness as a barrier to reunification and found Lela was learning to control her actions and develop insight regarding how her behaviors affected others.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">We do not minimize these strides. Lela rose above the victimization she suffered and assumed some direction for her life. In fact, the years of effort she has expended will provide a solid foundation for parenting. However, our focus must be on Alvin. The emphasis of the Federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-89, 111 Stat. 2115 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 42 <em>U.S.C.), </em>has. shifted from protracted efforts for reunification with a birth parent to an expeditious, permanent placement to promote the child\u2019s well-being. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:40-15. <em>See also C.S., supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 842 A.2d 215. \u201cKeeping the child in limbo, hoping for some long term unification plan, would be a misapplication of the law.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. </em>A.G., 344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 438, 782 A.2d 458 (App.Div.2001). When viewing the facts through the prism of Alvin\u2019s needs, as the law requires, the uncontroverted record reflects Lela could not grasp the nature and necessity of prioritizing Alvin\u2019s needs above her own and never achieved an appreciation for the young child\u2019s need for stability. Accordingly, Alvin remains at risk if placed in her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>During trial, Dr. Singer related his findings following his May 2, 2011 evaluation, keying on Lela\u2019s inability to provide stability and consistency in her life and for Alvin. For example, during a period when the Division was considering whether to again place Lela and Alvin in a \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program, Lela disappeared from her therapeutic foster home in favor of living with her cousin, despite being told her cousin\u2019s criminal history precluded her as an acceptable placement. Lela knew Alvin could not be accommodated in her cousin\u2019s home, but went there anyway. Then, after a disagreement with her cousin, Lela moved to her mother\u2019s home, again disregarding the Division\u2019s instructions that this was inappropriate for Alvin. Dr. Singer labeled these impulsive, poorly planned moves as \u201ca step backwards\u201d and asserted Lela\u2019s instability persists as she continues to make poor choices that adversely impact her parenting ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Dr. Singer stated Lela\u2019s instability precluded her from providing a stable home for Alvin, which was unlikely to change because her prognosis for compliance with necessary structure was poor. Acknowledging \u201cthe best predictor of the future is the past ... behavior[,]\u201d Dr. Singer opined Lela was \u201cnot likely to remedy these issues in the foreseeable future in terms [of] or with respect to [Alvin].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Dr. Singer also discussed the additional impact of Lela\u2019s current pregnancy, noting</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">now we\u2019re not concerned solely about [Lelal\u2019s ability to integrate [Alvin] back into her family just as a mother and child, but we have to be concerned with integratfing] [Alvin] into a family where there\u2019d be a newborn.... Certainly[,] it increases [Lela]\u2019s load in terms of the need to muster the emotional resources as well as the physical resources, not just to tend to the needs of a three year old child but, certainly, to tend to the needs of a newborn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">He concluded Lela \u201clacked ... both the physical and emotional resources needed to parent [Alvin]\u201d and could not afford him adequate parenting and protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Dr. Johnson concurred with Dr. Singer, testifying Lela\u2019s \u201ccommunity instability, her ability to stay in one place and her ability to follow the rules where she was\u201d thwarted reunification. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>months after Lela left her therapeutic foster home, she had not reestablished herself. Dr. Johnson also stated Lela took no \u201cblame\u201d for leaving that placement, suggesting she will make the same error again. Finally, she admitted she made the move without considering its potential impact on Alvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Lela\u2019s stated desire is to raise her son, a laudable and well-meaning objective. However, this ideal is jolted by the reality the child needs stability and permanency, concepts that continue to elude Lela. <em>See In re Adoption of a Child by P.S. &amp; J.S., </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 120, 716 A.2d 1171 (App.Div.1998) (\u201cA child\u2019s need for stability, for consistency, and for permanence cannot be ignored in reaching [ ] the most challenging decision any court can face.\u201d). The experts unequivocally agree Lela had not yet achieved stability for herself, making it impossible for her to provide the same for Alvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Lela\u2019s own testimony highlighted this difficulty. She suggested she was accepted in a Tri-Cities North Jersey \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program, stated she was to attend college in North Jersey, and also was accepted in a nursing certificate program. She then explained she located a different \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program in South Jersey, which she believed was more desirable for her needs and figured she would move to Willingboro, then find a new educational program in South Jersey, following her move. Lela never suggested she visited the Willingboro facility, or even spent time in Burlington County. Certainly, she has no prior connection to, or family living in, that locale, raising the uncertainty of her satisfaction with such a dramatic change. Her plans omitted mention of her baby\u2019s father, with whom, she told Dr. Johnson, she was discussing a future. More interestingly, Lela did not discuss how she intended to maintain Alvin\u2019s connection to his resource parents if she moved to Willingboro. Lela\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d is a mere possibility; it appears impulsive based on Lela\u2019s unspecific desires and not well thought out.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">At trial, Lela agreed she could not independently care for her son and needed the structure and housing of another \u201cMommy &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Me\u201d placement and the financial support of the State. The problem remained whether she could accept the structure and abide the rigidity of such a program. To date, Lela has not demonstrated the internal discipline to comply when confronted with restriction of her perceived freedoms and choices. Following Dr. Singer\u2019s maxim \u201cthe best predictor of the future is the past,\u201d the evidence clearly and convincingly supports Lela\u2019s inability to adequately parent Alvin. Lela offered no countervailing evidence to support her general assertion that this time will be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">We are satisfied the record supports the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the Division has satisfied the second prong by clear and convincing evidence. The chaos of Lela\u2019s life has lessened but has not ended, with likely more uncertainty when her baby arrives. Despite the three years that have passed and the myriad of efforts extended, Lela\u2019s life remains unstable and she continues to be unable to provide Alvin a safe and stable home. <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 357, 736 A.2d 1246. Further, delay in satisfying Alvin\u2019s need for a permanent placement will add to his harm. <em>M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 914 A.2d 1265. \u201cA child is not chattel in which a parent has an untempered property right\u201d and should not \u201cbe held prisoner of the rights of others, even those of his or her parents.\u201d <em>C.S., supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 110\u2014 11, 842 A.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Finally, we reject Lela\u2019s contention the trial court\u2019s determination was an erroneous value judgment on the quality of her parenting versus that of the foster parents. <em>See J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 21, 608 A.2d 1312. The Division\u2019s evidence exposed the risks of harm if Alvin were placed in his mother\u2019s care, whether in a \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program or not. Under these circumstances, continued reunification efforts were not justified. <em>C.S., supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 842 A.2d 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The third prong of the best interests standard requires the Division to make \u201creasonable efforts to provide services to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>help the parent correct the circumstances\u201d that necessitated removal and placement of the child in foster case. <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4C-15.1a(3). \u201cReasonable efforts\u201d consist of services \u201cto assist the parents in remedying the circumstances and conditions that led to the placement of the child and in reinforcing the family structure!;.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4C-15.1c.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The reasonableness of the efforts depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. <em>D.M.H., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 390, 736 A.2d 1261. Provision of services under the third prong \u201ccontemplates efforts that focus on reunification[,]\u201d <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 354, 736 A.2d 1246, and \u201cmay include consultation with the parent, developing a plan for reunification, providing services essential to the realization of the reunification plan, informing the family of the child\u2019s progress, and facilitating visitation.\u201d <em>M.M., supra, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>at 281, 914 A.2d 1265. The services provided to meet the child\u2019s need for permanency and the parent\u2019s right to reunification must be \u201c \u2018coordinated\u2019 \u201d and must have a \u201c \u2018realistic potential\u2019 \u201d to succeed. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. J.Y., </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>245, 267 n. 10, 800 A.2d 132 (App.Div.2002) (quoting <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:133-1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Yet, the reasonableness of the Division\u2019s efforts \u201cis not measured by their success[,]\u201d although a court considers whether a parent actively participated in the reunification effort. <em>D.M.H., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 393, 736 A.2d 1261. Ultimately, \u201c[t]he failure or lack of success of [the Division\u2019s] efforts does not foreclose a finding that the Division met its statutory burden to try to reunify the children with the family.\u201d <em>F.H., supra, </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 620, 914 A.2d 318 (citing <em>D.M.H., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 393, 736 A.2d 1261). Moreover, \u201c[e]ven if the Division ha[s] been deficient in the services offered to\u201d a parent, reversal of the termination order is not necessarily \u201cwarranted, because the best interests of the child controls\u201d the ultimate determination regarding termination of parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at 621, 914 A.2d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The court must also weigh available \u201calternatives to termination of parental rights!.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>30:4C-15.1a(3). This includes rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tive placements for the child that would obviate the need for termination of parental rights and adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">We first address an additional wrinkle posed by the matter, inasmuch as Lela was a child in the Division\u2019s custody when Alvin was born. When the Division assumes custody, care and supervision to assure a child\u2019s interests are protected to \u201cavoid an ongoing risk to the child\u2019s life, safety, or health,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.31b, it assumes responsibility to reunite the family if the child can be safely returned home. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.51. The question raised is whether Lela\u2019s custodial status requires the Division to continue its reunification efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In making the required fact-sensitive review of whether the services extended were reasonable, we believe the Division\u2019s burden, in this exceptional instance, is a heightened one, dictated by the special circumstance posed by a child-parent\u2019s young age. We conclude the Division\u2019s efforts must include satisfactory services to aid the development of the child-parent\u2019s maturation and necessary skills to adequately parent his or her child. The balancing test considers, on the one hand, the child-parent\u2019s abilities, motivations, capabilities and other familial resources to reach this goal and, on the other hand, the infant\u2019s need for achieving stability and permanency within a reasonable time period. As applied, there is no checklist or prescribed length of time the Division must continue its efforts, as that remains fact-sensitive. We do note these circumstances raise the likely need to extend services and efforts beyond the twelve-month timeframe mandated by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-61.2a(2) and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.54(b), which require a trial court to conduct a permanency hearing for a child removed from the care of his or her parent or guardian to \u201cdetermine whether the family will continue towards reunification or whether an alternative plan must be adopted.\u201d <em>Div. of Youth &amp; Family Services v. G.M., </em>198 <em>N.J. </em>382, 400, 968 A.2d 698 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">In Lela\u2019s case, the horrific circumstances she experienced required removal from her parent\u2019s care. The day following the Family Part\u2019s order for her protection, Alvin was born. Once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>reunification of Lela and her mother was not an option, the Division\u2019s efforts justifiably concentrated on teaching this very young teen to parent her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The one-hundred exhibits introduced by the Division at trial are replete with services extended, spanning from May 2007 through May 2011, in an effort to reunite Lela and Alvin. These services addressed medical, logistical, educational, housing, psychological, psychiatric, and financial needs along with the provision of years of visitation, one year of parenting classes, life skills, years of anger management, individual therapy, and other counseling. The Division continued its efforts to educate Lela on the obligations of care involved in being a mother, not mere rote tasks of diapering and feeding. Even in light of setbacks, services continued, aimed at Lela\u2019s individual healing as well as nurturing her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Following our review of the evidence, we determine the Division has met the heightened burden resulting from Lela\u2019s custodial status, the extent and nature of which accorded with her youth, and attempted to achieve reunification. We find no flaw in the trial judge\u2019s determination the Division extended reasonable efforts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Lela maintains she fully complied with all services extended and challenges the failure of the Division to provide what she believes is the one service that would have assured reunification: another chance at a \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program. She attacks the reasonableness of Division efforts, especially in light of the \u201cineffective and desultory\u201d attempt to locate a \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program in 2010. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Caseworker Johnson explained his efforts to secure such a placement were hindered by two facts. Fii\u2019st, funding requires Lela and Alvin must enter the program simultaneously; however, based upon expert recommendations, Alvin needed to \u201cbe transitioned\u201d after Lela demonstrated an ability to comply with the program\u2019s structure. Second, the case plan goal required modification to reunification. While the Division weighed its need to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>modify its case goal, Lela left her placement to live with her cousin.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In the three years prior to trial, Lela unquestionably matured. Yet, contrary to her suggestion, she had not fully complied with the Division\u2019s services. Most notably, she continued to disrupt her placements in favor of relationship decisions found detrimental to Alvin\u2019s interests. In this significant regard, Lela has not achieved the level of stability and security necessary to care for a young child. She argues her conduct was reasonable in light of the Division\u2019s failure to find a new placement fast enough. Such a suggestion deflects her responsibility for her conduct and disregards the fact her choices remained motivated by fulfilling her interests, desires, and needs, without regard to the resultant impact on Alvin.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">The Division\u2019s decision to pursue termination of parental rights rather than continue to hope Lela would modify her conduct was reasonably focused on Alvin\u2019s paramount need for safety, security, and permanency. Considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude the Division\u2019s efforts to achieve reunification were reasonable. Moreover, it was not unreasonable to decline modification of Alvin\u2019s permanency plan to allow Lela another attempt in a \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program, in light of evidence the effort would not have a \u2018\u201crealistic potential\u2019\u201d to succeed. <em>J.Y., supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 267 n. 10, 800 A.2d 132 (quoting <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:133-1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Under the last prong of the best interests standard, the Division must prove the child will not suffer greater harm from the termination of ties with his biological parent than from the permanent disruption of his relationship with his resource family. <em>K.H.O., supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 736 A.2d 1246. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a(2) (citing evidence that separating the child from his resource family would cause serious harm). The overriding consideration under this prong remains the child\u2019s need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>permanency and stability. <em>Id. </em>at 357, 736 A.2d 1246. If a child can be returned to the parental home without endangering his health and safety, the parent\u2019s right to reunification takes precedence over the permanency plan. A.W., <em>supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 607-09, 512 A.2d 438. On the other hand, \u201ctermination of parental rights likely will not do more harm than good\u201d where the child has bonded with the resource parents in a nurturing and safe home. <em>E.P., supra, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>at 108, 952 A.2d 436. The Division\u2019s clear and convincing evidence \u201cmust show \u2018that separating the child from his or her foster parents would cause serious and enduring emotional or psychological harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312). In meeting its burden under this prong, the Division should adduce testimony from a \u201cwell qualified expert who has had full opportunity to make a comprehensive, objective, and informed evaluation\u201d of the child\u2019s relationship with the natural and resource parents. <em>J.C., supra, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 19, 608 A.2d 1312.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Lela agrees Alvin\u2019s bond with his resource parents was stronger than his bond to her. However, she argues the trial judge erroneously disregarded the fact she too was strongly bonded to Alvin and expert recommendations provided for reunification. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">All prior expert evaluations counseled against allowing Lela to independently parent her son. Dr. Trott\u2019s June 1, 2009 report stated, Lela \u201cshould not be visiting her infant without close supervision.\u201d Dr. Iofin\u2019s September 6, 2009 report stated, \u201cI [would] not consider her as a reasonable candidate for reunification with her child.\u201d His updated report on November 15, 2010, noted Lela\u2019s improvement, but found \u201cthere is significant amount of different difficulties of different domains that will impair her abilities to be a minimally adequate parent for the child in question[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Dr. Fite\u2019s June 24, 2010 report concluded, \u201cI do not believe she is currently stable enough to provide minimally adequate care for her son, now or in the near future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>The first discussion of possibly attempting a second \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program was raised by Dr. Singer\u2019s combined psychological and bonding evaluation in October 2010. The report never suggested reunification was warranted, rather it concluded, \u201cWhile the data does not suggest [Lela] can independently parent [Alvin] either now or in the near future, the data does suggest that, with appropriate intervention, [Lela] is likely to become a viable parenting option for [Alvin], under supervision.\u201d In that regard, Dr. Singer recommended Lela commence a \u201chighly structured\u201d \u201cMommy &amp; Me\u201d program, then Alvin would be transitioned under supervised care, once Lela had adjusted and accepted the structure. Dr. Singer did not recommend Alvin\u2019s placement should be terminated in favor of this program, rather he cautioned in the event of another failed placement with Lela, there was an increased risk of \u201cenduring harm\u201d for Alvin because of the separation from his resource family.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In his subsequent review performed in June 2011, following Lela\u2019s rejection of her placement, Dr. Singer concluded, \u201cThis child clearly requires consistency and permanency. The available data does support [the Division]\u2019s plan to pursue termination of parental rights as the data does not suggest [Lela] will be able to provide consistency and permanency for her son in the foreseeable future.\u201d Dr. Singer\u2019s trial testimony reaffirmed this opinion. He opined were Alvin to live with Lela he \u201cwould have to live that chaotic lifestyle that [Lela] has lived over time. And ... that chaotic lifestyle is totally contrary to the permanency and consistency that a child needs.\u201d He also added \u201csignificant\u201d \u201clong-term\u201d harm was likely to result were Alvin separated from his resource family.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Finally, Dr. Johnson\u2019s bonding testimony supported the fact that Lela and Alvin have an emotional connection, albeit a tenuous one. Her overall style with him could be characterized as \u201chaving chronic and varying levels of confrontation.\u201d Dr. Johnson characterized the bond between Alvin and Lela as \u201cinsecure\u201d and recommended termination of parental rights was in Alvin\u2019s best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>interests because \u201cit would be traumatic for him to be removed from the only home that he\u2019s really ever known.\u201d She found Alvin had a \u201cconsistently strong and positive bond with both foster parents\u201d with whom he has lived for almost his entire life, and who would mitigate any harm resulting from the severing of ties to Lela.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">The trial judge credited the experts, whose unequivocal testimony clearly and convincingly stated that separating Alvin from his resource parents would cause serious and enduring emotional harm. <em>See also N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. T.C., </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>419, 440, 598 A.2d 899 (App.Div.1991) (concluding termination was justified \u201cto spare the child grievous and irreparable psychological harm\u201d). While Alvin has a relationship with Lela, the harm he would face were those ties severed would not be enduring, as it would be properly mitigated by his resource parents. This result is additionally supported by the trial court\u2019s finding that further delay in establishing a stable and permanent home for Alvin, who has been in placement for almost the entirety of his life (now more than four years), would continue to cause harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In conclusion, we determine the trial court\u2019s findings are properly supported by clear and convincing evidence and the legal conclusions drawn therefrom will not be disturbed. Alvin\u2019s right to a permanent, safe, and stable home must prevail over Lela\u2019s desire to continue her efforts toward possibly achieving adequate parenting and reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-10\"> On June 29, 2012, the Governor signed into law A-3101, which reorganizes the Department of Children and Families, which includes the renaming of the Division as the Division of Child Protection and Permanency. <em>L. </em>2012, <em>c. </em>16, eff.
