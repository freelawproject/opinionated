Plaintiff Katherine Milne challenges provisions set forth in Family Part orders dated March 10, 2011, March 23, 2011, and September 30, 2011, the latest of which was entered following our limited remand. Defendant Robert Goldenberg appeals from an April 29, 2011 order, which reallocated the parties\u2019 obligations to satisfy the guardian ad litem (GAL) expense. We ordered all matters consolidated on appeal and address them in a single opinion. Following our review, we affirm each of the challenged orders, except for a provision in the March 23, 2011 order appointing a parenting coordinator.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">The following facts are taken from the record of the trial court proceedings resulting in the orders under review. In addition to general background information regarding the parties\u2019 matrimonial litigation, we limit our recital of the facts to the specific provisions of the many orders, as necessary to provide context to the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-13\">Following trial in 2007, a dual final judgment of divorce (JOD) dissolved the parties\u2019 nineteen-year marriage. The divorce judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>found the pendente lite shared custodial arrangement for the parties\u2019 two special needs children was \u201cnot working[.]\u201d The parties had agreed the children would remain in the former marital home and each party, on an every other alternating week basis, would occupy the home and care for the children. The divorce judge terminated this process, finding \u201c[bjoth parents [were] unable to reach a consensus on parenting styles and other child related matters\u201d and had \u201cnot been able to put aside the anger and hostility they feel toward each other and make decisions in the best interest of [the children].\u201d The divorce judge adopted the parenting plan proposed by plaintiff, which designated her as the parent of primary residence (PPR), defendant as the parent of alternate residence (PAR), and set defendant\u2019s parenting time as 117 overnights and 52 midweek visits each year. The JOD also continued the pre-trial appointment of Dr. Amie B. Wolf-Mehlman as the parties\u2019 Parenting Coordinator (PC). Dr. Wolf-Mehlman, in her role as PC, was \u201cto assist the parties in changing or modifying [the] parenting plan or resolve any [parenting time] disputes that may arise[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Plaintiff and defendant appealed from provisions of the JOD. Plaintiff challenged various financial provisions and defendant challenged the appointment of plaintiff as the PPR. <em>Milne v. </em>Goldenberg, No. A-2822-07, 2009 <em>WL </em>3460219 (App.Div. Oct. 15, 2009) (slip op. at 2). On October 15, 2009, in an unpublished opinion, we affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">While the appeal was pending, plaintiff moved for modification of the parenting time provisions. In orders dated March 9, 2009, and April 21, 2009, a different Family Part judge (the motion judge) directed the parties to \u201cresume seeing a parenting eoordinator[.]\u201d However, plaintiff had terminated Wolf-Mehlman\u2019s services in November 2007, prior to the entry of divorce, because she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201cdisagreed with her recommendations\u201d and felt \u201c[defendant was abusing the [parent coordination] process.\u201d Defendant moved to enforce the JOD regarding cooperation with a PC. This request was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Plaintiff next moved to appoint a custody expert to evaluate the children, which was met by defendant\u2019s cross-motion to enforce litigant\u2019s rights regarding parenting time and requiring use of the PC. The motion judge denied plaintiffs request and vacated the prior orders requiring use of a PC. The motion judge appointed Linda Schofel as the children\u2019s GAL, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">[I]t\u2019s clear to me that this ease requires more than a parent coordinator____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">So, what I am doing is I am appointing a [GAL] that\u2019s going to represent the [children\u2019s] interests .. and I\u2019m appointing Linda Schofel ... who is an attorney and also has ... a strong background in social sciences, social services. I forget if she has her MSW----And I am going to appoint her to do an evaluation, meet with the [children], meet with you and I am going to follow her recommendations. I am concerned that the two of you can\u2019t conduct yourselves as responsible parents and that\u2019s why I\u2019m seeking the input of a [GAL]. And understand that if she tells me that it might be in the [children's] interests that neither of you have any parenting time with them, then I will do that because I am here to protect the interest of the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">The motion judge ordered the parties to \u201cfully cooperate with ... Schofel\u2019s requests\u201d and equally pay her $5000 retainer, within ten days. Any additional fees due Schofel were to be split equally and paid \u201cin a timely manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">As Schofel performed her assessment, several motions were filed by the parties regarding various parenting issues, which do not impact our review. However, the motion judge granted defendant\u2019s application requiring plaintiff to pay her share of the outstanding balance of Schofel\u2019s fees, totaling $5,232.12. Again, plaintiff was ordered to satisfy all future payments \u201cin a timely fashion[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-12\">Prior to preparing a formal written report to the court, the parties were ordered to meet with Schofel \u201cto discuss her preliminary thoughts and recommendations as to how to best help [the children.]\u201d The motion judge also appointed Ellen Marshall, an attorney, as the new PC, and required her fees to be paid equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>During a conference that included the parties and their counsel, Schofel discussed her findings and recommendations. Following that five-hour meeting, Schofel believed the issues \u201chad now been settled!,]\u201d and agreed to draft a consent order memorializing the agreement. Correspondence in respect of the alleged terms of settlement was exchanged. However, plaintiff rejected all recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The March 10, 2011 order emanated from defendant\u2019s November 5, 2010 motion seeking enforcement of litigant\u2019s rights. He included twenty-six requests, many of which centered around plaintiff\u2019s non-payment of previously ordered financial obligations and the remainder alleged changed circumstances necessitated modification of alimony and child support. Before the motion was heard, defendant also filed a separate emergent motion seeking sole custody of the children, implementation of Schofel\u2019s parenting time recommendations, enforcement of prior orders to pay the GAL and PC\u2019s fees, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Plaintiff filed her own motion seeking the motion judge\u2019s recusal. She also sought Marshall\u2019s removal and Wolf-Mehlman\u2019s return as PC. Finally, plaintiff requested Schofel\u2019s termination as GAL with a refund of all fees that had been paid to date. Plaintiff separately responded to defendant\u2019s motions, opposing his requests, particularly the motion for sole custody, and filed a cross-motion listing her own application for enforcement of provisions of the JOD and payment of defendant\u2019s share of unreimbursed medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The motion judge denied defendant\u2019s emergent application for change in custody, recused herself, and reassigned all remaining issues to a new Family Part judge (the trial judge). Prior to the next motion hearing, plaintiff supplemented her submissions with another motion for enforcement of litigant\u2019s rights, seeking to compel defendant\u2019s payment of alimony and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>On March 7 and 8, 2011, the trial judge considered all of the issues presented by the respective motions. Both Schofel and Marshall appeared along with the parties and their counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Plaintiff asserted Schofel must be removed and she must refund the fees paid because the court lacked jurisdiction to appoint a GAL when \u201cthe case was pending on appeal[.]\u201d The trial judge rejected this argument and found \u201cno basis to remove\u201d the GAL. He ordered Schofel\u2019s appointment nunc pro tunc, effective May 29, 2009, and ordered plaintiff to pay Schofel\u2019s outstanding bills within ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The trial judge also found plaintiff violated past orders to enforce provisions of the JOD. The orders required plaintiff to satisfy certain federal income tax liability and the accruing penalties assessed for late filing and payment. Notwithstanding that the obligations were clearly imposed by post-judgment orders mandating plaintiffs payment and imposed daily sanctions, she had yet to satisfy the debt. The trial judge recognized plaintiffs unemployment as precluding payment of the previously imposed sanctions, so he ordered plaintiff to perform 120 hours of community service, supervised by the Essex County Probation Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The trial judge allowed additional discovery and scheduled a hearing for March 21, 2011, \u201cconcerning the [GALj\u2019s recommendations[.]\u201d The order stated \u201c[t]he issues raised in [djefendant\u2019s ... [ojrder to [sjhow [cjause relating to custody of the minor children, the [cjourt\u2019s adoption of the recommendations of the [GAL], and the mental and physical health issues of the minor children shall be addressed at the hearing[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The trial judge also rejected plaintiffs application to remove Marshall, based on plaintiffs assertion Marshall failed to qualify as a PC under the Parenting Coordination Pilot Program Guidelines as adopted by the Supreme Court. The trial judge reasoned the pilot program was not implemented in Essex County so the Guidelines regarding the qualifications for PCs were \u201cnot relevant\u201d to the parties\u2019 matter. Accordingly, Marshall was appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>nunc pro tune effective June 21, 2010, and plaintiff was ordered to sign Marshall\u2019s retainer agreement, pay her half of her retainer, and cooperate with parent coordination services. The trial judge directed the role of the PC was \u201cto resolve certain parenting issues between the parties. The [PC] is to assist the parties in changing or modifying the [plaintiffs parenting plan, to resolve any disputes that may arise under this plan, and to perform as otherwise [o]rdered by this [c]ourt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Guided by <em>Rule </em>5:8B, the trial judge held a two-day hearing concerning the GAL\u2019s recommendations. The record suggests although correspondence between Schofel and the parties\u2019 counsel was exchanged, a formal written GAL report was never prepared. The trial judge noted, \u201cthe [GAL] provide[d] her services to the [c]ourt on behalf of the children ... [and] act[ed] as an independent fact finder, investigator, and evaluator as to what furthers the best interests of the children.\u201d Consequently, \u201clike any other witness, the court can accept all of the testimony of the witness, some of it, or none of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Prior to commencement of the hearing, plaintiff suggested the parties would need to testify and requested an adjournment to obtain an expert, presumably to challenge the recommendations advanced by the GAL. The trial judge denied the request, explaining this was \u201ca limited hearing\u201d and <em>Rule </em>5:8B permitted only the GAL to testify, subject to cross-examination, without testimony from the parties or other experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Responding to broad questions posed by the trial judge, Schofel related her education, past employment, licenses and general qualifications. Next, she discussed facets of her undertaking, estimated to have occurred over thirty to thirty-seven hours, including: meeting with the parties, the children, other relatives, physicians and therapists who were treating the parties and the children, along with other professionals or collateral contacts; reviewing pleadings, orders, and written communications between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the parties; and considering psychological treatises, articles, and materials relevant to the issues presented. She then delineated her recommendations for custody, parenting time, and related issues that would best aid the children. Thereafter, each party conducted cross-examination, identifying inconsistencies or conflicts in Schofel\u2019s testimony. Each side presented a summation and the trial judge reserved his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The following morning, the trial judge placed his opinion on the record. The trial judge affirmed the purpose of the hearing was to present the GAL\u2019s report as allowed by <em>Rule </em>5:8B and to finalize the balance of the issues raised in defendant\u2019s emergent application regarding a change of custody and other relief. The trial judge found Schofel\u2019s credentials were impressive and she was well-qualified to fulfill the GAL appointment. He noted Schofel undertook her investigational work in a \u201cprofessional, thorough, and even-handed fashion\u201d and found her testimony credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The trial judge considered the arguments advanced by plaintiff and defendant in favor of or opposing recommendations offered by the GAL. Accordingly, the trial judge reviewed each issue, at times adopting and at times rejecting Schofel\u2019s recommendations. The trial judge entered the March 23, 2011 order memorializing his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Two issues remained following the hearing: defendant\u2019s application for an award of counsel fees and final payment of the monies due Schofel. As a result of the trial judge\u2019s leave of absence, a new Family Part judge (the new motion judge) was assigned to determine these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Schofel submitted her final certification of services, and included the amounts she believed were due from each party based upon the order requiring them to pay equally. Her calculations showed defendant owed $9,243.12, and plaintiff owed $27,552.69. Without further argument, the new motion judge issued a letter opinion denying defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. Further, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>determining the initial order allocating the GAL expense was \u201cstale,\u201d the new motion judge reallocated the $54,000 GAL expense, which he had reduced from approximately $80,000, to be paid \u201cone third [by] the plaintiff wife and two thirds [by] the defendant husband.\u201d An April 29, 2011 order memorialized the new motion judge\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Plaintiff timely sought leave to appeal and requested a stay of the March 10, 2011 order imposing the community service sanction. However, we determined the order was final, mooting the request for leave. We stayed the provision ordering her to perform community service. Plaintiff corrected her pleadings and filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Plaintiff separately appealed from the March 23, 2011 trial judge\u2019s order, asserting she was denied due process during the hearing because the trial judge refused to allow her to testify or otherwise present evidence. She requests that order be vacated in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In plaintiffs appeal from the April 29, 2011 order challenging the allocation of the payment obligation to Schofel, a limited remand was sought to address defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the order. Additionally, Schofel had moved for inclusion of her letter dated May 2, 2011 within the appellate record, which addressed her fees. We granted a temporary remand to allow the Family Part to consider these two requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Because the new motion judge had retired, the case was reassigned to another Family Part judge (the final motion judge). He considered Schofel\u2019s letter and found no reason to exclude it from the record on appeal. The final motion judge also confirmed the allocation of Schofel\u2019s fees, but vacated and reconsidered defendant\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees. After reviewing the attorney fees request, the work performed, orders entered in the matter, and other factors set forth in <em>Rule </em>5:3-5(c), the final motion judge awarded defendant $10,000, which was set forth in the order dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>September 30, 2011. Plaintiff amended her notice of appeal of the April 29, 2011 order to include the September 30, 2011 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"> Generally, the special jurisdiction and expertise of the family court requires that we defer to factual determinations if they are supported by adequate, substantial, and credible evidence in the record. <em>Cesare v. Cesare, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>394, 413, 713 A.2d 390 (1998). <em>Accord N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. E.P., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>88, 104, 952 A.2d 436 (2008); <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. G.L., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>596, 605, 926 A.2d 320 (2007). It is well settled that Family Part factfinding receives particular deference because of \u201cthe family courts\u2019 special jurisdiction and expertise in family matters,\u201d <em>Cesare, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 413, 713 A.2d 390, which will be disturbed only upon a showing that the findings are \u201c \u2018manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence\u2019 \u201d to ensure there is no denial of justice, <em>Platt v. Platt, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 425, 894 A.2d 1221 (App.Div.2006) (quoting <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Also, we accord great deference to discretionary decisions of Family Part judges. <em>Donnelly v. Donnelly, </em>405 <em>N.J.Super. 117, </em>127, 963 A.2d 855 (App.Div.2009) (citing <em>Larbig v. Larbig, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>17, 21, 894 A.2d 1 (App.Div.2006)). \u201c \u2018LJjudicial discretion connotes conscientious judgment, not arbitrary action; it takes into account the law and the particular circumstances of the case before the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hand v. Hand, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>102, 111, 917 A.2d 269 (App.Div.2007) (quoting <em>Higgins v. Polk, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>490, 493, 103 A.2d 1 (1954)). An abuse of discretion \u201carises when a decision is \u2018made without a rational explanation, inexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Flagg v. Essex Cnty. Prosecutor, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>561, 571, 796 A.2d 182 (2002) (quoting <em>Achacoso-Sanchez v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>779 F.2d 1260, 1265 (7th Cir.1985)). However, a judge\u2019s legal decisions are subject to our plenary review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Crespo v. Crespo, </em>395 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 194, 928 A.2d 833 (App.Div.2007) (citing <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)); <em>Lobiondo v. O\u2019Callaghan, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>488, 495, 815 A.2d 1013 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>224, 827 A.2d 291 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">We start with plaintiffs challenge to the March 10, 2011 order imposing community service for her failure to comply with past orders regarding the payment of a joint federal income tax liability. Plaintiffs delay in resolving her ordered obligation resulted in the seizure of defendant\u2019s subsequent income tax refund. She argues the imposition of sanctions was an abuse of discretion because she had engaged a third-party to resolve the income tax issues. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\"><em>Rule </em>1:10-3 allows a court to enter an order to enforce litigant\u2019s rights commanding a disobedient party to comply with a prior order or face incarceration. <em>Saltzman v. Saltzman, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>117, 125, 675 A.2d 231 (App.Div.1996). Once the court determines the non-eompliant party was able to comply with the order and unable to show the failure was excusable, it may impose appropriate sanctions. <em>Id. </em>at 123, 675 A.2d 231. Sanctions under <em>Rule </em>1:10-3 are intended to coerce a party\u2019s compliance. <em>Ridley v. Dennison, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>373, 381, 689 A.2d 793 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Prior orders regarding plaintiffs satisfaction of the tax liability, which was shown to have increased from an initial amount of $10,311, to a total obligation with penalties and interest of $61,984, included imposing time deadlines for payment, extending those time deadlines, a mounting daily sanction for non-payment, an award of attorney\u2019s fees to defendant, and the issuance of a bench warrant. Plaintiff remained non-eompliant. During this hearing, plaintiff demonstrated her recent unemployment impeded her ability to satisfy daily sanctions, so the trial judge amended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>order, eliminating the financial penalty in favor of 120 hours of community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">During the ability to pay hearing, at which plaintiff testified, the trial judge found plaintiffs non-compliance was deliberately designed to delay satisfaction of the obligation, as she had \u201ca significant amount of money ... [at] her disposal, while she was not complying with these court orders.\u201d The judge found plaintiffs failure to pay was willful, as she intentionally \u201cprioritize[d]\u201d her funds and ignored the obligation. In imposing the community service obligation, the trial judge noted there is a need to maintain the \u201cintegrity and enforceability\u201d of the court\u2019s orders, \u201cotherwise they become suggestions or recommendations[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Deferring to the trial judge\u2019s factual findings regarding plaintiffs ability to pay and her willful non-compliance, which are facts supported by the evidence in the record, we conclude the imposition of community service hours rather than incarceration was a reasonable exercise of judicial discretion. We will not alter the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">We next examine a number of challenges to procedure followed during the March 21 and 22, 2011 hearing to consider the GAL\u2019s recommendations. Plaintiff argues her due process rights were infringed by the trial judge\u2019s denial of the opportunity to present witnesses and her own testimony. Before reviewing this argument, we examine the role of a GAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">\u201cIn all cases in which custody or parenting time/visitation is an issue, a [GAL] may be appointed by court order to represent the best interests of the child or children if the circumstances warrant such an appointment.\u201d <em>R. </em>5:8B(a). The rule is grounded in the Legislature\u2019s adoption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4c, which permits a court, \u201cfor good cause and upon its own motion ... [to] appoint a [GAL] or an attorney or both to represent the minor child\u2019s interests[,]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and affirms the Family Part\u2019s obligation to protect children enmeshed in parental disputes. <em>See Vannucchi v. Vannucchi, 113 N.J.Super. </em>40, 47, 272 A.2d 560 (App.Div.) (\u201cIn the exercise of their <em>parens patriae </em>jurisdiction our courts look always to the protection of the child\u2019s best interests[.]\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>163, 275 A.2d 744 (1971). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-4c (\u201cIn any proceeding involving the custody of a minor child, the rights of both parents shall be equal and the court shall enter an order which may include: ...

[and] acts as an independent fact finder, investigator and evaluator as to what furthers the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>In re M.R., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>155, 173, 638 A.2d 1274 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). The GAL\u2019s findings and recommendations are submitted to the <em>court. R. </em>5:8B(a). Specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">in addition to the preparation of a written report and the obligation to testify and be cross-examined thereon, the duties of a guardian may include, but need not be limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">1. Interviewing the children and parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">2. Interviewing other persons possessing relevant information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">3.

Such other matters as the guardian ad litem may request, on leave of court. <em>[Ibid]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">Finally, a GAL \u201cmust be available to testify and, like any other witness, is subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>Fawzy v. Fawzy, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>456, 484, 973 A.2d 347 (2009). <em>Accord R. </em>5:8B(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-16\">In this matter, even before the entry of the JOD, these parents relentlessly disputed parenting time and custody. The most recent post-judgment allegations, initiated by defendant\u2019s request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>for sole custody, were a continuation of an established pattern of dueling attacks on parental fitness. In their cross-motions, the parties suggested the children were experiencing physical symptoms resulting from the emotional turmoil stirred by their parents\u2019 acrimony. In an effort to ferret out the situation, Schofel was appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Plaintiff maintains the GAL was merely one witness whose testimony should not be considered \u201cin a vacuum.\u201d Plaintiff equates the appointment of a GAL with the court\u2019s appointment of any other expert, arguing the court cannot appoint a GAL \u201cand dispense with a full trial\u201d necessary to \u201ctest the validity of the [GAL]\u2019s facts or her conclusions!.]\u201d Although we agree in general with such a statement and conclude the trial judge employed too restrictive an interpretation of <em>Rule </em>5:8B, we nevertheless find, in the context of this case, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">We first clarify the issue regarding the parties\u2019 ability to contest the facts presented by a GAL. As an investigator acting at the direction of the court, a GAL must report on those facts bearing on a child\u2019s best interest. <em>Rule </em>5:8B(a) defines the method by which these facts are expressed to the court and the parties. The rule states the GAL issues a written report and must appear for examination and cross-examination by the parties. <em>Ibid. </em>A GAL would have no perceived bias in favor of one parent\u2019s position because the GAL\u2019s role is to act on behalf of the court and present the best interests of the children. <em>Ibid. </em>That role, however, would not obviate presentation of evidence refuting a GAL\u2019s factual assertions. Consequently, a parent or other witness may present evidence which clarifies, refutes, or supplements the testimony of the GAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">When faced with evidence of disputed material facts, a judge must permit a plenary hearing in order to reach a resolution. <em>Tretola v. Tretola, </em>389 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 20, 910 A.2d 630 (App.Div.2006). Similarly, \u201cdisputes implicating the welfare of a child and involving conflicting contentions and opinions of lay and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>expert affiants must be submitted to a plenary hearing.\u201d <em>Fusco v. Fusco, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>321, 329, 452 A.2d 681 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Also important is the scope of the GAL\u2019s role. Although acting as a fiduciary on behalf of the court, the GAL\u2019s report and recommendations may never serve as a substitute for the court\u2019s exercise of its <em>parens patriae </em>obligation. Consequently, a trial judge is never bound to accept a GAL\u2019s recommendations, and must never \u201ccede ... responsibility and authority[,]\u201d or \u201cabdicate [the] decision-making role to an expert.\u201d <em>P.T. v. M.S., </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>193, 216, 738 A.2d 385 (App.Div.1999). Therefore, the posture of the evidentiary hearing may not necessarily be limited solely to the GAL\u2019s testimony and evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Turning to the facts presented in this matter, we note the motion judge appointed a GAL on May 29, 2009. At that time, the parties\u2019 motions raised numerous parenting time disputes. Their respective positions demonstrated they were unable to resolve minor matters (such as defendant\u2019s request to be provided with a copy of the children\u2019s height and weight charts), or major concerns (such as whether modifications in evening or holiday parenting should occur). A prior appointment of a PC, designed to help the parties rationally discuss and reasonably resolve parenting time disagreements, failed. Unfortunately, the parties persisted in litigating the smallest of slights in their never-ending battle for advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">In the series of motions culminating in the evidentiary hearing, plaintiff sought appointment of a custody expert, presumably to support her belief that when it comes to defendant\u2019s time with his children, less was more desirable. The motion judge denied that request, expressed her \u201cconcern\u201d that the parents could not \u201cconduct [them]selves as responsible parents[,]\u201d and appointed a GAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Perhaps the best course would have been for the motion judge to order a hearing to test the parties\u2019 competing claims, enter an order outlining the boundaries of acceptable conduct, and insist on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>compliance with any orders entered. In any event, Schofel began her evaluation, which was not completed until July 14, 2010. The motion judge additionally delayed ultimate resolution by requiring the parties to mediate the matter. Defendant then filed the November 5, 2010 motion, triggering another series of quarrels between the parties. From May 2009 to February 2010, the parties\u2019 certifications encompassed hundreds of pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">During her appointment, the GAL had not prepared a written report, predominately because plaintiff had not fulfilled her responsibility to provide payment. The March 2011 hearing was designed to obtain the fruits of Schofel\u2019s investigation and subject her recommendations to cross-examination. Under these unusual circumstances, the trial court\u2019s limitation on the scope of the hearing was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We also note despite her protest of the procedure employed, plaintiff offers no evidence she would have presented if permitted, which would have altered the final result. She neither lists those witnesses whose testimony would have materially disputed the facts asserted by Schofel, nor presents new facts not previously included in the volumes of pleadings before the court. In short, she shows no harm resulting from the process employed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Plaintiff next maintains the trial judge abrogated responsibility to the GAL. We agree the motion judge erred in stating: \u201cI am appointing a [GALJ ... and I am going to follow her recommendations.\u201d However, we disagree this error infected the proceeding because the trial judge did not make the mistake of summarily adopting the recommendations of the GAL. Rather, he weighed the facts and independently determined each issue, after also considering the other evidence presented in the parties\u2019 pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">As our Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">The question of whether a trial court may make a sua sponte custody determination need not long detain us. The paramount consideration in child custody eases is to foster the best interests of the child. This standard has been described as one that protects the safety, happiness, physical, mental and moral welfare of the child. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>It would be incongruous and counterproductive to restrict application of this standard to the relief requested by the parties to a custody dispute. Accordingly, a sua sponte custody determination is properly within the discretion of the trial court provided it is supported by the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\"><em>[Beck v. Beck, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>480, 497, 432 A.2d 63 (1981) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The credible evidence in the record supports a finding that both parents provided excellent care for the children. However, their distrust and disgust for one another eliminated any hope of cooperative parenting. In this light, we find no error in denying further evidentiary proceedings prior to the trial court\u2019s modest modification of the parenting time schedule and its procedural implementation, in an effort to lessen parental interaction and curb opportunities to display acrimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Hand, supra, </em>391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 111, 917 A.2d 269 (providing a court may modify custody or parenting time when it \u201c \u2018takes into account the law and the particular circumstances of the case before the eourt[,]\u2019 \u201d thereby demonstrating the implementation of a \u201c\u2018conscientious judgment, [rather than] arbitrary action\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Higgins, supra, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>at 493, 103 A.2d 1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Plaintiff next attacks the provisions in the March 23, 2011 order appointing a PC, who is an attorney and not a mental health professional. Plaintiff argues the trial court erred because the Supreme Court Guidelines implementing the PC Pilot Program only allow appointment of attorneys with the parties\u2019 consent. Defendant suggests no abuse of discretion is presented, echoing the trial judge\u2019s comments that the Guidelines apply only to pilot counties, which did not include Essex County.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">We conclude parties to a matrimonial dispute may agree to comply with defined obligations regarding their use of a PC, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>do not violate the public policy of this State. However, any Family Part judge ordering the appointment of a PC must comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s established Guidelines. Because the Guidelines were not followed, that provision in the March 23, 2010 order is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Pilot Program was approved by the Supreme Court on March 5, 2007, to be implemented in Bergen, Middlesex, Morris, Sussex, and Union Counties. <em>See Notice to the Bar: Parenting Coordinator Pilot Program, </em>188 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>169 (April 9; 2007), <em>available at </em>http://www.judiciary.state.nj .us/notiees/2007/n070403a. pdf. The Guidelines explain a court may appoint a PC \u201cto facilitate the resolution of day to day parenting issues that frequently arise within the context of family life when parents are separated ... [but unable to] resolve these issues on their own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 I. The Guidelines require any appointee to meet the following qualifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">A Parenting Coordinator may be a social worker, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, or a marriage and family therapist who shall be licensed to practice in the State of New Jersey by the appropriate State Board and agencies. If the parties consent, the court may designate as Parenting Coordinator a non-mental health lay person unrelated to either party or an attorney licensed in the State of New Jersey, so long as such individual is qualified by experience and/or training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\"><em>[Id. </em>\u00a7 II D(l).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">The use of a PC is designed to aid parents by providing a different forum to discuss parenting problems. The use of a PC may not substitute for a judge\u2019s determination in contested parenting issues pending before the Family Part. <em>Parish v. Parish, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>39, 53, 988 A.2d 1180 (App.Div.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Although we are aware of no reported authority binding a non-pilot county to the Guidelines, we have no hesitation in ordering such a result. The pilot program is designed \u201cto test the parenting coordinator concept,\u201d <em>Notice to the Bar, supra, </em>18 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>169, which was developed after receipt of input from judges, lawyers, mental health professionals, and other interested persons. The Guidelines establish the Supreme Court\u2019s operational details for a uniform approach to appointment of PCs and impose pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>poseful boundaries on the PC role and those providing PC services.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We are very aware of Schofel\u2019s testimony recommending the attorney appointed as PC. Schofel believed \u201cthe parties needed a particular type of parenting coordinator, someone who would be very strong and not be intimidated by either [party] or manipulated by either [party].\u201d Further, she stated the approved candidates were limited because of conflicts or their refusal to accept appointment to coordinate for these parents. While Schofel\u2019s pronouncements may be accurate, the Guidelines\u2019 expressed limitation on using attorneys absent consent of the parents is meaningful and cannot be disregarded. Consequently, we reverse the trial judge\u2019s appointment of an attorney as violative of the Guidelines\u2019 requirements. On remand, if a Family Part judge appoints a PC for these parents, future management of the PC is subject to the Guidelines, which contain procedures both for grievances, <em>see Notice to the Bar, supra, </em>\u00a7 IV(8), and termination, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 IV(12).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The remainder of the claims under this point heading are meritless, <em>R. </em>2:11-3(E)(1)(E), including plaintiffs allegation the trial court impermissibly delegated its authority to the PC by directing her to explain to the parties their roles as PPR and PAR, faded to include a provision for the PC\u2019s removal, and erred by including \u201cdraconian language that failure to cooperate may result in a transfer of custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">The trial judge\u2019s instruction, stating \u201c[n]oneompliance by either of the parties <em>may be a basis </em>for a change in custody or, alternatively, a change in the designation of [PPR] and [PAR,]\u201d is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Beck, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 499, 432 A.2d 63, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">The necessity for at least minimal parental cooperation in a joint custody arrangement presents a thorny problem of judicial enforcement in a case such as the present one, wherein despite the trial court\u2019s determination that joint custody is in the best interests of the child, one parent (here, the mother) nevertheless contends that cooperation is impossible and refuses to abide by the decree. Traditional enforcement techniques are singularly inappropriate in a child custody proceeding for which the best interests of the child is our polestar. Despite the obvious unfairness of allowing an uncooperative parent to flout a court decree, we are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>unwilling to sanction punishment of a recalcitrant parent if the welfare of the child will also suffer. However, when the actions of such a parent deprive the child of the kind of relationship with the other parent that is deemed to be in the child\u2019s best interests, removing the child from the custody of the uncooperative parent may well be appropriate as a remedy of last resort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>See also R. </em>5:3-7(a)(6) (explaining remedies for a parent\u2019s violation of orders relating to custody or parenting time include \u201ctemporary or permanent modification of the custodial arrangement provided such relief is in the best interest of the children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Plaintiff next argues the new motion judge should have capped the GAL\u2019s bills to an amount that was reasonable and necessary. Tied to this issue is defendant\u2019s challenge to the final allocation of the GAL fees and plaintiffs objection to an award of counsel fees to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 arguments on each of these issues in light of the record and applicable law. We find no abuse of discretion and determine these arguments lack sufficient merit to warrant lengthy discussion in our written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E). We add these brief comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">A GAL is entitled to compensation for services at an hourly rate \u201cfixed in the initial appointing order[.J\u201d <em>R. </em>5:8B(d). The GAL must \u201csubmit informational monthly statements to the parties ... [and] a certification of services at the conclusion of the matter, on notice to the parties, who will thereafter be afforded the right to respond prior to the court fixing the final fee.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Finally, the trial judge has \u201cthe power and discretion to fix a retainer in the appointing order and to allocate final payment of the [GAL] fee between the parties.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Here, the appointing order fixed the GAL\u2019s retainer and the parties\u2019 respective obligations for payment. The order did not fix the GAL\u2019s hourly rate; however, no objection to this omission was raised. Additionally, the final assessment of the parties\u2019 obligation for payment was made following full opportunity to challenge the aspects of the work performed and the fees charged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number><em>See In re Adoption of a Child by J.D.S. II, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>378, 403-04, 803 A.2d 123 (App.Div.2002) (noting the trial court failed to set an hourly rate for GAL in appointing order and remanding for the trial court\u2019s consideration of plaintiffs challenge to the fee), <em>aff'd, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>154, 820 A.2d 1237 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">We also reject plaintiffs claim of misapplied discretion in the motion judge\u2019s failure to require Schofel\u2019s submission of a written report. In deference to plaintiffs objection to the cost, the motion judge proposed, and the parties accepted, a meeting with the GAL to review her findings. The procedure was also an effort to reach agreement on some or all issues, which would have narrowed or eliminated the need for a further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">We determine this procedure accomplished the intent and purpose of <em>Rule </em>5:8B. We conclude the modification of the procedure had no prejudicial effect on plaintiffs interest; rather, it was directed to efficiently resolve the controversy. <em>See R. </em>l:l-2(a) (providing the rules may be relaxed so long as they are \u201cconstrued to secure a just determination, simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">We turn to plaintiffs argument challenging the amount of the GAL expenses and defendant\u2019s argument that the new motion judge erred in ordering an unequal allocation of the GAL expenses. Having considered the parties\u2019 respective challenges, we are not persuaded an abuse of discretion occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The GAL initially sought fees in excess of $80,000, but the new motion judge reduced her entitlement to $54,000, after eliminating charges determined to be unreasonable. The modification of the allocation of this sum as between the warring parents was a direct function of their ability to pay. The record reflects tax returns were reviewed showing that of the total income earned, plaintiff earned 37.3% while defendant earned 62.61%. The new motion judge did not find support for defendant\u2019s contention plaintiffs untoward motives and conduct were \u201cthe direct and proximate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>cause of the substantial increase in the [GALJ\u2019s fees[.J\u201d Modifying the initial appointment order directing equal allocation of the fees was reasonable in light of plaintiffs ability to pay because she was unemployed, a fact well supported by the record. We find the new motion judge\u2019s basis for deviating from the allocation stated in the initial order appointing the GAL was clearly articulated and grounded on facts in the record. Defendant\u2019s claim that the unequal allocation was arbitrary or capricious is unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">We further reject plaintiffs challenge suggesting the final motion judge\u2019s attorney fee award was unsupported. The final motion judge properly reviewed the parameters of <em>Rule </em>5:3-5(c) and applicable case law regarding such awards in family matters. We find no \u201cclear abuse of discretion\u201d warranting our interference with the award of counsel fees ordered. <em>Strahan v. Strahan, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 317, 953 A.2d 1219 (App.Div.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The final motion judge relied on the trial judge\u2019s award of fees to defendant resulting from the enforcement of litigant\u2019s rights filed on November 5, 2010, and order to show cause filed on November 23, 2010. Following our review of the record of these proceedings, we conclude the trial court\u2019s findings in support of the fees awarded to defendant were proper. The court considered the necessity of the services incurred in enforcing the prior orders, per <em>Rule </em>1:10-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">In summation, except for the appointment of the PC set forth in the March 23, 2011 order which is reversed, we affirm the remaining orders in all other respects as discussed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">We note two motions to supplement the record were deferred pending our review (M-006816-10 and M-007097-10).
