Mclnerney, a high school baseball coach, guilty of endangering the welfare of ten children under the age of eighteen, a crime of the second degree defined in subsection a of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge sentenced him to three consecutive six-year terms of imprisonment and seven concurrent five-year terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">This second-degree crime applies only to a \u201cperson having a legal duty for the care of a child or who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. Although the evidence was adequate to permit the jury to conclude that defendant \u201cassumed responsibility for the care of\u2019 each child, the jury instruction on the meaning of that phrase was inadequate and contradictory. The flaws are attributable to the incorporation of definitions of abuse and neglect that equate paid and volunteer members of a school staff with parents and custodians, effectively enlarging the class of persons to whom the second-degree crime applies. The erroneous instruction requires a new trial. To avoid repetition of the error, we urge the Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Model Criminal Jury Charges to clarify the <em>Model Jury Charge (Criminal), </em>\u201cEndangering the Welfare of a Child (Second Degree)\u201d (Nov. 10, 2003) (hereinafter the Model Charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Except for a one season hiatus from June 2005 to March 2007, defendant was the coach of a Catholic high school varsity baseball team and head of the school\u2019s baseball program from 1994 until November 2007. He left the position when he was arrested for this crime and complied with the principal\u2019s request that he refrain from coming onto school property or speaking with the students.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">As head coach, defendant was responsible for the \u201coverall development\u201d of the school\u2019s baseball program. He supervised the assistant coaches assigned to the freshman and junior varsity teams and was expected to monitor the \u201cperformance of the players in the lower teams\u201d to assess their potential for moving to the varsity level. Some of the players were moved up to varsity while they were freshmen and sophomores. During defendant\u2019s tenure, the varsity team won a State championship.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Although the baseball season starts in March and ends in May or June, depending on a team\u2019s success in post-season tournaments, defendant frequently came to the high school in the off season. He attended to his other responsibilities, which included fundraising for the baseball program and scheduling games for the next season. Because the high school did not have playing fields, defendant also had to arrange for his teams to practice and compete elsewhere. In addition, defendant came to the high school to work out in the gym, visit with teachers and other coaches and keep score at basketball games. Defendant\u2019s brother coached the soccer team, and defendant attended its games as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Although high school coaches are subject to rules that preclude off-season coaching, defendant was involved with the baseball players most of the year and expected his players to be involved all year as well. He organized summer and fall leagues in which his high school\u2019s students played, and he attended practices and games. He also managed a recreational softball league, and some of his team members assisted him with this.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>On several occasions, defendant traveled out-of-state with members of the high school baseball and soccer teams. During Easter break, members of the baseball team participated in tournaments in Hawaii, Alaska, and North Carolina, even though the rules of the diocese precluded the high school from supporting trips that required airplane travel and the team could not use the high school\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Defendant spent time with team members outside of organized baseball. For example, he took select players who were Mets fans on weekend trips to see games played in cities like Boston and Chicago; met with a boy who was thinking about coming to his high school to play baseball at his home; regularly allowed players to stop at his home; hosted a party for a player who was offered a baseball scholarship to a prestigious university; and offered to drive students to their homes after sporting events. Defendant and his brother also had a t-shirt and uniform business, and one member of his brother\u2019s soccer team worked there. That soccer player traveled with the baseball team to an out-of-state tournament. Defendant also played tennis with team members in his free time.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Furthermore, defendant involved himself in the lives of the players in matters unrelated to sports. One of the victims called defendant after midnight because he had consumed too much alcohol to drive; defendant picked up the boy and drove him to his girlfriend\u2019s home. The boy called defendant because he did not want his parents to know he was drinking and defendant had offered to do that for his players. Another victim whose drinking brought him to the attention of the police came to defendant for assistance, and he intervened. After the incident, defendant directed that boy to call him every time he returned home from a night out for one month. Defendant also gave the boys money when they asked, and he bought some of them sneakers. Several of the victims kept in contact with him after they graduated, even those who attended college away from home.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>The endangering charges were based on defendant\u2019s supervision and direction of the boys in matters unrelated to sports or alcohol consumption. The ten boys gave similar accounts of that conduct. Defendant would approach a player individually by speaking to him after practice, while giving him a ride, at his home, on the tennis court or on a field-trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Defendant would begin a conversation about \u201cbehaving\u201d by asking the boy about alcohol and drugs and moving on to inquire about the boy\u2019s sexual behavior. He would ask whether the boy had a girlfriend and question him about the extent of their sexual activity. He cautioned about unplanned pregnancy and the impact it would have on the boy\u2019s life, asked if the boy understood how pregnancy occurred and knew how to avoid it, and he encouraged abstinence. Defendant also directed the boys to reduce the risk of failing to abstain by masturbating, asked if they had done it and how, and instructed them on means and methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">To encourage the practice of that behavior and monitor the boys\u2019 compliance, defendant paid them to send him reports by telephone, instant message or text message. He told the boys the messages were important to him because when he received them he would know they were behaving and not \u201cworry\u201d about them failing to abstain. He gave them directions on how to send reports indicating the duration and quality of the experience and the volume of ejaculate, phrased so that only they would understand. Records of cell phones used by defendant and the boys reflected the frequency of text messages sent by the boys to defendant from April through November 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Defendant also urged the boys to use condoms during masturbation and in the event of failure to remain abstinent. He supplied the condoms, and he directed some of the boys to bring him the used condoms for inspection, which some of them did. When defendant gave condoms to a boy, he directed him not to identify defendant as the source if someone else found them.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Finally, defendant asked some of the boys to video record their masturbation and lent them his camera. Defendant gave the boys <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>various explanations for that suggestion and offered rewards such as money and tickets to professional games. When those who complied gave defendant the tape, he destroyed it in their presence without viewing it, as he had promised he would. Defendant also took the camera on one of the out-of-state trips; there he approached boys and offered to leave his room so the boy could make a recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">When defendant first broached the topic of sexuality with the boys, three of them were younger than sixteen and the others were sixteen or seventeen. Some of the conversations took place outside New Jersey, and in some instances the conversations, texts and supplying of condoms continued after a boy\u2019s eighteenth birthday and after the boy left for college.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Defendant\u2019s supervision of the several victims\u2019 sexual behavior took place during various timeframes. The shortest of the periods was about five months, and the longest was about two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">School authorities were unaware of any problem with defendant\u2019s behavior prior to November 2007. On one occasion prior to November 2007, the athletic director had a conversation with defendant about perceptions of his favoritism toward some of the athletes, but he did not view the situation as one calling for a reprimand. The school required the coaches to take a course on protecting children from abuse by predators, and the athletic director had told them not to meet with students alone or host events that did not include all members of a team.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">At trial, defendant admitted having frank and probing sexual conversations with the boys, but he claimed to have done so only to encourage masturbation as a safe substitute for intercourse and to assure the boys that they were developing normally. He questioned the boys regarding then\u2019 sexuality, and did so persistently at times, solely because he understood how difficult it was for them to discuss the topic with their parents. He denied that the conversations and payments relating to masturbation were motivated by anything other than giving the boys a safe outlet. As defendant explained, \u201cThese were the players that I coached. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>These were the kids that I eared about, the kids that I loved. The kids that I wanted to succeed with their lives____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">On appeal defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">POINT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">DEFENDANT DID NOT FALL UNDER THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF A PERSON HAVING A \u201cLEGAL DUTY\u201d OR THE LEGAL DEFINITION OF SOMEONE WHO \u201cASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY\u201d FOR THE CARE OF THE ALLEGED VICTIMS. THEREFORE, THE PRE-TRIAL, TRIAL, AND POST-VERDICT MOTIONS TO DISMISS ALL COUNTS OF THE INDICTMENT ALLEGING VICTIMS BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND EIGHTEEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED AND THE COUNTS INVOLVING ALLEGED VICTIMS UNDER SIXTEEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THIRD-DEGREE ENDANGERING THE WELFARE OF A CHILD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">POINT II</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">THE TRIAL COURT GAVE INCOMPLETE AND ERRONEOUS JURY CHARGES WITH REGARD TO HOW THE JURY SHOULD DETERMINE WHETHER MR.

Any other person </em>who engages in conduct or who causes harm as described in this subsection to a child under the age of 16 <em>is guilty of a crime of the third degree.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Under this statute, only those having a \u201clegal duty\u201d or who have \u201cassumed responsibility\u201d for the care of the child-victim may be convicted of second-degree endangering. By providing enhanced punishment for those with \u201csupervisory responsibility,\u201d the Legislature accounted for a unique \u201charm,\u201d \u201cthe profound effect on a child when the harm [of endangering] is inflicted by a parental figure in whom the child trusts.\u201d <em>State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 660-61, 628 A.2d 735 (1993); see <em>also State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112, 120, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987). The Legislature\u2019s focus on this harm is evidenced not only by the enhanced punishment but also by the fact that only those who have a legal duty or have assumed responsibility for care of the child may be convicted of endangering the welfare of a child sixteen years of age or older under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. <em>Cf. N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3 (defining a fourth-degree crime that applies to \u201cany person\u201d who abuses a child under the age of eighteen); <em>In re R.B., </em>376 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 467, 870 A.2d 732 (App.Div.) (noting its applicability to children under the age of eighteen), <em>certif. denied, </em>185 <em>N.J. </em>29, 878 A.2d 848 (2005); <em>State v. D.V., </em>348 <em>N.J.Super. </em>107, 113-116, 791 A.2d 304 (App.Div.2002) (discussing prosecutorial discretion to charge under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4a or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Defendant contends that the State\u2019s evidence of his \u201clegal duty for the care of\u2019 or assumption of \u201cresponsibility for the care of\u2019 each victim was inadequate to establish his guilt and that the jury was given a confusing and inadequate instruction on this element of the crime. Either deficiency would require reversal of these convictions. <em>See State v. Denofa, </em>187 <em>N.J. </em>24, 40-41, 898 A.2d 523 (2006) (discussing the State\u2019s obligation to prove material elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>of the crime);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Galloway, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 662, 628 A.2d 735 (reversing on finding the jury instruction \u201cplainly erroneous\u201d and the evidence \u201cnot sufficient\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Both of defendant\u2019s claims require consideration of the meaning of the phrase \u201cassumed responsibility for the care of the child.\u201d In 1992, the Court interpreted that clause of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a in <em>Galloway</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 658-62, 628 A.2d 735. Although the Legislature has amended <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4 on numerous occasions since <em>Galloway, </em>it has not altered the language the Court construed. <em>See L. </em>2001, c. 291, \u00a7 1; <em>L. </em>1998, c. 126, \u00a7 1; L. 1995, c. 109, \u00a7 1. That is persuasive evidence of the Legislature\u2019s agreement with the Court\u2019s interpretation. <em>Quaremba v. Allan, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14-15, 334 A.2d 321 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The Court, concluding that the phrase \u201chas assumed responsibility\u201d could be understood to encompass either temporary or only \u201cmore permanent\u201d arrangements, construed the ambiguity against the State. <em>Galloway, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 658, 628 A.2d 735. Reviewing the legislative history and other statutes addressing abuse and neglect, the Court determined that the phrase captures only \u201cthose who have assumed a general and ongoing responsibility for the care of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661, 628 A.2d 735. Elaborating, the Court explained that the responsibility \u201cmay be legal and formal or it may arise from informal arrangements.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It could be based not only on a parental relationship or legal custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>but also on \u201cless structured relations,\u201d such as cohabitation with a parent of the child. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Most pertinent here, the Court held that the defendant \u201cmust have established a <em>continuing or regular </em>supervisory or caretaker relationship with the child that would justify the harsher penalties of the [second-degree] crime.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). The Court contrasted that type of relationship with that of \u201ca person assuming only temporary, brief, or occasional caretaking functions, such as irregular or infrequent babysitting, [who] would be chargeable with child endangerment in the [third] degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661-62, 628 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">The justification for harsher penalties for those who have assumed responsibility for the care of a child is noted above\u2014\u201cthe particular emotional harm\u201d and its \u201cprofound effect on the child when the harm is inflicted by a parental figure in whom the child trusts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661, 628 A.2d 735. As the Court explained, the \u201cnature and extent of supervisory responsibility\u201d is a factor important to the \u201charm inflicted on children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 628 A.2d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The evidence and available inferences, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, were adequate to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had \u201cassumed responsibility for the care of\u2019 these children when he engaged in conduct endangering their welfare. See <em>State v. Reyes, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>454, 458-59, 236 A.2d 385 (1967). A jury could find that defendant supervised these children, who trusted and admired him, on a regular and continuing basis, over extended periods of time and in matters generally committed to a child\u2019s parents. True, defendant did not live with the children and have the caretaking role that comes with cohabitation. But he extended his \u201csupervisory\u201d authority into their respective homes by: directing them to report their intimate behavior in a manner that only he and they would understand; supplying them with condoms for use as he directed; rewarding compliance with his directions on sexual matters; and speaking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>them when they did not report with the regularity or frequency he directed. Additionally, he counseled them about alcohol and drug use, and he invited them to call him, in lieu of their parents, for a ride if they drank too much. Also, he intervened on behalf of a student who sought his help when his behavior came to the attention of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In short, defendant assumed the role of a regular and primary supervisor in matters particularly suitable for parental oversight and wholly unrelated to performance and behavior on the playing field. The depth of the relationships he established with the children is demonstrated by the fact that several kept in touch with him after reaching the age of majority and graduating from the high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The difficulty with defendant\u2019s conviction lies with the guidance the jurors were given on determining whether he assumed responsibility for the several children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge gave the following instruction on this element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">The fourth element the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant had a legal duty for the care of the child or assumed responsibility for the care of the child. A person having legal duty for the care of a child or who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child includes the following: A natural parent, an adoptive parent, a foster parent, a step-parent, or any other person who has assumed responsibility for the care, custody or control of a child or upon whom there\u2019s a legal duty for such care. A person who has assumed the responsibility for the care of a child includes any person who assumes a general ongoing responsibility for the child and who establishes a continuing or regular supervisory or caretaker relationship with the child----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">As previously noted, under appropriate circumstances, a person who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child may include a teacher, employee, volunteer, whether compensated or uncompensated, of an institution who is responsible for the child\u2019s welfare, and a person who legally or voluntarily assumes the care, custody, maintenance, or support of the child. It can also include any staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>person of an institution regardless of whether or not the person is responsible for the care or supervision of the child, as well as teaching staff members or other employees, whether compensated or uncompensated of a day school. However, it includes only those who assume a general and ongoing responsibility for the child and who halve] established a continuing and fa] regular supervision or caretaking relationship with the child. It does not include one who only assumes a temporary, brief, or occasional caretaking function.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">This instruction clearly provided the jurors with adequate direction on <em>Galloway\u2019s </em>critical distinction between persons who assume \u201cgeneral and ongoing responsibility\u201d for \u201cregular supervision <em>or </em>caretaking\u201d and those who assume \u201ca temporary, brief, or occasional caretaking function.\u201d The difficulty is that the judge also directed the jurors that \u201cunder appropriate circumstances,\u201d a person who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child may include a staff member of a school. The judge did not, however, explain what \u201cthe appropriate circumstances\u201d were and effectively left the legal standard to the judgment of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Although one might conclude that the jurors, considering the instruction as a whole, would understand that defendant, a school employee, could not be found guilty unless he had assumed an ongoing responsibility for the child and established a continuing and regular supervision or caretaking relationship with each child, other portions of the instruction defeat that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The judge gave the jury another instruction that referred to persons denoted by position as \u201ccustodians\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-2 and to persons denoted as \u201cparents or guardians\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21, which was inconsistent with and not limited by reference to the <em>Galloway </em>standard. In defining the harm that would make a child abused or neglected, the judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">The definition of an abused or neglected child includes a person whose parent or guardian commits or allows to be committed an act of sexual abuse against the child. <em>Parent or guardian means any person who has assumed responsibility for the care, custody, or control of the child upon whom there is a legal duty for such care.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">Parent or guardian includes teacher, employee, or volunteer, whether compensated or uncompensated of an institution who is responsible for the child\u2019s welfare and any other staff person of an institution regardless of <em>whether or not the person is responsible for the care or supervision of the </em>child.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>In this context, the definition of parent or guardian also includes teaching staff member or other employee, whether compensated or uncompensated, of a day school as defined in Title 9. Day school means a public or private school which provides general or special educational services to day students in grades kindergarten through 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">With the foregoing instruction, the judge effectively directed the jurors that a school employee, even one without any responsibility for the care of the child, was included in the definition of parent or guardian along with those who have assumed responsibility for the care of a child. The instruction is easily understood as equating school employees with no responsibility for a child with persons who have assumed responsibility for a child. That proposition is clearly inconsistent with <em>Galloway. </em>An incorrect charge on an essential element of a crime is reversible error, <em>State v. Koskovich, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>448, 508, 776 A.2d 144 (2001), and where inconsistent charges, one right and one wrong, are given a reviewing court cannot determine which one the jury followed. <em>State v. Moore, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>420, 432-33, 585 A.2d 864 (1991). That is the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">We would be remiss if we did not identify the likely source of this error. In incorporating this list of actors who may be among those who have assumed responsibility for the care of a child, the judge followed footnote 5 of the Model Charge, which recites a list of persons denoted by position, including employees of institutions with no supervisory responsibility, that is taken from <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-2 and <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.21. That portion of the Model Charge is inconsistent with the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, <em>Galloway </em>and this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Demarest, </em>252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 329, 599 A.2d 937 (App.Div.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">In pertinent part, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">a. Any person having a legal duty for the care of a child or who has assumed responsibility for the care of a child who engages in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child, <em>or who causes the child ham that would make the child an abused or neglected child as defined in R.S.9:6-1, R.S.9:6-S and P.L.1971h c. 119, s.l (C.9:6-8.21) </em>is guilty of a crime of the second degree----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In construing a statute, courts look to its language and follow it without further inquiry when it is clear. <em>State v. Regis, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>439, 447, 32 A.3d 1109 (2011). As we explained in <em>Demurest, </em>\u201c[ajlthough <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a incorporates the provisions of Title 9 to describe the kind of \u2018harm\u2019 to a child required to establish the offense, it does not refer to Title 9 to define the other elements of the offense____\u201d 252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 329, 599 A.2d 937; <em>see also Galloway, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 659, 628 A.2d 735 (noting that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a \u201cspecifies the harm\u201d that \u201cconstitute[s] the abuse or neglect of a child\u201d by specific reference to <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:6-1, -3 and -8.21). The language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a plainly does not incorporate the provisions of Title 9 except with respect to the \u201charm that would make a child abused or neglected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">It is also apparent that any reliance on the list of actors found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-2 would be inconsistent with <em>Galloway. </em>In interpreting the phrase \u201cassumed responsibility for the care of a child,\u201d which the <em>Galloway </em>Court found ambiguous, the Court considered <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-2 and 9:6-8.21. 133 <em>N.J. </em>at 659, 628 A.2d 735. Five years before <em>Galloway </em>was decided, the Legislature added the list of persons denoted by position that is found in footnote 5 of the Model Charge and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-2 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21. <em>L. </em>1987, <em>c. </em>341, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6. Thus, the fact that the Court did not mention the list of persons denoted by position indicates that the Court did not deem the listing pertinent or helpful to the interpretation or future application of this element of second-degree endangering. As Judge Skillman noted in <em>Demurest, </em>there are significant \u201cdifferences in the legislative objectives of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 to -8.73\u201d that militate against broader incorporation of Title 9 in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a. 252 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 330, 599 A.2d 937. Judge Skillman observed that \u201cthe essential objective of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4a is to deter conduct that unjustifiably inflicts or threatens serious harm to others, to rehabilitate offenders and to confine persons when required for public protection.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). But, \u201cthe focus of proceedings under Title 9 is not the culpability of parents\u2019 conduct but rather the protection of children from acts or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>conditions which threaten their welfare.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In a case involving prosecution of a mother for \u201ca long course of sadistic, violent abuse, both physical and mental\u201d of a child in her custody, we rejected defendant\u2019s objection to the adequacy of a jury charge on the harm that makes a child abused. <em>State v. T.C., </em>347 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 223, 789 A.2d 173 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>222, 827 A.2d 289 (2003). The instruction, in part pertinent here, stated: \u201cAbused or neglected child means a child less than eighteen years of age <em>whose parent or guardian, as herein above defined, </em>inflicts upon such child physical injury, by other than accidental means, which causes or creates a substantial risk of protracted impairment of physical or emotional health.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239-40, 789 A.2d 173. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In <em>T.C., </em>where there was no issue as to legal duty and no claim that the instruction \u201cmisstated the law,\u201d we approved of the trial court\u2019s \u201cquoting and paraphrasing\u201d provisions of Title 9 in describing the harm that makes a child abused or neglected and rejected defendant\u2019s claim that \u201ca specifically tailored instruction relating the facts of the case to the applicable law\u201d was required. <em>Id. </em>at 240, 789 A.2d 173. <em>T.C. </em>does not endorse a jury instruction that would suggest a person who had no responsibility or legal duty for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the care of a child may be convicted of second-degree endangering because the person holds a position that is among those included in the broad definition of parent or guardian currently set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We urge the Supreme Court\u2019s Committee on Model Criminal Jury Charges to reconsider the guidance provided in footnote 5 of the Model Charge. As it stands, this footnote has the potential to invite instructions that are confusing to the jury and have the capacity to distract them from the central inquiry as defined in <em>Galloway. </em>We suggest the Committee also consider adding a footnote cautioning against incorporation of Title 9\u2019s definitions of parent or guardian or custodian in explaining the harm that makes a child abused or neglected.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Where the evidence of ongoing and continuous responsibility is supervisory in nature, rather than custodial, additional guidance may be drawn from <em>State v. Buscham, </em>360 <em>N.J.Super. </em>346, 360, 823 A.2d 71 (App.Div.2003), a case enumerating factors pertinent to the question of whether a gymnastics instructor had the \u201csupervisory or disciplinary power\u201d over a student essential to his conviction for sexual assault as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(2)(b). The considerations under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:24-4a focus more on the dependence and trust the child places in the adult than on the coercive aspects of the relationship defined as \u201csupervisory or disciplinary power\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2a(2)(b). Nevertheless, there is some overlap. Thus, factors such as disparity in ages or maturity; the importance of the activity the adult supervises to the child; and the extension of the supervisory relationship beyond \u201cguidance and advice\u201d expected given the defendant\u2019s supervisory role, all are relevant to an assessment of whether defendant assumed ongoing and continuing responsibility for the care of the child through a \u201ccontinuing or regular supervisory\u201d relationship. <em>See Galloway, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 661, 628 A.2d 735. The jurors did not have that guidance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The \u201cclear and correct jury instructions [that] are essential to a fair trial\u201d were not given here. <em>State v. N.I., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>299, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>308, 793 A.2d 760 (App.Div.2002). Accordingly, we remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Our determination that error in the jury instruction requires reversal makes it unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s claims of trial and sentencing error raised in Points III, V, VI, VIII, IX and X. We add the following with respect to defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of evidence of acts and conversations that took place outside New Jersey and with a child over the age of eighteen at the time. In admitting that evidence, the trial judge relied on the common law doctrine of res gestae. Subsequent to this trial, the Supreme Court disapproved reliance on that doctrine and set forth a new framework for admission of evidence about conduct not charged in the indictment. <em>State v. Rose, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>141, 179-84, 19 A.3d 985 (2011). Rather than address the application of <em>Rose </em>to these facts in the first instance, we direct the trial court to reconsider the admissibility of this evidence in light of <em>Rose.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\n<em>IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The only other point upon which we comment is defendant\u2019s contention that the endangering statute, \u201cas written and as applied, is unconstitutionally vague____\u201d This claim lacks sufficient merit to warrant discussion beyond the brief comments that follow. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">A general claim that a statute is vague as written, a facial challenge, may be voided if it is \u201c \u2018impermissibly vague in all its applieation[s],\u2019 that is, there is no conduct that it proscribes with sufficient certainty.\u201d <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 593, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985) (quoting <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>489, 495, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1186, 1191, 71 L.Ed.2d 362, 369 (1982)). We rejected a facial challenge to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a in <em>State v. M.L., </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>13, 30, 600 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>1211 (App.Div.1991), and see no basis for reaching a different conclusion at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>\u201cA </em>statute that is challenged as applied ... must be shown to be unclear in the context of the particular case.\u201d <em>Cameron, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 594, 498 A.2d 1217. Here there is no question that defendant\u2019s encouragement of boys to accept payment for reporting on sexual behavior directed by him was conduct clearly falling within the statute as conduct that would debauch their morals. Additionally, his assumption of ongoing and continuing supervision of their sexual acts in this manner clearly brings him within the class of persons eligible for conviction of second-degree endangering.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\"> The indictment included two additional counts charging second-degree endangering.

Neither the phrase defining the relationship between adult and child warranting additional punishment nor the phrase that defines the harm of abuse and neglect by reference to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>9:6-1, -6.3 and -8.21 has been amended since 1979. <em>Compare NJ.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a <em>with L. </em>1979, <em>c. </em>178, \u00a7 46. Indeed, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a still refers to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21 as adopted ini. 1974, <em>c. </em>119.
