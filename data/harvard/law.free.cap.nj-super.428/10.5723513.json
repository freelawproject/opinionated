Plaintiff Shanita D. Suarez enrolled in its diagnostic medical ultrasound technician (DMUT) program after an admissions representative told her that upon graduation, she would be able to perform ultrasounds on patients in hospitals and clinics and earn $65,000 per year. In this lawsuit, alleging violations of the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -195, and common law fraud, she contends that these representations were false. She alleges that, to obtain employment in this field, it was necessary to obtain ARDMS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> certification. Because Micro Tech lacked necessary accreditation, she was not eligible upon graduation to take the examination administered by ARDMS to obtain the certification required by potential employers. She contends that, as a practical matter, she cannot either attain the credentials necessary to be eligible to take the ARDMS examination or obtain employment as an entry level sonographer.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Plaintiff now appeals from an order that granted summary judgment to defendant, dismissing her complaint. Defendant cross-appeals, arguing that plaintiffs CFA claim should have been dismissed as barred under a \u201clearned professional\u201d exemption. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs common law fraud claim, reverse the dismissal of her CFA claim, and reject defendant\u2019s ai\u2019gument that the \u201clearned professional\u201d exemption applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Consistent with the standard applicable to summary judgment motions and our review, we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, giving her the benefit of all favorable inferences in support of her claims. <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c); <em>Parks v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>Rogers, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>491, 494-95, 825 A.2d 1128 (2003); <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Plaintiff left school after tenth grade and got her GED in 1995 when she was seventeen. A lack of daycare for her son thwarted her subsequent effort to obtain training in nursing. She also had to leave a computer training course two months short of completion because she could not afford the financial aid payments. At the time of her deposition, she had five children, ages sixteen, thirteen, ten, and six years old and eight months old, and was earning fifteen dollars per hour as a temporary billing clerk at a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Plaintiff learned of Micro Tech from an advertisement in the New York Post in May 2005. She contacted the school and met with a Mr. Brown, the admissions representative, and Patricia Washington, whom she believed was the dean of the school. She described her first meeting with Brown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">Mr. Brown, he explained to me how the\u2014what the program that I would be graduating, and I would be performing ultrasound after graduation on patients in the hospital and in the clinic. And he told me I needed to take a pre-entrance exam to get into the school. And he told me that once I graduate that I would be making good money and it would make my life different from what it is already before I came in there. And that I would be earning close to 65,000 a year, more than what nurses earn. Because I told him I had previously tried to become a nurse and he said, You would make more money as an ultrasound technologist than a nurse would.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Brown told her the program would last thirty-six months in the evening and twenty-four months in the day. Brown did not tell her about any certification requirements upon graduation or make any representations about obtaining certification. He did not state that Micro Tech guaranteed employment but said there was job placement available.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Plaintiff took the pre-entrance exam that day. She understood the results would dictate whether she could attend the school but was told \u201cnot to worry about it if [she] didn\u2019t do well.\u201d Although plaintiffs math results were \u201ca little underscore,\u201d Washington told plaintiff not to worry about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Plaintiff decided to attend Micro Tech. She applied for financial aid and received a $5,000 grant and $17,000 in loans. Since graduation, she has received deferment of her obligation to repay the loans from Sallie Mae because of her low income.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Plaintiff received a catalog from Micro Tech when she started school. The catalog stated that, upon completion of the program, a student can obtain employment within a hospital or clinical setting as an ultrasound technologist and that the program would emphasize the requirements to obtain ARDMS certification. She asked the dean about ARDMS and was told she did not need to worry about it until after she graduated.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Plaintiff was one of approximately eight students in Micro Tech\u2019s inaugural DMUT class. She attended evening classes, meeting Monday through Thursday from 6:00 to 10:30 p.m., from May 2005 through January 2008. Plaintiff also completed six hundred hours of clinical work, performing ultrasound studies on patients in a lab setting. She received a diploma certificate in June 2008, that stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">Shatma D. Suarez Has successfully completed 2535 hours of Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound Technician At Micro Tech Training Center, Inc. Jersey City, New Jersey On June 18, 2008</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">Plaintiff then started \u201cvigorously\u201d looking for employment. At the end of September 2008, the placement representative at Micro Tech sent her to interview with a woman named Anna at On-Site Imaging (On-Site) in southern New Jersey. Anna told her that as a new graduate, she would have to prove herself by scanning patients and that if she did so satisfactorily until November, she would be hired as a full-time employee and would be scanning various patients near her area as opposed to where she was being sent. Plaintiff did approximately thirty ultrasound scans for On-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Site from September to mid-October 2008. Anna paid her twenty-five to thirty dollars for each test, and ten dollars per hour for travel time from On-Site to the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In the beginning, plaintiff was told the scans she did were fine. After a few weeks, Anna told her there had been complaints about the way she filled out the forms that were turned in to the radiologist. Plaintiff knew one ultrasound was re-done.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">According to plaintiff, Anna told her in mid-October that she did not have any patients for her. At the beginning of November, Anna told plaintiff she had a patient for her to scan that weekend and then, at the last minute, Anna contacted plaintiff and told her she could not send her out on any more patients until plaintiff met with her senior technologist. Plaintiff called him several times but the technologist never returned her calls. Plaintiff contacted Anna to ask if she could meet with someone else. Anna replied that she would get back to her but did not do so. Plaintiff kept calling, and finally, someone from On-Site told her to return the GPS given to her. At the end of January 2009, Anna called plaintiff and told her she could not be responsible for her driving so far from her residence to the locations she sent her to see patients; and that she could not provide plaintiff any more work unless she moved closer to the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">In plaintiffs view, she was never employed by On-Site. She explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t have employment. I never filled out a W-2. It was just promised to me that if I completed X, Y and Z, I would have employment in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Every effort plaintiff made to secure employment thereafter failed because, she was told, she needed ARDMS certification to work as an ultrasound technician. However, to be eligible to take the examination for ARDMS certification, one had to satisfy prerequisites that varied depending upon educational background. A student who graduates from a program accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAA-HEP)<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is eligible to take the examination without any additional clinical ultrasound experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Micro Tech was not accredited by CAAHEP. As a result, its graduates were not eligible to take the ARDMS certification unless they also completed twelve months of full-time clinical ultrasound/vaseular experience. However, without an ARDMS certification, no one was willing to provide plaintiff with the required twelve months of experience.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In his letter report, plaintiffs expert, Fitzgerald Silvera, RT, MS, CRA, provided an explanation for this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">CareCore National, a benefit management company hired by most of the major insurance companies (Aetna, BCBS, Healthnet, United [Hjealth, Oxford and GHI) to either pay for imaging services, pre-autborize examinations or both, [has] unequivocally stated that, \u201cCareCore standards state that all non-certified U/S technologist and non-board certified radiologist, may no longer render sendees to patients whose health plans are clients of Care Core National.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">According to Silvera, an ultrasound services provider that used an uncertified technologist also ran the risk of being barred from the payer network. In addition, the provider could be subject to fines that \u201ccan be severe and may be calculated retroactively at the payer\u2019s discretion.\u201d Silvera noted that \u201c[mjost reputable employers will not take that risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Over the three years she was at Micro Tech, no one told plaintiff about ARDMS requirements or that she would have to obtain twelve months of experience in order to be eligible for the examination. Plaintiff did not know of anyone who went to Micro Tech with her who obtained ARDMS certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Plaintiff denied that she was an \u201centry level sonographer,\u201d stating, \u201cThere\u2019s no facility to hire me as an entry level sonographer. I don\u2019t have experience. Entry level would be at least getting you into the door.\u201d She explained her reason for contacting a lawyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">I felt like I was sold goods that were no good, that I could do nothing with. I paid for something that I couldn\u2019t do anything with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">I can\u2019t do anything with the certificate without ARDMS. And I can\u2019t get an ARDMS license without working for 12 months, and I\u2019ve just been going in one big circle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Plaintiff did not review Micro Tech\u2019s website until after she enrolled and did not read the website entry about the DMUT program until after she graduated. She does not contend that she relied upon the website in deciding to enroll at Micro Tech. However, because the contents of the website are included in the record and were relied upon by the motion judge, we include a pertinent section of them here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\">Objectives: The Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound Technician Program is designed to help students work effectively in a health-care environment. They will learn to perform ultrasound examinations coupled with a basic understanding of patient care in relation to performing their duties as entry-level sonographers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-10\"><em>Emphasis will be placed cm information and techniques necessanj for ARDMS </em>(American Registry of Diagnostic and Medical Sonography).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-11\">There will be a clinical externship where the student spends 600 hours in a clinical ultrasound department or hospital ultrasound department, applying knowledge gained in the didactic section of the program. At the conclusion of the clinical externship, students will receive a diploma in Diagnostic Medical Ultrasound Technician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-12\"><em>Graduates will be ready to enter the health-care field as professionals, </em>responsible for gathering information to aid with patient diagnosis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-13\">\n<em>The students graduating from this program will be prepared to work in a variety of imaging laboratories, hospital and clinics as entry-level sonographers.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-14\">Micro Tech Training Center is committed to the educational and professional enrichment of each student. The curriculum and environment provide an atmosphere in which students can excel and develop competence in their chosen field. The school takes pride in <em>preparing individuals for the workplace. </em>With a hands-on approach to training, students acquire practical, <em>marketable </em>skills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>[ (Emphasis added.) ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The website lists the following \u201cAccreditations &amp; Licenses\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">Accredited by ACCSCT.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">Licensed by New Jersey Dept. of Education.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">Approved for \u201cTitle TV\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by U.S. Dept. of Education</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">In this lawsuit, plaintiff alleges that defendant knowingly omitted material facts, i.e., (1) defendant\u2019s graduates were not eligible to sit for the examination required to obtain ARDMS certification without twelve months of additional full-time experience, (2) graduates of programs accredited by an agency recognized by ARDMS are eligible to sit for the examinations required to receive ARDMS certification, and (3) because they were not eligible for ARDMS certification, graduates of defendant\u2019s DMUT Program would, by and large, not be able to obtain work in their field.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Plaintiff also alleges that defendant made an affirmative misrepresentation, that upon graduation, she would have the qualifications needed to obtain a job as a sonographer in hospitals and clinics.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the complaint should be dismissed because, as a \u201clearned professional,\u201d it fell outside the scope of the CFA. The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s \u201clearned professional\u201d argument on procedural grounds because it had not been pleaded as an affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>defense and defendant had not sought to amend its answer on a timely basis to include that defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Defendant also argued that the alleged misrepresentations were merely hopes and aspirations regarding its curriculum and that plaintiffs reliance upon them was not reasonable. In support of its motion, defendant cited the deposition testimony of its president, Bashir Mohsen, which it described as follows: \u201cto the best of his knowledge, ARDMS certification is not required to obtain employment as an ultrasound technician; nor is ARDMS certification required for a medical provider to obtain insurance payments for ultrasounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The court granted summary judgment to defendant, finding there was no genuine issue of fact that defendant had made any actionable misrepresentation. In doing so, the trial court reviewed the contents of defendant\u2019s website, which plaintiff did not rely upon, elected to rely upon statements made by defendant\u2019s president that conflicted with evidence presented by plaintiff and accepted defendant\u2019s characterization of plaintiffs association with On-Site as proof of her employability despite plaintiffs assertions to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The court reviewed the contents of defendant\u2019s website and concluded, \u201cthere seems to be no dispute that the program enabled Ms. Suarez to obtain employment as a sonographer after her graduation from the program and in that regard, it lived up to its representations.\u201d The court found no affirmative misrepresentation that plaintiff would obtain any certification or qualification that the school could not provide. Rather, the court found, \u201cdefendant never claimed to be certified, they seem to only advise that it sought to teach the students the skills necessary for ARDMS testing and entry level sonography positions.\u201d Therefore, the court reasoned, plaintiff \u201cgot the benefit of her bargain[.J\u201d The court also found no issue of fact as to whether defendant intended to deceive plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The judge noted the president of the school had \u201c[testified] that ARDMS certification isn\u2019t required to get employment as an entry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>level sonographer.\u201d The judge discounted the opinion of plaintiff's expert to the contrary. She described his conclusion \u201cthat an individual in the plaintiffs position faces difficult job prospects\u201d as insufficient to create an issue of fact. Despite plaintiffs insistence that she was not employed by On-Site and was unable to obtain employment because she lacked an ARDMS certification, the court found she \u201cwas employed as a sonographer and could continue to seek work as such.\u201d The judge found further that \u201cthe possibility exists for those in Ms. Suarez\u2019s position to eventually achieve the accreditation\u201d by completing twelve months of clinical experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The court granted summary judgment, dismissing the CFA claim. The court also concluded that dismissal of plaintiffs common law fraud claim was appropriate, concluding that neither the statements on the website nor the statements made by Brown were false or misleading and, further, that she had not relied upon the statements made on the website.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In this appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in dismissing her CFA claim because defendant knowingly omitted material facts and made affirmative misrepresentations to her. She also contends that the trial court erred in holding defendant had not committed common law fraud. Defendant cross-appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in not barring plaintiffs claims pursuant to the \u201clearned professional\u201d exemption to the CFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">In our review of the order granting summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the trial court. <em>Spinks v. Twp. of Clinton, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>465, 473, 955 A.2d 304 (App.Div.2008), <em>certif. denied, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>476, 963 A.2d 845 (2009). Summary judgment is appropriate if the competent evidential materials presented, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, \u201cshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact challenged and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c); <em>see also Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146. \u201cAn issue of fact is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>genuine only if, considering the burden of persuasion at trial, the evidence submitted by the parties on the motion, together with all legitimate inferences therefrom favoring the non-moving party, would require submission of the issue to the trier of fact.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In considering the merits of a summary judgment motion, it is \u201cnot the court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine the outcome but only to decide if a material dispute of fact exist[s].\u201d <em>Gilhooley v. Cnty. of Union, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>533, 545, 753 A.2d 1137 (2000) (citing <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146). \u201cIf there exists a single, unavoidable resolution of the alleged disputed issue of fact, that issue should be considered insufficient to constitute a \u2018genuine\u2019 issue of material fact for purposes of <em>Rule </em>4:46-2.\u201d <em>Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146; <em>Mandel v. UBS/PaineWebber, Inc., </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>55, 71, 860 A.2d 945 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>213, 871 A.2d 91 (2005). However, when there are conflicting versions of the facts that would permit a rational jury to choose either version, the resolution of that conflict requires a determination of which version is more credible. Such a factual dispute should be decided by a jury, not a court, <em>Rowe v. Mazel Thirty, LLC, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>35, 50, 34 A.3d 1248 (2012); and it is improper for the motion judge to \u201cabrogate[ ] the jury\u2019s exclusive role as the factfinder.\u201d <em>Conrad v. Michelle &amp; John, Inc., </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 13, 925 A.2d 54 (App.Div.2007); <em>see also Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146; <em>Singer v. Beach Trading Co., </em>379 <em>N.J.Super. </em>63, 73, 876 A.2d 885 (App.Div.2005); <em>Davin, L.L.C. v. Daham, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super </em>54, 71, 746 A.2d 1034 (App.Div.2000) (conflicting certifications of experts presented a genuine issue of material fact, \u201cprecluding an award of summary judgment and requiring submission of the issue to the ultimate finder of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">In our review, we first determine whether the moving party has demonstrated that there are no genuine disputes as to material facts, and then we decide whether the motion judge\u2019s application of the law was correct. <em>Atl. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hillside </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>Bottling Co., </em>387 <em>N.J.Super. </em>224, 230-31, 903 A.2d 513, (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>104, 912 A.2d 1264 (2006). We review issues of law de novo and accord no deference to the motion judge\u2019s conclusions on issues of law. <em>Zabilowicz v. Kelsey, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>507, 512-13, 984 A.2d 872 (2009). Here, we are satisfied that there were genuine issues of fact as to plaintiffs CFA claim that precluded summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">We briefly address the dismissal of plaintiffs common law fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u201cA misrepresentation amounting to actual legal fraud consists of a material representation of a presently existing or past fact, made with knowledge of its falsity and with the intention that the other party rely thereon, resulting in reliance by that party to his detriment.\u201d <em>Jewish Ctr. of Sussex Cnty. v. Whale, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>619, 624, 432 A.2d 521 (1981). Thus, the five essential elements to a claim of common law fraud are: \u201c(1) a material misrepresentation of a presently existing or past fact; (2) knowledge or belief by the defendant of its falsity; (3) an intention that the other person rely on it; (4) reasonable reliance thereon by the other person; and (5) resulting damages.\u201d <em>Gennari v. Weichert Co. Realtors, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>582, 610, 691 A.2d 350 (1997); <em>Walid v. Yolanda for Irene Couture, Inc., </em>425 <em>N.J.Super. </em>171, 180, 40 A.3d 85 (App.Div.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Since reasonable reliance is a critical element of plaintiffs fraud claim, we narrow our focus to the statement relied upon by plaintiff, Brown\u2019s representations at the initial interview. She asserts that Brown knowingly omitted material facts, i.e., that Micro Tech graduates would not be eligible to take the ARDMS examination and that without ARDMS certification, they would be largely unemployable as diagnostic sonographers. She also contends that he made an affirmative misrepresentation\u2014that upon graduation, she would be performing ultrasounds on patients and making close to $65,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Plaintiff has identified no evidence in the record to establish that Brown knew any statement he made was false. Even assuming he had a duty to disclose the facts regarding ARDMS eligibility and certification, <em>see United Jersey Bank v. Kensey, </em>306 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 558, 704 A.2d 38 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>402, 709 A.2d 795 (1998), there is no evidence he was aware of their materiality and knowingly omitted those facts from his representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">As to the claims of affirmative misrepresentation, plaintiff must show the misrepresentation of a fact that exists at or before the time the representation is made. <em>See Mango v. Pierce-Coombs, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239, 253, 851 A.2d 62 (App.Div. 2004). Hence, neither expressions of opinion, <em>see, e.g., Daibo v. Kirsch, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>580, 589, 720 A.2d 994 (App.Div.1998) (seller\u2019s representation as to value of property is a \u201cmatter of opinion\u201d and \u201cnot usually a basis for a claim of fraud\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)), nor \u201cpuffery,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Trs. of Columbia Univ. v. Jacobsen, </em>53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>574, 148 A.2d 63 (App.Div.)

Brown\u2019s statements regarding plaintiffs potential employment and earning capacity were not statements of present or previously existing facts and therefore cannot provide the basis for a claim based on common law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">We are satisfied that, on this record, the dismissal of plaintiffs common law fraud claim was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">We next consider whether a genuine issue of fact existed as to plaintiffs CFA claim. To recover under the CFA, plaintiff must prove that a person has committed an unlawful practice; that she suffered an \u201cascertainable loss[;]\u201d and that there was a causal relationship between the unlawful conduct and the ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>tamable loss. <em>Gonzalez v.

The criteria for satisfying the elements for each of these categories differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">A violation based on one of the affirmative acts does not require proof that the defendant intended to commit an unlawful act or intended to deceive the plaintiff. <em>Cox v.

The plaintiffs acknowledged that the realtor did not knowingly misrepresent the location of the house but contended that her conduct violated the CFA \u201cbecause she made an affirmative false statement which concerned a matter of considerable consequence in the transaction and on which they relied to their detriment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 894 A.2d 68. The trial court granted summary judgment to the realtor. The court reasoned that since the misstatement was made by omitting the word \u201cTownship\u201d when she described the house as being in \u201cMontville,\u201d the realtor\u2019s error was an omission, which required knowledge, rather than an affirmative misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 133, 894 A.2d 68.

Their reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">In response to Columbia\u2019s suit to seek the balance of his tuition, Jacobsen filed a counterclaim, alleging fraud. <em>Id. </em>at 575-76, 148 A.2d 63. He cobbled together fifty mottos, inscriptions on buildings, quotations from brochures and the like, which, he alleged, falsely represented that Columbia would teach him wisdom, character and similar virtues and qualities. <em>Id. </em>at 576, 148 A.2d 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">We agreed with the trial court that \u201cwisdom is not a subject which can be taught and that no rational person would accept such a claim made by any man or institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579, 148 A.2d 63.

Our recognition that \u201cno rational person would accept\u201d a claim that wisdom and character could be taught comports with the reasoning in cases that declined to find actionable statements that amounted to mere puffery. <em>See, e.g., Rodio v.

The difference between such expressions and statements that may be actionable under the CFA is that they did not thwart the reasonable expectations of the consumer and did not present information in a manner that deprived the consumer of material facts necessary to make an intelligent decision in selecting a product or service to purchase. <em>See Turf Lawnmower Repair, Inc. v.

She asserted that she was virtually unemployable as an entry-level sonographer because she could not, as a practical matter, attain eligibility for the ARDMS examination to obtain the certification required by employers. Her expert supported her version of the facts by explaining that major insurance companies would not reimburse a provider for any service performed by an ultrasound technician not certified by ARDMS. The inability to obtain reimbursement and the risk of sanctions provided ample reason for employers to decline to employ any ultrasound technologist who was not certified by ARDMS.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Defendant\u2019s president presented a contrary view, stating that an ARDMS certification was not required and that plaintiff was indeed employable as an entry-level sonographer.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This conflict required a determination of which was the more credible version, a matter which lies within the jury\u2019s exclusive role as the factfinder. <em>Rowe, supra, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>at 50, 34 A.3d 1248; <em>see also Brill, supra, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>at 540, 666 A.2d 146; <em>Conrad, supra, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 13, 925 A.2d 54. The motion judge therefore erred in weighing the two versions of the facts and finding the facts to be as stated by defendant, denying plaintiff the legitimate inferences to be drawn from the evidence she produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Further, although the judge found no issue of fact as to whether defendant intended to deceive plaintiff, plaintiff was not required to show such intent to support her claim of an affirmative misrepresentation in violation of the CFA. As we have noted, a person who makes an affirmative misrepresentation \u201cis liable even in the absence of knowledge of the falsity of the misrepresentation, negligence, or the intent to deceive.\u201d <em>Gennari, supra, </em>148 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 605, 691 A.2d 350. To support her contention, plaintiff had to present evidence that defendant made a representation regarding a fact material to the transaction, that proved to be false, and was made to induce her to enroll in Micro Tech. <em>See German, supra, </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 535, 672 A.2d 1190. If a jury accepted plaintiffs proofs, it could find the statement that plaintiff would be employable as an entry-level sonographer following completion of the Micro Tech DMUT program was a statement of fact, material to her decision to enroll and made to induce her to do so. The jury could also find, based upon the evidence, that this statement was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In light of the record and applicable legal principles, we are satisfied that the motion judge erred in granting summary judgment to defendant, dismissing plaintiffs CFA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">In its cross-appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in failing to afford it the benefit of the \u201clearned professional\u201d exception to the CFA We disagree, and although the trial court rejected this argument on procedural grounds, we address its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">That \u201cjudicially crafted rule\u201d excludes certain transactions from the purview of the CFA \u201cbecause they involve services provided by learned professionals in their professional capacity.\u201d <em>Lee v. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>199 <em>N.J. </em>251, 263, 971 A.2d 1054 (2009). The reasoning for this exception is that such professionals are subject to regulation specifically applicable to their profession, which might conflict with the regulation of activities under the CFA. <em>Id. </em>at 264, 971 A.2d 1054; <em>Macedo v. Dello Russo, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>340, 344-45, 840 A.2d 238 (2004); <em>see, e.g., Hampton Hosp. v.

It must be convinced that the other source or sources of regulation deal specifically, concretely, and pervasively with the particular activity, implying a legislative intent not to subject parties to multiple regulations that, as applied, will work at cross-purposes. We stress that the conflict must be patent and sharp, and must not simply constitute a mere possibility of incompatibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\"><em>[Lemelledo v. Beneficial Mgmt.

In <em>Finderne Mgmt. Co., Inc. v. Barrett, </em>402 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 955 A.2d 940 (App.Div.2008), we found the \u201clearned professional\u201d exception inapplicable to financial planners, observing that \u201cno regulatory body defines uniform education, testing, or standards governing financial planners or the products they promote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568-69, 955 A.2d 940 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:1-1 to -32 (Professions and Occupations Subject To State Boards Of Registration And Examination)). We found that, in the absence of governmental board or agency regulation, the fact that \u201ccompeting voluntary associations issue designations to those who seek to be called \u2018financial planners,\u2019 \u201d was insufficient to establish them as \u201clearned professionals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 955 A.2d 940. We therefore concluded, \u201cthe lack of uniform regulation of an occupational group defeats its recognition as \u2018learned professionals\u2019 \u201d and exemption from the CFA. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Defendant contends that it is entitled to the \u201clearned professional\u201d exception because it provides post-high school educational and vocational training. It has identified no regulatory body that defines uniform standards for the services it provides or its activities as a for-profit training school, let alone regulation that would present a \u201cpatent and sharp\u201d conflict with the application of the CFA. Certainly, the federal regulations we have reviewed do not present such a conflict. Accordingly, the learned professional exemption is not applicable to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>We are satisfied that any issues not specifically addressed lack sufficient merit to warrant discussion in a written opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).
