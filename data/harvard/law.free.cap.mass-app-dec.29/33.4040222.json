Suffolk Superior Court</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b40-7\">\n<em>Eno, J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ad1\">This is an action of tort or contract by which the plaintiffs seek to recover a deposit of money paid on a purchase and sale agreement of real property. The answer is a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The trial justice made findings of facts in which he found that there was an attachment pending against the property; that the defendants were willing and able to post a bond to discharge the attachment; that the plaintiffs had changed their minds about purchasing the property; that the defendants .could have conveyed the property by a good and sufficient deed; and found for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">The trial justice also allowed all of the plaintiffs\u2019 requests for rulings and their only claim by this report is that the_ finding for the defendant is inconsistent with the granting of their requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">This question cannot be raised in this manner. The plaintiffs should have filed a motion for a new trial or a motion to correct the alleged inconsistency. Then, if the court denied either motion, the plaintiffs could have claimed a report on that ruling and preserved their right to have it reviewed. <em>DiLorenzo v.
