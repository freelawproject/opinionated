Claiming to be aggrieved, a request for a report was duly filed by the plaintiffs. The draft report was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>not filed, however, until <em>June </em>4, 1963, the <em>eleventh </em>day after receipt of notice of the finding. Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the draft report based on the late filing was allowed. To the allowance of this motion the plaintiffs claimed the present report. <em>There was no error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Rule 28 of the Rules of the District Courts requires the filing of the draft report within <em>ten days </em>of receipt of the notice of finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Provisions of statutes and rules of court regulating appellate procedure are construed strictly, <em>Framigletti v.

Cases upholding the dismissal or refusal by appellate .courts to entertain appeals where there has been a failure to comply with the rules of court are collected in an opinion by this court in <em>Allston Supply Co., Inc. v.
