(Presiding) &amp; Conolly, J.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b47-6\">Case tried to <em>Brooks, J. </em>in the First District Court of Eastern Middlesex (Malden).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AEq\">\n<em>Connolly, J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AIq\">This is an action of contract in which the plaintiff, claiming to be a holder in due course of a negotiable trade acceptance, seeks to recover $99.00 together with interest thereon from February 15, 1960. The answer is a general denial, payment, denial that the plaintiff is a holder in due course; that said negotiable trade acceptance was cancelled and that it was void for want of consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The court made the following <em>Rulings </em>and Findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">\u201cDefendants contracted to buy paint from Resinol Products Co., and on October 19, 1959 executed a Trade Acceptance in the amount of $99. O\u2019n or about October 26, plaintiff 'bought from Resinol Co., four accounts of the face value of $1187.25 for which it paid Resinol Co. $653. One of the four items was defendants\u2019 account for $99.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Plaintiff notified defendants of the purchase. Payment of $99 was in due course requested but never made. Defendants alleged that they had never received the goods purchased. There being no evidence to the contrary, I find this allegation to be a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">I find that plaintiff was a purchaser of a bulk transaction not in the regular course of business of the transferror and therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>under G. L. c. 106, Art. 3, \u00a7302, sub-section 3.C was not a holder in due course. The goods in question not having been received by defendants, I rule that there was a failure of consideration and that plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">I grant all plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings except Nos. 9, 14, 17 and 19.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The denied requests for rulings of law of the plaintiff are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">\u201c9. The evidence introduced by the plaintiff is sufficient to warrant the court in finding that the plaintiff paid value for the negotiable trade acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">14. The evidence introduced by the plaintiff is sufficient to warrant the court in finding that the plaintiff is a holder in due course of the full amount of the negotiable trade acceptance.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">17. The evidence introduced by the defendant is insufficient to establish that the plaintiff purchased the negotiable trade acceptance as part of business of the transferor.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">19. The evidence introduced by the defendant is insufficient to warrant the court in finding for the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">The plaintiff claims to be aggrieved by:</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">1. The failure of the court to allow his requests, ##9, 14, 17 and 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">2. The court\u2019s failure to state the facts found or the facts recited which it does not find in connection with plaintiff\u2019s requests, ##9, 14, 17 and 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>3. The finding by the court for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">4. The failure of the court to find for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The first two requests in question, #9 and #14 were proper and it was error to deny them unless, as a matter of law, they were inapplicable, or unless the judge by clear and definite findings demonstrated that they were inapplicable or immaterial because of his findings. <em>Himelfarb v. Novadel Agene Corp., </em>305 Mass. 446-448. Among other findings the trial judge found that the plaintiff was a purchaser of a bulk transaction not in the regular course of business of the transferror and, therefore, under G. L. c. 106, Art. 3, \u00a7302, sub-section (3c) was not a holder in due course. Such a finding renders inapplicable requests #9 and #14.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Request #17 ignores G. L. c. 106, Art. 3, \u00a7302, sub-section (3c) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">\u201cAfter it is shown that a defense exists, a person claiming the rights of a holder in due course has the burden of establishing that he, or some person under whom he claims, is in all respects a holder in due course.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">The phrase \u201cin all respects\u201d clearly includes a bulk transaction of the type in question, and the burden of establishing that it was in the regular course of business of the transferror rested on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Request #19 hardly merits discussion. There was uncontradicted evidence of a failure of .consideration. Since the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>had not established that it was a holder in due course it is difficult to see how the trial judge could have avoided finding for the defendant. There being no prejudicial error the <em>report is dismissed.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b50-5\">Cohen, Gaffin &amp; Greb, of Framingham, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AOj\">Silverstein &amp; O\u2019Neil, of Everett, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
