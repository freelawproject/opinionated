Pelham, for. the alleged negligence of the defendant. Count #2 seeks recovery for the minor plaintiff, Linda A. Pelham, for the alleged negligence of the defendant. Counts #3 and #4 seek recovery for the alleged consequential damage. The defendant\u2019s answer consists of a general denial and allegations of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">A finding was entered for the plaintiff on Counts #1 and #2.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">At the close of trial and before final arguments, the defendant made the following requests for rulings:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">1. The evidence warrants a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">2. The evidence compels a finding for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">Although he first denied both requests, the trial judge subsequently allowed request #1.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-14\">The defendant\u2019s contention is that there was insufficient evidence upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the trial judge could base a finding for the plaintiffs and, therefore, the evidence compelled a finding for the defendant. Its request to that effect, which was denied, is commonly treated as one for a directed finding. Because a request for a directed finding is a request based on all the evidence, such a request is required in the District Court to comply with the rule that it should specify the grounds upon which it is based. <em>Rule </em>27 <em>of the District Courts; Murphy v. Kelley, </em>302 Mass. 390, 392; <em>Mattera \u201cCivil Practice\u201d 3rd Edit. </em>\u00a7874; <em>Okin v. Sullivan, </em>307 Mass. 227, 228.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b67-9\">James A. O\u2019Donovan, of Somerville, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AVB\">Robert J. Ectman, of Boston, for the Defendant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Because the request in question did not specify the grounds upon which it was based, this Division declines to review its denial by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Attention is invited to the instructions contained <em>in </em>\u2014 Forbes <em>v. Gordon </em>&amp; <em>Gerber, Inc., </em>298 Mass. 91 at 94 wherein <em>Lummus, I. </em>said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">\u201cthe correct practice in the District Courts, and in the Superior Court without jury, is to raise the question of law whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding for the plaintiff by a request for a ruling that the evidence would or would not warrant such a finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">\n<em>The report is dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
