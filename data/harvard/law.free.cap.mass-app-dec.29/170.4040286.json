Patronski, </em>304 Mass. 679; <em>Irving v. Bonjorno, </em>327 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>516, 518; <em>Sutherland v. McGee, </em>329 Mass. 530, 532; <em>Menton v. Melvin, </em>330 Mass. 355, 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The defendant filed nine requests for rulings which were all allowed except requests numbered 8 and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The defendant claims to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s rulings on request number 5, and also because the finding for the plaintiff is inconsistent with the general findings of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Said request number 5 was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">\u201c5. Where one person contracts to perform certain services for another, intended to produce a result known to both parties, and the services, though performed, fail to produce the intended result, the services were not performed in a workmanlike and adequate manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">It was allowed by the judge who added the following statement :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">\"However, I do not find that the services performed by the plaintiff failed to accomplish the purpose requested by the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-12\"><em>Since </em>this request was allowed the defendants were not prejudiced thereby, and the only question raised by them therefore is whether there is any inconsistency in the judge\u2019s finding for the plaintiff and his ruling on this request and his other findings of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-13\">The allowance of the ruling in question and the finding for the plaintiff were perfectly consistent. <em>Marquis v. Messier, </em>303 Mass. <em>553, 556.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"b179-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Thomas M. Leahy, of Stoneham, for the Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Azn\">Gregory H. Adamian &amp; John A. Gledhill, of Cambridge, for the Defendants.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">But even if there were an inconsistency in the ruling on this request and the judge\u2019s other findings of facts, the question cannot be raised in this manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The defendants should have filed a motion for a new trial or a motion to .correct the alleged inconsistencies, then, if the court denied either motion, the defendants could have claimed a report on that ruling and preserved their right to have it reviewed by this Division. <em>Raytheon Mfg.
