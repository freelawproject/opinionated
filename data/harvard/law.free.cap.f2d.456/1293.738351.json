We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-23\">The appellant is serving a ten-year sentence for bank robbery imposed on August 6, 1959, in the Eastern District of New York. After serving five years and eight months, he was released on parole, but was retaken for parole violation on May 19, 1969.
