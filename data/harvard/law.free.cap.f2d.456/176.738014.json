The petitioner alleges numerous constitutional defects in the state statute and the court proceeding which resulted in his conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 602.9, for disrupting a school campus. Judgment was rendered sentencing appellee and petitioner to 90 days imprisonment in the county jail and payment of a $600 fine. The appel-lee was admitted to bail pending appeal of the judgment. Appellee thereafter sought relief through the state court system ending with a denial by the California Supreme Court of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. He then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court. On November 20, 1969, the district court ordered a stay of execution and admitted appellee to bail. The petitioner\u2019s federal application for a writ was filed with two days remaining on his state court stay of execution and admission to bail, and the district court\u2019s stay under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (3) was issued \u201conly hours before the expiration of the state stay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\">The first question'raised by the appellant is whether the district court had jurisdiction to grant a writ to a state prisoner who was on bail when the habeas petition was filed. We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-23\">The statute provides that the writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisoner unless \u2014 (in this case),</p>\n<p id=\"b240-24\">\u201c(3) He is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>of the United States; . . \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) (3) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The issue is whether petitioner was \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of the statute, for the purpose of jurisdiction. The early cases interpreted the phrase as meaning actual confinement. In Wales v. Whitney, 114 U.S. 564, 5 S.Ct. 1050, 29 L.Ed. 277 (1885), the petitioner who was a naval officer received a communication from the Secretary of the Navy ordering him to appear before a court martial. The communication concluded with the statement that the officer was 'under arrest. There was no confinement and no custody. The writ was denied and the Supreme Court affirmed saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">\u201cThe writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is not a writ of error, though in some cases in which the court issuing it <em>has </em>appellate power over the court by whose order the petitioner is held in custody, it may be used with the writ of <em>certio-rari </em>for that purpose. In such case, however, as the one before us it is not a writ of error. Its purpose is to enable the court to inquire, first, if the petitioner is restrained of his liberty. If he is not, the court can do nothing but discharge the writ. If there is such restraint, the court can then inquire into the cause of it, and if the alleged cause be unlawful it must then discharge the prisoner.\u201d 114 U.S. at 571, 5 S.Ct. at 1053.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">This case, among others, was relied upon by Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is in Stall-ings v. Splain, 253 U.S. 339, 40 S.Ct. 537, 64 L.Ed. 940 (1920) where the petitioner had been arrested but was admitted to bail. The court pointed out that one who applies for a writ after having been admitted to bail is not entitled to be discharged on habeas corpus. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 40 S.Ct. 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">Although there has been some broadening of the \u201ccustody\u201d concept in recent cases, none has gone so far as the request made here. Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) holds that jursidiction exists to permit a prisoner under consecutive sentences to challenge the second before finishing the first and Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968) sustains a habeas proceeding commenced while the petitioner was in custody although the habeas proceeding is to be concluded following his unconditional release from prison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not find any decision of the Court which has altered the rule of Stallings v. Splain, <em>supra. </em>The situation of the petitioner is to be judged as of the time of the filing of the petition. <em>See </em>Smith v. Campbell, 450 F.2d 829 (9th Cir. 1971). At that time he was not in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">We have followed the same rule in Matysek v. United States, 339 F.2d 389 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 917, 85 S.Ct. 1545, 14 L.Ed.2d 437 (1965), and only recently again in Hen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>sley v. Municipal Court, 453 F.2d 1252 (9th Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">We do not consider the constitutional issues raised. The order granting the writ is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-13\">. Although Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968), overrules McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238 (1934) and rejects a \u201cdoctrinaire approach\u201d to the meaning of \u201ccustody,\u201d it does not cite Wales v. Whitney, 114 U.S. 564, 5 S.Ct. 1050, 29 L.Ed. 277 (1885) or Stallings v. Splain, 253 U.S. 339, 40 S.Ct. 537, 64 L.Ed. 940 (1920), and it does not discuss the rationale of either of those cases. On the contrary, the court in <em>Peyton </em>does discuss \u201cthe prematurity rule of <em>McNally\u201d </em>and comments that \u201cof the prior decisions of this Court cited in <em>McNally, </em>only In re Swan, 150 U.S. 637, 14 S.Ct. 225, 37 L.Ed. 1207 (1893) suggested a rule of prematurity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>391 U.S. at 65 n. 18, 88 S.Ct. at 1555. Both Wales v. Whitney, <em>supra, </em>and Stallings v. Splain, <em>supra, </em>were cited in McNally v. Hill, <em>supra, </em>293 U.S. at 138, 55 S.Ct. 24. It would appear that the Court did not consider <em>Wales </em>or <em>Stallings </em>as exemplifying a \u201cprematurity\u201d rule. On the contrary, the repeated emphasis of the <em>Peyton </em>court is to permit \u201cprisoners\u201d to seek habeas relief at the earliest practicable time. <em>Id. </em>391 U.S. at 64, 88 S.Ct. 1549.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-16\">. We do not consider Settler v. Yakima Tribal Court, 419 F.2d 486, (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 903, 90 S.Ct. 1690, 26 L.Ed.2d 61 (1969) as holding to the contrary. Neither does the modification of <em>Settler </em>which was based upon the enactment of the Indian Civil Rights Bill in 1968. Settler v. Lameer, 419 F.2d 1311 (9th Cir. 1969). Matysek v. United States, 339 F.2d 389 (9th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 917, 85 S.Ct. 1545, 14 L.Ed.2d 437 (1965) was not referred to in either decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
