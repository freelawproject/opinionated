In 1960 Ward filed an unsuccessful action in the Southern District against the railroad (60 Civ. 4949). Thereafter he filed four other unsuccessful actions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the Southern District against the railroad and four other defendants in the present case, namely, the union, Carroll, Trapani and Dr. Daly. In the last two of those actions, 68 Civ. 1094 and 68 Civ. 1686, Judge Wyatt granted summary judgment for the defendants therein and ordered Ward not to \u201ccommence any further actions in this Court against [the defendants] * * * on account of any matter or thing set forth in the complaint in this action.\u201d That order was affirmed by this court (Docket Nos. 33256 and 33257, May 1, 1969); the Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari; and by order dated May 18, 1970, in 68 Civ. 1094, Judge Wyatt reaffirmed his prior order and instructed the clerk of the court to notify plaintiff \u201cthat if there are any further attempts by him to submit such documents for filing, citation to him for contempt of court will issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-15\">To avoid Judge Wyatt\u2019s order Ward filed this action in a state court, joining as defendants the railroad, some of its employees, the union, some individuals connected with it, Dr. Daly, Carroll &amp; Trapani, and the federal defendants referred to above. After removal to the Southern District, all defendants filed motions to dismiss on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-16\">All of those motions were granted, and in each order dismissing one or more of the defendants the district judge who entered the order included a provision enjoining Ward from instituting any further actions against such defendants in any court in the United States on any matter set forth in the complaint in 70 Civ. 5514.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-17\">On October 19, 1971, Ward filed a notice of appeal \u201cfrom the orders of U. S. District Judges Gurfein and McLean opinion June 24, 1971, September 22, 1971, entered herein * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>We have considered the record, the memoranda and the other documents filed in this court by Ward, and have concluded that the judgment orders entered by the district court were proper. The provisions in those orders which restrain Ward from instituting any further action or actions against the defendants or any of them in any court in the United States based on any matter set forth in the complaint in the case which became 70 Civ. 5514 in the district court were justified under the \u201cAll Writs Statute\u201d, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1651(a), because those provisions were necessary to protect and effectuate the judgments of the Southern District referred to above. The appeal from the orders of Judge Gurfein, 328 F.Supp. 1245, was not timely, and is dismissed. The appeal from the order of Judge McLean was timely; that order is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1111-19\">. 67 Civ. 1970, 67 Civ. 2597, 68 Civ. 1094 and 68 Civ. 1686.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1111-21\">. The order of Judge Gurfein dismissing the complaint as against the union defendants was entered on July 20, 1971; his order dismissing the complaint as against the railroad defendants was enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>ed on August 18, 1971; Judge McLean\u2019s order dismissing the complaint as against Carroll <em>&amp; </em>Trapani was entered October 13, 1971. No appeal was taken from the orders of Judge Sugarman, both of which were entered in June 1971.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
