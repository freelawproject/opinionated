At all times here relevant he has resided in St. Croix with this status. During his senior year at St. Croix Central High School he applied to participate in TSF. Eligibility was refused by defendants who are responsible for administering TSF. The sole basis for the refusal was plaintiff\u2019s non-United States citizenry. At trial he contended that such a refusal denied him equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The district court sustained the contention and defendants appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">An alien lawfully residing in the United States is entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See </em>Graham v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 365, 371, 91 S.Ct. 1848, 29 L.Ed.2d 534 (1971); Takahashi v. Fish and Game Comm., 334 U.S. 410, 420, 68 S.Ct. 1138, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>92 L.Ed. 1478 (1948); Truax v. Raich, 239 U.S. 33, 39, 36 S.Ct. 7, 60 L.Ed. 131 (1915). <em>See also </em>Hosier v. Evans, 314 F.Supp. 316, 319-20 (D.V.I.1970). This does not, however, necessarily prevent a particular legislature from excluding aliens residing within its state or territory from realizing certain privileges enjoyed by non-alien residents <em>if </em>the exclusion has \u201ca rational basis and bears a reasonable relationship to the special interest sought to be protected by [such a] legislative enactment.\u201d <em>See </em>Chapman v. Gerard, 341 F.Supp. 1170 (D.V.I. 1970); <em>cf. </em>Graham v. Richardson, <em>supra, </em>403 U.S. at 371, 91 S.Ct. 1848 at 852. As noted by the <em>Graham </em>opinion, though, \u201cclassifications based on alien-age, like those based on nationality or race, are inherently suspect and subject to close judicial scrutiny.\u201d 403 U.S. at 372, 91 S.Ct. at 1852; <em>accord, </em>Takahashi v. Fish &amp; Game Comm., <em>supra, </em>334 U.S. at 420, 68 S.Ct. 1138. The decision in <em>Takahashi </em>cast severe doubt on the continued vitality of the \u201cspecial interest\u201d doctrine in all contexts. <em>See </em>Graham v. Richardson, <em>supra, </em>403 U.S. at 374, 91 S.Ct. 1848. However, it did not explicitly declare consideration of such interests inappropriate to a review of legislation challenged on equal protection grounds. Rather, the Court in <em>Takahashi </em>restricted itself to noting that \u201cthe power of a state to apply its laws exclusively to its alien inhabitants as a class is confined within narrow limits.\u201d 334 U.S. at 420, 68 S.Ct. at 1143. The issue thus remains whether, in light of <em>Takahashi </em>and its progeny, \u201c[t]he interests which appellants assert are prompted by the [challenged] classification either may . . . [be] constitutionally promoted by government or are . . . compelling governmental interests?\u201d <em>See </em>Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 627, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1327, 22 L.Ed.2d 600 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Defendants contend that TSF was created to foster a \u201cpool of qualified citizens, resident within the Virgin Islands, capable of filling Government offices and positions. . . .\u2019\u2019In this regard they stress that the limitation to \u201ccitizens\u201d in awarding TSF assistance is necessitated by \u00a7 29 of the Revised Organic Act of 1954, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-9\">\u201cAll officials of the government of .the Virgin Islands shall be citizens of the United States. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The restriction imposed by \u00a7 29 is not contested. <em>See </em>Heim v. McCall, 239 U.S. 175, 36 S.Ct. 78, 60 L.Ed. 206 (1915). However, as noted by the district court, the legislative scheme of TSF does not suggest that students assisted necessarily will serve only as governmental \u201cofficials.\u201d Those receiving grants are required, as a condition precedent to obtaining assistance, to execute \u201ca proper contract to the effect that [they] will accept <em>employment </em>by the Government of the Virgin Islands . . .\u201d for a time commensurate with the period over which they received benefits. <em>See </em>17 V. I.C. \u00a7 176(a) (emphasis added). \u201cEmployment\u201d is not restricted to serving as a government official, however, and \u00a7 29 applies only to individuals serving in that capacity. The district court found that the Virgin Islands Government employs innumerable aliens in a spectrum of capacities and has announced its intention to expand this policy in certain areas of manpower shortage. Also, it was noted that TSF was intended by the legislature apparently to spawn qualified resident professionals in several specific fields in addition to the Government. Appellants do not challenge these observations. We, therefore, sustain the lower court\u2019s ultimate finding that \u201cthe statutory scheme of exclusion contained in 17 V.I.C. \u00a7 173 [is] arbitrary, invidious and without reasonable nexus to the special interest allegedly sought to be protected and the claimed purpose it was designed to serve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">We do not believe that the constitutional attack leveled against \u00a7 173(1) (a) can be answered by defendants\u2019 argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ment that participation in TSF is a \u201cprivilege\u201d rather than a \u201cright.\u201d <em>See </em>Graham v. Richardson, <em>supra, </em>403 U.S. at 374, 91 S.Ct. 1848; Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. at 627 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1322; Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963); <em>cf. </em>Kirstein v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 309 F.Supp. 184, 187 (E.D.Va. 1970) (14th Amendment applies to post-secondary school \u201ceducational opportunities\u201d). Nor can we sustain the challenged classification on the contention, implicit in defendants\u2019 argument, that TSF assistance is limited to \u201ccitizens\u201d in an effort to preserve the fiscal integrity of the Government and the fund. We note only that, in view of the fact that TSF is a program financed, in part, by the Government, this objective <em>per se </em>cannot necessarily justify the classification sought to be imposed. <em>See </em>17 V.I.C. \u00a7 171; <em>cf. </em>Hosier v. Evans, <em>supra, </em>314 F.Supp. at 320. <em>Compare </em>Griffin v. County Sch. Bd., 377 U.S. 218, 84 S.Ct. 1226, 12 L.Ed.2d 256 (1964) <em>with </em>Crane v. New York, 239 U.S. 195, 36 S. Ct. 85, 60 L.Ed. 218 (1915). <em>See also </em>Graham v. Richardson, <em>supra, </em>403 U.S. at 372-374, 376, 91 S.Ct. 1848. This is not to say, of course, that no conditions precedent can be prescribed to determine eligibility for TSF assistance. To the contrary, as noted by appellants themselves, classification may be acceptable which, according to the particular circumstances, appears \u201cnot palpably arbitrary and . . . reasonably based on a substantial difference or distinction. . \u201d <em>See </em>Clarke v. Redeker, 259 F. Supp. 117, 122 (S.D.Iowa 1966); <em>cf. </em>Booker v. State of Tenn. Bd. of Educ., 240 F.2d 689, 693 (6th Cir. 1957). We conclude only that in the present circumstances the discriminatory condition precedent of United States citizenship appearing in 17 V.I.C. \u00a7 173(1) (a), is not constitutionally sustainable as being \u201crationally related to a legitimate state object or purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
