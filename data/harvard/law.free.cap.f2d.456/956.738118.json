Nacirema Operating Co., Inc. v. Oosting, 330 F.Supp. 1034 (E.D. Va.1971). We reverse because the decision is inconsistent with the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 et seq. (1970), as amplified by its legislative history, and because it is contrary to the decisions of other courts and deputy commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Robert M. Allmond, a longshoreman employed by Nacirema Operating Co., Inc., was severely and permanently injured while working on board a vessel at Norfolk, Virginia. In accordance with the Act, his employer promptly began payment of compensation and medical expenses resulting from the injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These payments continued until Allmond settled an action he had instituted against the shipowner, as permitted by \u00a7 33(a) of the Act. From this settlement, Allmond reimbursed Nacirema for the compensation payments he had received and the medical expenses it had paid on his behalf. He also paid his attorney $37,000 for fee and expenses, leaving a net recovery of approximately $65,000. Because the amount of the settlement of Allmond\u2019s case against the shipowner was less than the present value of his compensation entitlement, he sought deficiency compensation under \u00a7 33(f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1022-14\">At the hearing before the deputy commissioner, the parties agreed that the amount Allmond paid to discharge Naeirema\u2019s lien for past benefits should be deducted from the sum he received on account of his injuries in computing the company\u2019s credit against future compensation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the only issue is whether the phrase in \u00a7 33(f), \u201cthe amount recovered,\u201d means All-mond\u2019s gross recovery less reimbursement for benefits paid, or whether it should be construed as the net proceeds actually received by him after also deducting his reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and expenses. Nacirema presented evidence that it had been impleaded as a third party defendant by the shipowner, it had employed its own counsel, and it had contributed to the settlement as indemnitor of the ship. It contended that since its position in the suit was adverse to Allmond\u2019s, it should not be burdened with his attorney\u2019s fee and expenses. It, therefore, claimed as a credit All-mond\u2019s recovery from his action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>the ship, without deduction of the sum he paid his attorney. Computed in this fashion, Nacirema\u2019s credit against future compensation would approximate $102,000. Allmond asserted that only his net proceeds, after deducting the $37,000 he paid his lawyer, was available as a credit. By his computation the credit would be roughly $65,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">The deputy commissioner agreed with Allmond and credited Nacirema with only the net proceeds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The practical effect of the ruling is that Nacirema must resume compensation payments to Allmond after about 17 years. Under Naeirema\u2019s computation it would have been relieved of payments until the expiration of roughly 27 years. Should All-mond expend the net proceeds he received in his action against the ship at the rate of his weekly compensation entitlement, he will exhaust the sum he received in about 17 years, and under Nacirema\u2019s theory he would be without the benefit of either his settlement or compensation for 10 years.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Nacirema appealed to the district court which accepted the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings of fact, but differed in its interpretation of the Act. The court held that \u201c[t]he statute refers to the amount recovered against [the shipowner], not the sum ultimately received by the employee.\u201d 330 F.Supp. at 1035. Accordingly, it modified the deputy commissioner\u2019s deficiency award by allowing Nacirema the full amount of the settlement, without deduction for attorney\u2019s fee and legal expenses, as a credit toward future payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">The Longshoremen\u2019s Act affords a worker the right to sue the person responsible for his injury if the wrongdoer is neither his employer nor a fellow employee. Since its enactment, the statute has been interpreted to provide that the \u201cemployer . . . remains liable for any amount by which the recovery against the [wrongdoer] falls short of the prescribed compensation.\u201d Chapman v. Hoage, 296 U.S. 526, 528, 56 S.Ct. 333, 334, 80 L.Ed. 370 (1936). Before 1959, acceptance of an award of statutory compensation operated as an assignment to the employer of the cause of action against the person liable for the injury. Amendments to the Act in 1959 allowed a worker to sue after accepting a compensation award, provided he does so within six months.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The amendments, however, were not intended to change the basic concept of the Act, which secures at least the full amount of statutory compensation for the injured worker. The legislative history emphasizes that when a longshoreman sues a wrongdoer, the employer is to be benefited only out of the net proceeds of the recovery.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Section 33(e) provides that when an employer sues the person responsible for injury to the employee, the employer\u2019s legal expenses and attorney\u2019s fee shall be deducted before any part of the recovery is paid to the employee. The Act, however, contains no mention of attorney\u2019s fee and legal expenses when an employee brings the suit. To fill this void, deputy commissioners and courts, both before and after the 1959 amendments, uniformly have held that an employee\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and expenses must be deducted from the amount recovered in an action at law to determine his deficiency award.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These decisions effectively implement the congressional policy of assuring an injured worker at least the statutory compensation to which he would have been entitled had he not brought suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\"> Neither the Act nor the decisions interpreting it create an exception for the stevedore which finds itself adverse to its longshoreman because the shipowner has joined it as a third party defendant. The shipowner\u2019s right to indemnification from the stevedore, sanctioned in 1956,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is of course well known to Congress and the Bureau of Employees\u2019 Compensation. Under settled principles of law, we cannot lightly put aside the agency\u2019s consistent interpretation of the Act by making an exception which neither Congress nor the Bureau recognizes. NLRB v. United Insurance Co., 390 U.S. 254, 260, 88 S.Ct. 988, 19 L.Ed.2d 1083 (1968); Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Nacirema relies on Ballwanz v. Jarka Corp., 382 F.2d 433 (4th Cir. 1967), but that case is inapplicable. There we held that when the amount recovered in an action against the shipowner is distributed, the stevedore is entitled to reimbursement of its equitable lien for medical expenses and compensation already paid without deduction of any part of the longshoreman\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee. Judge Brown has lucidly explained the difference between the allocation of an attorney\u2019s fee in distribution cases, such as <em>Ballwanz, </em>and the computation of the employer\u2019s credit in deficiency cases, such as this. Strachan Shipping Co. v. Melvin, 327 F.2d 83, 86 (5th Cir. 1964) (dissenting opinion). The basic difference is that the <em>Ballwanz </em>rule for distributing a recovery does not deprive a longshoreman of compensation due him under the Act as would acceptance of Nacirema\u2019s attempt to apply this rule in the computation of a deficiency award. Indeed, Allmond faithfully followed the rule when he fully reimbursed Nacirema for its outlay of medical expenses and compensation. <em>Ballwanz </em>is in harmony with every case, save one, which has directed the distribution of recoveries,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and nothing in this opinion trenches on its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the deputy commissioner\u2019s award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 907, 914.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">. Section 33(f) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 933 (f), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-11\">\u201cIf the person entitled to compensation institutes jjroceedings within [six months after an award] the employer shall he required to pay as compensation under this chapter a sum equal to the excess of the amount which the Secretary determines is payable on account of such injury or death over the amount recovered against such third person.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1022-12\">. Section 33(e) of the Act, which governs the distribution of the recovery against a wrongdoer when the employer institutes the action, specifically provides for reimbursement to the employer of all compensation and medical payments that he has advanced. There is no counterpart of this statutory lien in \u00a7 33(f) which deals with an employee\u2019s suit against a wrongdoer. To forestall double recovery by the employee, an equitable lien patterned after the \u00a7 33(e) lien has been judicially imposed on recoveries in suits brought by emjdoyees. <em>See e. g., </em>Fontana v. Pennsylvania R. R., 106 F.Supp. 461, 462 (S.D.N.Y.1952), aff\u2019d sub nom. Fontana v. Grace Line, Inc., 205 F.2d 151 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 346 U.S. 886, 74 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed. 398 (1953).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">. The deputy commissioner stated :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1023-8\">\u201c. . . That as a result of the compromise settlement effected between the claimant and .the third party or parties said to have been responsible for his injury, the claimant has realized the sum of $110,000.00, in addition to the sum of $2,170.00 in compensation paid on account of temporary total disability by the employer and insurance carrier for a gross recovery of $112,-170.00; that the attorney\u2019s fee of $36,-487.33, legal expenses of $538.02, the insurance carrier\u2019s lien for compensation in the amount of $2,170.00 and medical expenses in the amount of $8,123.55 which were incidental to the third-party settlement amount to $47,318.90; that the claimant has netted the amount of $64,851.10 ($112,170.00 less $47,318.-90) which sum is a prepayment of compensation accruing the claimant under this award.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">. Of course, under either the deputy commissioner\u2019s award or Nacirema\u2019s theory of computation, Nacirema\u2019s obligation for future compensation will end if Allmond were to die within 17 years. Moreover, this time is subject to adjustment if All-mond\u2019s injuries require additional medical treatment, or in the unlikely event that he should be restored to health.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">.
