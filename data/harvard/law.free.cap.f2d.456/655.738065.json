Co. v. Newton, 398 F.2d 729 (3d Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-15\">Aetna Insurance Company (Aetna), as insurer for the Lester C. Newton Trucking Co. (Newton) filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that C. F. Schwartz, Inc. (Schwartz) or its insurer Continental Insurance Company (Continental) was liable for amounts paid by Aetna to the Campbell Soup Company as reimbursement for damage to Campbell\u2019s property occurring while in transit. The shipment initiated with Schwartz and was transported through Newton\u2019s I.C.C. territory pursuant to a Master Interchange Agreement existing between Schwartz and Newton. The loss occurred in Newton\u2019s territory and liability therefor essentially turns on what effect is given particular provisions of that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">A previous appeal to this court was dismissed because the district court\u2019s order, 274 F.Supp. 566, failed to dispose of the litigation as to all the parties. At that time the court had granted Aet-na summary judgment against Schwartz. We remanded the proceeding with directions that a decision be made concerning Continental\u2019s responsibility to reimburse Schwartz. The district court, 315 F. Supp. 860, then granted Continental\u2019s motion for summary judgment and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-17\">As noted in our earlier opinion the rights and obligations of the various parties appear to hinge to a large extent on a determination of whether the indemnity provision of the Master Interchange Agreement between Schwartz and Newton was operative on the date when the Campbell shipment was damaged. Indeed, as Schwartz itself concedes, \u201cif Clause 4 C (2) of the . Agreement . . . was in effect on July 27, 1963, [Schwartz] is obligated to pay for the cargo loss.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 2. Clause 4 C (2) provides, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>inter alia, that the initiating carrier (Schwartz) shall \u201c[ijndemnify and save harmless the receiving carrier (Newton) against any claim by whomsoever filed . for loss or damage to any shipment. ...\u201d Schwartz sought to introduce parol evidence suggesting that both parties to the agreement understood that effectuation of clause 4 C (2) was to be delayed pending assurance from Continental that any loss suffered by Schwartz pursuant to the agreement would be insured. The district court ruled that this evidence would be inadmissible, saying that such contradiction of the otherwise clear terms of the agreement which made clause 4 C (2) effective as of the date of signature would violate the parol evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Schwartz contends that the district court\u2019s parol evidence ruling was erroneous. Its position is that the condition precedent exception to the parol evidence rule permits proof that effectuation of \u201cclause 4 C (2) of the Master Interchange Agreement was subject to a condition precedent at the time of the loss in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Section 241 of the Restatement of Contracts phrases the condition precedent exception as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\u201cWhere parties to a writing which purports to be an integration of a contract between them orally agree, before or contemporaneously with the making of the writing, that <em>it </em>shall not become binding until a future day or the happening of a future event, the oral agreement is operative <em>if there is nothing in the agreement inconsistent therewith. </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">See also Equitable Trust Co. v. Gallagher, (Del.Super.) 31 Del.Ch. 88, 67 A.2d 50, 55 (1949), aff\u2019d 32 Del.Ch. 401, 77 A.2d 548 (1950). It may be noted that the exception does not purport to authorize parol proof that implementation of only specific provisions of an otherwise integrated agreement was to be deferred. Nor have we been presented with any cases adopting Schwartz\u2019 position under circumstances such as exist in this case. To admit evidence tending to prove that the operation of clause 4 C (2) was subject to a condition precedent while the remaining provisions became effective immediately would ignore the import of other clauses in the agreement. Regardless of Schwartz\u2019 observation that the various provisions \u201ccould have been separately negotiated and separately reduced to writing,\u201d the fact remains that the agreement was a self-contained document. Clause 4 D (5) provides that the Agreement as written constituted \u201cthe entire <em>agreement </em>between the parties.\u201d Clause 4 D (6) provides that the Agreement was \u201cfor a period of one year from the date hereof <em>and shall continue in effect </em>from year to year. ...\u201d The date of the Agreement was April 18, 1963, and the record is clear that both parties treated this as the date when the agreement took effect. To entertain Schwartz\u2019 offer of evidence tending to establish that implementation of clause 4 C (2) alone was referred is to contradict the clear and generalized language of 4 D (6). Since the evidence of such a condition precedent is inadmissible, it follows that clause 4 C (2) did control at the time of the loss. The district court therefore correctly awarded summary judgment to Aetna against Schwartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Having determined that the district court properly found that Schwartz and not Newton was liable to Aetna for amounts it had paid to Campbell, we must now decide whether the trial court properly determined that any amounts which Schwartz pays Aetna will not be recoverable by Schwartz from its insurer Continental. The district court noted that Schwartz\u2019 liability \u201crested solely upon\u201d the Master Interchange Agreement and that \u201cContinental\u2019s obligation to indemnify Schwartz was limited to liabilities of Schwartz arising because of its status as a common carrier or because of its issuance of bills of lading or shipping receipts . . .\u201d The court concluded that \u201c[i]t [could] not be supposed that simply because Schwartz was a common carrier it expected to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>or Continental intended to provide indemnification against any contractual liability with respect to damaged goods which Schwartz saw fit to assume as an incident to its transportation services. . Schwartz\u2019 claim against Continental was beyond the coverage of the policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\"> In general this analysis satisfactorily disposes of Schwartz\u2019 argument concerning Continental. However, one particular contention raised on appeal does deserve separate consideration. Citing the Carmack Amendment, 49 U. S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 319(a), 20(11), 20(12), Schwartz points out that, being the \u201cinitial carrier\u201d of the damaged shipment, it was primarily liable under \u00a7 20(11) \u201cas a common carrier\u201d and, therefore, should recover on its policy with Continental. This argument, however, neglects to consider \u00a7 20(12) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">\u201cThe [initiating] carrier . shall be entitled to recover from the common carrier ... on whose line the loss, damage, or injury shall have been sustained. . . . \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">In effect, this section grants the initial carrier, which pursuant to \u00a7 20(11) has compensated the owner of damaged goods, a cause of action over against the connecting carrier operating in the territory where the particular loss occurred. Had Continental been required to reimburse Schwartz for damages paid to Campbell Soup Company under \u00a7 20(11), paragraph 12 of the Continental-Schwartz insurance policy, providing for subrogation, would have accorded Continental an action over against Newton consequent to \u00a7 20(12). The Master Interchange Agreement precluded this recourse, however. It restricted liability to the initial carrier exclusively. By entering into such an agreement without Continental\u2019s consent Schwartz unilaterally deprived Continental of subrogation rights against Newton which it otherwise would have had. Consequently, Continental is not required to reimburse Schwartz for damages owing to Aetna as Newton\u2019s insurer. See 6 J. Apple-man, Insurance Law &amp; Practice, \u00a7 4093 (1942); 16 G. Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, \u00a7 61.192 (2d ed. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">The orders of the district court awarding summary judgment in favor of Aetna and Continental and against Schwartz will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
