Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418, was decided by the Supreme Court on December 14, 1971, the proper course for the <em>in. banc </em>court was to affirm the orders of the district court without writing opinions, and to leave it to the State of New York to assert possible distinctions by petitions for certiorari. Now that several of my brothers have chosen to dissent in an opinion, I feel obliged to explain my own position.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-13\">I agree with Judge Lumbard that petitions of state prisoners complaining of the time or conditions of their confinement have the same potentialities for exacerbating federal-state relations as petitions attacking the validity of their confinement \u2014 perhaps even more. That federal concern on this score is not limited to challenges to the validity of convictions is evidenced by cases such as Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 251, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868 (1886), from which the exhaustion requirement sprang, and Dye v. Johnson, 338 U.S. 864, 70 S.Ct. 146, 94 L.Ed. 530 (1949), reversing per curiam, 175 F.2d 250 (3 Cir.1949). On the other hand, I cannot accept the conclusion that if such petitions are properly viewed as invoking 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a federal court can require exhaustion of state judicial remedies, if these are available. This is not simply because of the Supreme Court pronouncements which, except for the summary dispositions in Houghton v. Shafer, 392 U.S. 639, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319 (1968) and in Wilwording v. Swenson, were not in state prisoner cases, but because abstention would mean abdication in any case where the state afforded a fair hearing, whether the proper constitutional standards were applied or not. See England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, 375 U.S. 411, 84 S. Ct. 461, 11 L.Ed.2d 440 (1963); Lacka-wanna Police Benevolent Ass\u2019n v. Bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>en, 446 F.2d 52 (2 Cir.1971), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The right answer, it seems to me, is that, under the broad scope the Supreme Court has given to the \u201cGreat Writ\u201d as enacted by the Act of 1867, 14 Stat. 885, all state prisoner petitions complaining of the length or manner of custody, however phrased, are in fact petitions for habeas corpus \u201cin behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court ... on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 243, 83 S.Ct. 373, 9 L.Ed.2d 285 (1963); Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335, 88 S.Ct. 962, 19 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1968); Pey-ton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968); Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L. Ed.2d 718 (1969). If they are, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) forbids a federal court from proceeding in the first instance \u201cunless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, or that there is either an absence of available State corrective process or the existence of circumstances rendering such process ineffective to protect the rights of the prisoner\u201d \u2014 an exception sufficiently broad to enable a federal court to look at' what the state courts actually do. Because of the inapplicability of <em>res ju-dicata </em>in <em>habeas corpus, </em>recognition that such petitions are for that remedy also means that an aggrieved prisoner who has not received satisfaction at the hands of a state court can return to the federal court for a \u201cfinal federal say\u201d concerning the appropriate legal standard, although the federal court will be bound by proper state factual findings. I recognize that a number of cases, including Houghton v. Shafer, <em>supra, </em>and Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F.2d 571 (8 Cir.1968), cited by the Court in <em>Wilwording, </em>have assumed that state prisoner complaints over the conditions of custody come under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) rather than under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. But the issue was not there raised, and the problem of such prisoner applications had not yet reached its present dimensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">If this is the correct analysis, I do not understand how a state prisoner who is entitled to relief by <em>habeas corpus </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 can opt out of that section, with its attendant requirement of exhaustion of state remedies when these are available, simply by styling his petition as one under the Civil Rights Act. But <em>Wilwording </em>seems to indicate that he can. For that reason I am constrained to concur in affirming the orders of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b145-8\">WATERMAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aj-dedup-0\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">I concur in the affirmance of the judgments below and in the opinions of my brothers Smith, Kaufman, Feinberg and Oakes. And see my statement filed in Rodriguez v. McGinnis et al. 451 F.2d 730 at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">J. JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge (concurring);</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">I concur in the affirmance of the judgments below and in the opinions of my brothers Kaufman, Feinberg and Oakes. As indicated in my dissent to the panel opinion in <em>Katzoff, </em>441 F.2d 558, 560, I would not hold that either abstention in deference to the state courts or exhaustion under the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) in <em>habeas corpus </em>actions may bar a prisoner <em>from </em>his choice of a federal forum in a civil rights action. I had thought that this was reasonably plain from McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 668, 672, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963), Damico v. California, 389 U.S. 416, 88 S.Ct. 526, 19 L.Ed.2d 647 (1967), Houghton v. Shafer, 392 U.S. 639, 88 S. Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319 (1968), and our own course in Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2d Cir.1971). Wilword-ing v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418, Dec. 14, 1971, bolsters that view.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">Moreover, I question the desirability of even attempting to lighten our burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>by stifling or delaying prisoners\u2019 complaints of unconstitutional abuse. It may be an onerous burden, especially in the districts where large state prisons are located. Many petitions are poorly prepared, confusing and \u2022 mendacious. They do take the time of busy courts. But these cases now before us demonstrate that among them are some of substance, a circumstance which makes the effort worthwhile. It would be far better to provide more assistance in the districts which contain Attica and the other large institutions giving rise to these issues than to deny redress within the federal court system for deprivation of civil rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">IRVING R. KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge (concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The question which was presented to this court <em>in banc </em>is whether a state prisoner must exhaust state judicial remedies before he can bring an action for equitable relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, where his complaint charges that state prison officials have deprived him of fundamental personal rights. My unwavering answer to that question was that exhaustion is not required. Moreover, I agreed with Chief Judge Friendly that it was appropriate to dispose of these cases without opinions because of the Supreme Court\u2019s clear and unconditional holding in Wilwording v. Swen-son, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed. 2d 418 (1971). Since my brothers have chosen to file opinions explaining their positions, I believe it is necessary for me to state the reasons for the views I hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In <em>Wilwording </em>the Supreme Court instructed that: \u201cState prisoners are not held to any stricter standard of exhaustion than other civil rights plaintiffs.\u201d This pronouncement was based on its decisions beginning with Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183, 81 S.Ct. 473, 482, 5 L. Ed.2d 492 (1961), where the Supreme Court held that the federal remedy provided by \u00a7 1983 \u201cis supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.\u201d <em>See also </em>McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U.S. 668, 83 S. Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963); Dami-co v. California, 389 U.S. 416, 88 S.Ct. 526, 19 L.Ed.2d 647 (1967); Houghton v. Shafer, 392 U.S. 639, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319 (1968). I note also that <em>Wilwording </em>emphasized that the result in no way depended upon the inadequacy of state remedies. Quoting from Houghton v. Shafer, <em>id. </em>at 640, 88 S.Ct. at 2120, it added: \u201cin \u2018any event, resort to these remedies is unnecessary.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">I believe, however, that I should state candidly that I did not construe <em>Wil-wording </em>as a ground breaking decision. The opinion instead indicates that Court\u2019s clear deference to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. See </em>Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. at 192, 81 S.Ct. 473 (Harlan, J\u201e concurring). And it was our adherence to the principles gleaned from the earlier Supreme Court decisions that led us to conclude in our recent <em>in banc </em>decision in Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178, 182 (2d Cir. 1971), that exhaustion of state legal or equitable remedies is not a prerequisite for a state prisoner to maintain a \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">I do not intend to argue with statistics indicating that prisoner petitions are on the rise; nor shall I pretend that this condition is pleasing to judges. But I cannot believe that federal jurisdiction in cases involving prisoner rights is any more offensive to the state than federal jurisdiction in the areas of police procedures for search, arrest and detention, Monroe v. Pape, <em>supra, </em>or education, McNeese v. Board of Education, <em>supra, </em>or welfare, Damico v. California, <em>supra, </em>or public housing, Holmes v. New York City Housing Authority, 398 F.2d 262 (2d Cir.1968). I can think of no reason why the question of prison administration should be classified as one of greater or more peculiar state concern than the instances to which I have just referred. In any event, neither of the grounds articulated is a tolerable basis for declining jurisdiction where a prisoner specifically alleges facts indicating a callous disregard of his basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>human and constitutional rights, <em>see </em>Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), or for reworking accepted principles of federal jurisdiction in one sweep of the judicial pen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wilwording </em>will not lead to the subversion or circumvention of the <em>habeas corpus </em>exhaustion requirement, codified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b), which is concerned with prisoner challenges to the validity of state court convictions or sentences. <em>See </em>Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d at 182. <em>See also </em>Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 419-420, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963); Parker, Limiting the Abuse of Habeas Corpus, 8 F.R.D. 171, 172-173 (1948). Collateral attack on a final state court adjudication is <em>toto c\u00e1elo </em>from an untried constitutional claim unrelated to a prior proceeding. Under these circumstances, I see no basis for radically expanding the impact of \u00a7 2254(b) or, to put it another way, for concluding that Congress intended by that section to carve out an exception to \u00a7 1983 for state prisoners challenging an invasion of their constitutional rights during confinement and stating a valid claim for equitable relief. Indeed, the <em>sua sponte </em>construction by the Supreme Court of Wilwording\u2019s petition as a complaint under \u00a7 1983 clearly articulates that state prisoners alleging deprivation of constitutional rights by prison officials are not forced to mold their claim for relief in the form of a petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>I find it difficult to believe that the Court, specifically confronted with the alternative modes of pleading, overlooked or did not consider fully the interaction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b147-13\">. I fully agree with my brother Friendly, for the reasons stated in his opinion, that abstention would be wholly inappropriate here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-14\">. I agree with the views expressed by my brothers in their separate concurrences with this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b147-6\">FEINBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"aq-dedup-0\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">I agree with Judges Kaufman and Smith that under the authorities there is simply no basis for requiring these state prisoners to exhaust state judicial remedies as a condition to bringing an action for equitable relief under 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 1983. And I further agree with them and with Chief Judge Friendly that application of the abstention doctrine is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Were those my complete views on these cases, I would resist the temptation to add yet another opinion and would simply concur since my brothers have admirably and succinctly covered those issues. However, there is a further point \u2014 perhaps implicit in their opinions \u2014 that I believe should be made. If the already over-burdened federal courts are being overwhelmed by frivolous prisoner petitions, it surely is desirable to find some way of coping with that problem in a manner that is nonetheless fair and just to prisoners, whose claims of mistreatment have too often been ignored in the past. But the correct way to reach that result is not for us to indulge in judicial legislation but for Congress to enact an appropriate statute, which could take into account the conflicting policy considerations and could include compromises, limitations and safeguards that we as a court cannot legislate.</p>\n<author id=\"b147-11\">MANSFIELD, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ao5\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b147-12\">I concur in Judge Friendly\u2019s opinion. I would add that prior to Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418 (U.S.Dec. 14, 1971) (per curiam), my view was that even though there might be cases where a state prisoner\u2019s complaint, purportedly brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983, could not be treated as a petition for <em>habeas corpus, </em>a federal court, upon its finding that the prisoner was seeking equitable relief and was afforded an adequate state court remedy (as here), had the discretionary power as a court of equity to defer ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>tion pending the prisoner\u2019s application to the state court for relief. See Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329, 64 S.Ct. 587, 88 L.Ed. 754 (1944); Alabama v. United States, 304 F.2d 583, 590 (5th Cir.), affd. per curiam, 371 U.S. 37, 83 S.Ct. 145, 9 L.Ed.2d 112 (1962); Pu-gach v. Dollinger, 277 F.2d 739, 742 (2d Cir. <em>en banc </em>1960), affd., 365 U.S. 458, 81 S.Ct. 650, 5 L.Ed.2d 678 (1961). Upon the prisoner\u2019s showing that the state would not offer a reasonably prompt and fair hearing, on the other hand, the federal court would be required to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">The competence of New York state courts to apply federal constitutional principles is not disputed. In most instances their facilities are closer to the state prison in which the prisoner-plaintiff is located (and where regular state court sessions are held) than is the nearest federal court. Furthermore the state court is in a position to insure greater cooperation on the part of essential state personnel (e. <em>g., </em>local and state police, clerks, sheriffs, court reporters and officers of state and county departments) than is the federal court. For example, unless <em>Wilwording </em>is limited, suits for injunctive relief by prisoners of one of New York\u2019s largest institutions, Clinton Prison, Dannemora, Clinton County, must be heard by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, which is located in Albany, 180 miles away. The single federal judge, with only two holding cells and two deputy marshals at his command, will face the necessity of bringing prisoner-plaintiffs and other prisoner-witnesses on a 360-mile round trip in federal custody. By way of contrast, the New York Supreme Court for Clinton County, with no appreciable calendar problem, is equipped to hold court in a nearby county courthouse or in the prison itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The extent to which state prisoners\u2019 <em>habeas corpus </em>petitions have been dressed up in a \u00a7 1983 suit of clothes, often merely with a view to the prisoner\u2019s availing himself of the change of scenery offered by federal facilities, is attested by statistics compiled by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The 1971 Annual Report of its Director reveals (Table 14, 11-48) that from 1968 to 1971 state prisoners\u2019 <em>habeas corpus </em>petition in the United States district courts increased 30%, whereas civil rights suits increased 170%, and that from 1970 to 1971 such <em>habeas corpus </em>petitions declined 7.6%, while such civil rights petitions increased 43.6%.</p>\n<author id=\"b148-7\">OAKES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AT\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">I concur in the affirmance of the judgments below and in the opinions of Judges Smith and Kaufman, agreeing as I do with the original reasoning of Judge Waterman in his dissent in Rodriguez v. McGinnis, 451 F.2d 730 (2d Cir., 1971), and Judge Smith in his dissent in Katzoff v. McGinnis, 441 F.2d 558, 560 (2d Cir. 1971). It is not my impression that the federal courts are being overwhelmed with frivolous prisoners\u2019 petitions \u2014 indeed, many have been highly meritorious. But I agree with Judge Feinberg that if the courts were so burdened, judicial legislation is not the appropriate method of meeting the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">To the extent that the dissenting opinion of Judge Lumbard and the concurring opinions of Chief Judge Friendly and Judge Mansfield make arguments directed to the Congress that warrant further reply, that reply, it seems to me, may more appropriately be made in some place other than a judicial opinion. To the extent that those same opinions imply a request to the Supreme Court to reconsider and overrule its own line of cases sustaining jurisdiction, the most recent of which may be Haines v. Ker-ner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed. 2d 652 (1972), I would simply register my vehement disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">TIMBERS, Circuit Judge, concurs in the opinions of Judges J.

I would reverse the orders of the district courts and remand with directions to stay further proceedings pending a hearing of the claims in the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Prior to Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 418, decided December 14, 1971, I had hoped that these three cases could be resolved, consistent with Supreme Court authority, by a requirement of exhaustion of state remedies as a condition precedent to a cause of action in the federal courts under the Civil Rights Act by a state prisoner seeking equitable relief from allegedly unconstitutional prison conditions or sanctions. <em>Wilwording </em>suggests the contrary, but it dealt with an inmate in a Missouri prison and Missouri apparently makes no provision for hearing such cases in its courts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I still think there is room to hold that a district court in New York \u2014 which does provide an adequate remedy in its courts for the redress of legitimate prisoner complaints <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 should refrain from hearing such a case until the state court has acted thereon, so long as on-going physical brutality is not involved, as it was in Inmates of Attica Correctional Facility v. Rockefeller, decided by this court December 1, 1971, 453 F.2d 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-14\">I am not unmindful that what the Court has said <em>per curicum </em>in <em>Wilwording </em>follows much that was said along the same lines in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), McNeese v. Board of Education, 373 U. S. 668, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963), Damico v. California, 389 U.S. 416, 88 S.Ct. 526, 19 L.Ed.2d 647 (1967), and Houghton v. Shafer, 392 U. S. 639, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319 (1968) . Only in <em>Houghton, </em>however, was the petitioner serving a sentence in a state prison, and it does <em>not </em>appear from the record what, if any, remedies were available to Houghton in the Pennsylvania state court. In any event, the Court did not pass on the considerations which seem to me to compel the conclusion that the federal courts should not hear these cases in the first instance where the state courts are ready, willing and able to give relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-17\">The resolution of differences between inmates and jailers in state prisons is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>peculiarly a matter of state interest and concern. These matters can better be determined by the state court which is nearby and available for immediate resolution of such disputes. For some years justices of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, the highest trial court of general jurisdiction, have held court in courtrooms within the confines of the prisons. Thus the petitioning prisoner and any necessary witnesses can be heard with a minimum of risk and expense. By contrast, a hearing in the federal courts requires that prisoners must be moved considerable distances under circumstances presenting a danger of escape and injury to members of the public, to say nothing of substantial expense to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Recent unrest and dissatisfaction in New York state prisons reached a tragic climax at Attica Correctional Facility where a four-day inmate uprising took a death toll of 11 hostages and 32 inmates. Allowing a state prisoner the choice of being heard in a federal court would seem an obvious means of exacerbating relations between state prisoners and their jailers. Obviously the holding of a hearing at a distant federal court is a far greater interruption of prison life and routine than a hearing inside a state prison by a state judge. Sostre v. McGinnis, 442 F.2d 178 (2d Cir. 1971) <em>(en banc), </em>is a good example of what may frequently be involved in a federal court hearing. That case was tried before Judge Motley in the Southern District of New York during seven days of trial extending from Wednesday, October 29, 1969 to Friday, November 7, 1969. In addition to Sostre, who was brought from Walkill Correctional Facility, Walkill, New York, to testify, two other state prisoners were transported to the hearing from Green Haven Correctional Facility, Stormville, New York. The warden, the food service manager, a doctor, and eleven guards from Green Haven testified. Five guards from Attica Correctional Facility, Attica, New York, testified, as did one from Clinton Correctional Facility, Dannemora, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">If the federal courts must hear these suits and resolve factual issues, it is a clear invitation to state prisoners to frame complaints of alleged mistreatment so that they will, at the least, be afforded some vacation from the tedium of prison life.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">It could hardly have been the intention of the Congress in enacting \u00a7 1983 that it would be the means whereby state prisoners would place state authorities on trial for the manner in which they were cared for and disciplined in state prisons. But there can be no doubt that it is becoming the fashion for state prisoners to bring these suits. The totals for state prisoner civil rights suits commenced in the federal courts of the Second Circuit for the past six fiscal years <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> tell the story\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">1966 21</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">1967 62</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">1968 72</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">1969 138</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-14\">1970 277</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">1971 585</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-16\">All but 38 of the 585 cases filed in 1971 were filed in the four districts of New York. While these totals for state prisoner civil rights suits are still less than those for state prisoner <em>habeas corpus </em>petitions in the Second Circuit, which have risen from 571 to 813 in those same years, it should be borne in mind that a very high percentage of the <em>ha-beas corpus </em>petitions can be, and are, disposed of on the face of the petition or after submission of a paper record. By contrast, a very large percentage of Civil Rights Act cases can be disposed of only after a hearing at which the petitioner and others will be produced as witnesses. In the <em>habeas corpus </em>cases a record has already been inade in the state court, whereas civil rights cases al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ways raise issues which have recently arisen and are wholly undetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">It is now quite clear that state prisoners are turning more and more to the Civil Rights Act to redress their grievances and for therapeutic relief, rather than to <em>habeas corpus. </em>They not only hope to get an earlier hearing but they also expect a vacation from prison confinement. Unless the district courts can, in the exercise of discretion, stay their hands pending determination of suit in those state courts which will hear the cases, the federal courts will find themselves in the business of running and regulating state prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">If the course I propose is followed, certainly it would still be open to the state prisoner to ask the federal court to examine his complaint <em>de novo, </em>upon a showing that the state court hearing had not been a full and fair one. <em>Cf. </em>Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">For the above reasons, I would direct the district courts in the three cases before us to stay action until the state court has passed upon the matters complained of by these state prisoners.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-18\">. <em>See </em>Wilwording v.
