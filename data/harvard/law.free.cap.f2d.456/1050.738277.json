The Board\u2019s decision and order are reported at 188 NLRB No. 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-16\">Huber was employed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, as a carpenter by G. E. Johnson Construction Company which had a collective bargaining agreement, containing a union security clause, with the Union. The complaint charged that the Union caused or attempted to cause the Company to discharge Huber for nonpayment of dues and thereby violated the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. It is alleged that Huber was outside the bargaining unit and that the Union improperly required the payment of certain assessments before it would accept his \u201cperiodic dues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-18\">After a hearing the Trial Examiner held that the Union had wrongfully sought Huber\u2019s discharge because of nonpayment of assessments as well as dues. In overruling the Trial Examiner, the Board found that the General Counsel had not sustained the burden of proving that the Union caused or attempted to cause Huber\u2019s discharge and dismissed the complaint. The Board did not reach the questions of Huber\u2019s inclusion in the unit or the Union\u2019s insistence upon the payment of assessments as well as dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-19\">The facts are adequately and fairly summarized in the Board\u2019s decision and need not be repeated. The Board adopted the Trial Examiner\u2019s credibility resolutions and underlying factual findings. It disagreed with him only on the inferences to be drawn therefrom. It rejected his finding that the Company had sufficiently participated in Huber\u2019s \u201ccessation of work\u201d to result in a \u201ccausing of termination\u201d by the Union, and found nothing to support the conclusion that the Union had directly or indirectly ever requested or demanded that the Company discharge Huber or that the Company ever had in fact discharged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-20\">The evidence is capable of supporting different inferences. It is within the province of the Board to draw a different inference from that of the Trial Examiner even though the finding of the Examiner may not be clearly erroneous. National Labor Relations Board v. Central Machine &amp; Tool Company, 10 Cir., 424 F.2d 542, 543, and Rocky Mountain Natural Gas Company v. National Labor Relations Board, 10 Cir., 326 F.2d 949, 951. We will not disturb a permissible inference drawn by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>the Board from credible and substantial evidence. American Sanitary Products Co. v. National Labor Relations Board, 10 Cir., 382 F.2d 53, 55, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
