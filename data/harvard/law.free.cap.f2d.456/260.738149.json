The shipper sought damages for the destruction by fire of her household goods that were being transported by defendant from Greenville, South Carolina, to Memphis, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">On appeal, the carrier raises the following issues. First, it contends that the shipper was bound by the limitation of value typed into the bill of lading that the shipper signed, which represented the agreement reached by the parties based upon a written estimate the carrier asserts its agent prepared and gave to the shipper two weeks before the move. Second, it contends that the proof-of-loss statement signed by the shipper after the destruction of the goods either released appellant from any liability above that contained in the bill of lading or constituted an accord and satisfaction that had the same effect. Third, it argues that appellee\u2019s evidence of the value of the goods was insufficient to support the court\u2019s determination of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">In a comprehensive memorandum, the district judge made findings of fact in which he credited the shipper\u2019s testimony that she had not been given a copy of the written cost estimate or a copy of the <em>Notice to Shippers of Household Goods </em>required by the Interstate Commerce Commission to be furnished to all prospective shippers of household goods in interstate commerce. He also credited her testimony that appellant\u2019s agent did not adequately advise her concerning her opportunity to choose a valuation for her goods that would represent a limitation on the carrier\u2019s liability, and that the agent had assured her that the rate he suggested would afford her sufficient insurance coverage, which she understood to be supplemental protection to the carrier\u2019s responsibility for the entire loss. The district judge further credited her testimony that defendant\u2019s insurance agent who obtained appellee\u2019s signature on the proof-of-loss form and release after the fire knew that she disputed the valuation he placed on the goods and told her that the release would not affect her claim against the carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\"> In light of these findings, together with the fact that the carrier had typed in the valuation figure on the bill of lading rather than allowing the shipper to write that figure herself as provided in the printed instructions for completion of the document, the court held that the shipper was not bound by this valuation because the carrier had not complied with the requirements of the Carmack Amendment, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20(11), and applicable Interstate Commerce Commission regulations. The court also held that the shipper was not bound by the insurance company\u2019s release that she signed because of the insurance agent\u2019s misrepresentation of its purpose and because of appellee\u2019s lack of intent to surrender her claim against appellant for the entire value of her goods.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the court determined that appellee sufficiently proved the amount of her loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">We recognize that appellee\u2019s version of events was hotly disputed, but we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>review the District Court\u2019s findings <em>de novo. </em>From our review of the record and consideration of the briefs and arguments of the parties, we determine that the findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and we find no error in the conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-10\">. We observe, moreover, that the proof-of-loss form contains a statement purporting to release only the insurance company from further liability, not the carrier. However, the form also contains a provision stating that \u201c[i]n consideration of the payment of the loss herein described, if such payment is made, all right, title and interest of the insured in the property lost or destroyed shall inure and pass to said insurer.\u201d The District Court did not reach the question whether appellee\u2019s signature on this form assigned her claim to the insurance company, and we find it unnecessary to do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
