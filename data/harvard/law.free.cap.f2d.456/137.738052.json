The case is not without its difficulties. The facts were partially set forth in our original opinion, Payne v. SS Tropic Breeze, 1 Cir., 1969, 412 F.2d 707, hereafter <em>Payne </em>I, but they bear some repeating. The TROPIC BREEZE, rigged as a bulk cement carrier, proved incapable of carrying herself, and was libelled by her crew and sold in the District Court of Puerto Rico. The sale date was initially postponed a number of weeks as the result of a stipulation entered into between appellant National Western Life Ins. Co., National, an in-tervenor and holder of a ship\u2019s mortgage, and appellee, Tropical Commerce Corporation, Tropical, an intervenor and alleged owner of the cement loading, bagging and unloading equipment, and all other claimants. The owner defaulted. In <em>Payne </em>I we held that, having had notice of the agreement with the owners under which Tropical could attach, and at the end of the voyage remove the equipment provided it \u201crestored\u201d the vessel, National could not hold the equipment subject to its mortgage. We reversed the district court and remanded the case for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It might have been better if we could have resolved a number of other questions, but as we pointed out, they were not properly presented.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a memorandum and order date, June 21, 1971, the district court has now determined that National, as a result of the stipulation, became obligated to pay off Tropical\u2019s claim for the value of the equipment \u2014 if Tropical in fact owned the equipment\u2014 as against National\u2019s contention that Tropical was limited to claiming against the proceeds of the sale. The court referred to a master the question of the validity of Tropical\u2019s claim to own the equipment, and the value thereof. National appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-14\">The first question is our jurisdiction. Tropical moves to dismiss the appeal on the ground that although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (3) authorizes appeals from interlocutory decrees \u201cdetermining the rights and liabilities of the parties to admiralty, cases in which appeals from final decrees are allowed,\u201d the order in this ease did not sufficiently determine the rights and liabilities of the parties because the court submitted the \u201cmerits\u201d of Tropical\u2019s claim, as well as the issue of valuation, to a master. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>disagree. It is true that the usual interlocutory appeal under section 1292(a) (3) is from an order finally determining that one party is liable to another and referring the cause to an assessor for the determination of damages. <em>E. g. </em>The Maria, 2 Cir., 1933, 67 F.2d 571; United States v. The Lake George, 3 Cir., 1955, 224 F.2d 117, 118; see Texas Co. v. R. O\u2019Brien &amp; Co., 1 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 280. The statute is not limited to such situations, however, but, rather, applies to any decree finally determining the liability of one of the parties, even if it leaves open an issue which may, ultimately preclude recovery by a particular plaintiff. Republic of France v. United States, 5 Cir., 1961, 290 F.2d 395, 397-398, n. 4, cert, denied 369 U.S. 804, 82 S.Ct. 644, 7 L.Ed.2d 550. <em>See also </em>Rice Growers Ass\u2019n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Frode, 9 Cir. 1948, 171 F.2d 662, 663, cert. denied 338 U.S. 878, 70 S.Ct. 159, 94 L.Ed. 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The district court\u2019s order is analogous to the order in <em>Republic of France. </em>Tropical concedes that the order determined finally that National\u2019s liability to the owner of the equipment was not confined to the proceeds of the sale. The court\u2019s opinion expressly states that \u201cNational\u2019s liability is no longer in issue.\u201d The reference to the master of the \u201cmerits\u201d of Tropical\u2019s claims as well as their valuation, must, if the opinion is to be internally consistent, be a reference only of the question of the validity of Tropical\u2019s title to the property at issue, a question which we noted in <em>Payne </em>I, at 709, had not been conclusively determined by the district court. The fact that this question was left open does not mean that the court did not adequately determine rights within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (3), which broadly permits admiralty appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Turning to the merits, the facts of life are that when a vessel is sold by court order the claimants are normally limited in the aggregate to the realized proceeds. <em>See </em>G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, The Law of Admiralty 640-43 (1957). The question is whether the stipulation changed this. In paragraph 1 all parties requested a postponement of the sale. Paragraph 2 stated that this was to enable the court to pass on the proofs and priorities of claims, and possibly to enable National to submit a plan for the continued operation of the vessel (which it did not do). Paragraph 3 suggested a sale date. In paragraph 4 National agreed to deposit in court, forthwith, some $24,000 to cover top priority marshal\u2019s expenses and crew\u2019s wages. Paragraph 5 read as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">5. Intervenor National Western Life Insurance Company hereby agrees to deposit into the Registry of the Court the aggregate amount of all such other claims that the Court may find as having priority over the claim filed, as mortgagee, by said Interve-nor, such deposit to be made within five (5) days after the Court\u2019s determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Paragraph 6 provided that National would be subrogated to the rights of any claimants it paid as a result of the stipulation. Paragraph 7 reserved Tropical\u2019s rights on appeal from that part of the order of sale which contained a ruling that its equipment was subject to the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">It having been determined by us, as a result of the appeal, that as between National and Tropical the mortgage did not apply to the cement equipment, the district court ruled that Tropical\u2019s right to the equipment was a prior claim within the meaning of paragraph 5, even to the extent of disregarding the subrogation provisions in paragraph 6. In this last it could not possibly be right. In ignoring the subrogation provision the court neglected as well that part of its original opinion, that the equipment was subject to maritime liens, that we did not reverse in <em>Payne </em>I. Even as to paragraph 5 the court disregarded Tropical\u2019s, and its own interpretation of the stipulation at the time of the sale. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>It is important to note the sequence of events. To recapitulate, on September 28, 1967, the present parties having been at loggerheads for some time over Tropical\u2019s claim to own the cement equipment free and clear, the court ruled that the equipment was not only subject to its pro rata share of the preferred liens, but that it was subject to National\u2019s mortgage. On November 1, 1967, all claimants entered into the stipulation. On December 18 the sale was held. No outside bidders appeared, and National bid in the vessel for $90,000 something less than the total amount due on its mortgage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearing to confirm the sale, no one objected except Tropical. Its objections were, to quote the court\u2019s memorandum confirming the sale, that National \u201cwas the only bidder, that the purchase price of $90,000 is inadequate, and that there was not enough security should the mortgage ... be disallowed.\u201d In finding the price adequate, the court said nothing about Tropical\u2019s now asserted right to recover under the stipulation regardless of what was realized.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">We have, then, this singular situation. If, as Tropical now contends, National was so anxious to postpone the sale for a few weeks that it had assumed fully not only the unavoidable priority claims, but had also agreed to pay off Tropical in full if, as a result of the appeal, it were held not subject to the mortgage, why did no one mention this at the time, and what possible concern, having a commitment to be paid in any event, could Tropical have had as to the adequacy of the sale\u2019s price? Conversely, what reason could National have had for entering into an open-ended obligation to pay Tropical\u2019s claim in full, which very possibly runs larger than the mortgage itself, unless, at the least, it received some valuable consideration from Tropical in return? In fact, it received nothing of consequence; neither a waiver of Tropical\u2019s appeal, nor even an agreement to acquiesce in whatever price National bid at the sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It seems clear, accordingly, both from the contemporary conduct of the parties, and as a matter of rudimentary business sense, that the TROPIC BREEZE is sought to be turned into a windfall, simply as a result of an afterthought.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Nor does the language of paragraph 5 of the stipulation, \u201call such other claims that the Court may find as having priority over the claim filed, as mortgagee, by said Intervenor, such deposit to be made within five (5) days after the Court\u2019s determination,\u201d support this afterthought. We start with the fact that the court had already determined that Tropical\u2019s claim was subordinate, not prior, to National\u2019s mortgage. More basically, even when we later reversed the district court, we did not hold that Tropical had a \u201cclaim prior\u201d to National\u2019s mortgage. So far as the equipment was concerned there was no question of prior and subordinate; National had no claim at all. Conversely, with respect to the vessel, Tropical had no claim at all. In this circumstance it would be a forced meaning to speak in terms of priority claims. Were it necessary to do this in order to effectuate an apparent understanding of the parties, possibly we might have a question. In the absence of such manifestation no question arises. The court\u2019s finding that paragraph 5 of the stipulation in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>eluded Tropical\u2019s ownership as a \u201cpriority claim\u201d which National assumed was clear error, and must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Tropical, therefore, may recover only from the fund created by the judicial sale. Under the formula recited in <em>Payne </em>I at 709, n. 2, Tropical\u2019s rights cannot exceed the proportion of the sale price that is attributable to the equipment. To reach this amount the court must determine, as of the date of the sale, the fair market value of the vessel, restored, without the equipment (V), and of the vessel with the equipment (V plus E). The difference is the value attributable to the equipment (E). Tropical\u2019s interest in the proceeds is to be measured by the ratio of E to V plus E. National is to pay interest on Tropical\u2019s share from the date of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Tropical may not, however, recover this full amount. National has paid some $48,000 in claims, of one sort or another, under the stipulation. Under paragraph 6, it became subrogated in the rights of the claims it paid. Because of this subrogation clause, the claims are regarded as still extant, although title to them has shifted. The district court should have recognized that to the extent the equipment was subject to these claims a proportionate part of the sale price attributable to the equipment must be paid to National as subrogee.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The traditional admiralty rule is that the vessel itself and all equipment which is \u201can integral part of the vessel and [is] essential to its navigation and operation,\u201d are subject to preferred maritime liens on the vessel. <em>See </em>Turner v. United States, 2 Cir., 1928, 27 F.2d 134; United States v. F/V Sylvester F. Whalen, D.Me., 1963, 217 F.Supp. 916. The Court explained the theory of this rule in The John G. Stevens, 1898, 170 U.S. 113, 122-123, 18 S.Ct. 544, 548, 42 L.Ed. 969:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">\u201cThe offending ship is considered as herself the wrongdoer, and as herself bound to make compensation for the wrong done. The owner of the injured vessel is entitled to proceed in rem against the offender, without regard to the question who may be her owners, or to the division, the nature or the extent of their interests in her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-13\">The cement equipment involved in this case is clearly of the type that is subject to such claims. The TROPIC BREEZE became, with the installation of the equipment, a bulk cement carrier. The equipment was essential to its operation as such a carrier. It could not be removed without substantial cost, and the value of the ship would be substantially less without it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fact that the equipment was owned by Tropical, a time charterer, does not change the result. <em>See </em>Turner v. United States, ante; United States v. F/V Golden Dawn, E. D.N.Y., 1963, 222 F.Supp. 186. <em>See also </em>C.I.T. Corp. v. Oil Screw Peggy, 5 Cir., 1970, 424 F.2d 767.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">On remand, the district court is to determine which of the claims paid by National were of such a nature as to be superior to Tropical\u2019s title to the equipment. <em>Cf. </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 953. National is entitled to recover from the portion of the fund attributable to the equipment that share of the obligations allocable to the equipment which it has paid or assumed, with interest from the dates of payment. The proportion formula, of course, will be the same, E to V plus E.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">The order of the district court is reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-11\">. In a later opinion, Payne v. SS Tropic Breeze, 1 Cir., 1970, 423 F.2d 236, cert, denied sub nom. Samadjopoulos v. National Western Life Ins. Co., 400 U.S. 964, 91 S.Ct. 363, 27 L.Ed.2d 3S3, we passed upon certain preferred claims, not presently involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b202-15\">. The parties did not even call to our attention that the court bad made extensive findings determining the validity of the mortgage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b204-5\">. A clue as to the absence of bidders may be found in the observation in the court\u2019s original memorandum that at the time of the sale Tropical was taking the position (and, as conceded at the present argument before us, openly announcing it) that the sale would not convey good title to the cement equipment. This was wrong, Point Landing, Inc. v. Alabama Dry Dock &amp; Shipbuilding Co., 5 Cir., 1958, 261 F.2d 861, 866; <em>see </em>G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, The Law of Admiralty, ante at 640-42, and a very unsensible act on Tropical\u2019s part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\">. The sale was not a consideration. Tropical had already recognized, prior to the stipulation, the desirability of having an immediate sale of the entire vessel and equipment. This appears in the court\u2019s original memo of September 28, 1967 ordering the sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b205-8\">.
