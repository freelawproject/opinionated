S.C. \u00a7 876 and acquitted him of a third count. The verdict on one count was subsequently set aside. On the remaining count Aboud was sentenced to one year, suspended, with probation for three years. Aboud argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. Our review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the record reveals this contention to be clearly without merit. We do not perceive any abuse of discretion in the refusal of the District Judge to allow Aboud\u2019s counsel to interrogate jurors after the verdict concerning the courtroom incident described <em>infra. </em>The conviction in No. 71-2273 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The appeal in No. 71-2272 of Aboud\u2019s counsel from a fifty dollar fine for contempt of court presents a rather novel situation, to say the least. After the conviction, counsel requested permission of the Court, under its Local Rule, to interview the jurors as to whether they heard Aboud tell the court reporter in a personal comment that he wished he had never learned to write and, if they heard the remark, whether it influenced their verdict. Permission was denied. Mr. Chagra rather persistently protested the ruling and the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I am going to order you not to talk to the jurors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">MR. CHAGRA: The Court is misunderstanding me. I have no intention of talking to the jurors, but I would like in order that I can appeal, I would like to somehow get myself in \u2022 \u2014 I don\u2019t want to go to jail or anything, I would like to get myself in contempt of Court in some way, Your Honor, so that I can appeal it directly. It would take me four or five months. And if the Court is in error, people\u2019s minds change, and this way I can get up there in about fifteen to twenty days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">That\u2019s all I am trying to do. I don\u2019t intend\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">THE COURT: You want me to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">place you in technical contempt and fine you $50 ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">MR. CHAGRA: Yes, Your Honor. I would because I\u2019m telling the Court that I intend to disobey the Court\u2019s order because I think the Court is wrong [in denying permission under the local rule which Mr. Chagra contended was unconstitutional],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">THE COURT: All right. Well, I\u2019m going to fine you $50 and place you in contempt. And you can appeal that conviction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-13\"> On the basis of this record we are convinced that Mr. Chagra was not really in contempt of Court. He had not wilfully and contumaciously violated a Rule of the Court, nor had he any actual intention of doing so. The proceedings reflect a desire to confer jurisdiction on this Court by agreement of the parties. Moreover, there is no actual controversy between the Court and the attorney as to the commission of a contempt. We are thus without jurisdiction to hear this appeal. There must be a real and substantial controversy, North Carolina v. Rice, 404 U.S. 244, 92 S.Ct. 402, 30 L.Ed.2d 413 [December 14, 1971]. Jurisdiction otherwise absent cannot be conferred by consent of the parties, Lee v. Porcelain Patch &amp; Glaze Corporation, 5 Cir., 1957, 240 F.2d 763. Where defects of District Court\u2019s jurisdiction are apparent on the face of the record such defects must be noted by the Court of Appeals, <em>sua sponte, </em>Lang v. Patent Tile Company, 5 Cir., 1954, 216 F.2d 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">The appeal in No. 71-2272 is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b274-17\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b274-18\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc, (Rule 35 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12) the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
