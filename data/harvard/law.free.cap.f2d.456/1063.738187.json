The district court, Judge Denney, after hearing the evidence of the parties, dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies through union contract and statutory grievance procedures, and for reasons of comity inhering in the abstention doctrine. Stradley v. Andersen, 334 F.Supp. 72 (D.Neb.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-10\">In this case, however, the \u201cright alleged is . . . plainly federal in origin and nature, no underlying issue of state law [is] controlling, . . . [n]or is the federal right in any way entangled in a skein of state law that must be untangled before the federal case can proceed.\u201d McNeese v. Board of Educ., 373 U.S. 668, 674, 83 S.Ct. 1433, 1437, 10 L.Ed.2d 622 (1963). The law is well-settled that in such cases the very purpose of \u00a7 1983 precludes forcing a forum choice on the plaintiff by requiring exhaustion of the state\u2019s avenues of litigation. Wilwording v. Swenson, 404 U.S. 249, 92 S.Ct. 407, 409-410, 30 L. Ed.2d 418 (1971); Houghton v. Shafer, 392 U.S. 639, 88 S.Ct. 2119, 20 L.Ed.2d 1319 (1968); Damico v. California, 389 U.S. 416, 88 S.Ct. 526, 19 L.Ed.2d 647 (1967); McNeese v. Board of Educ., <em>supra; </em>Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961). The same reasoning makes it improper to abstain in this case. Wisconsin v. Con-stantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 439, 91 S.Ct. 507, 27 L.Ed.2d 515 (1971). The special circumstances attendant to enjoining a state prosecution are not present here and thus the district court\u2019s reliance on Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971) is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-14\">Reversed and remanded for a trial on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
