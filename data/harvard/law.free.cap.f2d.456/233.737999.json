Appellant, a prisoner at The Tennessee State Penitentiary, seeks damages from the warden of that institution under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming a deprivation of his constitutional rights under color of state law. Specifically, Appellant\u2019s complaint asserts the following grounds for relief: 1) a denial of equal protection in that Appellee and his agents negligently permitted an \u201cinsane\u201d prisoner to roam freely within the prison and allowed said prisoner to have access to dangerous instruments which he used to severely beat and injure Appellant; 2) cruel and unusual punishment in that Appellee and his agents caused Appellant to be placed in solitary confinement for a period of 10 days, solely because he had been beaten by the \u201cinsane\u201d prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-18\">In dismissing the complaint, the District Court ruled that 1) \u201cit is clear that negligence does not constitute a \u2018deprivation of [any] rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u2019 as contemplated by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,\u201d and 2) the decision to place Appellant in solitary confinement does not constitute an \u201cextreme case\u201d warranting judicial intervention into the internal affairs of penal institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-19\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the negligence claim \u2014 although for somewhat different reasons. We believe it is incorrect as a general rule, and misleading in this particular case, to state that the negligent conduct of a person acting under color of state law cannot be the basis for relief under \u00a7 1983. In Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), the Supreme Court expressly re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>jeeted the contention that a plaintiff under R.S. \u00a7 1979 [now 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983] must establish the defendant\u2019s specific intent to deprive the plaintiff of a constitutional right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201cIn the <em>Screws </em>case [Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 89 L.Ed. 1495] we dealt with a statute that imposed criminal penalties for acts \u2018wilfully\u2019 done. We construed that word in its setting to mean the doing of an act with \u2018a specific intent to deprive a person of a federal right.\u2019 325 U.S. at 103, 65 S. Ct. at 1036. We do not think that gloss should be placed on \u00a7 1979 which we have here. The word \u2018wilfully\u2019 does not appear in \u00a7 1979. Moreover, \u00a7 1979 provides a civil remedy, while in the <em>Screws </em>case we dealt with a criminal law challenged on the ground of vagueness. Section 1979 should be read against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his actions.\u201d 365 U.S. at 187, 81 S.Ct. at 484.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In reliance on this ruling by the Supreme Court, numerous courts have recognized that various types of tortious conduct \u2014 including some forms of negligence \u2014 can be the basis for relief under \u00a7 1983. <em>See, e. g., </em>Stringer v. Dilger, 313 F.2d 536, 540-541 (10th Cir. 1963); Joseph v. Rowlen, 402 F.2d 367, 369-370 (7th Cir. 1968); Jenkins v. Averett, 424 F.2d 1228, 1232 (4th Cir. 1970). <em>Cf. </em>Daniels v. Van De Venter, 382 F.2d 29, 31 (10th Cir. 1967); Whirl v. Kern, 407 F.2d 781, 787-789 (5th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 901, 90 S.Ct. 210, 24 L. Ed.2d 177 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">These decisions do not, however, eliminate the requirement under \u00a7 1983 that the plaintiff establish a deprivation of his constitutional rights through the conduct of the defendant. In this respect, we do not believe that Appellant\u2019s claim presents a deprivation of his constitutional rights as a. result of Appellee\u2019s allegedly negligent conduct. The most readily cognizable constitutional infringement under the conduct challenged in the complaint would be a denial of equal protection. We do not believe, however, that the alleged negligence of Appellee in permitting an \u201cinsane\u201d prisoner to roam within the prison and in allowing that prisoner to have access to a dangerous instrument, resulting in injury to another prisoner, constitutes a denial of equal protection cognizable under \u00a7 1983. As noted by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in reviewing a claim virtually identical to that presented here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-9\">\u201cIn order to be actionable under section 1983 [as a denial of equal protection], ... we believe that more than an isolated incident of negligent failure to protect must be alleged.\u201d Williams v. Field, 416 F.2d 483, 485 (9th Cir. 1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">We thus believe that Appellant\u2019s claim based on Appellee\u2019s alleged negligence was properly dismissed by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">As to the claim that Appellant was arbitrarily placed in solitary confinement solely because he was the victim of the \u201cinsane\u201d prisoner\u2019s beating, we are compelled to reverse the District Court\u2019s dismissal in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision (filed after the District Court\u2019s ruling) in Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Haines, an inmate in the Illinois State Penitentiary, sought damages under \u00a7 1983, claiming that he suffered injuries while in disciplinary confinement and that he was denied due process in the steps leading to that confinement. There, as here, the District Court dismissed the complaint because it did not allege \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d warranting judicial intervention into the internal operations of state penitentiaries and because it did not show a deprivation of a constitutional right. The Court of Appeals affirmed, emphasizing the broad discretion afforded to prison officials in disciplinary matters. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the District Court erred in' summarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ruling that the complaint alleged no facts which, if proven, would entitle the plaintiff to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"> Significantly, the <em>Haines </em>case involved a <em>pro se </em>complaint \u2014 as does the present case \u2014 which requires a less stringent reading than one drafted by a lawyer. Thus, although the second claim in Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint does not appear to allege facts to support a finding of cruel and unusual punishment, Appellant must be permitted to introduce evidence of any constitutional deprivation \u2014 particularly the denial of due process \u2014 which would warrant relief under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The judgment of the District Court with respect to Appellant\u2019s claim of arbitrary commitment to solitary confinement is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
