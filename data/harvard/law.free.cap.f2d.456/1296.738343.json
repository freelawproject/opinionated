We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">Appellant was president of a Nevada corporation which encountered difficulties with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the sale of unregistered securities. In a civil action, the district court permanently enjoined appellant and other corporate officers from using the mails to sell corporate stock, unless it was exempted from the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-13\">Nine months later appellant and others were indicted for conspiracy and sale of unregistered stock, and appellant was charged in two counts with offering to sell \u201ccertain [unregistered] securities, to wit, promissory notes . . . \u201d There followed extended delays and pretrial appearances. After a jury had been impaneled, appellant appeared with counsel and agreed with the government to plead guilty to a superseding information charging him in two counts with a violation of the 1968 injunction. The court accepted the plea after a careful inquiry into the voluntariness of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-17\">Appellant now claims that the promissory notes were exempted from registration and that the information failed to charge him with a crime. The district judge denied his \u00a7 2255 application without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-18\">The information stated a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 and Morgan\u2019s plea was a binding admission of all facts alleged therein. See <em>e. g., </em>North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969); Davis v. United States, 347 F.2d 374, 375 (9th Cir. 1965); Thomas v. United States, 290 F.2d 696, 697 (9th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-19\">The order denying the motion to set aside the convictions is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
