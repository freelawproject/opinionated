As it appears in appellant\u2019s application,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the mark is somewhat stylized:</p>\n<p id=\"b850-21\">RIDGID</p>\n<p id=\"b850-22\">[A5654]</p>\n<p id=\"b850-23\">Registration was refused in view of the previously registered mark RIGI-TAPE for measuring tape.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The issue is whether the mark sought to be registered so resembles the previously registered mark as to be likely, when applied to applicant\u2019s goods, to cause confusion, to cause mistake, or to deceive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-24\">Appellant argues that the two marks as applied to the goods do not look or sound sufficiently alike to engender a likelihood of confusion. The board, considering the \u201cobvious substantial similarity\u201d between the marks, held that there would be likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-25\">The prior registration covers goods which are identical to appellant\u2019s tape measures. These tapes clearly flow through the same channels of trade to the same consumers. Considering this factor, as well as the obvious similiarities between the marks, we agree with the board that there is a likelihood of confusion. The decision of the board is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-15\">.
