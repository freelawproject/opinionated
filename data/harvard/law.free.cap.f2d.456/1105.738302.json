At the close of the evidence the district court entered a judgment in favor of the government and the plaintiffs appealed. We affirm the judgment in favor of the United States, although we do not pass on the merits reached by the trial court. We find it patently clear that plaintiffs have failed to plead facts which provide a proper claim for relief against the United States under the Federal Torts Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Plaintiffs originally purchased some cattle from the Producers Livestock Marketing Association of Omaha, Nebraska.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>The cattle were subsequently quarantined by the State of Iowa. Thereafter employees of the United States Department of Agriculture performed certain tests to determine whether the cattle had hoof and mouth disease. Plaintiffs claimed the Department of Agriculture wrongfully ordered these testing samples quarantined and refused to disclose the detailed findings of their laboratory tests. Plaintiffs further al- \u25a0 lege that in giving notice that the cattle were <em>nob </em>diseased, the government misrepresented their true condition. When the result of the government test was issued the State of Iowa lifted its earlier quarantine. Plaintiffs claimed that thereafter they were unable to sell their cattle and because the government report was in fact erroneous, they were prevented from timely treating the diseased cattle. The district court found there was no duty on the part of the defendant to furnish plaintiffs with the contents of those reports,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and held that plaintiffs had failed to prove any breach of duty by government officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">The Federal Torts Claims Act provides an exclusive remedy against the government for tortious wrong. Under \u00a7 2680(h) of the Act it is provided that no recovery may arise from \u201c[a]ny claim arising out of . misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.\u201d Under these circumstances there existed no jurisdictional bases upon which the district court could have entertained plaintiffs\u2019 claim. Hall v. United States, 274 F.2d 69 (10 Cir. 1959). And see discussion and cases in Hubbard v. State, 163 N.W.2d 904 (Iowa 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">Plaintiffs have also asserted damages arising out of their emotional injury from the quarantining of samples taken from the cattle. This type of damage claim fails to establish a cause of action under Iowa law. See Zabron v. Cunard S. S. Co. Ltd., 151 Iowa 345, 131 N.W. 18, 20-21 (1911).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More germane here, however, is that a claim arising out of any \u201cquarantine\u201d is likewise specifically excepted from the Torts Claims Act. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-12\">We think it clear that the government has delineated the areas in which it did not intend to forfeit its immunity from suit and \u00a7 2680 specifically excludes these claims from the court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 1346(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">. The tort claim case was tried to the court concurrently with the jury trial of i&gt;lain-tiffs\u2019 elaim against the Producers Livestock Marketing Association on an alleged breach of implied warranty as to the fitness of the cattle. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant. No appeal is filed from that judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">. In view of our dismissal for lack of jurisdiction it is not necessary to pass on the district court\u2019s finding that plaintiffs were not entitled to the Department of Agriculture reports on the cattle. It has been held that under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, district courts possess the power to compel an agency to produce records. <em>Cf. </em>Wellford v. Hardin, 444 F.2d 21 (4 Cir. 1971), commented on in 85 Harv.L.Rev. 861 (Feb. 1972). However, the Act specifically exempts \u201cinvestigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1170-16\">. Under \u00a7 1346(b), when recovery is not otherwise barred, the liability of the government must be determined \u201cin accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
