His motion for post-conviction relief was denied by the Kentucky Circuit Court without an evidentiary hearing, and this denial was affirmed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Appellant then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court of Kentucky pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The petition alleged the following violations of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-12\">1) at the time of his interrogation by police officers, he was denied the assistance of counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-13\">2) he was subjected to unconstitutional identification procedures and was denied the assistance of counsel during those proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-17\">3) he was denied the effective assistance of counsel prior to and upon the entry of his guilty plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-18\">These allegations, together with appellant\u2019s factual assertions, raised substantial questions whether his guilty plea was a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary act. <em>See </em>McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 770-71 &amp; n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970); Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 796, 90 S. Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970). The District Court, however, dismissed appellant\u2019s petition without holding an evidentiary hearing. Accordingly, at no time since appellant\u2019s plea has he been afforded an evidentiary hearing on these questions, <em>see </em>Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 312-313, 88 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2243, 2254(d). In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to hold an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining the facts and disposing of the matter as law and justice require. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
