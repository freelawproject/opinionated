The first trial resulted in the conviction of Whitlock for a violation of the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2421, the unlawful transportation of a woman in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution. The foundation case was affirmed on appeal. Whitlock v. United States, 10 Cir., 429 F.2d 942. The principal contention of appellant in the case at bar is that the false testimony given during the Mann Act trial was immaterial to the issues of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-17\">It was undisputed in the Mann Act case that Whitlock did transport a woman, known to him to be a prostitute, from Seattle, Washington, to Salt Lake City, Utah and that the woman lived with him after arrival in Salt Lake City for about four weeks. The determinative issue in that case was whether the purpose of such transportation was unlawful. The woman testified that she was carried to Salt Lake for the purpose of prostitution, that she practiced her profession after arriving in Salt Lake, and that she turned over her total income from such practices to Whitlock. Whitlock testified that he brought the woman to Salt Lake for her own convenience, that he came to Salt Lake to be with a sick son, and that he did not participate in her activities after arrival. The trial occurred about a year after the alleged offense and Whitlock\u2019s arrest therefor. He had been free on bond during the interim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-18\">During Whitlock\u2019s cross-examination and over defense objection the prosecutor opened up the subject of Whitlock\u2019s apparent financial affluence at time of trial. In ruling that this general line of inquiry was proper the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1295-19\">THE COURT: Yes. Well, you opened up the question, and you submitted him to cross-examination. And one of the inquiries I think the Government is entitled to make is \u2014 If the fellow is living and spending at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>certain level of affluence and down in the quarters in this town where he says he has worked and is acquainted, the Government is entitled to ask him what he did, how much he made, where did he make it and, if the answers to those questions are not satisfactory, to cross-examine him on those matters. I suppose the Government has some knowledge, and I suppose pretty soon some of this will be tied up. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-4\">The trial court\u2019s ruling allowing inquiry on this subject was manifestly correct for obviously if Whitlock participated in the woman\u2019s Salt Lake income such fact was critical to a determination of his original purpose in transporting the woman from Seattle to Salt Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-5\">Whitlock\u2019s testimony concerning his financial condition may be summarized narratively up to the point of his alleged perjurious answer. He testified that after coming to Salt Lake he was employed as a bartender in an area frequented by prostitutes at a salary of $100 per week; that from his salary he bought some clothes for the alleged victim; that the expensive shoes he was wearing at trial had also been purchased from his bartender\u2019s income; a question concerning the source of income for the three different suits he had worn during the trial days was left unanswered; and then the cross-examination climaxed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-6\">Q How long has it been since you worked ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-7\">A About three weeks ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-8\">Q Do you have a bank account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-9\">A I have fifty dollars in the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-10\">Q How much money do you have with you today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-11\">A I have about two hundred dollars. Q Where did that come from ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-12\">MR. PITLER: Your Honor, is that really material, what is done today, this very moment of time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1296-13\">THE COURT: No, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1296-14\">After the Mann Act jury returned a verdict of guilty Whitlock was taken in custody by the United States Marshal, a deputy marshal, and a special security guard and taken to a lockup near the courtroom. When Whitlock\u2019s pockets were emptied prior to placing him in the lockup he had on his person the sum of $2,179.61.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-15\">An essential element of the crime of perjury is that the testimony alleged to be perjurious must relate to a material issue in the proceeding. Travis v. United States, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 268; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621. For a testimony to be \u201cmaterial\u201d it must be capable of influencing the tribunal on the issue before it. Luna v. Beto, 5 Cir., 395 F.2d 35, cert. denied, 394 U.S. 966, 89 S.Ct. 1310, 22 L.Ed.2d 568. We have no doubt that had Whitlock truthfully answered the key question premising this perjury prosecution, the amount of money he had on his person, that the trial court would have allowed further cross-examination in depth as to the source of the money; nor do we entertain any doubt that an unsatisfactory explanation of the possession of such an amount would be capable of seriously affecting the jury\u2019s consideration of Whitlock\u2019s credibility. We agree with the trial court that the testimony was material and hold that the court did not err in so instructing the jury in the ease at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-16\">We have considered all other appellate contentions presented and determine them to be negatived in fact by the record or to be totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1296-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
