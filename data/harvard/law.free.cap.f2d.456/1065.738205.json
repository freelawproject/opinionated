The sole ground for the writ of habeas corpus was that in the state court Nixon had not received effective assistance from his court-appointed counsel. Upon a complete evidentiary hearing, in which Nixon was represented by counsel and testified, the District Court denied relief. The District Judge found that Nixon was not a credible witness and \u201cis not worthy of belief\u201d, that he had received adequate representation, and that his contentions to the contrary were frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-15\">Upon a review of the record and briefs we perceive no basis for overturning these findings. They are far from clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">The judgment of the District Court denying the writ is</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
