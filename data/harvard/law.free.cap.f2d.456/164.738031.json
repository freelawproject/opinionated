Barber v. United States, 427 F.2d 70 (10th Cir.1970), cert. denied 400 U.S. 867, 91 S.Ct. 108, 27 L.Ed.2d 106 (1970). Barber did not raise the contention there, as he does here, that failure on the part of the trial judge or of his counsel to inform him of his ineligibility for parole prior to his guilty plea rendered that plea involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Barber correctly contends that in those cases where parole is prohibited by statute, the Court must inform a defendant of this fact before accepting a guilty plea, inasmuch as ineligibility for parole is a \u201cconsequence of the plea\u201d. We so held in Jenkins v. United States, 420 F. 2d 433 (10th Cir.1970). The record before us does not indicate that the Court informed Barber of his ineligibility for parole. At issue is whether <em>Jenkins </em>applies retroactively or prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">At the time of Barber\u2019s plea, Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure required only that a plea of guilty shall not be accepted without first determining \u201cthat the plea is made voluntarily and with understanding of the charge\u201d. The rule did not expressly require that such plea shall not be accepted without a prior determination that the defendant further understands \u201cthe consequences of the plea\u201d. The words \u201cthe consequences of the plea\u201d were added with the amendments to Rule 11, effective July 1,1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In McCarthy v. United States, 394 U. S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969), the Court held that a defendant was entitled to plead anew if his guilty plea was accepted without compliance with the stricter requirements of Rule 11, as amended. Later, in Halliday v. United States, 394 U.S. 831, 89 S.Ct. 1498, 23 L.Ed.2d 16 (1969), the Court declined to apply <em>McCarthy </em>retroactively, holding that it applied only to guilty pleas accepted after April 2, 1969, the date that <em>McCarthy </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\"> We accordingly hold that <em>Jenkins, supra </em>shall not be applied retroactively. This determination requires rejection of Barber\u2019s motion to set aside his conviction based solely on his complaint that the district court failed to inform him of his ineligibility for parole. Considering all of the circumstances, we adhere to the rule laid down in Stephens v. United States, 376 F.2d 23 (10th Cir. 1967), cert. denied 389 U.S. 881, 88 S.Ct. 124, 19 L.Ed.2d 176 (1967), that failure by the sentencing judge to fully comply with the strict requirements of Rule 11 is not fatal to the entry of the plea. <em>Jenkins </em>applies only to those guilty pleas made after April 2,1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
