Johnson, Jr., under the conspiracy clause of former Section\u2019 176a, Title 21, U.S.C.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (with Lawrence Lynn Langner named as co-conspirator but not indicted as a defendant) for conspiring to knowingly and with intent to defraud the United States import marijuana contrary to law, between October 28, 1970 and January 6, 1971. Kenneth Johnson was convicted and received a confinement sentence under the indeterminate sentence provision of the Youth Corrections Act, Title 18, U.S.C., Section 5010(b). He brings this appeal claiming that errors occurred below in two respects, invalidating his conviction: (a) the trial court\u2019s overruling of his Motion to Suppress Evidence based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>upon illegal search and seizure and illegal arrest, and (b) the trial court\u2019s denial of his Motion for Severance. We do not find error demonstrated in either particular and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">On January 6, 1971, about 6:30 A.M., Langner, traveling alone, was arrested by U. S. Customs Agents in the inspection area at the International Bridge, Laredo, Texas, when 31 pounds of marijuana was found concealed in the Volkswagen Camper driven by him. He implicated the Johnson brothers of San Antonio, Texas, in a scheme to purchase marijuana in Mexico and import it into the United States. Langner agreed to cooperate with the federal agents. Two agents traveled with him in the Camper to San Antonio, where Langner made telephone arrangements to meet appellant and his brother at a hospital parking lot. Langner proceeded to the rendezvous alone, with federal customs and narcotics agents following in other cars. The agents saw Langner meet the two Johnsons and proceed with them to appellant\u2019s home. There the agents arrested appellant at the driveway entrance from the street, but found no contraband on his person or in his home. The government\u2019s conspiracy case rested primarily upon Langner\u2019s testimony that appellant had furnished $450.00 for expenses of the Mexican trip and for the purchase of marijuana, and also that Johnson had procured the Camper (belonging to a friend\u2019s mother) for use in the importation. Appellant contended below by Motion to Suppress and here that seizure of the marijuana and his warrantless arrest were without probable cause. We think, to the contrary, that ample grounds for Kenneth Johnson\u2019s arrest without a warrant existed at the time he was apprehended. From Langner\u2019s possession of the marijuana and his statement to the officers, from the monitoring of Langner\u2019s telephone call, and from the appearance of the two Johnsons at the parking lot, there were ample reasonable grounds to believe that appellant had been and at the time was violating federal laws dealing with the importation and smuggling of marijuana. Such an arrest by U. S. Customs Agents was authorized by Title 26, U.S. C., Sec. 7607(2). See further, United States v. Simon, 7 Cir. 1969, 409 F.2d 474, 476; Rocha v. United States, 9 Cir. 1968, 387 F.2d 1019; United States v. Santiago, 2 Cir. 1964, 327 F.2d 573; United States v. Smith, 2 Cir. 1962, 308 F.2d 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">We are not sure we understand the appellant\u2019s position as to the search question, but we are confident that no ground for reversal is shown. No objection is made \u2014 nor could one be made \u2014 to the search of Langner and the Camper by U. S. Customs Agents at the inspection area of the International Bridge, and the seizure of 31 pounds of marijuana at that spot. Further and in any case, appellant lacks standing to object to that search. As indicated above, no evidence was seized at the time of Kenneth Johnson\u2019s arrest in San Antonio later in the day. The Motion to Suppress was properly denied for clearly apparent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The point raised as to severance is without merit. The appellant attempts to show that references by witnesses to him and his brother were confused and confusing. Careful reading of the record refutes this completely. Further, he asserts prejudice to him before the jury because his brother William Johnson, Jr. had a prior narcotics record and this was brought out during the testimony of Langner. We quote the explanation of this incident verbatim from the government\u2019s brief on appeal, pages 20 and 21:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">\u201cThis statement by Langner came out in response to a question asked by the attorney for the co-defendant William A. Johnson, Jr. and occurred in the following colloquy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">\u201cQuestion by Roy Barrera, Attorney for William A Johnson, Jr.: All right, now, what I am asking you to do is give us the conversations that took place between you and whoever may have conversed with you at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>time regarding your selection of an attorney to represent you. That is what I would like to have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">\u201cAnswer: My selection of an attorney to represent me. I said I met Mr. Thompson and Mr. Rice. I said: \u2018Oh, you are the officers involved in John\u2019s case from last year.\u2019 They said: \u2018Yes, that is right,\u2019 and I said: \u2018Well, I have heard a lot about you.\u2019 They said: \u2018Well, I imagine so. We know a lot about you, too, as a friend of John\u2019s.\u2019 I think I asked them for a cigarette. They gave it to me. If I remember correctly it was Mr. Thompson that gave me a cigarette. Id. at 664-665.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201cThis is the only reference in the record to a prior case involving co-defendant William A. Johnson, Jr. It was not brought out on direct examination; on the contrary it came out through cross-examination. No objection was interposed at that time by either counsel for the appellant or for the co-defendant. A short recess then occurred for fifteen minutes. Following the recess a conversation occurred at the bench between the court and counsel for appellant, the co-defendant, and government counsel and after some discussion it was only then that appellant reurged his motion for severance. No further statement or evidence was ever elicited nor was any comment made concerning the fact complained of by appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cAppellant asserts that he was prejudiced by the court allowing testimony of the federal agents to show that co-defendant William A. Johnson, Jr. knew the federal agents. Appellant\u2019s Brief at page 20. It should be noted that this evidence was received without objection by appellant or counsel for the co-defendant.\" Id.' at 469-470.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">The judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-11\">. This section was repealed by Public Law 91-513, Title III, \u00a7 1101(a) (2), October 27, 1970, 84 Stat. 1291. The repealing statute by its terms became effective six months after passage, and the repealing act carried a savings provision as to violations occurring prior to the effective date. As may be noted, the violation here charged occurred within both periods.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
