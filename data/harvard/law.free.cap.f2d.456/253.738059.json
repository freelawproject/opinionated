She filed a creditor\u2019s claim against the estate of the maker in a California Probate Court but when the claim was rejected, as it should have been, did not file suit on the rejected claim. It thus became barred forever. Cal.Probate Code \u00a7 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-27\">Appellant then filed an action to \u201cdetermine validity\u201d of the note in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, was unsuccessful, and failed to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-28\">Finally, a complaint was filed in the district court \u201cFor Affirmation of Valid Bearer Note.\u201d The court on its own motion dismissed the complaint and she appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-29\">First of all, there is no jurisdiction asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>and probably could not be, because both parties are citizens of the same state. Neither is any other ground asserted to establish jurisdiction, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) (1). Second, appellant is barred by the doctrine of res ju- \u25a0 dieata, and the note is unenforceable because of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
