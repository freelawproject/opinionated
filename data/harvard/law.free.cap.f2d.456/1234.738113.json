Sometime thereafter the Company\u2019s president received a report from supervisors that some employees were \u201cbadgering and pestering\u201d other employees during working hours to sign Union authorization cards. On October 22, 1970, the Company president wrote a letter to the employees informing them that signing an authorization card might really be casting a vote for the union, giving them detailed instructions on how to get an authorization card back if they had already signed one, and urging them not to sign a card. The letter concluded with the following paragraph;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1299-11\">\u201cFurther, if you are threatened in any way or subjected to constant badgering by union proponents to sign these cards, please report these matters to your Department Head immediately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1299-12\">The Board concluded that in the context of the general anti-union tenor of the letter, the concluding paragraph could reasonably be interpreted by the employees to request the reporting to management of the names of employees who were engaging in persistent union solicitation. The Board required the Company to post a notice stating that it would not \u201crequest any of our employees to inform management about their fellow employees who persistently solicit them to sign a union card.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-13\"> The Company does not appear to contest the proposition that employer requests that employees inform as to other employees\u2019 union activities exert a coercive influence on employees\u2019 organizational rights. <em>See, e. g., </em>NLRB v. Louisiana Mfg. Co., 374 F.2d 696, 700-701 (8th Cir. 1967). Rather, it contends that its letter cannot reasonably be interpreted to make such a request. Thus the question is whether there is substantial evidence on the record to support the Board\u2019s determination that the Company\u2019s letter in fact constituted a request to employees to inform on their fellow employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-14\">The Company contends that its letter must be interpreted as referring only to threatening or unlawfully coercive solicitation on behalf of the union. However, there is not the least suggestion on this record that any remotely threatening conduct had occurred during the Union campaign, and therefore the employees would most likely read the letter in the context of conduct which had actually occurred \u2014 namely, persistent union solicitation which was protected under the act. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s suggestion that its employees report \u201cconstant badgering by Union proponents\u201d followed its admonition (in capital letters), \u201cDON\u2019T SIGN A CARD!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1299-15\">Since the letter seems reasonably susceptible to the interpretation placed upon it by the Board enforcement is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
