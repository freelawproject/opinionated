We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-17\">We find the contention that there was an \u201catmosphere of fear\u201d throughout the trial not supported by the record. Also, the contention that public trial was lacking when three teenagers were excluded from the building is without merit. And, there was adequate evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-18\">On this record, evidence of a previous arrest does not require reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-19\">Any burden the government had as to showing the fairness of the pre-trial line-up was met.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
