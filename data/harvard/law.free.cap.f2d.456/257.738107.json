After all the evidence had been introduced at the trial, petitioner \u201crequested\u201d that the prosecution not be permitted both to open and close final oral argument to the jury as authorized by Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 54-88 (1960) and Rules for the Superior Court \u00a7 479, Conn.Practice Book (1963). His request was refused. Petitioner was convicted and ultimately sentenced to a prison term of four to eight years. Petitioner thereafter filed this petition for <em>habeas corpus </em>in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that the Connecticut procedure of allowing the prosecution in criminal cases both to open and close final oral argument violated his rights under the fourteenth amendment to due process of law and effective counsel. We affirm the judgment of the District Court denying the petition for <em>habeas corpus </em>because of the lack of merit of petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims as set forth in Chief Judge Blumenfeld\u2019s opinion, reported at 328 F. Supp. 228 (D.Conn.1971).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
