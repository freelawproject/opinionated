Appellant acknowledges that the District Court had found that the Local Board had a \u201cbasis in fact\u201d for denying petitioner a continuation of his II-A classification. But appellant claims as reversible error the District Court\u2019s failure to grant the petition on the ground that the Local Board did not give any reasons for its decision. In this regard appellant relies entirely upon this court\u2019s recent opinion in United States v. O\u2019Bryan, 450 F.2d 365 (6th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-22\">The holding in <em>O\u2019Bryan, </em>which involved a claim to conscientious 'Objector status, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-23\">\u201cWhere it is clear that a <em>prima fa-cie </em>case was established, we conclude that <em>in conscientious objector cases, </em>it is essential to the validity of an order to report that the board state its basis of decision and the reasons therefor, . \u201d United States v. O\u2019Bryan, <em>supra </em>at 371.
