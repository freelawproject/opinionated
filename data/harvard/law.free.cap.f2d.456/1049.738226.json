A three-year sentence was entered under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b) (1970) on the first count only and appellant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-25\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argued before us that reversal of conviction on this count was required because the government failed to prove a case for submission to the jury. In this regard his principal point was that there was no affirmative proof that appellant had prepared the income tax return in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-26\">On inspection of the briefs and appendices and the original record in this case, we are convinced that the government made out a prima facie case of fraudulent preparation of the 1963 income tax return of Charles Brant by 1) offering into evidence Brant\u2019s 1963 income tax return (Government Exhibit 3), which on the line designated for the person preparing the return is signed with what purports to be appellant\u2019s signature, and contains beside it an address which is admitted to be appellant\u2019s ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>dress; 2) the testimony of Charles Brant, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-4\">\u201cQ. Do you know the Defendant in this case, Mrs. Mary McKee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-6\">Q. How long have you known her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-7\">A. I first went to her in \u2014 it would be in 1963.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-8\">Q. Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-9\">A. I went to her to have income tax filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-10\">Q. Mr. Brant, I show you Government\u2019s Exhibit 3 in evidence and ask you to identify it, please, if you would, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-11\">A. This is my 1963 report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-12\">3) Brant\u2019s subsequent testimony denying that he had furnished appellant information on which a business expense item was based contained in the record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-13\">\u201cQ. Mr. Brant, referring to the exhibit you have in your hand now, and referring specifically to Schedule C, line 4, would you read the number that appears there, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-14\">A. \u2018Cost of labor.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-15\">Q. Excuse me, sir. What else does it say in parenthesis ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-16\">A. \u2018Do not include salary paid to yourself.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-17\">Q. What dollar figure is shown there, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-18\">A. $2,209.65.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-19\">Q. What, if anything, did you tell Mrs. McKee about that entry ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-20\">A. I did not tell her anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-21\">Q. Did you at any time tell her you had a man working for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1114-22\">A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1114-23\">In addition, the jury had before it (and had a right to consider) the pattern of similar conduct on the part of appellant in relation to the other 27 counts of the indictment as to which the jury brought in 14 additional verdicts of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-24\">In our judgment there was ample evidence from which the jury could have found appellant guilty on Count 1 of the indictment on which she was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-25\">We find no need to remand this case for any further investigation pertaining to appellant\u2019s allegation of electronic surveillance. The United States Attorney who was in charge of the case testified before the District Court: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain that the government itself and no agents of the government engaged in any electronic surveillance.\u201d The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
