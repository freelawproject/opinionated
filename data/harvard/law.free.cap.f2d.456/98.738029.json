Appellants then filed an amended complaint, which the court again dismissed for the reason that appellants had not complied sufficiently with the court\u2019s orders and thus had not stated claims upon which relief could be granted. Pursuant to the court\u2019s directions, appellants filed a second amended complaint. This time the court found that appellants\u2019 first \u201ccause of action\u201d did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that appellants\u2019 second \u201ccause of action\u201d was defective in the manner twice previously specified. Accordingly, the court dismissed the complaint with prejudice for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted and for failure to comply with the court\u2019s prior orders. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-24\">Appellants\u2019 counsel has conceded in argument upon this appeal that the first \u201ccause of action\u201d did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>District Court with respect to this part of the complaint. With respect to the remainder of the complaint, we are hard-pressed to find an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s dismissal, and do so only because we believe that the interests of justice require that appellants be afforded one more opportunity to conform their pleadings to the court\u2019s orders. Therefore, with respect to the first \u201ccause of action\u201d stated in the complaint, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed, and with respect to the remainder of the complaint, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to allow appellants leave to amend their complaint to conform specifically to the previous orders of the District Court and to such further requirements as the court in its discretion may direct.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
