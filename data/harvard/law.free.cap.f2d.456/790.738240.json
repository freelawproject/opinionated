After consideration of \u201cthe differences between the prior art and the claims at issue,\u201d Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 694, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966), we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">According to the specification, the invention relates to a natural rubber-re-sorcinol formaldehyde resin composition for use in either sizing glass fibers or impregnating yarns, cords and fabrics of glass fibers. The composition is said to enhance bonding relationships between the fibers and elastomeric materials when the fibers are employed to reinforce the elastomers 'in such end use areas as drive belts and tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-14\">Claim 10 is illustrative of the composition when used as a size on glass fibers:</p>\n<p id=\"b855-15\">10. Glass fibers and a size present as a thin coating on the glass fiber surfaces in which the size consists essentially of the combination of a natural rubber \u2014 resorcinol formaldehyde resin and an anchoring agent selected from the group consisting of an \u00f3r-gano silicon compound and a Werner complex compound in which the organic group attached to the silicon atom of the organo silicon compound and in which the carboxylato group coordinated with the chromium atom of the Werner complex compound contains a group selected from the group consisting of amino and epoxy groups and in which the anchoring agent is present in the ratio of 0.1 to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the natural rubber \u2014 resorcinol formaldehyde resin in which the resorcinol and formaldehyde are reacted in the molar ratio of about 2 to 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Claim 11 defines a particular silane as the anchoring agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Claim 7 is illustrative of the use of the composition to impregnate an already-sized bundle of glass fibers:</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">7. A glass fiber bundle, a thin size coating on the surfaces of the glass fibers in the bundle and a composition impregnating the bundle of sized glass fibers consisting essentially of a natural rubber \u2014 resorcinol formaldehyde resin in which the resorcinol and formaldehyde are reacted in the molar ratio of about 2 to 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Claim 13 limits the size coating of claim 7 to 0.5-1 percent by weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">\n<em>The Prior Art</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">The board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of all claims under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 as unpatentable over Lessig<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or Ells <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in view of van Gils,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Biefeld and Eilerman.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Lessig describes a composition and method for increasing the adhesion of rubber to fibers, cords and fabrics manufactured of, inter alia, glass. The composition comprises a polyhydric phenol aldehyde-rubber latex adhesive, preferably a resorcinol formaldehyde-rubber latex mixture. The fibrous material to be treated is immersed in the adhesive \u201cfor a time no longer than that necessary to wet the cord,\u201d and is subsequently dried at elevated temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">The van Gils patent discloses that rubber latices compounded with substantial amounts of resorcinol formaldehyde resin have been used for adhering tire cord fabric to rubber for many years. The examiner pointed out, and appellant does not deny, that the resorcinol: formaldehyde molar ratio employed by van Gils is on the order of 2:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-16\">The board regarded Ells as the most pertinent reference. It too discusses the solution to the problem of increasing adhesion between rubber and various fibrous reinforcing materials, \u201cwhether in the form of cord, yarn, fabric or filaments,\u201d by treating the fibers with a \u201cbonding latex.\u201d Among the bonding latices disclosed by Ells are colloidal emulsions of such conjugated diene materials as natural rubber and a \u201cmodified\u201d butadiene-styrene-vinyl pyridine terpolymer. The modifying agents disclosed as suitable for the latter include a resorcinol formaldehyde resin. When the fibrous material to be treated is relatively nonreactive, such as glass fibers, Ells states that \u201cit is desirable to use multiple coatings of bonding latex.\u201d Ells further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-17\">The fibrous materials, when in the form of continuous filament yarn, may be coated with the compositions employed herein by passing the yarn through a bath and squeezing to remove excess solution and to evenly distribute the latex composition on the fibers. Other techniques known in the art for applying a solution to fibers can also be employed such as for instance, padding or spraying, or, in fact, any system which will provide a pickup of the diene rubber latex in the range of from about 0.5% to about 20% and preferably from about 2% to about 5% calculated on the weight of the starting fibers and on the latex solids. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-18\">In the event a second latex coating is desired, process conditions are adjusted so that the already-coated fibers will pick up another 0.5-20% latex solids calculated on the weight of the starting fibers.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-19\">As his invention, Ells found that he could solve an occasional problem of oxi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>dative breakdown of the latex coating by-incorporating \u201cparaffin wax into the latex prior to coating a substrate with a diene rubber latex, or a material previously coated with a diene rubber latex may be made oxidation resistant by superimposing a paraffin coating on the latex coating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">\n<em>Differences in Subject Matter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Appellant posits several differences between the subject matter of his claims and the disclosure of the prior art, some of which differences are real, others rather tenuous. Summarized, they are:</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">(1) The claim language excludes the presence of paraffin wax in the size or impregnating compositions, whereas the essence of Ells\u2019 invention is the provision of paraffin wax in the bonding latex composition to inhibit oxidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">(2) The claims recite the use of a natural rubber-resorcinol formaldehyde resin composition to size or impregnate the glass fibers, whereas Ells does not disclose the use of such a composition at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">(3) Claims 10 and 11 require the size composition to be present as a \u201cthin coating\u201d on the glass fiber surface, whereas the Ells or Lessig procedures would not result in such a coating.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">(4) Claims 7 and 13 state that the glass fibers of the bundle are sized prior to impregnation, while Ells and Lessig do not disclose the prior application of a size coating.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">With respect to the first difference posed by appellant, it is true that Ells does disclose the use of paraffin <em>in </em>his bonding latex composition as one aspect of his invention, while the claim language \u201cconsisting [or consists] essentially of\u201d certain specified ingredients might be interpreted as excluding the presence of paraffin. See In re Jana-kirama-Rao, 317 F.2d 951, 50 CCPA 1312 (1963). The board felt that the omission of the paraffin from Ells\u2019 composition along with omission of its function would not be an unobvious expedient, particularly if the composition were to be used in circumstances where oxidation is not a problem. While we agree with the board\u2019s position, appellant appears to have overlooked the fact that Ells need not include paraffin <em>in </em>his diene rubber latex composition at all, but may subsequently apply it as a separate coating <em>on </em>the latex coating, as is clear from one of the heretofore-quoted portions of the Ells patent. That being the case, we see no difference, much less one productive of a conclusion of unob-viousness, between appellant\u2019s claims and Ells\u2019 disclosure in that first respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">As to appellant\u2019s second point, it cannot be gainsaid that Ells does not expressly disclose the use of a natural rubber-resorcinol formaldehyde resin composition. It is apparent from van Gils and Lessig, however, that resorcinol formaldehyde resins have long been combined with various rubber latex materials, including natural rubber, to promote adhesion between rubber and tire cord made of, among other things, glass. While the board did not specifically comment on the matter, the examiner saw nothing unobvious in the use of a resor-cinol formaldehyde-natural rubber latex composition <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as a substitute for the specific bonding latex composition disclosed by Ells. Appellant has presented no evidence or argument persuasive of error in that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">The last two points of difference set forth above are best discussed together. Appellant contends the board erred in finding that Ells\u2019 or Lessig\u2019s treatment of multifilament yarns or cords with bonding latex composition in one or more coating operations results in a thin \u201csize\u201d coating being applied to the individual fibers of the yarn or cord. It is appellant\u2019s position that Ells\u2019 and Les-sig\u2019s procedures involve <em>impregnation </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>a fiber bundle with the bonding latex composition, and that neither reference discloses placing a thin <em>size </em>coating of any kind or composition on the individual filaments of his yarn or cord. Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-4\">Coating of the glass fibers to provide a thin coating on the fiber surfaces is difficult to achieve after the fibers have been gathered together into a multi-filament interplied yarn or cord, as in Ells et al. This is because it is difficult to penetrate into the interior of the glass fiber bundle, even by multiple impregnations. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">* * * the treatment referred to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">in Ells et al. would not result in a thin size coating of the glass fibers as called for by- claims 10 and 11. The immersion of cord for a time no longer than necessary to wet the cord would result only in the outer fibers of the cord being partially coated while the majority of fibers within the interior of the cord would be free of coating. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">He draws our attention to In re Biefeld 285 F.2d 826, 48 CCPA 795 (1961) where, according to appellant, this court has previously recognized the difference between a \u201csize\u201d coating on glass fibers and a coating effected by impregnation of a bundle of glass fibers.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">The board observed Ells\u2019 disclosure of the desirability of treating nonreactive fibrous materials, such as glass, with a two-step coating process. It regarded the initial coating as a size coating comparable to that of claims 10 and 11, an inference it no doubt drew from Ells\u2019 description of passing the material \u201cinto a squeeze roll <em>size </em>box\u201d (emphasis supplied) containing the latex composition. It considered the second coating to be an impregnant coating comparable to that of claims 7 and 13, with the first coating serving as the \u201cthin size coating\u201d recited in those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">As we see it, the difficulty with appellant's argument is that he has placed nothing in the record to cause us to disbelieve the statement by Ells that, in his initial fiber coating step, the fibrous material is treated in a manner \u201cto <em>evenly distribute </em>the latex compositions <em>on the fibers\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The solids pick-up in that initial coating step of Ells is on the order of 0.5-20% by weight on the weight of the original fibers. That range encompasses or overlaps either of the ranges \u2014 0.5-1% for conventional size compositions apparently intended in claims 7 and 13, and 20-45% for the particular size composition of claims 10 and 11 \u2014 disclosed by appellant in his specification as corresponding to the weight of a size coating. In light of the above, we think the board reasonably concluded on this record that all of Ells\u2019 fibers have a \u201cthin\u201d coating<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on them in a weight corresponding to that of the \u201csize\u201d coating of any of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">Section 103 of the 1952 Patent Act provides that a patent may not be obtained \u201cif the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.\u201d In light of the background of the subject matter here, the scope and content of the prior art, and the differences between it and appellant\u2019s claims, we think appellant\u2019s discovery would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">The decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-16\">.
