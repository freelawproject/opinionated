We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\"> The amount of liquidated damages which the prime contract required be paid to the Government, as owner of the project, bears no absolute relationship to the amount of overhead expenses suffered by the prime contractor because of the subcontractor\u2019s failure to timely perform its obligations under the subcontract. Therefore, this amount does not govern, as between the latter parties, unless such liquidated damage amount was adopted by the prime and subcontractor as the measure of damages for any breach of <em>their </em>agreement. While the subcontract contained a clause providing that \u201cin general\u201d the parties would assume the correlative positions of the parties in the prime contract, it also contained a specific proviso that payments due the subcontractor would be subject to offset for reasonable claims arising out of performance of the subcontract work. Accordingly, Foster is entitled to withhold from payment to its subcontractor Federal provable damages which it has incurred under the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
