The Jefferson Parish School Board appeals from that order. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>In 1969 the district court approved a desegregation plan for Jefferson Parish. In 1971, following the decision in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> plaintiffs filed a Motion for Further Relief. At that time there remained in Jefferson Parish 19 one race schools \u2014 4 all black schools with 2,434 students or 19% of all black students, and 15 all white schools. At the beginning of the 1971-72 school year there were 75 schools and approximately 63,000 students, 80% white and 20% black. In their Motion for Further Relief the plaintiffs asked that every school be required to achieve a white-black ratio more nearly proportionate to the ratio of the entire system and that assignment of faculty members be on a ratio comparable to the system wide faculty composition.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">After a hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion the district court ordered the Jefferson Parish School Board to submit a plan in accordance with <em>Swann </em>to be implemented in the 1971-72 school year. In compliance, the School Board submitted a plan to the court, but without recommending that it be adopted. On August 10, 1971, the district court approved the plan submitted by the school board and ordered that it be implemented. The plaintiffs are fully satisfied with the court\u2019s order. The order provides for the integration of all 19 formerly one race schools by altering boundaries for elementary and middle school attendance zones and by bussing some 3,000 students. Evidence presented at the hearing showed that the average daily round-trip distance for the students to be bussed would be approximately 7 miles. The longest round trip distance for any child was shown to be 14 miles. The plan also provides for the assignment of faculty so that the racial composition of the faculty in each school will be comparable to the system wide ratio.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">The School Board contends that the. district court erred in requiring \u201cforced bussing\u201d to achieve racial balance and in concluding that the one race schools involved were \u201cvestiges\u201d of the previously operated dual school system rather than the product of voluntary housing patterns.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\"><em>Swann </em>made clear that bussing is an available tool for use by district courts in achieving school desegregation. In <em>Swann </em>23,000 students were to be bussed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Jefferson Parish only 3,000; and in <em>Swann </em>the average daily round trip was 15 miles,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in Jefferson Parish only 7 miles. No serious argument was made or evidence presented which would support a finding that the bussing required here would adversely affect the health of the children or significantly impinge on the educational process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We find no abuse of the district court\u2019s equitable discretion with respect to bus-sing.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\"><em>Swann </em>placed the burden on school authorities to show that one race schools are \u201cgenuinely nondiscriminatory.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court found that the only evidence presented by the School Board to justify the presence of 19 one race schools in this case \u201cwas an allusion to housing patterns.\u201d In view of the history of officially sanctioned school segregation in Jefferson Parish, the court concluded that such a bare allegation was without merit. The real thrust of the School Board\u2019s argument is a plea for neighborhood schools. But Chief Justice Burger reminded the litigants in <em>Swann </em>that, \u201cDesegregation plans cannot be limited to the walk-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>in school.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court did not commit error in concluding that the School Board had not met its burden under <em>Swann </em>to show that the 19 schools were genuinely nondiscriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">The district court permitted Albert B. Eason and others of his class to intervene on behalf of the School Board. Their brief on appeal raises substantially the same issues as those raised by the School Board. They emphasize that the district judge who granted the motion for further relief was the same judge who in 1969, ordered a plan implemented which he held would establish a unitary school system. Thus, Eason contends that Jefferson Parish already has a unitary school system and that no further relief is required. At the time of the 1969 order the Supreme Court had not made clear the extent of the remedial power available to district courts in dealing with the vestiges of a dual and unconstitutional school system. <em>Swann </em>has since provided additional guidance. Whether either the parties or the district court thought the Jefferson Parish system in 1969 was a unitary one is not^controlling. <em>Swann </em>held that one race schools, as here, which have always been one race schools in a system with a history of segregation are suspect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>Seeking to justify the remaining 19 one race schools the intervenors state in their brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">The few remaining one-race schools exist solely because of housing patterns prevalent in Jefferson Parish for many years before Brown I was rendered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">It is unquestioned that before <em>Brown I </em>there was state imposed segregation in Jefferson Parish. As the district court noted we do not have here schools which have been desegregated and then rese-gregated by shifting population trends. The argument of the intervenors thus lends support to the district court\u2019s finding that the 19 one race schools are in fact \u201cvestiges\u201d of former school segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-13\">The intervenors also suggest that 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1232a<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Supp.1971) supports their position. A similar argument was made under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000c-6 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and rejected in <em>Swann.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The result we reach here is not based on \u00a7 1232a or on our construction of other federal statutes.
