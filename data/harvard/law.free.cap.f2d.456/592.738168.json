Patent No. 3,382,280, known as the Huffman patent, issued May 7, 1968.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The action arose in an infringement proceeding Monsanto brought against Rohm and Haas Company, in which the defendant counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of invalidity and for an injunction and damages for unfair competitive acts against defendant\u2019s allegedly infringing product.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-18\">Preliminarily, we observe that Rohm and Haas, as a defendant in the proceedings below, had the right to challenge the validity of the patent on the ground that it was obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Walker Proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ess v. Food Machinery, 382 U.S. 172, 176, 86 S.Ct. 347, 350, 15 L.Ed.2d 247 (1965), the Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Under the decisions of this Court a person sued for infringement may challenge the validity of the patent on various grounds, including fraudulent procurement. E. g., Precision Instrument Mfg. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., 324 U.S. 806 [65 S.Ct. 993, 89 L.Ed. 1381] (1945); Hazel-Atlas Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 [64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1256] (1944); Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., 290 U.S. 240 [54 S.Ct. 146, 78 L.Ed. 293] (1933). In fact, one need not await the filing of a threatened suit by the patentee; the validity of the patent may be tested under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201 (1964 ed.). See Kerotest Mfg. Co. v. C-OI Two Fire Equipment Co., 342 U.S. 180, 185 [72 S.Ct. 219, 222, 96 L.Ed. 200] (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">The patent in suit is for a chemical compound known as 3,4-dichloropropion-anilide, hereinafter 3,4-DCPA or propan-il. The 1967 patent application asserted that only 3,4-DCPA had unusual and valuable herbicidal activity and that this activity was \u201csurprising\u201d because \u201crelated compounds possess little or no herbicidal efficiency.\u201d The district court concluded that Monsanto intentionally withheld material facts in order to mislead the Patent Office, thereby making its application for a patent taken as a whole misleading; that Monsanto came into court with unclean hands; that it was guilty of laches in asserting any right to patent the compound ; that 3,4-DCPA was obvious within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102; and that the compound was \u201cdescribed in printed publications\u201d within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 102(a), (b) and was therefore anticipated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Monsanto Co. v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Rohm and Haas Co., 312 F.Supp. 778, 798-799 (E.D.Pa.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In the view we take, it becomes necessary to reach only the misrepresentation issue. And to do this requires a discussion of the chemical compounds in question, those related to them, and the various properties associated with them. Closely related to 3,4-DCPA is the chemical compound 3,4-dichloroacetanilide (3,4-DCAA), differing in its structural formula solely by having one less CH2 group.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The first Monsanto (Huffman) application pertinent to these proceedings was filed May 27, 1957, and covered a class of 3,4-dichloroanilides comprising some one hundred compounds, including 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA, claiming herbicidal <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> compositions of chemical compounds and the use of these compounds to destroy undesired plants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Huffman claimed that the members of the class possessed \u201cunusual and valuable herbicidal activity,\u201d while related compounds possessed \u201clittle or no herbicidal efficiency.\u201d Huffman confirmed this \u201cunusual and valuable herbicidal activity\u201d of <em>all </em>the compounds <em>included, </em>in the claim. The Patent Office, in four separate office actions, rejected all of Huffman\u2019s claims as unpatentable under prior art disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Monsanto, through Huffman, tried again on May 8, 1961. Its application disclosed another large class of 3,4-dihalogenated anilides, again including 3,4-DCPA and 3,4-DCAA. Urging anew that the class possessed \u201cunusual and valuable herbicidal activity,\u201d the application averred that, in addition to 3, 4-DCPA, both 3/4''-dichloroisobutyranilide and 3,4/-dichloromethacrylylanilide were useful as selective post-emergent herbicides for rice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And again the Patent Office rejected the claim of the application as unduly broad and unpatentable over the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">The patent in suit was the third Monsanto application filed on February 3, 1967. This time it was represented that only 3,4-DCPA had \u201cunusual and valuable herbicidal activity\u201d and that the activity of this compound was \u201csurprising\u201d because \u201crelated compounds possess little or no herbicidal efficiency.\u201d The examiner rejected the single compound claim as obvious under prior art disclosing homologs<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and isomers<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of 3,4-DCPA, including 3,4-DCAA and 2,4-diehloropropionanilide. The patent was issued, however, on May 7, 1968, after Monsanto submitted an affidavit of Dr. Robert F. Husted, based on tests performed by him on twenty plant species at three different rates of application per acre. The report as presented to the Patent Office asserted that 3,4-DCPA completely killed or severely injured nine of the eleven species and failed to have any effect on only two. Eight other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>compounds were reported to have no effect on any of the eleven plants and two other compounds, one of them 3,4-DCAA, either had very slight or no effect. Significantly, although the Husted tests entailed tests on twenty species, at three separate rates of application per acre, the Patent Office was informed of tests on only eleven species and only at one rate of application, two pounds per acre. In all, the affidavit showed less than 25 per cent of Husted\u2019s results; of 899 tests, only 110 were submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The district court concluded that this close-cropping of Husted\u2019s findings amounted to misrepresentation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, Judge Masterson found misrepresentation in the inconsistency of Monsanto\u2019s 1967 representations of 3,4-DCPA\u2019s unique herbicidal efficiency, despite assertions in 1957 and 1961 that 3,4-DCAA and other 3,4-dichloroanalides also had activity as herbicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-14\">The concept of misrepresentation as applied to patent infringement cases admits to no fixed parameters and promulgates no specific dogma. At best it is an abbreviated expression of basic equitable maxims inherent in the law of patents; a recognition that a part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>quid pro quo </em>for the acquisition of a patent monopoly is an insistence that the circumstances surrounding the application for the patent be \u201cfree from fraud and other inequitable conduct.\u201d Precision Co. v. Automotive Co., <em>supra, </em>324 U.S. 806, 816, 65 S.Ct. 993, 998, 89 L.Ed. 1381 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">We perceive the test to be that set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Precision: </em>\u201cThe facts of a given case must accordingly be measured by both public and private standards of equity\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANm\">The guiding doctrine in this case is the equitable maxim that \u201che who comes into equity must come with clean hands.\u201d This maxim is far more than a mere banality. It is a self-imposed ordinance that closes the doors of a court of equity to one tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which he seeks relief, however improper may have been the behavior of the defendant. That doctrine is rooted in the historical concept of court of equity as a vehicle for affirmatively enforcing the requirements of conscience and good faith. This presupposes a refusal on its part to be \u201cthe abettor of iniquity.\u201d Bein v. Heath, 6 How. 228, 247 [47 U.S. 228, 12 L.Ed. 416]. Thus while \u201cequity does not demand that its suitors shall have led blameless lives,\u201d Loughran v. Loughran, 292 U.S. 216, 229 [54 S.Ct. 684, 689, 78 L.Ed. 1219], as to other matters, it does require that they shall have acted fairly and without fraud or deceit as to the controversy in issue. Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., 290 U.S. 240, 245 [54 S.Ct. 146, 147, 78 L.Ed. 293]; Johnson v. Yellow Cab Co., 321 U.S. 383, 387 [64 S.Ct. 622, 624, 88 L.Ed. 814]; 2 Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (5th Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 397-399.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">This maxim necessarily gives wide range to the equity court\u2019s use of discretion in refusing to aid the unclean litigant. It is \u201cnot bound by formula or restrained by any limitation that tends to trammel the free and just exercise of discretion.\u201d Keystone Driller Co. v. General Excavator Co., <em>supra, </em>245, 246 [54 S.Ct. 147, 148, 78 L.Ed. 293]. Accordingly one\u2019s misconduct need not necessarily have been of such a nature as to be punishable as a crime or as to justify legal proceedings of any character. Any willful act concerning the cause of action which rightfully can be said to transgress equitable standards of conduct is sufficient cause for the invocation of the maxim by the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Moreover, where a suit in equity concerns the public interest as well as the private interests of the litigants this doctrine assumes even wider and more significant proportions. For if an equity court properly uses the maxim to withhold its assistance in such a case it not only prevents a wrongdoer from enjoying the fruits of his transgression but averts an injury to the public. The determination of when the maxim should be applied to bar this type of suit thus becomes of vital significance. See Morton Salt Co. v. Suppiger Co., 314 U.S. 488, 492-494 [788, 62 S.Ct. 402, 405, 406, 315 U.S. 788, 314 U.S. 488, 86 L.Ed. 363].</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">. The possession and assertion of patent rights are \u201cissues of great moment to the public.\u201d Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 246 [64 S.Ct. 997, 1001, 88 L.Ed. 1250]. See also Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., 320 U.S. 661, 665 [64 S.Ct. 268, 271, 88 L.Ed. 376]; Morton Salt Co. v. Suppiger Co., <em>supra; </em>United States v. Masonite Corp., 316 U.S. 265, 278 [62 S.Ct. 1070, 1077, 86 L.Ed. 1461]. A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. As recognized by the Constitution, it is a special privilege designed to serve the public purpose of promoting the \u201cProgress of Science and useful Arts.\u201d At the same time, a patent is an exception to the general rule against monopolies and to the right to access to a free and open market. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>The far-reaching social and economic consequences of a patent, therefore, give the public a paramount interest in seeing that patent monopolies spring from backgrounds free from fraud or other inequitable <em>conduct </em>and that such monopolies are kept within their legitimate scope. The facts of this case must accordingly be measured by both public and private standards of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Precision Co. v. Automotive Co., 324 U. S. 806, 814-816, 65 S.Ct. 993, 997, 89 L. Ed. 1381 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Otherwise stated, the test is whether the applicant for a patent has \u201cdisplayed that standard of conduct requisite to the maintenance of this suit in equity.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>324 U.S. 819, 65 S.Ct. 999, 89 L.Ed. 1381.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Basically the issue resolves itself to a determination whether the representation to the Patent Office that \u201crelated compounds possess little or no herbicidal efficiency\u201d was \u201ctainted with inequitableness.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In view of Huffman\u2019s previously unsuccessful attempts to obtain a patent, it is reasonable to conclude that his success with his 1968 application, originally rejected by the examiner, and later accepted after presentation of the Husted Report, was attributed to his emphasis that the compound possessed properties of \u201csurprising . . . herbicidal efficiency\u201d not possessed by related compounds. \u201cFrom the standpoint of patent law, a compound and all its properties are inseparable; they are one and the same thing.\u201d Application of Papesch, 315 F.2d 381 (C.C.P.A.1963).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">Equity imperatively demands of suitors in courts fair dealing and righteous conduct with reference to the matters concerning which they seek relief. He who has acted in bad faith, resorted to trickery and deception, or been guilty of fraud, injustice, or unfairness will appeal in vain to a court of conscience, even though in his wrongdoing he may have kept himself strictly \u201cwithin the law.\u201d Misconduct which will bar relief in a court of equity need not necessarily be of such a nature as to be punishable as a crime or to constitute the basis of a legal action. Under this maxim, any willful act in regard to the matter in litigation, which would be condemned and pronounced wrongful by honest and fairminded men, will be sufficient to make the hands of the applicant unclean. Both courts and text-writers have repeatedly spoken upon this subject in no uncertain language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-22\">Thus, in view of the previous patent application rejections on the ground of prior art, it cannot be said that it was the unique chemical formula of 3,4-DCPA which gave rise to the issuance of the patent, but the representation made of it as a \u201ccompound and all its properties.\u201d Indeed, it was emphasized that these properties effected a herbicidal efficiency not possessed by related compounds. This being the thrust of the representation to the Patent Office, it required the applicant seeking a patent monopoly to exercise a degree of candor and disclosure as to the herbicidal efficiency of related compounds commensurate with \u201cequitable standards of conduct.\u201d <em>Precision Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-23\">The Husted affidavit to the Patent Office did not nearly reflect the total Husted test as transmitted to Huffman. Indeed, an examination of the report permits, if not compels, the misleading inference that it constituted a complete and accurate analysis of all the testing instead of an edited version thereof. Concealment and nondisclosure may be \u201cevidence of and equivalent to a false representation, because the concealment or suppression is, in effect, a representation that what is disclosed is the whole truth.\u201d Stewart v. Wyoming Cattle Ranch Co., 128 U.S. 383, 388-89, 9 S.Ct. 101, 103, 32 L.Ed. 439 (1888). See, Concealment and Nondisclosure, Chafee and Re, Equity, 5th Ed., 1967, at 635-644. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>Moreover, it cannot be convincingly-argued that the examiner in the Patent Office in 1967, in a proceeding numbered 613,738, can be charged with knowledge of all the contents of an abandoned application numbered 661,575 made in 1957. The record indicates that Huffman made no effort to bring to the attention of the Patent Office in 1967 \u2014 -when he was seeking a patent on 3,4-DCPA <em>per se, </em>attributing to it special herbicidal efficiencies not possessed by related compounds \u2014 that in 1957, and again in 1961, he had made representations to the Patent Office inconsistent with those made in 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">What, then, is the effect of this failure to make total disclosure? Clearly, if the 1968 patent on 3,4-DCPA qualified on its own as a formula or compound <em>per se, </em>without any consideration of its property for \u201cunusual and valuable herbicidal activity\u201d not possessed by related compounds, the necessity for a full and complete disclosure of the effect of its properties would not assume the importance it requires here. In Application of Papesch, <em>supra, </em>315 F.2d 381 at 391, while considering the importance of properties of new chemical compounds in the context of determining unobviousness, Judge Rich emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">\u201cFrom the foregoing cases it will be seen that this and other courts, . have determined the unobviousness and patentability of new chemical compounds by taking into consideration their biological or pharmacological properties. Nine of the ten cases above considered, directly or indirectly, involved such properties. Patentability has not been determined on the basis of obviousness of structure alone. In fact, where patentability was found in the above cases it was found in spite of the close similarity of chemical structure, often much closer similarity than we have here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201c . . . From the standpoint of patent law, a compound and all its properties are inseparable; they are one and the same thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">See also Commissioner of Patents v. Deutsche, 130 U.S.App.D.C. 95, 397 F.2d 656 (D.C.Cir. 1969) where Chief Justice, then Judge, Burger, emphasized this same principle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Applying these considerations to <em>Precision\u2019s </em>test of \u201cboth public and private standards of equity\u201d we cannot bring ourselves to say that the application for the 1968 patent \u201cdisplayed that standard of conduct\u201d demanded under the circumstances. We hold that under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d\u2014 (1) the rejection for obviousness in 1957 of the class of compounds of which 3,4-DCPA was a member and the representations of their common properties with related compounds; (2) the similar rejection in 1961 for the same reasons, and (3) the original rejection of the application in 1967 and the subsequent acceptance only after receipt of the Husted affidavit \u2014 Monsanto was obliged to disclose more information as to the herbicidal properties of related compounds to the Patent Office than it did; for \u201cwhat is at issue is not merely a contest between the parties but a public interest that cancelled or rejected claims not be revived and restored.\u201d General Instrument Corp. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 399 F.2d 373, 385 (1st Cir. 1968.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, it was impossible for the Patent Office fairly to assess Monsanto\u2019s application against the prevailing statutory criteria. Thus, Monsanto\u2019s failure to disclose amounted to misrepresentation transgressing equitable standards of conduct owed the public by the applicant in return for its monopoly.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Accordingly, Monsanto was not entitled to the patent monopoly, and the district court did not err in issuing the declaratory judgment of invalidity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-8\">.

The right to such an action has had an oblique history. Though the patent acts of 1790 (Act of 1790, \u00a7 5, 1 Stat. 109) and 1793 (Act of 1793, \u00a7 10, 1 Stat. 318) expressly granted a private party the right, upon allegations of fraud, to petition the district court for an order requiring the patentee to show cause why his letters patent should not be repealed, the omission of the provision in the 1836 Act (Act of 1836, 5 Stat. 117) prompted the Supreme Court to conclude in 1871 that \u201cno one but the government, either in its own name or the name of its appropriate officer can institute judicial proceedings for the purpose of vacating or rescinding the patent which the government has issued to an individual . [except in those cases asserting the statutory defenses to private infringement actions permitted by the 1839 Act].\u201d Mowry v. Whitney, 81 U.S. 434, 14 Wall. 434, 20 L.Ed. 858 (1871). The right of the government to bring an action to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>annul a patent was firmly established in United States v. Bell Tel. Co., 128 U.S. 315, <em>9 </em>S.Ct. 90, 32 L.Ed. 450 (1888), and the right was deemed exclusive United States v. American Bell Tel. Co., 159 U.S. 548, 555, 16 S.Ct. 69, 40 L.Ed. 255 (1895); Briggs v.

Ananconda Copper Mining Co., 26 F.2d 651, 660 (9th Cir. 1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Since 1915, however, our research discloses no Supreme Court case holding that the right to seek patent nullification has been expressly limited to the United States. Of course, a patentee guilty of obtaining a patent by fraudulent conduct could be denied equitable relief when bringing an infringement action, thus rendering the patent unenforceable against a defendant who could prove unclean hands. <em>Precision Instrument, </em>supra; Hazel Atlas Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., <em>supra. </em>(Implicit in Justice Roberts\u2019 dissent is the recognition that only the United States can seek actual nullification, 322 U.S. at 252, 64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250; <em>Keystone Driller, supra. Cf. </em>Hazelton Research v. Avco Mfg. Corp., 227 F.2d 137, 146 (7th Cir. 1955); Vortex Mfg. Co. v. Ply-Rite Contracting Co., 33 F.2d 302, 310 (D.Md.1929); Alliance Securities Co. v. J. A.

See United States v. Glaxo Group Limited, 302 F.Supp. 1, 11-15 (D.D.C.1969).

The district court\u2019s Finding 37 set forth :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">In its attempt to persuade the Patent Office that 3,4-DCPA was patentable over such prior art compounds, Monsanto, in the course of prosecuting this third application, filed on or about November 9, 1967, the affidavit of Dr. Robert F. Husted. (DX-1, pp. 47-50). This affidavit was drafted by one of Monsanto\u2019s patent attorneys and was based upon tests performed by Dr. Husted on about 20 plant species at three different rates of application per acre. The results of these tests were reported by Husted to counsel by letter with attached charts (DX-22). The affidavit only reports the results of tests of 10 compounds applied to 11 plant species at the rate of 2 lbs. per acre of application. The results were that 3,4-DCPA completely killed or severely injured 9 of the 11 species and failed to have any effect on only 2. By contrast, 8 other compounds were reported to have no effect on any of the 11 plants and two other compounds, one of them 3,4-DCAA, either had very slight effect or no effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">A comparison of the affidavit (DX-1, pp. 47-50) with the letter and charts forwarded to counsel by Husted (DX-22) reveals the following (Cole, N.T. 787-813):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-10\">1. The affidavit states that 3,4-DCPA completely kills radishes at 2 lbs. per acre, earning a \u201c4\u201d rating (DX-1, p. 49). The charts attached to Husted\u2019s letter to counsel reveal that 3,4-DCPA only has moderate herbicidal value at 2 lbs. per acre, earning a \u201c2\u201d rating (DX-22, last page).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">2. The charts in DX-22 indicate that at 2 lbs. per acre 3,4-DCAA has complete kill value on pigweed, earning a rating of \u201c4\u201d (DX-22, next to last page). The affidavit completely omits the results of this test. (DX-1, p. 49).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-16\">3. The affidavit fails to contain the results of tests where a compound other than 3,4-DCPA attained a rating higher than \u201c1\u201d (DX-1, p. 49). The second to last chart in DX-22 reveals that at 2 lbs. per acre, three compounds other than 3,4-DCPA achieved a rating of \u201c2,\u201d which means a moderate herbicidal value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-17\">4. The affidavit reports that 3,4-DCPA at 2 lbs. per acre achieved a \u201c3\u201d or \u201c4\u201d rating on all plant species except two where it achieved a \u201c0\u201d rating (DX-1, p. 49). DX-22 reveals that at 2 lbs. per acre 3,4-DCPA had a rating of less than 3 on several plant species, which results were not reported in the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-18\">5. The affidavit fails to contain the results of Husted\u2019s testing at other than 2 lbs. per acre. (DX-22, first four charts). These show that 3,4-DCPA is somewhat less active at rates other than 2 lbs. per acre.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-19\">In addition to the above, the Huffman and Allen article (DX-8) reports the results of tests on various crops at 8 lbs. per acre of application and shows that 3,4-DCAA exhibits high herbicidal activity. Tiiis article, as well as the results of the tests in DX-22, were not brought to the attention of the patent examiner (Cole, N.T. 811).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-20\">These omissions were intentionally and deliberately made to mislead the patent office into believing that 3,4-DCPA had outstanding- lierbicidal value as compared to related compounds. The Husted affidavit failed to state facts necessary to be stated in order to make Monsanto\u2019s representation to the patent office, taken as a whole, not misleading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-21\">312 F.Supp. at 785-786.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">.

The dissent expresses the view that the district court misapprehended the appropriate burden of proof required for a judgment of invalidity. From a colloquy occurring upon argument of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the dissent finds that the district court believed that preponderance of the evidence, rather than clear and convincing proof, was enough to carry Rohm &amp; Haas\u2019 allegation. Such an inference is refuted by the court\u2019s formal conclusions of law themselves. The court expressly stated that \u201c[u]pon our examination of the record, we have concluded that Rohm and Haas has met its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing proof.\u201d Monsanto v. Rohm &amp; Haas, <em>supra, </em>312 F.Supp. at 797. The court then formally concluded: \u201c6. Even if the presumption of validity were not destroyed, Rohm and Haas has met its burden of proving invalidity by clear and convincing proof.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 798. After argument on the motion, during which the colloquy relied upon by the dissent occurred, the court reaffirmed: \u201cAs to whether Rohm and Haas has met its burden of proof, we have decided to let the record stand as it is.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-18\">The dissent makes much of the district court\u2019s supplemental opinion, accentuating its reference to intentional fraud. This emphasis overlooks the basic thrust of the supplemental opinion which explicitly declared that \u201cEven if we were persuaded to change our mind\u201d and find that \u201cMonsanto did not intend to mislead, . a specific intent to deceive is not necessary where there is evidence of deliberate withholding of material information.\u201d The court also made reference to the admission by Monsanto\u2019s counsel: \u201cThere is no question it wasn\u2019t accidentally left out.\u201d 312 F.Supp. at 799.

The District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Patent Office was thereby misled was based solely on \u201cinference.\u201d On that score, it has been squarely held that \u201cinference\u201d cannot be substituted for \u201cclear and convincing proof\u201d in determining whether the Patent Office has been misled by material misrepresentations or omissions.

There was, however, affirmative testimony by the then counsel for the patent applicant that the omitted data was not included in the Husted affidavit because in his opinion it was not material. This testimony was not challenged nor was it impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">It is pertinent to note that in Monsanto Company v.

Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp. v. Tatnall Meas. Sys. Co., <em>supra, </em>169 F.Supp. p. 25. When these guidelines are applied to the present case, the inescapable conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>is that defendants have failed in their burden of proof. The only misinformation presented to the Patent Office is the degree of phytotoxicity of 3,4-DCPA on radishes. There is no evidence that this small corner of a broad picture presented to the patent examiner materially influenced the decision to grant the patent. The remaining contention on unclean hands relates not to what was said, but rather to what was not said. Defendants have not established that the withholding of this information was done with intent to deceive the Patent Office. They have similarly failed to prove the materiality of the information withheld, that the patent examiner would have rejected the application had he known of the matters said to be withheld as was true in Charles Pfizer &amp; Co. v. FTC, <em>supra. </em>To overcome the initial rejection by the patent examiner, it was necessary for plaintiffs to convince her that 3,4-DCPA had properties neither predictable from, nor in fact possessed by, 3,4-DCAA. By the manner in which they went about this task, plaintiffs did nothing more than put their best foot forward. Defendants\u2019 contentions on this point are therefore without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">This, too, must be said with respect to the majority\u2019s reliance on Precision Instrument Manufacturing Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co., 324 U.S. 806, 65 S.Ct. 993, 89 L.Ed. 1381 (1945). There the evidence conclusively established that the patent in suit had been obtained by fraud, intentionally concealed from the Patent Office with intent to deceive. <em>Precision, </em>accordingly, is inapposite on its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The majority has found it necessary to reach only the misrepresentation issue. I have accordingly confined this dissent to that issue. It is meet that I should say that I would also reverse the District Court\u2019s Judgment insofar as it is premised on its holdings that the Monsanto Huffman patent is invalid because it is \u201cobvious\u201d and \u201canticipated,\u201d and unenforceable because of \u201claches.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-20\">. 312 F.Supp. 799.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\">. \u2018\u2019Fraud is never presumed, and the burden is upon the defendant to show facts constituting fraud by clear, cogent, convincing and certain proof.\u201d Equitable Life Assurance Soc. v.

The District Court, in its Supplemental Opinion denying Monsanto\u2019s Motion for a Partial New Trial which was premised largely on the contention that the District Court had erroneously found that \u201comissions were intentionally and deliberately made\u201d in the patent application proceeding, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-14\">\u201cAs to whether Rohm &amp; Haas lias met its burden of proof, we have decided to let the record stand as it is. However, we are compelled to point out that even if we were persuaded to change our mind and find that although there were intentional omissions of fact, Monsanto did not intend to mislead the Patent Office, this would not lead us to a different conclusion with respect to the validity of a patent in light of such omissions. For the same policy considerations which underlie our February 17th Opinion (pages 792-794), <em>ice hold that even if Monsanto did not intend to deceive the Patent Office, the fact that it intentionally withheld facts which were material to the decision whether it was entitled to a patent is sufficient to bar the issuance of a patent . . . even if the decision not to disclose was motivated by nothing more than bad judgment as to the materiality of the information, the patent must still be rejected. We hold that a specific intent to deceive is not necessary to bar a patent when there is evidence of a deliberate withholding of material information. </em>Of course, if it is found that the facts withheld were not even marginally material to the issues before the Patent Office, then our decision on this precise issue would be different.\u201d 312 F.Supp. 799.
