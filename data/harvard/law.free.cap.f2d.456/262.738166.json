Plaintiff, on behalf of two clients, had won a judgment in 1963 in the amount of $105,000 against one of the partners. By prior agreement with his clients, plaintiff was to receive one-third of any judgment \u201cobtained and collected\u201d. All efforts to collect the judgment in full have been unavailing, the partners having reorganized and extended the life of the partnership indefinitely on June 22, 1965, in such a way as effectively to frustrate to this point satisfaction of the judgment. Plaintiff alleges that this indefinite extension of partnership life was undertaken for the purpose of rendering plaintiff\u2019s clients\u2019 judgment uncollectible. He also alleges that the members of the partnership have initiated and continue to maintain a system of bookkeeping which improperly conceals the value of the judgment debtor\u2019s interest in the partnership assets and his current income. The district court, 330 F.Supp. 856, dismissed the complaint, holding that the alleged conspiracy was aimed at plaintiff\u2019s original clients and could effect no legally cognizable interest of plaintiff and that, in any event, the conspiracy was placed beyond suit by the running of the applicable one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-19\">This is a bizarre case: we have here an attorney asserting an independent cause of action to collect a portion of an eight-year-old judgment, a judgment which because of the shielding effects of Puerto Rican commercial partnership law and apparent inaction on the part of plaintiff\u2019s original clients remains uncollected. In reaching a decision on the facts now before us we have not considered whether the statute of limitations has rendered the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>completely uncollectible because the unhappy fact for this plaintiff is that he has not shown where, under Puerto Ri-can law, he has any legal interest in the judgment which could support a conspiracy action other than, of course, a contract right to be paid one-third of whatever portion of the judgment his former clients collect. No Puerto Rican authority is cited, and we have found none to support the construction of the ' fee agreement as an equitable assignment. In Cornier v. Superior Court, 96 P.R.R. - (1968) (per curiam), the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico referred to a similar agreement as having \u201cno other scope than fixing of attorney\u2019s fees\u201d. Earlier in its opinion it had also made clear that Puerto Rico recognizes no attorney\u2019s lien for professional services. <em>See also </em>A. Mendez <em>&amp; </em>Bro. v. Chavier, 39 P.R.R. 661 (S.Ct.1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
