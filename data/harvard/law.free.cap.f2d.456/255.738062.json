Appellant sought to examine a completed Patent Office Form PO 892, which was prepared in connection with Patent Application Serial No. 666,526.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">The District Court, 328 F.Supp. 619, held that the Patent Office had correctly withheld this particular Form PO 892 from appellant because the form contained information concerning a pending application for a patent, and, therefore, disclosure was prohibited by 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 122 and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) (3). Upon this appeal, appellant contends that PO Form 892 is not a pending application or papers relating thereto within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 111 and 122 and so disclosure is not prohibited by statute. We need not reach this issue since it appears that subsequent events have rendered the litigation moot as to the documents sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">The patent application in question, Marcus A. Eggenberger application Serial No. 666,526, was approved on October 19, 1971. At that time the Form PO 892 prepared in connection with the Eggenberger application became open for inspection by the general public and a copy of the document was mailed to appellant\u2019s attorney. The only relief sought by appellant in this lawsuit is compelled disclosure of this document. Since appellant has been provided with the document, there is no longer any matter in controversy before this court. <em>See </em>Local No. 8-6, Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union v. Missouri, 361 U.S. 363, 367, 80 S.Ct. 391, 4 L.Ed.2d 373 (1960); Ackerly v. Ley, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 420 F.2d 1336 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
