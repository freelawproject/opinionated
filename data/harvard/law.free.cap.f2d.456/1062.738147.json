Appellant challenges the constitutionality of certain sections of Michigan Statutes dealing with the temporary detention of persons alleged to be mentally ill. She seeks permanently to enjoin the enforcement and operation of Michigan Statute Annotated 14.809(1) and 14.811 (1969), as amended, (Supp. 1971), M.C.L.A. \u00a7\u00a7 330.11a, 330.-21, on the ground that under the terms of said statute she has been deprived of and is currently threatened with being deprived of due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-13\">Our inspection of these statutes, appellant\u2019s claim and the opinion of the District Judge denying relief convinces us that the complaint does allege facts which if accepted as true, represent claims of substantial federal constitutional violations. See Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L.Ed. 152 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-15\">The judgment of the District Court is vacated and the case is remanded for the appointment of a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2281 and 2284 (1970).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
