From the judgment rendered thereon the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The defendant has stated eighteen claims of error, including an assertion that the trial court erroneously applied the \u201cfair preponderance of the evidence\u201d standard of proof rather than the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. We agree that the standard of proof that should apply is the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">In response to the defendant\u2019s motion for articulation, the trial court expressly stated: \u201cThe standard of proof used by the court in the above captioned matter was that of a fair preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>This court in <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>18 Conn. App. 316, 323, 559 A.2d 220 (1989), held that the standard of proof applicable in determining whether an attorney has violated the code of professional responsibility is clear and convincing evidence. For an analysis of the various standards of proof, see <em>Cookson </em>v. <em>Cookson, </em>201 Conn. 229, 233-35, 514 A.2d 323 (1986), and <em>Schaffer </em>v. <em>Lindy, </em>8 Conn. App. 96, 104-105, 511 A.2d 1022 (1986). Because the clear and convincing evidence standard of proof was not applied in this case, a new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Because we find error and remand for a new trial, we do not reach the other claims of error advanced by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
