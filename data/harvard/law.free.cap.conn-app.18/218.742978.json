The plaintiff claims the trial court erred (1) in directing the verdict for the defendant, and (2) in refusing to allow the plaintiffs expert to testify for the purpose of establishing prospective profits, which, the plaintiff claimed, was a proper measure of damages for the defendant\u2019s breach of their partnership agreement. Our decision on the plaintiff\u2019s first claim of error is dispositive of the appeal. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">The plaintiff brought an action for damages against the defendant for breach of an oral partnership agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At trial, the plaintiff offered evidence intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>to establish that the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an oral agreement to form a partnership for the purpose of purchasing and rehabilitating two apartment buildings and thereafter either renting the apartments or selling the buildings. The plaintiff testified about the various discussions he had had with the defendant regarding the project and about their efforts to estimate the costs associated with it. Testimony regarding the parties\u2019 agreement was presented. At the close of the evidence, the defendant moved for a directed verdict. After questioning the plaintiff\u2019s counsel regarding the plaintiff\u2019s claims,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court granted the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>ant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict, ruling that there was no evidence that the buildings ever could have been purchased for $65,000, the amount the plaintiff had testified the parties planned to pay, and that, without such evidence, there was no proof of a contract. The court denied a subsequent motion by the plaintiff to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The trial court\u2019s ruling was based upon an implicit factual assumption: that the parties intended and agreed that their agreement was conditioned upon successful negotiation of a purchase price for the buildings of no more than $65,000. The court in effect made a factual finding regarding a term of the alleged oral agreement entered into by the parties. In so doing, the court improperly assumed the jury\u2019s factfinding function. Litigants have the right to have issues of fact as to which there is room for a reasonable difference of opinion among fairminded people passed upon by the jury and not by the court. <em>Palomba </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>208 Conn. 21, 25, 543 A.2d 1331 (1988); <em>Seals </em>v. <em>Hickey, </em>186 Conn. 337, 350, 441 A.2d 604 (1982); <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Assn., </em>170 Conn. 520, 540, 368 A.2d 125 (1976). Whether an oral partnership agreement has been entered is a question of fact. 59A Am. Jur. 2d, Partnership \u00a7 211. The terms of such an agreement are ascertained by determining the intent of the parties, which is a question of fact. See <em>Kasper </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>5 Conn. App. 358, 361, 498 A.2d 132, cert. denied, 197 Conn 818, 501 A.2d 388 (1985). It is the jury\u2019s function to determine which inferences should be drawn from evidential facts if reasonable minds may differ as to the inferences to be drawn, even where those facts do not seem to be in dispute. 59A Am. Jur. 2d, Partnership \u00a7 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Our review of the record reveals that the facts regarding the existence and terms of the alleged oral agreement between the parties were in dispute at trial. The testimony conflicted on these issues, and resolution of the factual questions raised depended upon judgments regarding the credibility of the witnesses, the weight to be given the evidence, and the inferences to be drawn from the testimony. These are matters for the jury. <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>supra. The trial court erred in making a factual finding regarding the content of the alleged agreement between the parties and directing a verdict on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">There is error, the.judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\"> The plaintiffs Amended Complaint set forth the following allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-11\">\u201c1. In May of 1985 the plaintiff proposed to the defendant, and he accepted, a partnership for the purchase and rehabilitation of the premises known as 162-164 and 166-168 Homestead Avenue in Hartford, Connecticut, which premises consist of two six-family houses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-13\">\u201c3. The plaintiff prepared a contract between the owner of the premises and the defendant (as the transaction was being done in defendant\u2019s name) and tendered to the defendant a check for one-half of the deposit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-12\">\u201c2. The plaintiff and the defendant were equal partners for the acquisition, rehabilitation and ownership of the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-14\">\u201c4. The plaintiff maintained contact with the defendant for the months following May 1985 during which time the defendant assured the plaintiff that he was finalizing the deal with the seller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-15\">\u201c5. In December 1985, the plaintiff\u2019s check was returned, never having been cashed, and the defendant informed the plaintiff that the plaintiff would no longer be involved in the acquisition or rehabilitation of the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-16\">\u201c6. Subsequent thereto, the plaintiff became aware of the fact that the defendant had purchased the premises in October of 1985.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201c7. As a result of the actions of the defendant aforesaid, the plaintiff was deprived of the benefit of his bargain and lost the expectancy of acquiring and rehabilitating said premises, all to his loss and damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\"> The following interchange took place between the court and the plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u201cThe Court: And what was said in the agreement about the purchase price of the buildings?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u201cMr. Wisser: Sixty-five thousand dollars was what they wanted to purchase the building for.
