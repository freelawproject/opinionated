They claim that the trial court erred (1) in denying their motion to dismiss and (2) in concluding that the parties had orally agreed to a month-to-month lease and that the lease had terminated by lapse of time. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that the parties had orally agreed to a month-to-month lease and that the lease term had expired. The summons and complaint set the return date as January 29, 1987, and were returned to court on January 27, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Before the trial began, the defendants moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 142,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arguing that the return of process was not made in conformance with the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23a.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied the defendants\u2019 motion without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Following a brief trial, the court found that the parties had agreed to a month-to-month lease and that the lease had expired. The court awarded possession of the premises to the plaintiffs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We hold that the trial court erred in denying the motion to dismiss because the late return of process rendered the action subject to dismissal upon timely motion by the defendants. The summons and complaint were returned to court two days prior to the return day; they should have been returned \u201cat least three days before the return day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In <em>Bergin </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>3 Conn. App. 566, 490 A.2d 543, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 806, 404 A.2d 903 (1985), this court held that a late return of process, in an appeal from a Probate Court, rendered the appeal subject to dismissal. \u201c \u2018Where return of service is not timely . . . the courts have uniformly held that the defect cannot be cured by amendment. <em>Safford </em>v. <em>Morris Metal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number><em>Products Co., </em>99 Conn. 372, 121 A. 885 (1923); <em>Deni-son </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>74 Conn. 38, 49 A. 351 (1901); <em>LaMothe </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>15 Conn. Sup. 504 (1948). The rationale of this proposition appears to be that once the date for return has passed there is nothing before the court which can be amended.\u2019 <em>William J. Petzold, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>39 Conn. Sup. 247, 249, 476 A.2d 1094 (1984).\u201d Id., 569; see also 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed.) \u00a7 35, p. 139 and n.622. The late return of process renders the action voidable and, if the defendants choose not to waive the jurisdictional defect of a late return, the trial court must dismiss the action. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u201c[I]t is the actual return of the writ to the court which really puts the action before the court and empowers the court to proceed, even prior to return day.\u201d 1 E. Stephenson, supra, \u00a7 21, p. 67. Thus, although a defendant in a civil action may consent to the jurisdiction of the court, the court may not proceed with the action until the return of process is made to the court. See, e.g., <em>Algonquin Gas Transmission Co. </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>25 Conn. Sup. 448, 206 A.2d 846 (1952); annot., 82 A.L.R.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">The failure to meet the statutory requirement for the return of process rendered the case subject to dismissal. The defendants timely filed a motion to dismiss and the trial court erred in not dismissing the action. Because we hold that the trial court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, it is unnecessary to examine the defendants\u2019 remaining claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 142 provides: \u201cmotion to dismiss. Any defendant, wishing to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction, may do so even after having entered a general appearance, but must do so by filing a motion to dismiss within thirty days of the filing of an appearance. Except in summary process matters, the motion shall be placed on the short calendar to be held not less than fifteen days following the filing of the motion, unless the court otherwise directs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23a specifies the procedure for filing a complaint in summary process actions, following service on the occupants of a notice to quit possession of the premises. It states that \u201c[sjuch complaint may be made returnable six days, inclusive, after service upon the defendant and shall be returned to court at least three days before the return day.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 47a-23a (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
