During the evening of September 22, 1986, the defendant and Doe,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a male companion, were at the Ashley Cafe in Hartford. At approximately 10:40 p.m., Doe invited the victim, who was alone, to join them at their table. The victim accepted the invitation and joined them for a drink. Sometime later, the defendant and Doe informed the victim that they were leaving the bar to obtain marihuana on Magnolia Street and asked her if she wanted to accompany them. The victim agreed to go along. The two men and the victim left the Ashley Cafe. While walking in an area located near the Vine Street School, Doe asked the victim to engage in sexual intercourse with him. The victim refused and turned to walk away. Doe then grabbed her around the neck, pulled her to the ground and dragged her behind the school. The victim resisted, screaming and struggling, and struck Doe. Doe hit the victim in the jaw and threatened to kill her if she did not stop struggling. He reached into his pocket, a gesture causing the victim to believe he had a weapon. The victim, fearing for her life, ceased resisting but continued to scream. Doe proceeded to engage in sexual intercourse with the victim while the defendant stood nearby, smoking a cigarette and watching. Doe then ordered the victim to remain on the ground and told the defendant to \u201ctake his turn.\u201d The victim, crying, complied with Doe\u2019s order to remain on the ground. The defendant then engaged in sexual intercourse with the victim. The police arrived at the scene shortly thereafter, and the defendant was subsequently arrested and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>charged with sexual assault in the first degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a); conspiracy to commit sexual assault in the first degree; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a) and 53a-70 (a); and unlawful restraint in the first degree. General Statutes^ 53a-95 (a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In his first claim of error, the defendant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his objection that the testimony of a state\u2019s witness was hearsay and in admitting that testimony as evidence of an \u201cadmission by silence\u201d by the defendant. The following facts are relevant to this claim. During its case-in-chief, the state called Officer Cheryl Canino of the Hartford police department as a witness. Canino testified that, during the early morning hours of September 23, 1986, she was dispatched to the rear of the Vine Street School to investigate a report of a woman screaming. Canino testified that, upon her arrival at the school, she observed a male and a female standing some distance away and began to approach them. In response to a question by the prosecutor, Canino began to testify that, as she approached the two individuals, she heard the female speaking to the male. The defendant interrupted, objecting that the testimony was hearsay. In an offer of proof conducted outside the presence of the jury, Canino testified that, as she approached the two individuals, she heard the victim repeatedly saying to the defendant, \u201cWhy did the both of you do this to me?\u201d She further testified that the defendant did not respond to the victim\u2019s statements. The defendant argued that Canino\u2019s testimony regarding what she heard the victim say was hearsay. The state responded that Canino\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s statements to the defendant and the defendant\u2019s failure to reply was admissible to establish an admission by conduct. The defendant countered that the admission into evidence of testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>regarding his choice to remain silent in the face of the victim\u2019s accusations violated his rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and his rights under the Connecticut constitution. The defendant contended that he had not been under any obligation to respond to the victim\u2019s statements \u201cbased on his fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendment [rights] and [his rights] under the state\u2019s constitution whether he was in custody or not.\u201d The court overruled the defendant\u2019s hearsay objection and ruled that Canino\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s silence was admissible to show an admission by silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The defendant concedes on appeal that his choice to refrain from responding to the victim\u2019s accusatory statements is not protected under either the United States constitution or the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argues, however, that the trial court erred in permitting Canino to testify about his failure to respond to the victim\u2019s accusatory statements because the statements were made in the presence of a police officer and therefore the circumstances did not naturally call for him to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The rule in Connecticut is that when a statement, accusatory in nature, made in the presence and hearing of an accused, is not denied or explained by him, it may be received into evidence as an admission on his part. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 522, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>174 Conn. 73, 76, 381 A.2d 563 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Yochelman, </em>107 Conn. 148, 152, 139 A. 632 (1927). Evidence of silence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>prearrest setting may be used either as an admission or for impeachment purposes. <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>supra. The theory underlying the rule is that the natural reaction of an innocent person to an untrue accusation is promptly to deny, contradict or otherwise object to it; 29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence \u00a7\u00a7 633, 638; and that the failure of the person to contradict or reply is probative of his adoption of the assertion. <em>Obermeier </em>v. <em>Nielsen, </em>158 Conn. 8, 11, 255 A.2d 819 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The strength of the inference that the defendant\u2019s silence imports acquiescence in the truth of an accusatory statement depends upon the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement. \u201cRecognizing that, at its best, the doctrine of assenting silence brings about the weakest assumption known to the law\u201d; 29 Am. Jur. 2d 692, Evidence \u00a7 638; many state courts have imposed conditions upon the introduction of evidence that an alleged admission by silence has occurred. C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed.) \u00a7 160. Some state courts have even barred entirely the introduction, in any criminal case, of evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence, reasoning, in part, that the inference of assent was too unreliable. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>201 N.W.2d 921, 927 (Iowa 1972); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dravecz, </em>424 Pa. 582, 227 A.2d 904 (1967). The doctrine has also been criticized by commentators. See C. Gamble, \u201cThe Tacit Admission Rule: Unreliable and Unconstitutional \u2014 A Doctrine Ripe for Abandonment,\u201d 14 Ga. L. Rev. 27 (1979); Note, \u201cTacit Criminal Admissions,\u201d 112 U. Pa. L. Rev. 210 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Our Supreme Court has joined other state courts in developing standards governing the admissibility of evidence of a defendant\u2019s prearrest silence in the face of accusation. The trial judge must decide, as a preliminary matter, whether proffered evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence in the face of accusation is, under the circumstances, sufficiently probative of assent by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>defendant to the accusatory statement made in his presence. See <em>Mei </em>v. <em>Alterman Transport Lines, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 307, 315, 268 A.2d 639 (1970); <em>Obermeier </em>v. <em>Nielsen, </em>supra. The inference of assent may be made only when no other explanation is equally consistent with silence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 405, 497 A.2d 956 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>182 Conn. 220, 229, 438 A.2d 38 (1980). Relevant considerations in determining the proper explanation for an actor\u2019s silence are whether the actor heard, understood, and comprehended the statement to which he did not respond, <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 406; whether the circumstances naturally called for a reply from him; id.; and whether there were present physical or emotional factors which render the inference of assent unreliable; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Canino\u2019s testimony, we note that, ordinarily, the trial court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence are accorded great deference and will be disturbed on appeal only upon a showing of clear abuse of discretion. <em>Ellice </em>v. <em>INA Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>208 Conn. 218, 222, 544 A.2d 623 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Erhardt, </em>17 Conn. App. 359, 553 A.2d 188 (1989). We consider, therefore, whether the trial court could reasonably have concluded, on the basis of the evidence before it, that the fact of the defendant\u2019s silence was sufficiently probative of assent to an accusatory statement to permit its admission into evidence as an admission by silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">At the time the trial court ruled on the admissibility of Canino\u2019s testimony, the state had presented the testimony of only one other witness, the victim. Through the testimony of Canino and the victim, evidence of the following circumstances had been presented. The victim, in a state of extreme emotional upset, asked the defendant why he and Doe had done what they did to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the time the victim directed this statement to the defendant, the defendant was standing near the victim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Canino was approaching and was within two feet of the defendant and the victim at the time the victim was speaking,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the defendant was facing Canino.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the time the trial court was called upon to rule on the question before it, this evidence was uncontradicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>On this state of the record, a close question is presented. There was sufficient evidence from which the trial court could conclude that the defendant heard the victim\u2019s statement; the testimony of both the victim and Canino supports such a finding. The first question is whether the statement made by the victim was sufficiently accusatory in import to call naturally for a response from the defendant. The incriminating content of a statement is to be considered in determining whether an ordinary person would deny it. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Schulman, </em>624 F.2d 384 (2d Cir. 1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Flecha, </em>539 F.2d 874 (2d. Cir. 1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra. On one hand, the statement \u201cwhy did you do this to me\u201d is ambiguous in that it does not by terms identify any wrongful act. An individual making such a statement could as well be referring, for instance, to another\u2019s late arrival for an appointed meeting as to some criminal or otherwise wrongful act allegedly committed against him by the other. We think, however, that the trial court could reasonably conclude that the statement \u201cwhy did you do this to me\u201d carried sufficiently accusatory implications to call for a response from the one to whom it was directed. In order to be accusatory in character, a statement does not necessarily have to be of such tenor that any stranger hearing it would understand it as such. Annot., 80 A.L.R. 1235, 1278. The statement \u201cwhy did you do this to me\u201d is expressive of a belief held by the declarant that the defendant had done something \u201cto\u201d her which required explanation. Such an expression is fairly characterized as accusatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">We next consider whether, as argued by the defendant, the trial court should have refused to admit, as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>admission by silence, evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence because the presence of police, at the time a response would otherwise have been called for, rendered the significance of the defendant\u2019s choice to remain silent ambiguous. It is undoubtedly true that some individuals might, in the situation faced by the defendant, choose not to answer. \u201c[I]t is a lamentable but undeniable fact of modem society that some of our citizens harbor a mistrust for law enforcement authority which leads them to shun contact with the police even when the avoidance of contact is not in their own best interest ... . Such individuals may refrain from speaking to law enforcement officials not because they are guilty of some crime, but rather because they are simply fearful of coming into contact with those whom they regard as antagonists.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Conyers, </em>52 N.Y.2d 454, 458, 438 N.Y.S.2d 741, 420 N.E.2d 933 (1981). An individual\u2019s prearrest silence in the presence of police could be attributable to \u201cthe natural caution that arises from his knowledge that anything he says might later be used against him.\u201d Id. Because there are at least several plausible explanations for why an individual might refrain from responding to an accusatory statement directed to him in the presence of police, the defendant\u2019s argument that his silence was too ambiguous to be admissible as an admission is appealing. Clearly, the probative value of evidence of a choice to remain silent in the face of accusation as proof of assent to the statement is less when the accusatory statement is made in the presence of police than if police were not present. We decline, however, to adopt a rule that would make evidence of a defendant\u2019s choice to remain silent in the face of an accusation directed to him by another in the presence of police inadmissible as a matter of law and adopt instead a case-by-case approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">On the basis of the facts of this case, we decide that the trial court erred in permitting Canino to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>testify that the defendant remained silent in the face of the victim\u2019s accusation. At the time the court ruled on the admissibility of the state\u2019s evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence, the uncontradicted evidence regarding the surrounding circumstances was (1) that the victim was making her accusatory statement as Canino approached, (2) that the defendant saw Canino, a police officer, approaching, (3) that Canino arrived just as the victim completed the accusatory statement, and (4) that the victim, according to her own testimony, was \u201cvery, very emotional\u201d at the-time she made the statement. On this record, we cannot say that it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that a sufficiently strong inference of assent could be drawn from the fact of the defendant\u2019s silence to justify admission of this fact into evidence. First, evidence that the declarant of an accusatory statement was highly emotional at the time the statement was made may weaken any inference of assent that might otherwise be drawn from the fact of silence to such an extent that evidence of the silence is rendered inadmissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, the Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in admitting, as an admission by silence, evidence of the defendant\u2019s choice to remain silent in response to an accusatory statement because evidence that the declarant was in a state of emotional hysteria when she made the statement gave rise to an alternative explanation for the defendant\u2019s silence. The court in <em>Harris </em>stated: \u201cIn this circumstance the defendant may well have felt that any response on his part either would have been pointless because [the declarant\u2019s] agitated mental condition precluded her from appreciating any reasonable rejoinder or might have exacerbated the existing tension.\u201d The present case involves similar evidence of an \u201cemotional factor\u201d constituting, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>\u201ca sufficient impediment . . . to the invocation of the infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ence [of assent].\u201d Id. In <em>Harris, </em>the existence of this \u2018emotional factor\u201d was sufficient in and of itself to render evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Second, the evidence before the trial court was that, as the victim spoke the accusatory words, Canino, a police officer, was approaching the place where the victim and the defendant were standing, that the defendant was aware of this, and that Canino\u2019s arrival and the victim\u2019s completion of the accusatory statement were practically simultaneous. On these facts, we think the defendant\u2019s failure to respond to the victim\u2019s statement is equally likely to be attributable to distraction or apprehension occasioned by the impending arrival of a police officer; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Conyers, </em>supra; or to bewilderment or confusion, as to acquiescence in the truth of the accusatory statement. In short, in the particular circumstances involved in this case, the fact that the defendant remained silent was too unreliable as evidence of assent to the victim\u2019s statement to be admissible as an admission by silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Although we find that the trial court erred in overruling the defendant\u2019s hearsay objection and admitting, as an admission by silence, evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence in the face of accusation, the question remains whether the error was harmful. The error in this case does not involve a constitutional violation. The burden is therefore on the defendant to demonstrate the harmfulness of the court\u2019s error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 230; <em>State </em>v. <em>Petterson, 17 </em>Conn. App. 174, 183, 551 A.2d 763 (1988). \u201c \u2018The defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Petterson, </em>supra, 183, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 723, 732, 535 A.2d 808 (1988). The defendant in his appellate brief essentially argues that \u201c[a]ny admission by silence to [the] accusation had monumental effect in establishing [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>defendant\u2019s] guilt in an otherwise close case.\u201d The defendant\u2019s conclusory statement fails to demonstrate that it is more probable than not that the trial court\u2019s error affected the result in the case. \u201cIn the absence of any showing of prejudice, any discussion of harmfulness is speculative at best.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Petterson, </em>supra. Moreover, our review of the record reveals that the case against the defendant was sufficiently strong that the jury in all probability would have found him guilty of the crime charged even if the erroneously admitted evidence had not been admitted. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Flinter, </em>16 Conn. App. 402, 548 A.2d 1 (1988). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s error in admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s silence in the face of accusation was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that, in order to find the defendant guilty of sexual assault in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70, it had to decide unanimously which of two statutorily designated acts necessary to constitute the offense the defendant had committed. The defendant asserts that that failure violated his right to a unanimous jury verdict in a trial by a six-member jury under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution because the jurors could have believed that they could find him guilty even if they did not unanimously agree on which act the defendant committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The defendant neither submitted a request to charge nor excepted to the charge given by the trial court. Generally, this court will not consider claims of error relating to the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury where no request to charge was submitted and no exception was taken to the charge as given. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 854, 4185; <em>State </em>v. <em>Benite, </em>6 Conn. App. 667, 670, 507 A.2d 478 (1986). The defendant requests review, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). We have previously held that the federal constitutional issue raised by the defendant in this case falls within the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d rule of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>17 Conn. App. 186, 196, 551 A.2d 421 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Benite, </em>supra, 671; <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>3 Conn. App. 650, 654-55, 491 A.2d 428 (1985). We will therefore address the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The state charged the defendant by substitute information with sexual assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a), alleging that the defendant \u201ccompelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse <em>by the use of force and the threat of use of force . \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) At trial, the court charged the jurors that, in order to find the defendant guilty of sexual assault in the first degree, they must find that the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe defendant compelled the victim to engage in . . . sexual intercourse, <em>either by the use of force or by the threat of the use of force.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The court later instructed the jurors that they must render a unanimous verdict. The court did not instruct the jurors that they could only find the defendant guilty if they could unanimously agree on which method of compulsion \u2014 use of force or threat of use of force \u2014 the defendant used. The defendant argues that the court\u2019s failure to charge the jurors that they had to agree unanimously in this regard permitted them to convict the defendant even if all jurors did not agree on the means by which the defendant compelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The issues encompassed by the defendant\u2019s claim have previously been analyzed by this court. A specific unanimity instruction is required \u201conly where a trial court charges a jury that the commission of any one of several alternative actions would subject a defendant to criminal liability, <em>and those actions are conceptually distinct from each other, </em>and the state has presented some evidence supporting each alternative.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Benite, </em>supra, 674-75. (Emphasis added.) This court decided in <em>State </em>v. <em>West, </em>supra, 656, that \u201cthe use of force\u201d and \u201cthe threat of use of force\u201d were not \u201cconceptually distinct\u201d acts requiring the giving of a specific unanimity charge to the jury. These decisions are dispositive of the claim raised by the defendant, and we hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to charge the jurors that they must unanimously agree whether the defendant employed \u201cuse of force\u201d or \u201cthe threat of use of force\u201d did not violate the defendant\u2019s right, under the sixth and fourteenth amendments, to a unanimous verdict in a trial by a six-member jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in permitting the state\u2019s attorney improperly to \u201c[inject] into argument the notion that someone was either lying or committing perjury.\u201d The defendant points to six remarks made by the state\u2019s attorney during final argument,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> claiming that the state\u2019s attorney in effect told the jury that it had to conclude that the victim was a liar before it could believe the defendant\u2019s version of events and acquit him. He claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>those remarks violated his rights to a fair trial and to due process of law under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The defendant made no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks either during or after the argument and requested no curative charge. Where a criminal defendant does not object and take exception to allegedly prejudicial remarks of the state\u2019s attorney, either at the time they were made or at the close of argument, he waives his right to press the claimed error on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>199 Conn. 102, 108, 505 A.2d 712 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyler-Barcomb, </em>197 Conn. 666, 673, 500 A.2d 1324 (1985). Where counsel fails to object or to request a curative charge, \u201c \u2018we have presumed that defense counsel did not view the remarks as so prejudicial that his client\u2019s right to a fair trial was seriously jeopardized.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Lubesky, </em>[195 Conn. 475, 484, 488 A.2d 1239 (1985)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 23 n.13, 463 A.2d 558 (1983).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The defendant claims review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973). Our Supreme Court has reviewed claims of prosecutorial misconduct under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, where the defendant raised a claim, adequately supported by the record, that he clearly has been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 536, 529 A.2d 653 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Findlay, </em>198 Conn. 328, 344, 502 A.2d 921, cert. denied, 476 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>1159, 106 S. Ct. 2279, 90 L. Ed. 2d 921 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>194 Conn. 483, 497, 481 A.2d 741 (1984). <em>Evans </em>review of claims of prosecutorial misconduct has been denied, however, where claimed misconduct was not \u201cblatantly egregious\u201d and consisted only of \u201cisolated and brief episodes\u201d that did not reveal \u201ca pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 537; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>14 Conn. App. 146, 150, 539 A.2d 1037, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 805, 545 A.2d 1101 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Our review of the record in this case leads us to conclude that review under <em>Evans </em>of the defendant\u2019s claim is not warranted. The defendant has pointed to six remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument. No pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial is evident; rather, the claimed misconduct consists only of isolated and brief remarks which have no blatantly egregious import. The defendant\u2019s claim of pros-ecutorial misconduct is not adequately supported by the record. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has failed to raise a claim, adequately supported by the record, that misconduct by the prosecutor caused him to be deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial, and we therefore decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Evans.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-70. sexual assault in the first degree: CLASS B FELONY: ONE YEAR NOT SUSPENDABLE.
