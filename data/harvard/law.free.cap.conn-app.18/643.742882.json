The defendant claims that the court erred (1) in denying his motion for a mistrial filed on the basis of an allegedly improper question asked by the state, and (2) in its failure to charge the jury, in accordance with his request to charge, regarding prior inconsistent statements of the victim. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On the evening of August 8,1986, the seventeen year old victim was at her girlfriend\u2019s house. At approximately 2 a.m., the victim and her friend were outside the friend\u2019s house talking with the defendant and Angelo Paniagua. The victim knew the defendant from the neighborhood. The victim then left for home on her bicycle. About two blocks away, she again saw the defendant, who called to her. When she stopped, the defendant pulled out a knife, which he put against her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>side as he grabbed her arm. The defendant led the victim to a rooming house, where he took her into a room and sexually assaulted her. The victim subsequently went to the hospital for treatment. Using a sex crime kit, hospital personnel examined the victim\u2019s clothing and pubic hair and took vaginal swab samples, which revealed the presence of semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court erred by denying his motion for a mistrial, which was based on a question asked by the state during its redirect examination of Mary Beth Guman, a serologist employed by the state police forensic laboratory. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">This claim arises in the following context. On direct examination, Guman testified that there was a stain that contained semen in the crotch area of the victim\u2019s underwear, that the stain was of blood group A, and that the victim was a secretor with A type blood. She also testified that the vaginal swabs from the victim disclosed semen and spermatozoa, and that semen donors from blood groups B and AB could be excluded in this case. Guman had only the victim\u2019s blood sample for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">On cross-examination by the defendant, Guman testified that body hairs found on the victim\u2019s blouse were not analyzed because there was no known sample with which to compare them, that head hairs found on the victim\u2019s jacket were consistent with her head hairs, and that hairs found on her pubic area were consistent with her pubic hairs. She also testified that the stain on the victim\u2019s underwear was a mixture of fluid from the victim and the donor.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">On redirect examination, without objection by the defendant, Guman repeated her earlier testimony regarding the hair evidence. She also testified that if she had a known hair sample she could discount someone as a possible donor, but that she had only the vie-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>tim\u2019s sample. The state then asked the following partial question: \u201cHow about as to the blood group. Did you have any samples \u2014 \u201d The defendant objected, and the court sustained the objection. At the defendant\u2019s request, the jury was excused. In the jury\u2019s absence, a colloquy ensued in which the defendant argued that the state\u2019s questions regarding the lack of a hair sample, other than the victim\u2019s, with which to compare the hairs examined by Guman permitted the jury to infer guilt because the defendant had not supplied a sample of his hair. The defendant did not base his argument on the question regarding blood groups, to which his prompt objection had been sustained.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant moved for a mistrial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, and the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The defendant argues that the state\u2019s questioning of its witness on redirect examination violated the presumption of innocence and reduced the state\u2019s constitutional burden of proof. It is difficult to glean from the defendant\u2019s brief whether he now complains of the questions regarding hair or blood groups or both. Whether we view them separately or together, however, the defendant\u2019s argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">A mistrial is warranted only where, as a result of an occurrence during the trial, the defendant has been deprived of the opportunity for a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Baskins, </em>12 Conn. App. 313, 319, 530 A.2d 663, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 811, 532 A.2d 586 (1987). That determination is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The defendant explored the issue of the hair evidence on cross-examination, and did not object to the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>three questions regarding that evidence on redirect examination. The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the partial question regarding the blood groups, and the defendant did not base his trial claim for a mistrial on that question. This record does not support the defendant\u2019s claim either that the state impermissibly led the jury to draw an adverse inference against the defendant, or that such purported misconduct warranted a mistrial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The defendant next claims that the court erred by failing to instruct the jury in accordance with his request to charge regarding prior inconsistent statements of the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The defendant\u2019s request to charge focused on three purported prior inconsistent statements by the victim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Those statements concerned whether she or the defendant walked her bicycle while the defendant held a knife against her, whether she or the defendant carried the bicycle into the rooming house, and whether she took cocaine during that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We note first that the victim\u2019s statement regarding whether she took cocaine the night of the incident was inconsistent not with a prior statement of her own but with the testimony of Angelo Paniagua, the defendant\u2019s companion. See footnote 3, supra. The victim gave no prior inconsistent statement on this issue, and the conflict between her testimony and Paniagua\u2019s was addressed in the court\u2019s instruction regarding the relative credibility of witnesses, to which the defendant had no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We next examine the other two proffered inconsistencies in the victim\u2019s statements, namely, whether she or the defendant walked the victim\u2019s bicycle and carried it into the rooming house. We conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to give a particularized jury charge on these inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">In determining whether a witness\u2019 prior statement is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement, the court is entitled to take into account whether the incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>sistency is substantial and relates to a material matter. <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 710, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979); <em>Hartmann </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>16 Conn. App. 1, 17, 547 A.2d 38 (1988). Even where, as here, prior inconsistent statements are admitted into evidence, however, the court is not required to give a specific charge concerning the statements, at least where the inconsistencies are not substantial and do not relate to a material matter. These inconsistencies can hardly be characterized as substantial and material.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Furthermore, although the court did not specifically refer to the issue of prior inconsistent statements, it gave a thoroughly adequate charge on credibility of witnesses in general. The court instructed the jury that it could consider any matter bearing on credibility, including whether the witness\u2019 testimony had been contradicted by other credible evidence, and including the principle of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, as requested by the defendant. Viewing the charge on credibility in its entirety, as we must; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>15 Conn. App. 342, 351, 545 A.2d 1109 (1988); we conclude that the court did not err in declining to give the specific charge requested by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-8\"> After the jury was excused, the defendant stated: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a chance to get into the hematology or serology aspect, whether or not there [were] blood samples from my client offered up for her analysis because I objected.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\"> On appeal, but not at trial, the defendant also relies in part on one isolated statement the assistant state\u2019s attorney made during the colloquy in the jury's absence. Statements made in the jury\u2019s absence have no impact on the fairness of the trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pardo, </em>199 Conn. 354, 356-57, 507 A.2d 461 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-8\"> The defendant\u2019s request to charge was as follows: \u201cOne such circumstance [bearing on the credibility of a witness] you should consider is evidence that at some time a witness has said something which is inconsistent with the witness\u2019s testimony at trial. For instance you will recall [the victim\u2019s] testimony. During parts of [her] testimony she made some statements concerning events she claimed that transpired on August 9, 1986. You will recall that certain statements of [the victim] were admitted into evidence which were different from her in-court testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">\u201cThe testimony of a witness may be discredited or impeached by showing that she previously made statements which are inconsistent with her present testimony. Prior statements of a witness which are inconsistent with her trial testimony, constitute evidence and are admissible to impeach the credibility of the witness. It is the province of the jury to determine the credibility, if any, to be given the testimony of a witness who has been impeached. Devitt &amp; Blackman, 1 Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, pp. 540, 562 \u00a7 17.08, 17.16 (West 3d Ed. 1977); <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">\u201cYou will recall that [the victim] stated that on the night she claimed to have been sexually assaulted, she was forced to move her bike up Hancock Avenue with her left hand as Mr. Gonzalez walked on her right holding the knife on her, that she carried the bike in the back door of a rooming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>house on Hancock Avenue and that when Mary Perez, Angel Paniagua, Mr. Gonzalez and she were together on State Street she did not take any drags. On the other hand, you heard Detective Richard Mancini testify that [the victim] told him that Mr. Gonzalez took the bike up Hancock Avenue while forcing [the victim] to go with him and that Mr. Gonzalez carried the bike in the front door of the rooming house. Mr. Paniagua testified that during the night in question he personally observed [the victim] take cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">\u201cI will tell you that as the triers of fact in this case you determine the weight a particular witness\u2019 testimony deserves. If a witness is shown to have testified falsely concerning any material matter, you have a right to distrust such witness\u2019 testimony on other particulars; and you may reject all the testimony of that witness or give it such credibility as you may think .it deserves. Devitt &amp; Blackman, 1 Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, pp. 540 \u00a7 17.08 (West 3rd Ed. 1977).\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b671-8\"> On appeal, the defendant presents three other purported inconsistent statements, in addition to the issue of who walked the victim\u2019s bicycle to the rooming house. These concerned whether the victim\u2019s mother or sister called the police after the sexual assault, whether Paniagua was in her presence before the assault, and whether she left the place of the assault by the back or front door. To the extent that the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal differ from those presented at trial, they are not entitled to review. <em>Commissioner of Health Services </em>v. <em>Kadish, </em>17 Conn. App. 577, 580 n.4, 554 A.2d 1097 (1989). Furthermore, even a full review of all of them does not disclose any error by the trial court in not giving a particularized jury charge relating to them, because they were not substantial and did not relate to material matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
