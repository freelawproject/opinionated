As we have often stated, we will not retry the case. <em>Coles </em>v. <em>Coles, </em>17 Conn. App. 831, 832, 553 A.2d 1169 (1989). Our review of the record fails to disclose that the court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings, or that the decision was otherwise erroneous in law; Practice Book \u00a7 4061; or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Branigan </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>3 Conn. App. 580, 581, 490 A.2d 1019 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claims that attack the court\u2019s eviden-tiary rulings are also meritless. Rulings involving the court\u2019s discretion will be disturbed on appeal only upon a clear showing of abuse of that discretion. <em>Leech </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>17 Conn. App. 352, 353, 552 A.2d 451 (1989). Our review indicates that the court\u2019s actions were clearly within its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
