We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">The following facts are relevant to the appeal. On September 21, 1987, the plaintiff, owner of real property in Middletown, filed an appeal from a decision of the planning and zoning commission approving a subdivision application for property abutting the plaintiff\u2019s. The citation named the defendant planning and zon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>ing commission (commission) and directed the sheriff to serve the town clerk with a copy of the summons and complaint. The citation failed to cite the chairman or clerk of the commission. In addition, the sheriffs return was not attached to the appeal documents returned to the court. The original sheriffs return was eventually filed on November 23, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The defendant property owner, Thaddeus Bysiewicz, moved to dismiss the appeal on November 13, 1987. In his motion papers, he argued that the citation failed to name the chairman or clerk of the commission as required by General Statutes \u00a7 8-8,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which constituted a jurisdictional defect mandating dismissal. He also noted, but did not specifically argue, that the court file did not contain the sheriffs return; On November 20, 1987, the trial court, <em>Budney, J., </em>scheduled argument on the motion to dismiss for November 23, 1987, on the short calendar.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">At the short calendar hearing, Bysiewicz argued that the motion should be granted because the plaintiff had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>failed to cite the proper parties, and because the sheriffs return had not been attached to the appeal documents. Although Bysiewicz\u2019 supporting motion documents argued only that the appeal should be dismissed because of the alleged citation deficiencies, the oral argument focused on the perceived inadequacy of the return of process. The court then set a schedule for briefs on the issue of whether the appeal should be dismissed because the appeal documents returned to court failed to include the sheriff\u2019s return.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Following the hearing, Bysiewicz filed a supplemental memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>which argued both grounds for dismissal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss on December 7,1987, addressing both arguments propounded by Bysiewicz. By filing the memorandum on that date, the plaintiff complied with the briefing schedule arranged by the trial court on November 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Argument on the motion was postponed. On February 16,1988, Bysiewicz filed another supporting memorandum, this time alleging that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 143 because she did not timely file a memorandum in opposition to his motion to dismiss, filed on November 13, 1987.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed her memorandum in opposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tion to this motion on March 9, 1988, addressing the alleged defects in the citation as well as Bysiewicz\u2019s argument that the appeal should be dismissed because the plaintiff failed to file her motion in opposition in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Argument on the motion to dismiss was heard on March 14, 1988, before <em>R. O\u2019Connell, J. </em>Each of the three grounds for dismissal advanced by Bysiewicz was argued before the court, although the majority of the hearing was confined to the issue concerning the defects in the citation. After the hearing, decision was reserved and rendered sometime later. The court granted the motion without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The plaintiff petitioned this court for certification to appeal, which was denied on April 7, 1988. She thereafter filed a motion to open the judgment of dismissal, as provided by Public Acts 1988, No. 88-79,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which became effective on April 20, 1988. After a hearing, the trial court, <em>Higgins, J., </em>denied the motion. The memorandum of decision stated: \u201cThe plaintiff alleges that the court <em>(R. O\u2019Connell, J.) </em>dismissed this appeal on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Simko </em>decisions. The court finds that the appeal was dismissed for the failure to file a memorandum of law in opposition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the motion to dismiss five days before the motion was to be heard at short calendar .... In the present case, the motion to dismiss was scheduled for short calendar on November 23, 1987. The plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to Bysiewicz\u2019 motion to dismiss on December 7, 1987, 14 days after short calendar. Since the <em>Simko </em>legislation, section 3 (b) of Public Acts 1988, No. 88-79, addresses only <em>Simko </em>defects, it is found that this curative legislation is not applicable in this case. The said motion to open is denied.\u201d We granted the plaintiff certification to appeal from the judgment of the trial court denying her petition to open the judgment of dismissal of her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The plaintiff claims<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the court erred in denying her motion after determining that the trial court had dismissed her appeal for failing to file timely a memorandum in opposition to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Our review, on an appeal taken from a denial of a motion to open a judgment, seeks to determine whether the trial court acted unreasonably and in clear abuse of discretion. <em>Yanow </em>v. <em>Teal Industries, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 579, 583, 494 A.2d 573 (1985); <em>Crozier </em>v. <em>Zdboori, </em>14 Conn. App. 457, 461, 541 A.2d 531 (1988). The same standard of review applies to those motions to open brought under the common law and those, as in the case here, brought pursuant to a statute. <em>Manchester State Bank </em>v. <em>Reale, </em>172 Conn. 520, 523-24, 375 A.2d 1009 (1979). In deciding whether the trial court abused its discretion, \u201cthe ultimate issue is whether the trial court could reasonably conclude as it did. <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enter</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>prises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 612, 153 A.2d 463 [1959].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bitting, </em>162 Conn. 1, 11, 291 A.2d 240 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Given the facts presented by the plaintiff, which are supported in the record and uncontested in the defendants\u2019 appellate briefs, we hold that the trial court erred when it ruled that the original trial court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s zoning appeal because the plaintiff had failed to file timely her memorandum in opposition to Bysie-wicz\u2019 motion to dismiss. By scheduling the short calendar hearing three days after the November 20, 1987 briefing schedule, the court effectively precluded the plaintiff from meeting the time requirements in Practice Book \u00a7 143. Further, the transcript clearly indicates that the court waived the requirement by setting a briefing schedule on the matter. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s decision denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open was made in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">On remand, the trial court should consider whether the appeal properly could have been dismissed for the plaintiff\u2019s failure to attach the sheriffs return to the appeal documents. A determination of that issue would logically precede consideration of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open based on Public Acts 1988, No. 88-79, and subsequent case law interpreting that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 8-8 provides in pertinent part; \u201c(a) Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision of said board, or any person owning land which abuts or is within a radius of one hundred feet of any portion of the land involved in any decision of said board, or any officer, department, board or bureau of any municipality, charged with the enforcement of any order, requirement or decision of said board, may, within fifteen days from the date when notice of such decision was published in a newspaper pursuant to the provisions of section 8-3 or 8-7, as the case may be, take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which such municipality is located, which appeal shall be made returnable to said court in the same manner as that prescribed for civil actions brought to said court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u201c(b) Notice of such appeal shall be given by leaving a true and attested copy thereof with, or at the usual place of abode of, the chairman or clerk of said board, and by serving a true and attested copy upon the clerk of the municipality. The appeal shall state the reasons upon which it has been predicated and shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court to which such appeal is returnable may, on application, on notice to the board and on cause shown, grant a restraining order.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-6\"> During the hearing, the following exchange between John H. Hanks, counsel for the defendant Bysiewicz, and Jule A. Crawford, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">\u201cMr. Hanks: I would be happy to file a brief by tomorrow of this new narrow issue which the judge points out.
