J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asc\">The defendant appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment of revocation of his probation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32. The defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in finding that he violated his probation, (2) in revoking his probation, and (3) in allowing him to represent himself without an adequate waiver of counsel. We find error on the last claim, and, therefore, need not decide the first two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">The defendant was sentenced on July 31,1986, to two concurrent terms of four years, execution suspended after time served, with five years probation, on his guilty pleas to one count of larceny in the third degree and to one count of attempt to commit burglary in the third degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-124 and 53a-103. On February 14,1987, the defendant was arrested by police officers responding to a domestic complaint, and charged with robbery in the third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>degree, breach of peace, two counts of interfering with an officer, and two counts of assault on an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">On December 11,1987, the defendant was arrested pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 for violating his probation. After a probation revocation hearing, the court found that the defendant had engaged in conduct on February 14, 1987, that constituted a violation of his probation. The court thereupon revoked probation and sentenced the defendant to serve two concurrent terms of four years, less time served as of July 31,1986. The defendant was subsequently found not guilty on the charges that arose from his arrest on February 14, 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">In his last claim, dispositive of this appeal, the defendant alleges that the court should not have accepted his waiver of his right to counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The right to assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>of counsel is guaranteed to a defendant in a criminal proceeding by the sixth and fourteenth amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>to the constitution of the United States; <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963); and by our state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 533, 480 A.2d 435 (1984) <em>(Gethers I); State </em>v. <em>Varricchio, </em>10 Conn. App. 265, 267, 522 A.2d 843 (1987). This constitutional right has been extended to defendants in probation violation hearings by \u00a7 53a-32 (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the General Statutes. <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 639, 645, 356 A.2d 902 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cA criminal defendant also has the right to appear pro se in a state criminal trial \u2018when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so.\u2019 <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975) . . . .\u201d <em>State v. Gethers, </em>197 Conn. 369, 376, 497 A.2d 408 (1985) <em>(Gethers II); State </em>v. <em>Varricchio, </em>supra, 267. Because a defendant has a constitutional right to the assistance of counsel at a hearing concerning the possible violation of his probation; <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 645; he has the concomitant constitutional right to represent himself at such a hearing upon an effective waiver of the right to the assistance of counsel. See <em>Gethers I, </em>supra, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">When a defendant is deciding whether to appear pro se or with a lawyer, it is vital for the trial court to satisfy itself that the defendant, if he or she chooses to appear pro se, is fully aware of the risks involved and makes the choice knowingly. <em>Gethers II, </em>supra, 380-81; <em>State </em>v. <em>Varricchio, </em>supra, 268. Our role as a reviewing court is to determine whether the defendant effectively waived his right to counsel. <em>State </em>v. <em>Varricchio, </em>supra, 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u201cThis determination is based upon [United States] Supreme Court guidelines. First, courts are required to \u2018 \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u201d of fundamental constitutional rights . . . .\u2019 <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>[304 U.S. 458,] 464 [58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938)]. In addition, \u2018[presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible.\u2019 <em>Carnley </em>v. <em>Cochran, </em>369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S. Ct. 884, 8 L. Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>2d 70 (1962). It has long been acknowledged that \u2018[t]he determination of whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u2019 <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>supra. This important decision rests within the discre-tionof the trial judge. Id., 465 . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Varricchio, </em>supra, 269-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 959 provides that \u201c[a] person who is charged with an offense punishable by imprisonment, or who is charged with violation of probation . . . shall be entitled to have counsel represent him unless: (1) He waives such appointment pursuant to [Practice Book] Sec. 961 . . . .\u201d Once the requirements of Practice Book \u00a7 961<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> are satisfied, the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to self-representation is triggered. The rule is written to implement the constitutional right of self-representation as well as to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to the assistance of counsel. <em>Gethers I, </em>supra, 534; <em>State </em>v. <em>Varricchio, </em>supra, 269; <em>State </em>v. <em>Blackwell, </em>9 Conn. App. 587, 595, 520 A.2d 634, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 804, 525 A.2d 519 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The defendant argues that the court failed to comply with the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 961 in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the court did not inquire into the educational background or intelligence of the defendant, did not advise the defendant that he could have standby counsel appointed, or advise him of the range of punishments that he faced upon the revocation of his probation, or of the specific dangers of self-representation. The defendant also argues that the court should have advised him that the standard of proof in a revocation hearing is not \u201cbeyond a shadow of a doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court failed to comply substantially with Practice Book \u00a7 961 (3), and, therefore, limit our discussion of the defendant\u2019s arguments to that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendant asserts that he was not informed of \u201cthe range of punishments that he faced upon the revocation of probation.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 961 (3) requires that the court be satisfied that the defendant \u201c[comprehends the nature of the charges and proceedings, the range of permissible punishments, and any additional facts essential to a broad understanding of the case. . . .\u201d A court is entitled to presume that defense counsel has explained the nature of the offense in sufficient detail. <em>State </em>v. Blackwell, supra, 597, citing <em>Gethers I, </em>supra, 537. In this case, however, the defendant stated, on the record, that he asked his attorney about the nature of the proceedings instituted against him and whether he was \u201cgoing to start picking a jury,\u201d whereupon his attorney replied that the proceedings did not involve selecting a jury but rather concerned the charge that the defendant had violated his probation. When the defendant asked what this particular proceeding entailed, his attorney allegedly said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, ask Shorty.\u201d The defendant stated that \u201cShorty\u201d was a fellow inmate. We cannot presume, therefore, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>defendant\u2019s attorney had explained the nature of the offense to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">It also is not apparent that the defendant understood the \u201crange of permissible punishments\u201d that could occur if his probation were revoked.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state argues that the <em>Blackwell </em>presumption, that a court is entitled to presume that a defendant has had the nature of the offense explained to him, leads to the conclusion that the defendant understood the range of permissible punishments since the latter conclusion is embodied within the former presumption. For the same reasons discussed above, however, we cannot indulge in the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The state argues that the defendant\u2019s attorney and the defendant\u2019s probation officer stated, on the record, in the presence of the defendant, that the defendant was exposed to \u201cforty-four months\u201d and that he was sentenced in both cases to \u201cfour years, execution suspended after time served and five years probation.\u201d This testimony, however, did not concern the \u201crange of permissible punishments\u201d that would result if the court found that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation. Rather, this testimony was in response to the court\u2019s request for clarification regarding the original July 31, 1986 sentence imposed upon the defendant. This testimony also took place <em>eleven days </em>before the defendant sought to invoke his right to represent himself. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the defendant sufficiently understood the \u201cnature of the charges and proceedings\u201d and \u201cthe range of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>missible punishments\u201d involved in the revocation hearing before he allegedly waived the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We conclude that the trial court failed to comply substantially with Practice Book \u00a7 961 (3). Because \u00a7 961 protects a defendant\u2019s right to the assistance of counsel, as well as his corollary right to self-representation; <em>Gethers I, </em>supra, 534; substantial defective compliance with the rule requires reversal \u201ceven if no particular prejudice is shown and even if there is overwhelming evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Varricchio, </em>supra, 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">In view of our holding on this claim, it is unnecessary to consider the defendant\u2019s remaining claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-7\"> One of the conditions of probation to which the defendant had agreed after his sentencing on July 31,1986, was that he not violate any criminal law of the state of Connecticut. A revocation of probation proceeding based upon a violation of a criminal law need not be deferred until after a disposition of the charges underlying the arrest because the purpose of a probation revocation hearing is to determine whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constituted an act sufficient to support a revocation of probation; <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>10 Conn. App. 395, 503 A.2d 917 (1987); rather than whether the defendant had, beyond a reasonable doubt, violated a criminal law. The proof of the conduct at the hearing need not be sufficient to sustain a violation of a criminal law.

I would like for him to be here just for exactly what I just told you.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">\u201cThe Court: And what was that Mr. Smith?

It\u2019s impossible at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">\u201cThe Defendant: Well, for the sake of argument, sir, I\u2019ll see you later.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-14\">\u201cMr. Hines: As much as I\u2019d like to, and I think I\u2019ve done a lot of work on this case, with that allegation there is no possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019ll see you later.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">\u201cMr. Hines: Especially now with an attorney client relationship now, when the gentleman is saying\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: There was never one, sir, from the outset of these proceedings. Excuse me, Your Honor, I asked Mr. Hines, I said, \u2018What\u2019s what,\u2019 he said, \u2018You\u2019ve been hit with a violation of probation.\u2019 I was under the assumption I was here to pick a jury trial. They hit me with two counts of violation of probation. He came in the back room, I said, \u2018Sir, what\u2019s going on, and am I going to start picking a jury today?\u2019 He said to me, he said, \u2018No they are going to start a violation of probation.\u2019 And I said, \u2018What does that consist of?\u2019 He says, T don\u2019t know, ask Shorty.\u2019 Shorty, Your Honor, is an inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">\u201cThe Court: Are you therefore dismissing Mr. Hines?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019m dismissing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-20\">\u201cThe Court: Thank you, Mr. Smith. Mr. Hines, you have just been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-21\">\u201cMr. Hines: May I be excused, Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"b393-22\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, you may.

Morris to the stand please.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-24\">\u201cMr. Sullivan: Your Honor, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s implied, but given the difficulty which this fairly routine type of proceeding has a history of, I would like to know whether or not the defendant is asking for standby counsel or simply wishes to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-25\">\u201cThe Defendant: We can proceed, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-26\">\u201cMr. Sullivan: As pro se?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Are you then waiving counsel from this point forward?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: I am waiving.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u201cThe Court: Do you understand that by waiving counsel you\u2019re putting yourself at a disadvantage?</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\u201cThe Defendant.
