J.</author>\n<p id=\"azk-dedup-1\">This is an action brought by the plaintiff for damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of an automobile accident. Shelby Mutual Insurance Company (Shelby) sought to intervene in the action as a plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-293. The trial court denied the motion to intervene as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the denial of Shelby\u2019s motion to intervene is an appeala-ble final judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the denial of Shelby\u2019s motion to intervene was not an appealable final judgment, and that the appeal must therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. On April 28, 1987, the plaintiff sustained personal injuries as a result of an automobile accident. The accident occurred while the plaintiff was operating a motor vehicle in the course of his employment with Wilson Motors, Inc. Because the plaintiff\u2019s injuries arose out of and in the course of his employment, the plaintiff\u2019s employer, Wilson Motors, Inc., became obligated to pay, and in fact paid, workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">In June, 1987, the plaintiff commenced the present negligence action against the defendant, the owner and operator of the vehicle that collided with the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle. In accordance with the provisions of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 31-293, the plaintiff notified his employer by letter, dated August 27,1987, and sent by certified mail, that he had instituted the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">On April 22,1988, Shelby, the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, moved to intervene in the plaintiff\u2019s action pursuant to \u00a7 31-293. The plaintiff objected to Shelby\u2019s motion to intervene, claiming (1) that the motion had not been filed within thirty days of notification as required by \u00a7 31-293, and (2) that \u00a7 31-293 provides that only an employer, rather than the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, may intervene.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The test for whether the denial of a motion to intervene is a final appealable judgment is succinctly stated in <em>Common Condominium Assns., Inc. </em>v. <em>Common Associates, </em>5 Conn. App. 288, 291, 497 A.2d 780 (1985). An unsuccessful applicant for intervention does not have a final judgment from which to appeal unless he can make \u201ca colorable claim to intervention as a matter of right.\u201d Id.; see also <em>Rodia </em>v. <em>Tesco Corporation, </em>11 Conn. App. 391, 393, 527 A.2d 721 (1987). If the proposed intervenor does make such a claim, \u201con appeal the court has jurisdiction to adjudicate . . . his claim to intervention . . . .\u201d <em>Common Condominium Assns., Inc. </em>v. <em>Common Associates, </em>supra, 291. The test for determining whether the denial of a motion to intervene is appealable is consistent with the test for determining the appealability of other otherwise interlocutory orders. Id. An order or action is appealable where it (1) \u201cterminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) . . . so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The second prong of <em>Curdo </em>is the only one arguably implicated by a ruling on a motion to intervene. \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>[applicant] must show that [the court\u2019s] decision threatens to abrogate a right that he or she <em>then </em>holds.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Longo, </em>192 Conn. 85, 91, 469 A.2d 1220 (1984). \u201cThe right itself must exist independently of the order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Id., 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Shelby\u2019s claim for intervention must fail because it can make no colorable claim to intervention as a matter of right. The \u201cright\u201d in this case is claimed to be provided by \u00a7 31-293, which provides that \u201cany employer having paid, or having become obligated to pay, compensation under the provisions of this chapter may bring an action against [the tortfeasor] to recover any amount that he has paid or has become obligated to pay as compensation to [an] injured employee. If . . . such employee . . . brings such an action against such third person, he shall . . . notify the [employer], in writing, by personal presentation or by registered or certified mail, of such fact and of the name of the court to which the writ is returnable, and [the employer] may join as a party plaintiff in such action within thirty days after such notification, and, if [the employer] fails to join as a party plaintiff, his right of action against such third person shall abate.\u201d Accordingly, once statutory notice has been given by the employee to the employer,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the employer has thirty days to intervene or his \u201cright of action against such third person shall abate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>In <em>Skitromo </em>v. <em>Meriden Yellow Cab Co., </em>204 Conn. 485, 489, 528 A.2d 826 (1987), our Supreme Court, sub silentio, reaffirmed <em>Ricard </em>v. <em>Stanadyne, Inc., </em>181 Conn. 321, 322 n.1, 435 A.2d 352 (1980), for the proposition that an employer has a colorable claim to intervention as a matter of right under \u00a7 31-293.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Shelby is not, however, an employer within the meaning of \u00a7 31-293. When a cause of action has been created by statute, strict rules of statutory construction apply. <em>See Misiurka v. Maple Hill Farms, Inc., </em>15 Conn. 381, 384, 544 A.2d 673, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 813, 550 A.2d 1083 (1988). In <em>Misiurka, </em>we held that notice to an employer\u2019s insurance carrier did not constitute notice to the employer for purposes of \u00a7 31-293. Accordingly, it follows that an insurance carrier does not constitute an employer for purposes of intervention within the meaning of \u00a7 31-293.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-11\"> This case was formerly subject to this court\u2019s own motion to have counsel appear and show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of a final judgment. The matter was marked \u201coff,\u201d however, and the parties were directed to address the final judgment issue in their briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\"> See General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 (6) for the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\"> Shelby concedes that the plaintiffs letter of August 27,1987, complied with and contained the information required by General Statutes \u00a7 31-293. It argues, however, that the minimum notice provided by the statute is \u201cmanifestly insufficient to comply with procedural due process.\u201d Shelby admits in its brief that it, as the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, is not entitled to notice under \u00a7 31-293, citing <em>Misiurka </em>v. <em>Maple Hill Farms, Inc., </em>15 Conn. App. 381, 384-85, 544 A.2d 673, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 813, 550 A.2d 1083 (1988). Since Shelby has no right to any notice at all, it cannot claim that \u00a7 31-293 is insufficient to satisfy the minimum standards of due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
