J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">This appeal involves a counterclaim in which the defendant sought payment for materials and services supplied by the defendant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in the remodeling of the plaintiffs\u2019 home. The defendant appeals from a judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiffs on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred (1) in rendering judgment for the plaintiffs on the basis of the defendant\u2019s noncompliance with General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) and (c) of the Home Improvement Act, when the plaintiffs had not pleaded noncompliance as a special defense, and (2) in finding that the act precluded the defendant from recovery under a theory of quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The defendant\u2019s amended counterclaim consisted of four counts, three of which are involved in this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Two counts alleged that the parties had entered into an oral agreement for the furnishing of materials and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the rendering of services in connection with the renovation of the plaintiffs\u2019 residence. A third count alleged that the defendant had furnished materials and services at the request of the plaintiffs for which he had not been paid in full and which had the same value as the amount set out in the other two counts. The plaintiffs filed an answer, essentially denying all of the allegations in the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and a special defense to the counterclaim alleging that the defendant did not comply with the Home Solicitation Sales Act. General Statutes \u00a7 42-134a et seq. The plaintiffs did not specially plead General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) of the Home Improvement Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Concluding that the defendant failed to comply with General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a) and (c) of the Home Improvement Act, the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. In its memorandum of decision, the court did not comment directly on the plaintiffs\u2019 failure specially to allege a violation of the act by the defendant. It did, however, state that the evidence that supported a finding that the act was violated was either introduced by the defendant or not objected to by the defendant. The defendant claims that the court could not render a judgment for the plaintiffs on the basis of noncompliance with the act because it is a special defense and one not encompassed in the plaintiffs\u2019 general denial. The plaintiffs claim that the court could consider the act even though they only alleged a violation of the Home Solicitation Sales Act as a special defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In order to determine the effect of the plaintiffs\u2019 failure specially to allege a violation of the act as a defense, we must examine certain facts. On the fourth day of the trial, the court and the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel engaged in a colloquy concerning the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was the first time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>that the act was mentioned at trial. On the last day of trial, after the defendant had rested his case on his counterclaim, the plaintiffs moved to dismiss the defendant\u2019s counterclaim pursuant to \u00a7 302 of the Practice Book for failure to make out a prima facie case,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> relying specifically on the defendant\u2019s failure to demonstrate compliance with the act. The plaintiffs never sought to amend their special defense to allege noncompliance with the act. Practice Book \u00a7 174 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 failure specially to plead the Home Improvement Act violates Practice Book \u00a7 109A which provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen any claim made in a complaint, cross complaint, special defense, or other pleading is grounded on a statute, the statute shall be specifically identified by its number.\u201d The plaintiffs contend that Practice Book \u00a7 109A provides authority for the rule that a statute may be denominated numerically when it is relied upon in a party\u2019s pleading. We agree with the plaintiff\u2019s view. The word \u201cwhen\u201d as used in \u00a7 109A connotes a condition or a contingency; see Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed.); and may be equated with the word \u201cif.\u201d The purpose of \u00a7 109A is to allow the defending party to be aware of the precise statute upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>his adversary relies. <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Godou, </em>209 Conn. 273, 275, 550 A.2d 1073 (1988); <em>Gionfriddo </em>v. <em>Avis Rent A Car Systems, Inc., </em>192 Conn. 280, 290-91 n.10, 472 A.2d 306 (1984); <em>DeVita </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>13 Conn. App. 101, 103-104, 535 A.2d 364 (1987), cert. denied, 207 Conn. 807, 504 A.2d 375 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The question here, however, is not whether a statute was correctly identified by its number but whether a statute should have been specially pleaded as a defense. Section 164 of the Practice Book addresses whether a defense must be specially pleaded. The defendant implicitly relies on \u00a7 164 in his brief, and we will address his claim under this section. Section 164 of the Practice Book provides: \u201cNo facts may be proved under either a general or special denial except such as show that the plaintiffs statements of fact are untrue. Facts which are consistent with such statements but show, notwithstanding, that he has no cause of action, must be specially alleged. Thus, accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, coverture, duress, fraud, illegality not apparent on the face of the pleadings, infancy, that the defendant was non compos mentis, payment (even though nonpayment is alleged by the plaintiff), release, the statute of limitations and res judicata must be specially pleaded, while advantage may be taken, under a simple denial, of such matters as the statute of frauds, or title in a third person to what the plaintiff sues upon or alleges to be his own.\u201d The purpose of \u00a7 164 is \u201cto apprise the court and opposing counsel of the issues to be tried, not to conceal basic issues until the trial is under way . . . .\u201d <em>DuBose </em>v. <em>Carabetta, </em>161 Conn. 254, 261, 287 A.2d 357 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In his counterclaim, the defendant relied upon facts that supported an oral contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs attempted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>to prove at trial that, notwithstanding the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim grounded on oral contract, the defendant had failed to comply with either the Home Solicitation Sales Act or the Home Improvement Act, both of which require contracts for certain services to be in writing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The operative effect of a defense premised on the act is to render a home improvement contract invalid if the \u201centire agreement between the owner and the contractor\u201d is not in writing, even though it might otherwise be valid as an oral contract. Allegations that an oral agreement is unenforceable under the act are consistent with the defendant\u2019s allegations relying on an oral contract, \u201cbut show, notwithstanding, that [the defendant] has no cause of action .-. . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 164. Consistent facts must be specially alleged; id.; and may not be proved under a general denial. The fact that the writings of the parties did not contain the entire agreement of the parties, as admitted by the defendant in his testimony, and as found by the court, is a fact that destroyed the liability of the plaintiffs under the act, even if all of the facts as alleged in the defendant\u2019s counterclaim were true. Therefore, the act should have been specially alleged as a defense by the plaintiffs. See <em>Pawlinski </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>165 Conn. 1, 5-8, 327 A.2d 583 (1973). When the evidence needed to establish that no cause of action lies is consistent with the allegations necessary to establish a prima facie case, a special defense is required. <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>National Fence Co., </em>176 Conn. 622, 629-30, 410 A.2d 1007 (1979). We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that the plaintiffs should have pleaded the Home Improvement Act as a special defense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the defendant waived any deficiency in the pleadings by failing to object to evidence admitted under the Home Improvement Act. It is well established that a failure to allege a special defense is waived if evidence relating to that special defense is admitted without objection. <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>203 Conn. 281, 286, 524 A.2d 629 (1987); <em>Presnick </em>v. <em>DeRosa, </em>12 Conn. App. 554, 556, 532 A.2d 1309 (1987); see also <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>210 Conn. 503, 509, 555 A.2d 986 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Our scrutiny of the transcript of the proceedings before the trial court indicates that the evidence introduced by the plaintiffs could have been admitted under either the Home Solicitation Sales Act or the Home Improvement Act. The evidence that related solely to the Home Improvement Act, namely, that which established that the writings submitted did not contain the <em>entire agreement of the parties; </em>General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a); was not objected to by the defendant and was, in part, introduced by the defendant. The defendant, therefore, waived the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to specially plead the Home Improvement Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The question remains whether the trial court properly found for the plaintiffs on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The court relied entirely on the Home Improvement Act in rendering judgment for the plaintiffs on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim. The court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>that the work to be performed, as well as the business of the defendant, fell within the scope of that act. General Statutes \u00a7 20-419. The court further found that the evidence introduced by the parties unequivocally demonstrated that no written contract containing their entire agreement existed. The court found that it was impossible to reconcile the agreements in evidence to form a written contract containing the entire agreement between the parties because the agreements were full of contradictory terms, and that no writing clearly set out the scope of the work, extras or the many other details necessary to complete an agreement. Accordingly, the court concluded that the defendant's counterclaim relying on an oral contract was barred by General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a), which provides: \u201cNo home improvement contract shall be valid unless it is in writing and unless it contains the entire agreement between the owner and the contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">\u201cIt is well established that appellate courts will not retry facts or pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence. ... We are limited in our review to determining whether the judgment of the trial court was clearly erroneous, or if the judgment was contrary to law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Golfin </em>v. <em>Plymouth Industrial Development Corporation of Connecticut, Inc., </em>15 Conn. App. 804, 543 A.2d 287 (1988). The facts found by the trial court were sufficient for the court to have concluded that the agreement between the parties fell within the Home Improvement Act and that the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, relying on an oral contract, was barred by General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a). The facts found are not clearly erroneous, and the conclusion based upon those facts is legally and logically correct. The trial court did not err, therefore, in finding for the plaintiffs\u2019 on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The defendant\u2019s last claim is that the trial court erred in finding that the act precluded him from recovery under a theory of quantum meruit. The defendant\u2019s claim is disposed of by <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 717, 513 A.2d 43 (1986). In <em>Caulkins, </em>the court held that the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in concluding that General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 bars enforcement of oral home improvement agreements that have been fully performed was unavailing. The court\u2019s reasoning is applicable to the present case in that the language of \u00a7 20-429 (a) is \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d and precludes implied exceptions to its mandate that home improvement contracts must be in writing. Id., 717-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\"> The action was withdrawn as to the named defendant Philip N.

The defendant may offer evidence in the event the motion is not granted, without having reserved the right to do so and to the same extent as if the motion had not been made.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b607-7\"> The defendant also relied upon facts that supported his theory of recovery under quantum meruit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><em> </em>General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (the Home Improvement Act) provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) No home improvement contract shall be valid unless it is in writing and unless it contains the entire agreement between the owner and the contractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 42-135a (the Home Solicitation Sales Act) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo agreement of the buyer in a home solicitation sale shall be effective if it is not signed and dated by the buyer . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> Relying on <em>Caulkins </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>200 Conn. 713, 716 n.4, 513 A.2d 43 (1986), the plaintiffs contend that the \u00a7 20-429 (a) of the Home Improvement Act falls within the statute of frauds exception to Practice Book \u00a7 164. <em>Caulkins, </em>however, did not address the pleading problem at issue in this case, but rather addressed whether the Home Improvement Act, General Statutes \u00a7 20-429 (a), barred recovery under the doctrine of full performance, a common law exception to the provisions of the statute of frauds. General Statutes \u00a7 52-550.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b610-6\"> Even if the court had decided the case based on the special defense to the counterclaim of the Home Solicitation Sales Act, the result would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>been the same. The court found that the parties did not have an agreement in writing. The Home Solicitation Sales Act generally requires that the agreements covered by it be in writing; see General Statutes \u00a7 42-135a; although it may also be violated in a number of other ways. See General Statutes \u00a7 42-134a et seq. Whether the special defense was the Home Improvement Act or the Home Solicitation Sales Act, the defendant could not have recovered on his counterclaim, and the decision of the court could be upheld even if one of the special defenses should have been pleaded but was not.
