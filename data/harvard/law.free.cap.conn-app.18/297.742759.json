We find that the record in this case does not support the defendant\u2019s claim that he was deprived of any constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">This case involves allegations made by two minor victims that the defendant sexually abused them. The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. R and K are siblings and live across the street from the defendant. The defendant had a workroom in his garage, and R and K visited him there a number of times.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">R testified that in the fall of 1985, when she was seven years old, the defendant placed his hand down her pants and under her shirt on a number of occasions. On one of these occasions, the defendant placed his hand inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>R\u2019s pants and placed his finger in her \u201cprivate parts.\u201d The defendant cautioned R not to tell anyone about these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">K, R\u2019s older sister, testified that several times when she was thirteen years old, the defendant touched her breasts, buttocks and crotch. On one occasion, the defendant kissed K on the lips and put his tongue in her mouth. The defendant also asked K to touch him.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The defendant raises three claims of error on appeal that were not properly preserved at trial. See Practice Book \u00a7 4185. As to each, the defendant seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. We find the Supreme Court\u2019s recent admonition to appellate counsel appropriate to this case. A \u201cwholesale appellate reconstruction of the trial court proceedings does not serve the administration of justice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pelletier, </em>209 Conn. 564, 566-67, 552 A.2d 885 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>198 Conn. 77, 86-87, 502 A.2d 388 (1985). Appellate review of newly discovered issues cannot be guaranteed by couching every claim of error in the constitutional language of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, or the common law doctrine of plain error codified in Practice Book \u00a7 4185. Belated appellate scrutiny is warranted only for egregious errors that undermine the fairness of a trial and cast doubt on the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>210 Conn. 481, 484-85, 556 A.2d 154 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We have reviewed the defendant\u2019s claims of error and conclude that the record does not disclose that the defendant has been deprived of any fundamental constitutional right or a fair trial; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sergi, </em>7 Conn. App. 445, 448, 509 A.2d 56 (1986); or that any of the defendant\u2019s claims involve a \u201c \u2018truly extraordinary [situation], where the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings\u2019. . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Phu Dinh Le, </em>17 Conn. App. 339, 342, 552 A.2d 448 (1989), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>supra, 87-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the trial court\u2019s imposition of multiple punishments for the crimes of sexual assault in the fourth degree and risk of injury to a child violated his rights under the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the federal constitution and under Connecticut law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In particular, the defendant claims that because the long form information described the manner in which the defendant committed the crime of risk of injury to a minor as \u201csubjecting her to sexual contact,\u201d the two crimes were \u201cnominally\u201d the same for double jeopardy purposes. Both the Supreme Court and this court have conclusively held that the imposition of multiple sentences for convictions of sexual assault and risk of injury to a child does not violate the double jeopardy clause because these crimes are not considered the \u201csame offense\u201d for the purpose of double jeopardy as \u201ceach require[s] proof of an element not required by the other . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 162, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 91-92, 444 A.2d 896 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>13 Conn. App. 667, 671-72, 539 A.2d 150 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Trujillo, </em>12 Conn. App. 320, 335-36, 531 A.2d 142 (1987). The fact that the state has alleged that the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>conduct constituted the charges does not alter this result. <em>State </em>v. <em>Trujillo, </em>supra; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Per-ruccio, </em>supra, 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Because the defendant has not \u201cclearly been deprived of a constitutional right\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 70; his first claim is not reviewable under <em>Evans. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 322, 332, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>10 Conn. App. 302, 306-307, 523 A.2d 891, cert. denied, 204 Conn, 805, 528 A.2d 1152 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>10 Conn. App. 330, 334, 523 A.2d 906, cert. denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 523 (1987). Similarly, we find the defendant\u2019s assertion that this claim is reviewable as plain error equally unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The defendant\u2019s second unpreserved<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> claim is that he was deprived of his state and federal rights to due process of law and a fair trial by certain remarks made by the prosecutor during closing argument. <em>Evans </em>review of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is reserved for those cases in which the prosecutor\u2019s conduct manifested \u201can egregious pattern of blatant prejudicial misstatements\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>supra, 485; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>209 Conn. 423, 428, 551 A.2d 742 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 537, 529 A.2d 653 (1987); and has been denied in cases where the \u201c \u2018 \u201cclaimed misconduct consisted of isolated and brief episodes, and did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial.\u201d . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">We have reviewed the record in this case and conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation and, therefore, this claim does not merit full review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>supra. For similar reasons, we refuse to review this claim under the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The defendant\u2019s final unpreserved claim of error merits little discussion. The defendant claims a multitude of constitutional violations resulting from the trial court\u2019s sequestration order that in addition to requiring all witnesses, except the defendant, to remain outside the courtroom and not discuss the case, also precluded the defendant from discussing the case with potential witnesses. The defendant claims that this order precluded him from participating meaningfully in his own defense. We have reviewed the record in a limited way and conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim is not \u201ctruly of constitutional proportions [but] is simply characterized as such by the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>supra, 306; <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>supra, 334. Consequently, this claim is not reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. We reach this result after reviewing the circumstances of this case. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff </em>supra, 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Prior to trial, the court granted the state\u2019s motion to sequester all witnesses from the courtroom. The order also precluded all witnesses, including the defendant, from speaking about the case to each other. Although this order included the defendant, the trial court did not prohibit the defendant\u2019s attorney from conferring with witnesses. The defendant did not object to this order, but merely requested clarification as to whether the order pertained to him. During the course of the trial, the defendant did not request a modification of the sequestration order to allow him to confer with any particular witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We fail to see how a general sequestration order, which included the defendant, violated any of his constitutional rights, particularly in a case in which the defendant did not seek permission to talk to any wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>nesses during the course of the trial and does not argue any particular prejudice to his case. Any possible prejudice to the defendant would have undoubtedly been cured by the fact that the order did not encompass the defendant\u2019s counsel. Under the circumstances of this case, we decline to review this claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra. We are similarly unpersuaded that we should exercise our \u201cprincipled appellate discretion\u201d to review this claim under the plain error doctrine. The trial court\u2019s sequestration order did not constitute a \u201cmanifest injustice to the defendant so as to impair the effectiveness and integrity of the trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>supra, 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53-21. injury or risk of injury to, or impairing morals OF, children.
