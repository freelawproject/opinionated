Partnership. Before Judge Andrews. Warren Superior Court. April Term, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-7\">Rainwater sought to recover seventy-five bushels of corn from Usry, by possessory warrant. On the trial before the Judge <em>of </em>the County-Court, Rainwater testified that he and Usry farmed together, in 1867, each paying half the expenses and taking half of the crop; they gathered the corn, shucked it, and divided it, putting half into one crib and half into another, and each took possession of one crib and its cpntents. Both cribs were on Usry\u2019s land; and he testified that when the corn was so divided he considered it all his, until he was paid certain demands which 'he held against Rainwater, and until the expenses of the farm were paid. He admitted, that Rainwater had kept the key of one of the cribs, ever after said division, till he left the premises, meanwhile feeding his horse out of it, and he admitted^ that since Rainwater left, he, Usry, changed the lock of the crib to which Rainwater had had the key, and refused to allow him to use or remove the corn.,. He also put in evidence the contract between them, but what it was does not appear, except by inference from the petition for <em>certiorari. </em>Rainwater, re-examined, testified that ho had paid the liens on his part of the crop, and that Usry sold the cotton raised by them, and had paid no part of its proceeds to him. The Judge of the County-Court ordered the corn delivered to Rainwater.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-8\">Usry sued out a certiorari, averring that the Judge of the County-Court erred in said judgment, because the corn was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the joint property of TJsry &amp; Rainwater, whose partnership is not yet dissolved, because, by the contract, neither was to have any exclusive right to any part of the crop till the expenses of the farm were paid, and because possessory warrant was not the proper remedy under the circumstances. Judge Andrews affirmed the decision of the Coiinty-Judge. That is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-4\">\u25a0 Toombs &amp; DuBose, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEL\">relied on sections 1880, 3956, of Irwin\u2019s Code and 18th Ga. R., 664.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-5\">E. H. Pottle, for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7b\">relied on 34th Georgia Reports, 224.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b337-6\">McCay, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Nothing is more common among \u201c croppers\u201d than to separate the corn as it is gathered, into equal lots, put each lot in a separate crib, and agree that each person at interest shall feed his stock out of a designated crib, of which he keeps the key. In such arrangements there is no intent to divide the crop. It is nothing but a convenient and satisfactory mode, by which to keep an account of what each one uses, since, when the final division is made, the deficiency in each crib is conclusive of the account. The habits of our people, who are very often \u201cout of corn,\u201d even before the crop is gathered, makes this practice a great convenience. The arrangement is made long before it is possible to know what will be a proper division, after the cotton is gathered and the expenses are paid, and it is not intended as a severance of the joint ownership. So long as this continues, the <em>possession </em>of one is the possession of both, and a possessory warrant does not lie between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">TYe see no evidence in this record of any severance of the <em>ownership </em>of this corn, and, although it is true that in such trials the right to the possession is the only thing at issue, yet there are eases (and this is one of them) where the possession depends'upon the ownership. So long as this corn belongs to the partnership, the possession of one is the posses<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>sion of both, and there is no such possession of either as c'omes within the meaning of the Act of 1821, or the provisions of the Code, generally known as the possessory warrant law.</p>\n<p id=\"A8-K\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
