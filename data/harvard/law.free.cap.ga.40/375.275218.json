Whereupon the landlord filed a bill against the tenant, alleging <em>his </em>repeated violations of the agreement, and performance thereof on <em>his </em>part, the insolvency of the tenant, and danger of loss to the landlord in consequence of the bad management of the' tenant, praying for an injunction, and the appointment of a Receiver to take charge of the plantation stock, and crop growing thereon, etc., until the further order of the Court. The Court granted the injunction, and appointed a Receiver, as prayed for in complainant\u2019s bill, and upon a motion being made to dissolve the injunction and revoke the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>appointing a Receiver, on the coming in of the defendant\u2019s answer, the Court overruled the same: <em>Held, </em>that upon the state of facts contained in the record, this Court will not control the discretion of the Court below in refusing to dissolve the injunction and revoke the order appointing the Receiver to take charge of and secure the crop thereon, and- other property, for the present year; but if, in the discretion of the Court below, it should be necessary to keep the property and plantation in the hands of a Receiver until the termination of the litigation between the parties, then it is the judgment of this Court that the complainants should be required to furnish all the necessary means and supplies tp the Receiver to make a crop, and carry on the plantation for the ensuing year, as is specified in the written agreement for the lease of the premises, for the mutual benefit of the parties interested, as stipulated in that agreement, and in the event the complainants shall fail or refuse to do so, then that the order appointing a Receiver should be revoked and set aside.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b384-5\">Equity Practice.

After the judgment of the Supreme Court in that case ha'd been made the judgment of the Court below, Ross <em>&amp; </em>Son and Robenson began negotiations for a settlement of the matter as between them. They entered into a certain agreement with him, (which does not appear in this record,) under which he seems to have kept possession of the Chehaw place, etc. Ross <em>&amp; </em>Son undertook to sell said Chehaw place, etc., under the power granted in the mortgage, but Robenson procured the military authorities to prevent them from perfecting said sale.

They aver that they did comply with the contract, but that Robenson fraudulently violated it, in that he had never paid the $500 00 rent for 1868, did not deliver them all the cotton made on the Che-haw place, had misappropriated the money, etc., furnished him under said contract; that though they furnished him more than was necessary to carry on the farm, he had wasted much of it in foolish extravagance; he had not attended to the farm, and owes them for advances made under said contract $7,000 00; that he is insolvent, and a spendthrift; 'that they have no means of securing their said advances but the cotton crop of 1868, and yet that, because he demanded more money, and they would not supply it, he notified them that he would treat said contract as utterly void. They averred that this notice was given when the crop was about maturing, and with a fraudulent intent by Robenson to appropriate the crop to his own use; that part of it would necessarily go to the laborers, and they Ross &amp; Son, ought to have the balance under said contract. In 'order that they might get it, they prayed that Robenson be enjoined from disposing of any of the property, and that this farm be put into the hands of a Receiver, who should take care of the farm and stock, gather and sell the crops, and account to the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">To this bill was appended a statement of the account of Ross &amp; Son against Robenson, from the 1st of January, 1869, to the 17th of August, 1869, amounting to $8,305 16, credited by \u201cproceeds 11 bales cotton,\u201d 1st January, 1869, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>$1,202 69, There are $2,609 81-100 of this account covered by \u201cmerchandize\u201d and \u201cfreights,\u201d without further specifications,- $2,533 46 is \u201cbalance from account of 1868\u201d without more; the remainder of the account is as follows: \u201c1869, January 1st, acceptance draft for mules, $1,600 00; 22d, paid Schofield $5 00; 26th, acceptance of Wheeler draft, $228 27; March 1st, sight draft paid Stokes, $163 99; April '1st, stai\u00fcps on deeds, $6 00; 15th, paid John Mosely $18 50; \u25a0 17th, taxes paid by Stokes, $110 28; May 7th, cash $70 00; 31st, money advanced by Stokes, $150 00; June 21st, paid Ramsey $30 00; August, 16th, 50 bushels corn at $1 25, $69 30; 17th, note for renewal life insurance, $130 55; Aug. 17th, rent for 1868, $500 00.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\">On August 26th, 1860, without-a hearing, the Chancellor granted the injunction as prayed for, and appointed one Tyson as Receiver, to take and keep said property till further order. Robenson answered the bill. He gave\u2019 a history of the origin of the $6,000 00 notes, stated substantially as in <em>Robenson vs. Vason et ul., 37th Georgia Reports, </em>66. He said the terms of the first agreement 'were fixed upon, but the agreement was not executed, because some of the mules died, and all of the corn on the pla\u00f3e was burnt before its consummation. Then Ross <em>&amp; </em>Son attempted to sell the property under the power granted in the mortgage, but the sale of the plantation was stopped by the military order forbidding sales under judgments, etc. While they were so prevented from selling, said second contract was executed in pursuance of a written memorandum, agreed to between the parties, and in pursuance of that memorandum, he allowed the property sold, made his.deeds and bills of sale to Ross <em>&amp; </em>Son for the same, and they gave him a written power of redemption; that no money was paid to him at said sale, as purchase-money, but that all this was but one transaction, and not intended for a sale, but simply to secure Ross &amp; Son\u2019s claims against him, and was not made in a spirit of generosity, but because of the difficulty of collecting debts; that Ross &amp; Son were anxious to secure themselves-by giving credit. He said that he in good faith, tried to comply with jfche contract, but they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>furnished him provisions so scantily and so niggardly that he could only cultivate four hundred and fifty acres, when the understanding was, that he was to cultivate all of the farm, and they would not furnish him enough for tilling even that much properly; th\u00e1t he had no wagon, no gin gear; the, fences, gin-house and negro-houses needed repairing, there was no crib .for the corn, and Ross <em>&amp; </em>Son knew these repairs were heeded when the contract was made, and after, and refused to furnish the money to make them, and thereby cut off the crop greatly. He said he delivered them all the cotton made in 1868, except what the .laborers owned, sending them even all that was raised on his son\u2019s place. He 'answered that their account of 1868 was incorrect, but he could not say how, \u00abas they had not set out that account; as to the account of 1869, he said the $1,600 00 ought not to be charged to him, as Ross &amp; Son held the titles to the mules, and claimed them as theirs; that $75 00 was paid Stokes for a pair of steers, which also belonged to Ross &amp; Son; that the $70 00 cash, and the $150 00 advanced by Stokes, was on an independant contract and independant security given by Robenson to Ross &amp; Son, and that he was not bound for the $130 Q0 for insurance. He denied all fraud on his part, charged that Ross &amp; Son fraudulently withheld supplies to ruin him, and said that he gave them the notice charged simply to protect himself, and with no intention to avoid paying their just claims against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-4\">He further averred, that the consideration of'a part of said debt was slaves or their hire, and part was Confederate money, and part for taxes paid to the Confederate Government to carry on the late war; that there could be no recovery as to the two former, and only such amount as a jury may find as to the last; that he had lost much by the war, which Ross Son aided in carrying on, and he claimed the benefit of the Homestead Act 'against any recovery they plight have against him. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-5\">To this answer was appended, as an exhibit, copies of said memorandum and said contract, as to the privilege of redemption, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>\u201c </em>This memorandum of an agreement between J.

We have to pay cash for wagons, and we haven\u2019t it to advance, and 'you must manage to get through this year with what you have. \"When the plantation gets out of debt, then we can afford to make additional expenditures, but for the present we cannot advance anything for the plantation, only what is absolutely requisite to feed the hands and mules.\u201d They also read a letter from Robenson to Ross <em>&amp; </em>Son, dated August 17th, 1869, as follows: \u201cI wish to have timber gotten out for cribs and will have to purchase lumber for the cribs, and also for other purposes, upon the plantation, and, will have to hire a workman and hands to assist in doing the work. You will please send me $250 00, with which I will endeavor, by economy, to have done tlie work that is now necessary to be done * * * *. It is absolutely necessary that the work should be don\u00e9 at once, and l can not do without the money ;\u201d-and the reply of Ross &amp; Son, in which they said, \u201c until w\u00e9 receive from it (the farm) what is already due us, we must decline furnishing only necessary supplies:\u201d They also read Robenson\u2019s reply to this,, in which he averred his own good faith, charges that they had acted fraudulently, to cramp him and render him unable to comply with his contract, and closed by saying that because of their failure to comply, he should \u201ctreat the whole arrangement, made in May, 1868, as utterly void, on account of your (their) repeated violation of it.\u2019*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">Besides said deeds and contracts, many affidavits were read <em>fro </em>and <em>con. </em>The affidavits in behalf of Ross &amp; Son went to show that Robenson was enriching that part of the land belonging to his son, at the expense of Ross &amp; Son, that he had not taken proper care of the stock, fences, etc., that he only saved part of the corn crop, and that that part was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>damaged, that Stokes had furnished Robenson for Ross <em>&amp; </em>Son about $1,200 00 in merchandize.
