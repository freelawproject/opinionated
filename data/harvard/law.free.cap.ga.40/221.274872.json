On the trial the plaintiff offered to prove \u201cthat printed hand-bills, signed \u201cMeador &amp; Tumlin,\u201d advertising for hands to work in the stone-quarrying business, were distributed at various points and stuck up at various places at Stone Mountain, and. that one of them was stuck upon the door of the house where Tumlin boarded,\u201d which evidence was ruled out by the Court. There being a verdict in favor of Tumlin, a new trial was granted by the Court below, which was excepted to : <em>Held, </em>that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>copartnership cannot be proved by general reputation, but the fact that printed hand-bills, with the firm name signed thereto, stuck up at various places in the town where the defendant was residing at the time, one of which was stuck upon the door of the house where he boarded, was <em>competent </em>evidence to be submitted to the jury for their consideration upon the trial of the issue between the parties, and as this evidence was rejected by the Court the judgment of the Court below granting a new trial in the case should be affirmed ,on that ground alone.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b230-4\">Partnership. Evidence. Before Judge P\u00f3pe, DeKalb Superior Court. March Term, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-5\">Goldsmith, as trustee of Mrs. Henry, sued Tumlin and 'John T. Meador, as partners, upon a promissory note for $1,950 00, dated 1st March, 1867, due the 26th of June, 1867, and signed \u201cMeador <em>&amp; </em>Tumlin.\u201d Tumlin pleaded the general issue, that he did not sign or make said note, nor authorize any one to do so for him, that no such copartnership as \u201cMeador &amp; Tumlin\u201d ever existed, nor was he ever a member of any such firm, and that if such a firm had existed, it was dissolved before said note was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b230-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys read in evidence the note, after examining Meador, to show that there was such a firm as \u201c Meador &amp; Tumlin\u201d in the business of quarrying stone at Stone Mountain, Georgia, prior to the date of said note. While Meador was being examined, plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to prove by him that printed hand-bills, signed \u201cMeador &amp; Tumlin,\u201d advertising for hands to work in said stone-quarrying business, were distributed at various points, at the suggestion of Tumlin, and stuck up at various places at Stone Mountain, and he offered to testify that one of them was stuck upon the door of the house where Tumlin boarded; and while Goldsmith was being examined, they proposed to show by him that some hay and a box of mule shoes came to Stone Mountain, consigned to \u201c Meador <em>&amp; </em>Tumlin,\u201d when Tumlin lived near the depot. The Court ruled out this offered evidence,because it was not shown that Tumlin- knew that the handbills were so put up, or that said goods were so directed, or that lie acquiesced in the same. The witnesses were allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>to testify that such hand-bills were printed and circulated at Tumlin\u2019s request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel proposed to prove by various witnesses that it was generally understood at Stone Mountain, and the common talk there, that Tumlin was the partner of Meador in said stone business, and that the firm name was \u201c Meador &amp; Tumlin,\u201d but the Court would not allow it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-5\">The substance of Meador\u2019s testimony was that, in 1866, he was quarrying stone, being one of the joint owners of Stone Mountain; that Tumlin bought an interest in the property, and had control of the share of another owner; that Meador controlled the share of another owner, and they jointly paid the remaining owner for his part; that the business, by him, was carried on in the name of the \u201c Granite \"Works;\u201d that he and Tumlin formed a partnership in the same business, and for some time carried on the business under that name, but afterwards, at Tumlin\u2019s request, the name was changed to \u201c Meador &amp; Tumlin;\u201d that said note was given for money borrowed and used for Meador <em>&amp; </em>Tumlin, and that though the owners sold out the property before said note was made, <em>\u201c </em>Meador <em>&amp; </em>Tumlin\u2019s\u201d business was continued for some months after the date of the note, in finishing up their work, etc.; that a 'job for Bell for near $5,000 00, and another for the Masonic Hall Company for near $3,000 00, were finished after the date of the note. His testimony was supported by other witnesses and facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-6\">On the other hand, Tumlin swore that there never was such a firm; that he never authorized his \u00f1am\u00e9 to be used, never authorized the hand-bills to be printed, nor the goods to be marked as aforesaid, and did not know that such firm name was being used, etc. He admitted that he had attended, a sale of Bell\u2019s property, and bid $20,000 00 for it, to protect the lien of a <em>fi.fa. </em>in favor of \u201cMeador <em>&amp; </em>Tumlin,\u201d sued out against Bell, and he supported his side by other witnesses and facts. There was evidence as to whether there was a dissolution before the date of said note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b231-7\">The jury found for plaintiff against Meador only. Goldsmith moved for a new trial upon the grounds that the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>erred in ruling out said offered evidence, and because the verdict was against the evidence, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">The Court granted a new trial upon the last ground, overruling the others. This is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-6\">Hill <em>&amp; </em>Candler, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjX\">said \u201c reputation \u201d was inadmissible in this case: Irwin\u2019s Code, secs. 3717, 3718, 3719; 20th Wend., 81; 22d Wend., 264; 16 Maine R:, 192; 3 Hill N.

It is well settled that a copartnership cannot be proved by reputation alone. The evidence offered by the plaintiff that printed hand-bills, with the firm name of \u201c Meador &amp; Tumlin \u201d signed thereto, were stuck up at various places in the town where Tumlin lived at the time, and that one was stuck upon the door of the house where he boarded, was <em>competent </em>evidence to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>been submitted to the jury on the trial of the issue betweln the parties. The sticking up of the printed hand-bills, with the firm name signed thereto, where the defendant might reasonably be expected to have seen them, was a <em>fact </em>which should have been submitted to the jury for their consideration, and as this evidence was rejected by the Court, we affirm the judgment of the Court below, granting the new trial on that ground alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Let the judgment of the Court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
