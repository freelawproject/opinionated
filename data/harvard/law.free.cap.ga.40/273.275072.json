R. Smith, to submit to arbitration a controversy which he had with them, concerning certain cotton. The January Term, 1867, of Floyd Superior Court, was adjourned till in April, 1867. On the 9th of February, 1867, the arbitrators heard the cause and 'made an award, and gave to each of the parties a copy of it. On the 17th- of April, before said Adjourned Term convened; counsel of Cothran &amp; Smith gave written notice to Chisolm\u2019s counsel, that, at the then approaching Adjourned Term, they would 'object to judgment upon said award, and move to vacate it, upon grounds stated in said notice. When the Adjourned Term met, and said cause was called, in its order on the motion docket, on the 22d of of April, 1867, said award was entered upon the minutes of the Court, in presence of counsel of Cothran &amp; Smith; On the 22d of April, 1867, said counsel for Cothran &amp; Smith filed certain objections to said award, and they were entered upon the minutes of said Court. These objections were not verified. On the 24th of April, 1867. Chisolm\u2019s <em>counsel </em>entered up a judgment against Cothran <em>&amp; </em>Smith for the amount found in his favor, against them, by said award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">Afterwards, in May, 1867, Cothran &amp; Smith made affidavit to said objections, but it was conceded in the argument that this was after said Term adjourned. At the July Adjourned Term of said Court, Chisolm\u2019s-counsel demurred to said objections, because they were not made at the January Adjourned Term, and because they were insufficient in law. The Court below overruled the demurrer, and ordered a trial to be had on said objections, this is assigned as error. (As this Court did not pass upon the merits of the objections, they are immaterial here.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-6\">Printup &amp; Fouche, E. N.
