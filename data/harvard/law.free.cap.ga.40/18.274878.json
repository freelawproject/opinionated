The testator also desired that his other property should be sold, and out of the proceeds thereof, after the payment of his debts and certain specific legacies therein named, and after the defrayal of the expenses incident to the execution of his will, the subsistence and removal to the new and contemplated homes of the negroes intended to be manumitted, that the residue should be divided among his negroes who should thus become free, to be paid to each person eighteen years of age, on his or her' \u25a0 ' arrival in his or her new home. In 1859 the Legislature passed an Act which declared \u201cthat <em>from and after the passage of this Act </em>any and every clause in a deed, will, or other instrument, made for the purpose of conferring freedom on slaves directly or ipdirectly, within or without the State, to take effect after the 'death of the owner, shall be absolutely void.\u201d The testator died in September, 1868, never was married, and left no children at his death: <em>Held, </em>that inasmuch as the testator violated no law of the State at the time of the execution of his will in 1852, that the same remained ambulatory until the time of his death in 1868, at which time the Act of 1859 had become <em>obsolete, </em>and that the Act of 1859 did not, in law, operate upon and revoke the testator\u2019s will made in 1852, there being no <em>act </em>of the testator showing that it was <em>his intention </em>to revoke the same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b26-7\"><em>Held further, </em>That it is a cardinal rule, in the construction of wills, to carry into effect the <em>intention </em>of the testator, when such intention violates no law of the State, and as the testator violated no law of the State in the <em>expression of his intention, </em>in regard to his slaves, at the time of making his will, and as there was no law in existence at'the time of his death which forbid the execution of <em>that </em>intention, tho same should be carried into effect by the Courts.

It was the testator\u2019s intention that the writing should not have effect as a will unless his negroes therein mentioned and referred to should remain with him as his slaves until his death, and during all that time should serve and obey him as his slaves; and these caveators say that long before the death of said Owen Thomas, viz: three years, the said negroes accepted the emancipation procl\u00e1imed by the President and confirmed by the State Convention, and abandoned and deserted the said Thomas, and never again acknowledged him as master or served him as slaves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-11\">oth.

The testator also desired that his other property be sold, and out of the proceeds thereof, after the payment of his debts and certain specific legacies therein named, and after the defrayal of the expenses incident to the execution of his will, the subsistence and removal to their new and contemplated homes of the negroes intended to be manumitted, the_residue should be divided among his negroes who should <em>thus become free, </em>to be paid to each person eighteen years of age, on his or her arrival in his or her new home. The testator died in the month of September, 1868 ; never was married, and left no children at his death. In the year 1859, six or seven years after the execution of the will by the testator, the General Assembly of this State passed an Act declaring <em>\u201c </em>that <em>from and after the passage of the same, </em>any and every clause in a deed, will, or other instrument, made for the purpose of conferring of freedom on slaves directly or indirectly, within or without the State, to take effect after the death of the owner, shall be absolutely void.\u201d It is insisted here, that this Act of the General Assembly operated upon, and had the effect, to revoke the will of the testator, made in 1852, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>at least so far as it related to the manumission of his slaves, and that inasmuch as he died without any republication of his will after the slaves became free, he died intestate as to the bequests and provisions made to and for them thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The first question to, be considered is, whether the Act of 1859 revoked the testator\u2019s will made in 1852? At the time the will was executed it was a lawful and valid will -under the then existing laws of this State. Did the Act of 1859 have a <em>retroactive </em>operation so as to defeat the <em>legal </em>expressed intention of the testator as contained in his will of 1852, so as to revoke the same without any <em>act </em>on his part ? In our judgment the Act of 1859 did not, and could not, upon any sound principle oft construction have that effect. All laws (says Blackstone) should be made to commence <em>in futuro, </em>and be notified before their commencement, which is implied in the term \u201c prescribed\u201d: 1st Blackstone Commentaries, 46. Laws prescribe only for the future, they cannot impair the obligation of contracts, nor generally have a <em>retrospective </em>operation: Code, section 6. Besides, the Act of 1859, by its express terms, was not to take effect until <em>from and after its passage. </em>A will, as defined by the Code, is the legal expression of a man\u2019s wishes as to the .disposition of his property after his death: Code, section 2359. A testator, by his will, may make <em>any disposition of Ms property, </em>not inconsistent with thp laws, or contrary to the policy of the State: Code, 2364. At the time the testator made his will, (in 1852,) and expressed his wishes as to the disposition of his property after his death, his expressed wishes were <em>legal, not </em>inconsistent with the laws of the State, or contrary to the policy thereof, as has been repeatedly adjudicated by this Court. It is true that his will did not take effect as <em>his will </em>until after his death, but he had the <em>legal </em>right to make it at the time and in the manner he did, so that it <em>might </em>take effect after his death as to the disposition of his property, a <em>legal right </em>which the laws of the land expressly conferred upon him. When the testator had exercised this <em>legal right, </em>and made his will, the presumption of the law. is against its revocation: 1st Williams on Ex\u2019rs, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>There is no pretence in this ease that the testator\u2019s will was revoked by any <em>act </em>or <em>expressed intention </em>on his part, and the only <em>implied </em>revocations of a will, recognized by the Code, are when the testator has executed a subsequent inconsistent will, the marriage of the testator, or the birth of a child to him subsequent to the making his will, in which no provision is made in contemplation of such an event: Code, 2435, 2441. It is a cardinal rule in the construction of wills to carry into effect the expressed intention of the testator when such intention violates no law of the State. The testator in this case clearly intended to manumit his slaves, and to bequeath to them property <em>as freemen, </em>where they could enjoy it as such freemen, and hence the provisions in his will to carry into effect that intention; but before his death the laws which prohibited them from enjoying their freedom <em>here </em>became <em>obsolete ; </em>in other words, freedom came to them instead of their having to seek it under the provisions of the testator\u2019s will. The intention of the testator, when he made his will, was, that they should <em>he free, </em>and they being free at the time of his death, when the will took effect, his intention was carried out, though not in the manner contemplated when the will was made; but their freedom <em>now </em>is entirely consistent with his intention <em>then, </em>as expressed in his will upon that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">In the construction of legacies given by a will, the Court will seek diligently for the <em>intention </em>of the testator, and give effect to the same as far as may be consistent with the rules of law: Code, 2420. The will of the testator was valid at the time of its inception, (to-wit) at the time it was made, (in 1852,) and was a valid will at the time of its consummation, (to-wit) at the time of the death of the testator, not having been revoked by any act of the testator, or by operation of law. The testator violated no law of the State in expressing his intention in regard to his slaves at the time he made his will, and no law of the State will be violated in now carrying into effect that intention, as the same is presumed to have existed at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">As it was clearly the <em>intention </em>of the testator that his slaves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>should <em>be free </em>and epjoy the property given to them by his will, as <em>freemen; </em>it is the duty of the Court to carry into effect <em>ihat intention, </em>which, under the present existing laws of the State, can as well be done <em>here </em>as in Liberia, or in any other foreign State; they are now free <em>here, </em>and can enjoy their freedom <em>here, </em>and being free <em>here, </em>they can receive and enjoy the property bequeathed to them by the testator <em>here, </em>as such freemen, in accordance with the expressed wishes of the testator, as contained in his will at the time of his death: Let the judgment of the Coui;t below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
