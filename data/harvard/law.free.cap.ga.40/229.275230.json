The Solicitor General offered evidence of the value of the hog. This was objected to because no value was averred in the indictment. The Court sustained the objection. The defendants were found guilty. Defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s moved to arrest the judgment because no value was averred in the indictment, nor proved upon the trial. The Court overruled the motion,, holding that: 1st. Since the distinction between grand and petit larceny was abolished, value was immaterial; 2d, value is immaterial when'the statute makes the taking of a specific thing, larceny ; and 3d, because this objection to the indictment came too late, under section 4546, Irwin\u2019s Code. This is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-5\">Gartrell <em>&amp; </em>Jackson, for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFm\">said larceny is of personal goods: Irw.

By the common law, at the time of our statute adopting it, the <em>value </em>of the property, in an indictment for simple larceny, was required to be alleged and proved on the trial. \u201cWhere personal' chattels are'the subject of an offense, as in larceny, they must be described specifically by the names usually appropriated to them, and the number and <em>val\u00fae </em>of each species or particular kind of goods, stated.\u201d Archibold\u2019s Criminal Pleading, 22. On the trial for larceny, evidence must be given that the thing stolen is of <em>some value: </em>Roscoe\u2019s Criminal Evidence, 512. This principle of the common law is still of force in this State, and the failure to allege'in the indictment the value of the property charged to have been stolen, is a good ground for arresting the judgment after verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
