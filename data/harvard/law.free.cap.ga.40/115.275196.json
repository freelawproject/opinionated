Though there are no .formal worths of the action of assumpsit, the prayer ended, \u201c to answer your petitioner assumpsit.\u201d The pleas were, 1st, the general issue, 2nd, that .the Court could not enforce said claim because it was for a -debt, the consideration of which was a slave, and 3rd, that on the 27th of December, 1862, McAffee was worth $42,000 00 and at the surrender of the Confederate armies he was worth but $15,000 00, said loss having been caused \u201cby the emancipation of his slaves, and the destructive and ruinous effects \u25a0of the war.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys demurred to said second plea. The demurrer -was overruled. Defendant\u2019s counsel then moved to dismiss said cause, upon -the ground that its averments were insufficient to base a recovery upon. Before the Court had pronounced its judgment upon this motion, plaintiff\u2019s counsel amended the petition, by, inserting therein, at the point indicated by the * <em>ante, </em>that McAffee falsely and fraudulently represented said slave to be sound and healthy, knowing that she was not so, and thereby effected said exchange, to Mulkey\u2019s damage, $1,000 00, and filed also another amendment, in no material point different from the other, except that it gave the nature of the disease of which she died, and the facts of the trade somewhat in detail. Defendant\u2019s attorneys objected to these amendment^ upon the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>they made an action for deceit, and that such action could not be joined with assumpsit. The Court allowed the amendments and then overruled the motion to dismiss. The only facts about which there was a contest below -were whether said slave died of unsoundness which existed at the time of the trade,, and whether defendant knew of said unsoundness and falsely represented her as sound. Upon the first of these points the evidence was as follows: For the plaintiff, he and many other witnesses testified that they knew,the slave from the 28th of December, 1862, till said date of her death, that she had on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of January, 1863, a very bad cough, expectorated much offensive'and bloody matter, and was wholly unable to do any work, aauj was an expense \u2022and trouble to plaintiff till her death. In reply, the defendant, his overseer and overseer\u2019s wife, and a negro man, testified that they had known said slave for several years, prior to said trade, that she worked regularly and so far as they knew was sound and healthy. As to the <em>scienter, </em>the plaintiff testified that defendant offered to let him have either of three women, that he selected Ann and took a bill of sale, but'on the next morning had his suspicions aroused by defendant\u2019s offering Ann..a pair of shoes, which were then very high, (worth $8 00,) saying that she might take cold and be sick, and by a conversation between McAffee and his wife, of which he could understand nothing, except that she did not wish McAffee to sell Ann to him; defendant was then asked to let him have another of said women- and consented, but upon that womap saying she would not go with plaintiff, defendant said, \u201cyou see I have done all I can,\u201d and plaintiff said-no more. It was shown that the physician who attended upon Ann, in her last illness, was dead. Another physician testified that such symptoms, as aforesaid exhibited in January, 1863, showed that she had an abcess of the lungs wljich must have been some time in forming, that she must have had the disease four or five weeks, perhaps longer, perhaps for years before her death, and that if said symptoms so manifested themselves early in January, 1863, her unsoundness must have been very appareht to any one, long before the 27th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>December, 1862. Another physician testified that he was defendant\u2019s family physician in 1860, 1861, 1862, and perhaps longer, and that between February and July, 1861, he presented a bill to defendant for treating Ann two or three weeks in thesummer of 1860, for a complication of inflammation of the womb and pneumonia, and that defendant said he ought not to pay the full amount because his' wife said Ann was not sound. Defendant testified that he did not know Ann was unsound, honestly believed she was sound, and put said words in the bill of sale because he had recently had two of his soundest slaves to die, and then determined never to warrant \u00e1 slave sound beyond the date of sale, and that he told plaintiff this at the time, as the reason for inserting those words. There was no other evidence as to representations as to Ann\u2019s health.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">Defendant\u2019s attorneys during the trial, offered to show the loss of his property, as pleaded! The Court held that the \u201cRelief Act\u201d did not apply to this cause and rejected the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">The Court charged the jury : 1st. \u201cThis is not an action on the contract to hold McAffee liable' on the warranty, but an action of deceit, for and on account of the false and fraudulent representations made by McAffee, at or about the time of the sale. 2nd. If McAffee, at, or about the time of the sale, represented the negro to be sound, and she was not sound at the time of sale, and McAffee knew she was not sound, then he is liable for such false and fraudulent representation, and you will so find. 3d. But if McAffee made such representations in good faith, not knowing that the negro was unsound, he is not bound, and you will so find. 4th. If McAffee fraudulently and recklessly represented said negro to be sound, not knowing whether she was sound or not, with intent to deceive Mulkey, and she was unsound at that time, he is liable. To falsely and recklessly state a fact to be true, not knowing whether it is true or false, if intended to deceive, is equivalent to a knowledge of falsehood.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-8\">The jury found for plaintiff $*1,100 00, with costs. Defendant\u2019s attorneys moved for a new trial, upon the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>that the Court erred in allowing said amendments of the petition, in rejecting the evidence of McAffee\u2019s loss of property, that the verdict was excessive, unsupported by the law and evidence as, to <em>soienter, </em>and contrary to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd charges of the Court, and because the 4th charge was hypothetical.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-4\">The new trial was refused, and error is assigned on each of said grounds.
