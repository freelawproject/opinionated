The trial resulted in a verdict for the defendant. Barge moved for a new trial, but it was refused. He sued out a writ of error.</summary>\n\n\n\n<summary id=\"b560-10\">McCay, J., dissented, because he thought the copies of the notes were not necessary, under the circumstances.</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b560-11\">E.
