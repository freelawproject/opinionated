The return of the Sheriff in this case being taken to be true, the Court below erred in making the rule absolute against the Sheriff for the payment of the money, and in default thereof, that he be attached for contempt upon the statement of facts contained in said return.

April Term, 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-12\">On the 9th of October, 1869, Carr made affidavit that he was owner of certain described premises, and that he \u201crented said farm and eight mules and horses \u201d to James Moye on the 1st of January, 1868, upon his promise to deliver to Carr, or bearer, thirteen thousand pounds of lint cotton, middling\u2014 twenty-six bales packed and ready for market, on the application of the bearer of said obligation, at Carr\u2019s house, or No.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-13\">13 Central Railroad, as should be designated by said bearer \u201c for the rent of so much of the plantation\u201d as Moye wished to cultivate, \u201cand the use of the mules and horses now on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the place to the number of eight; that Moye promised \u201cto return\u201d him \u201cthe same amount of corn, fodder, peas and potatoes that I (Moye) get from him,\u201d (Carr,) and \u201cto pay him sixteen cents for the meat\u201d which- Carr should fur\"nish him; \u201cthat, said Moye, under the above contract, owes him for such renfrand for provisions the amount of $5,000 00, said produce being in the opinion of deponent worth that sum;\u201d that the rent is not due, but that Moye is seeking to remove his goods from the premises, and'that Cary apprehended the loss of the same unless a distress-warrant issue in his behalf. A distress-warrant issued, for $5,000 00, and the sheriff, Jesse Pound, on the 24th of said month, levied it upon the cotton, corn, etc., etc., on said premises. Moye, on the same day, replevied the property, giving bond and security for the eventual condemnation money in the usual form. In this bond it was recited that Moye had \u201c filed his affida- . vit, denying that any portion of the rent distrained for is due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aq9\">These papers were returned to said Court. When the cause was there called, and the parties were proceeding <em>to </em>trial, it was discovered that in fact Moye had not filed the affidavit required by law to stop the warrant, though it was so recited.in said bond. Thereupon the Court decided that he had no issue before him, and was passing to other cases on the docket when Carr\u2019s counsel asked for a rule against Pound, sheriff, requiring him to show cause <em>instanter </em>why he should not pay Carr the $5,000 00 c\u00e1lled for by the warrant. The rule was granted^ 'The Sheriff answered, that when Langmade &amp; Evans, Carr\u2019s attorneys, handed him the warrant, he immediately went and mad'e the levy, and got Lang-made to enter his levy upon the warrant; directly afterwards Mr. Gilmore, attorney for Moye, came and got the papers, saying Moye would replevy the property, and insisted*, on doing so then, though it was Saturday night; about an hour -afterwards the papers were returned to Pound. On Monday morning Pound handed the papers to Langmade, and asked him if he was \u201csatisfied with the bond, and if all was right.\u201d Langmade examined them, find said the bond was good, and all was right, or words to that effect. Then Pound returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>the papers to the Clerk\u2019s office of said Court. About a month afterwards Elournoy, of the firm of Gilmore &amp; Flournoy, called for the papers, and Pound got them from Langmade, and handed them to Flournoy; that Gilmore assured him the papers were all right when he handed them to him on said Saturday night, and \u201cJudge Jones told him (Pound) that the affidavit of Moye was drawn, or to be drawn, by R. L. Warthen, and all was right,\u201d and because the papers were from time to \u2022 time in the hands of the attprneys of either side, he (Pound) supposed all was done which was required by the law, and further, that the cause was docketed by Langmade. Further, he set up that the warrant was void, because the pretended rent was partly for the hire of mules, provisions, etc., that its amount was uncertain, and if he was liable at all on said rule, he prayed that the jury should find the amount due Carr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">This answer was not traversed, but the parties <em>pro </em>and <em>con </em>examihed said lawyers as witnesses before the Judge, (he having refused to submit the matter to a jury.) The rule was made absolute. Thereupon Pound\u2019s counsel sued out his bill of exceptions. In it there was no recital of the facts sworn to by these witnesses, except in \u00bfhis way. It appeared from the evidence that counsel on both sides believed.that the affidavit had been filed, and their assurances mislead the Sheriff; and it further appeared in evidence, that Langmade, plaintiff\u2019s attorney,, entered the case upon the docket, and told the Sheriff the papers were all right, though Langmade denied, when examined as a \u201cwitness, that he had said anything about the affidavit, or that his attention was called to it, saying that his opinion was confined to the bond, of which' he was speaking when he said \u201call was right.\u201d <em>/ '</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">When the cause was called here for a hearing, counsel for defendant in error moved to dismiss the bill of exceptions because the evidence was not set forth therein. This Court refused to dismiss the cause, but decided that they would hear nothing connected with the evidence. The grounds of' error - in the bill of exceptions were, that the, Court erred,, because said obligation could not be enforced by distress-war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>rant, because it was not for a sum certain, because it was for hire of mules, etc.', as well as for the use of land, because the affidavit did not state that any sum was \u201cdue\u201d to him \u201cfor rent,\u201d because no action lay on said obligation till a designation of the place of delivery and a refusal to deliver; that the Court erred in holding that a rule against the Sheriff was appropriate to this case, and that the Judge could pass upon it without the intervention of a jury, and in holding that the Sheriff was liable for the money, under the circumstances shown by the answer and evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-5\">James S. Hook, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP\">said the warrant was bad because this was not a rent contract, and Carr had not made the affidavit required by law: Irwin\u2019s Code, secs. 4010, 4011, 4012, 397 ; there had been no breach: Ib., sec. 2259; as to distress: 3d Kent\u2019s Com., 634; 9 Wend.

The Sheriff\u2019s answer was verified by his oath, and was to have been taken as true, unless traversed, as provided by the Code, and a verdict found by the jury against the truth thereof. i\u00a3n our judgment the Court below erred in making the rule .absolute against thp Sheriff for the payment of the money, .and in defalt thereof, that he be attached for contempt, upon .the statement of facts contained in the Sheriff\u2019s answer to the ..rule against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">.Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
