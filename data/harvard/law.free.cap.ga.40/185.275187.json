A. Fisher for $1,500 00, and took her individual note for it. Her husband was in the army, but she usually acted as his agent, and he supposed her husband would be bound by law by her promise. The husband died, and she became his administratrix, and had this piano appraised as part of his estate. Afterwards she married Moorefield, and McNeil was made administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Fisher, and advertised said piano for sale. Moorefield and his wife claimed it, but their claim was dismissed for some informality. Mrs. Moore-field has.the piano, will not pay the note, nor give it up to Davis, nor arbitrate the matter, and McNeil will not undertake to sell it under the circumstances, and therefore Davis can not claim it. He says that the note is .void, first, because he gave credit to a married woman, and because both being ignorant of the revenue laws, said note was never stamped, and therefore lie says the title of the piano is still in him. He prayed that he should recover the piano, or have other relief. The bill was dismissed upon the ground that Davis had a plain and adequate common law remedy. That is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-5\">E. G.
