Thebill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>of exceptions shows as follows: Hood, as administrator for Jarrett Turner, for the use of Francis Logan, sued Townsend, as maker, and 'William C. Henson, as endorser, on a, promissory note, payable to himself as such administrator, for $380 00, dated the 8th of July, 1861, due one day after date, signed by Townsend, and transferred as follows :_ \u201cI assign this note to F. Logan for $150 00, July the 16th, 1862.\u201d Whether this transfer was signed by any one does not appear. On this note were the following credits: $7 5 00, loth September, 1861; $12 40, 21st October, 1861; $17 00, 2d December,\u00ab1861; $20 00, April 1st, 1862. The defendants plead that the fi\u00f3te was given during the late war,, and that a tender of the full amount was made to plaintiff, and he refused to accept it. Plaintiff introduced the note and closed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">Townsend\u2019s wife testified that the latter part of 1863, or the first pari of 1864, she went with Confederate Treasury notes sufficient in amount to pay off the note, and offered to pay it therewith, but plaintiff said he had enough of that kind of money, and refused to accept the_payment, and said he did not look to Townsend for the money anyway. In rebuttal, plaintiff showed that at the date of said note no Confederate currency had been issued, and that at the time^ of the alleged tender\u2019, such currency was worth but five cents in the dollar of specie, and further, th\u00e1t after the war Townsend was dunned upon the note, made no objection to it, but left a fi\u00f3te for $150 00 for collection, with instructions to apply its proceeds to the payment of this note; that the jury scaled the collateral note to $50 00, and then Townsend refused to allow said $50 00 applied to this note unless it was accepted as full payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">Plaintiffs counsel requested the Coqrfc to charge the jury that if said note was made before Confederate currency was issued, the holder was not bound to take that currency in payment. The Court gave the request with this addition': \u201cbut there might, nevertheless, arise an' equity between the parties which might authorize you to reduce the amount, scale the note.\u201d He further requested the Court to charge that si\u00edch a tender alone would not authorize the jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>reduce the debt,, unless there was some equity arising out of the facts and circumstances of the case between the parties. The Court read the request to the jury, and said, \u201c I simply add that this would depend on the circumstances of the case, evidences .showing equities.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-4\">He further charged as follows, and not otherwise: \u201c If you are satisfied, from the evidence, that the defendant tendered the balance due on the note to the plaintiff, then he is entitled to such credit, or such a deduction, on the balance as you inay. think just and equitable.. If you are satisfied, from the evidence, that this note was made in July, 1861, after the war commenced, then it is a Confederate contract, and evidence would be admissible to show'equities between the parties, and if you are satisfied, by the evidence, that the' note was endorsed by W. C. Season to F. Logan, you may then inquire what is the date of that endorsement, and you may consider what the equities are'between Logan and Henson, for the endorsement made a new contract between Henson and Logan. So you may look into the date of the endorsement to get at the equities between them.\u201d Further, upon request of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, if you are satisfied, from the evidence, that this note was-given before the war commenced, and that it has never been transferred, or that it is-payable to orphans, the defendant,would take no benefit from the mere fact that he tendered the Confederate money.\u201d The jury-found for plaintiff for $25 00 only; whether against both does not appear. Plaintiff moved for a new trial upon the grounds, that the Court erred in his' said qualifications of plaintiff\u2019s requests to charge, and in charging as he did, and because the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence. The refusal of the new trial is complained of here.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-6\">John L. Faij\u00ed, H. P.

The note sued on was a Cionfederate contract, and is within the provisions of the Ordinance of 1865. In our judgment the Court below erred in not giving that Ordinance in charge to the jury, as the equities of the parties were to be regulated and adjusted by it. The Ordinance of 1865 was the law applicable to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Let the judgment of the Court below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
