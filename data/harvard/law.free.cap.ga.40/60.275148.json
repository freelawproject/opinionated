Ble was kept under arrest till next morning, and then told by Leonard that they had concluded to take what he had and let him go, upon his giving security not to trade again with the Feder\u00e1is. He gave the security and importuned Leonard not to take all he had, and Leonard let him keep one mule and his wagon, and kept the other mule, seventeen gallons of syrup and said halter. He testified, also, as to the value of the articles kept by Leonard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-5\">A person.who was arrested with Brakebill testified to the same facts, and plaintiff rested his cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">One of the defendants testified that the suspicion against Brakebill was excited by his having trunks in his wagon, that they arrested him under certain orders,- which, while he had not seen them, he knew by common report. It was shown that Leonard was a Captain under General Wheeler, and that these defendants were of Leonard\u2019s command;, it was, also, shown that orders issued in November, 1864) for Wheeler\u2019s men to leave North Georgia and join him, but that there was difficulty in sending orders through at that time, and it was not knowm whether Leonard had received this order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">General Wheeler testified by interrogatories, to which he appended copies of orders, which, he said, he received from General Beauregard. In one of these, dated 22nd October, 1869, and received by him 18th November, 1869, he was ordered among other things for him to do in North Georgia, \u201cshould the enemy advance anywhere, you will drive off all the stock in their front.\u201d Another, dated 18th November, 1869, ordered him to employ his cavalry \u201c to best advantage, retarding advance of Sherman\u2019s army and destroying supplies in his front;\u201d * * and to consume and destroy all sup.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>plies within his reach. By another, dated 28th November, 1864, Wheeler was notified that eight hundred dismounted Cavalry would report to him that night, and he was ordered to mount them \u201cas rapidly as possible, by capture or impressment, and use them to the best advantage.\u201d Plaintiff's counsel objected to the reading of these copy orders, as evidence, but the objection was overruled and they were read with General Wheeler\u2019s evidence. His evidence amounted to this: that,, if Leonard acted upon and within these orders, he was so acting by military order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">At this stage of the proceeding, before defendants had closed their testimony, the Judge remarked that \u201c the old man Brakebill had been badly treated, but he might charge it to the war,\u201d and announced the case dismissed, without any motion from defendant\u2019s counsel. In the bill of exceptions, he says he did so \u201c because it appeared that the property was taken in obedience to the orders of superior officers, and in accordance with the practice of soldiers in each army during the war, and because it was a useless waste of time to pursue a fruitless investigation.\u201d Judgment for costs was entered against plaintiff. His counsel-complain at said dismissal and judgment, and at the allowance of said copy orders as evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-6\">R.
