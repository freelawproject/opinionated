The petition made no averments whatever as the basis of his application. Counsel for plaintiffs in error objected to the assignment of the homestead because Pace was not the head of a family. Other objections were made by other creditors. The homestead was assigned. Plaintiffs in error appealed. Upon the appeal trial counsel for plaintiff in error moved to dismiss the application, because it did not show what property or assets Pace had, and which was' not included in his schedule, or that Pace was either the head of a family, or guardian, or trustee of a family of minor children. This motion was 'overruled. Pace\u2019s counsel demurred to said objection, filed in the Court of Ordinary. The demurrer was sustained, \"the Court holding that no such objection could be made in this case on the appeal trial. He further held, that no obj\u00e9c\u00edion could be then heard, except want of sufficiency or fullness of the schedule, or fraud of any kind, or to dispute the valuation of the property, or the propriety of the survey. Counsel for the plaintiffs in error proposed to prove to the jury that Pace was not the head of \u00e1 family, nor guardian, or trustee of a family of minor children. This evidence was rejected. These objections being all overruled, the counsel for plaintiffs in error declined proceeding further in the cause, and the Judge directed the jury to find for the applicant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-4\">They now say the Court erred in refusing to dismiss the application, in overruling the demurrer, in restricting them in the objections to be made to the application, in rejecting the evidence offered, and ordering the verdict for the applicant. /</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-5\">Hood &amp; Kiddoo, E.
