In an action to recover damages on account of disease alleged to have been communicated to the plaintiff\u2019s cattle by Texas and Cherokee cattle belonging to the defendant, and brought into this State in violation of the act of 1867 on that subject, if there be evidence tending to show that plaintiff\u2019s cattle were exposed to two lots of Texas and Cherokee cattle, one belonging to the defendant and the other to a third person, it would be improper to instruct the jury that if both lots contributed to infect plaintiff\u2019s cattle, and they were not able to say that one lot was concerned in doing so more than the other, they must find for the defendant. An instruction on that subject should be given only on the hypothesis that the disease was communicated by the cattle of the one party solely, and not by the cattle of both.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b437-9\" pgmap=\"437\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Kankakee county; the Hon.

We think the instruction should, at least, have been modified so as to have been given to the jury only on the hypothesis, that the disease was communicated by the cattle of the one party solely, and not by the cattle of both.</p> <p id=\"b438-9\" pgmap=\"438\">For error in giving this instruction the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b438-10\" pgmap=\"438\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
