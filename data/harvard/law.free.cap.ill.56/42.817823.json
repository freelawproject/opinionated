Replication \u2014 \u201c And the plaintiff, by way of replication to the amended plea of the defendant, by him secondly above pleaded, says, preclude non, because he says that the defendant has not sustained damage by reason of any acts or doings or representations of the plaintiff, in manner and form as is in said plea alleged. And this he prays may be inquired of by the country,\u201d etc. Issue joined thereon.</p> <p id=\"b45-6\" pgmap=\"45\">The replication admitted the contract set up in the plea and the breach thereof, in accordance with the rule, that every pleading is taken to confess such traversable matter of fact, alleged on the other side, as it does not traverse.</p> <p id=\"b45-7\" pgmap=\"45\">The only issue then, under this plea, was upon the damages. The proof was very clear that the goods were unmerchantable to a great degree, and of largely less value than they would have been, had they been of the quality as contracted for. The jury found for the plaintiff the fall amount of the note, allowing no damages.</p> <p id=\"b45-8\" pgmap=\"45\">The verdict was manifestly against the evidence in this respect, and a new trial should have been granted. Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b45-9\" pgmap=\"45\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
