There is nothing in the drawing referred to in the ordinance, nor in any of the papers or proceedings in the case, which tends, in the least, to define any such portions of the work, which have been already done. As the ordinance declares the work shall he done, under the superintendence of the hoard of public works, it is an attempt to clothe that board with a discretionary power which the law does not warrant, and this court will not tolerate; because it opens the door to fraud and favoritism. This case falls directly within that of Foss v. The City of Chicago, ante, p. 354, in which we held such an ordinance void. This point being decisive of the case, it is unnecessary to consider the others presented by the record and argued by counsel. The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b400-6\" pgmap=\"400\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
