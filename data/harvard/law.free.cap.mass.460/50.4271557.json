Higgins (employee) injured his back while working for the school department of Maynard. The employee filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the Department of Industrial Accidents (department). In connection with that claim, the self-insurer, Massachusetts Education and Government Association (self-insurer), requested that the employee submit to a medical examination pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 45. The employee sought to compel discovery of the medical report of that examination (\u00a7 45 report), and also to use the report to cross-examine the impartial medical examiner (impartial physician) appointed pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A. The self-insurer appeals from the decision of the reviewing board (board) of the department, finding in favor of the employee on both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>We agree that the employee is entitled to obtain a copy of the \u00a7 45 report and to use it in cross-examination of the impartial physician, and we therefore affirm the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the procedural history as well as certain facts found by an administrative judge and the board. On July 12, 2004, the employee injured his back while lifting trash barrels as part of his job for the school department. The employee filed a claim pursuant to \u00a7 10 of G. L. c. 152, the workers\u2019 compensation act (act). The self-insurer requested that the employee submit to a medical examination by Dr. William Shea, a physician it had selected, as the self-insurer was entitled to do under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 45 (\u201cif requested by the insurer . . . [the injured employee shall] submit to an examination by a registered physician, furnished and paid for by the insurer\u201d). Dr. Shea examined the employee on May 2, 2005. The self-insurer did not file a copy of Dr. Shea\u2019s report of his medical examination with the department, and neither Dr. Shea nor the self-insurer furnished a copy of it to the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Following a conference conducted pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A (1), the administrative judge ordered the self-insurer to pay the employee a closed period of total temporary disability benefits, an open period of partial disability benefits, and medical benefits. Disputing the cause of the employee\u2019s medical condition, the self-insurer appealed from the conference order and sought a hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A (3). In advance of the hearing, the administrative judge appointed Dr. Nabil Basta as the impartial physician to examine the employee and render an opinion in the form of a report as to the cause and extent of the employee\u2019s injury pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (\u00a7 11A report).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The self-insurer did not submit the \u00a7 45 report of its examiner Dr. Shea to the impartial physician for consideration, nor otherwise make use of the \u00a7 45 report in defending against the employee\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">On July 8, 2005, shortly before the impartial physician was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to conduct the impartial examination, the employee sought by motion to compel discovery of Dr. Shea\u2019s \u00a7 45 report. The administrative judge took no action, effectively denying the motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The impartial physician examined the employee and issued his impartial medical report on July 12, 2005. The employee requested and received permission to depose the impartial physician as permitted under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A transcript of the deposition, which took place on October 25, 2006, was submitted to the administrative judge. The impartial physician\u2019s report and deposition testimony constituted the sole medical evidence regarding the employee\u2019s injury placed before the administrative judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The administrative judge adopted the impartial physician\u2019s opinion as set forth in the \u00a7 11A report, and found that the employee suffered from a preexisting chronic degenerative disc disease that had been aggravated by a work-related injury. The administrative judge also found, in accordance with the impartial physician\u2019s opinion, that the impairment resulting from this injury had resolved by the date of the impartial physician\u2019s \u00a7 11A examination on July 12, 2005, and therefore ordered discontinuance of the employee\u2019s partial disability benefits as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In his appeal to the board pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11C, the employee argued in relevant part that he should have been permitted to discover Dr. Shea\u2019s \u00a7 45 report and to use that report in cross-examining the impartial physician at deposition. The board agreed, concluding in essence that employees who are subject to examinations conducted pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 45, are entitled to discovery and production of reports made in connection with such examinations. The board also concluded that due process concerns and the unique role of the \u00a7 11A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>impartial examiner in the workers\u2019 compensation scheme supported the employee\u2019s use of the \u00a7 45 report to cross-examine the impartial physician.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The self-insurer appealed to the Appeals Court, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2); we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">2. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review decisions of the board in accordance with the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (a)-(d), (f), and (g). <em>Scheffer\u2019s </em>Case, 419 Mass. 251, 257-258 (1994). Among the reasons we may reverse or modify a decision of the board is if it is \u201c[i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency\u201d; \u201c[b]ased on an error of law\u201d; \u201c[m]ade upon unlawful procedure\u201d; or is \u201c[a]rbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) <em>(b)-(d), </em>and (g). See <em>Scheffler\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 258 n.4. Although decisions of the board interpreting the act are entitled to substantial deference, see <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993), \u201cultimately the \u2018duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moss\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 704, 709 (2008), quoting <em>Slater\u2019s Case, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 326, 330 (2002). We have observed that in interpreting the act, \u201cits words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning,\u201d but also that the act \u201cis to be construed broadly, rather than narrowly, in the light of its purpose and, so far as reasonably may be, to promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u201d <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 364 (2005), quoting <em>Taylor\u2019s Case, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 499 (1998). See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). We must also consider the act \u201cas a whole ... so that the various portions taken together shall constitute a harmonious and consistent legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Price </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>322 Mass. 476, 480 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">3. <em>Discovery of the \u00a7 45 report. </em>We agree with the board that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the employee is entitled to obtain a copy of the \u00a7 45 report prepared at the behest of the self-insurer. To reach this conclusion, the board relied on dictum in <em>Anzalone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>403 Mass. 119, 121 n.4 (1988), in which this court stated that, in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, an employee\u2019s \u201cright to obtain copies of medical reports [made in connection with examinations of the employee by physicians for the employer or insurer] is adequately provided for by G. L. c. 152 . . . \u00a7\u00a7 20, 20A and 30A.\u201d Because the question of the employee\u2019s right to obtain such medical reports was not directly before the court in the <em>Anzalone </em>case, that issue was not fully developed or discussed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We now consider the issue in light of the parties\u2019 claims, beginning with an examination of the relevant statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Section 20 of G. L. c. 152 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-6\">\u201cAll medical records and reports of hospitals, clinics and physicians of the insurer, employer, or of the employee shall be filed with and open to the inspection of the division so far as relevant to any matter before it. Such reports shall be open to the inspection of any party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">On its face, the requirement that \u201call\u201d medical reports of physicians of the insurer must be filed and open to inspection appears to include the \u00a7 45 report.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the context of a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, all medical reports relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>employee\u2019s work-related injury are relevant and are therefore subject to the mandates of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 20. A medical report that has not been filed, but is subject to the filing requirement, would thus be subject to discovery by the employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The self-insurer asserts that G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 20, does not apply to nontreatment medical reports such as those created pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 45. In support of this view, the self-insurer relies primarily on language in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 45, which permits the insurer to require the employee to submit to ongoing medical examinations and requires \u201cthe insurer to file with the division a copy of the report of its examining physician or physicians if and when such report is to be used as the basis of any order by the division.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The self-insurer argues that this provision imposes a separate filing requirement for \u00a7 45 reports that only comes into play if the self-insurer intends to proffer the report as a basis for a decision of the department. Because it did not have such intent, the self-insurer argues, it was not obligated to file the report with the department. We disagree that the language of these statutes supports this view.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Halebian </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>Berv, </em>457 Mass. 620, 628 (2010) (maxim of \u201cnegative implication\u201d is guide to statutory construction, not positive command, and should not be followed where doing so would frustrate legislative intent). Wholly apart from any filing requirement, the workers\u2019 compensation scheme as a whole supports the board\u2019s view that the \u00a7 45 report is discoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Broad discovery by a party of medical reports procured by another party is consonant with the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, which provides an alternative to traditional tort litigation by creating an insurance-based remedy for work-related injuries. See <em>Saab </em>v. <em>Massachusetts CVS Pharmacy, LLC, </em>452 Mass. 564, 566-567 (2008). Contested issues in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings often revolve around \u201cthe fact and extent of injury,\u201d and the substantive and procedural provisions of the act and related regulations are designed to facilitate resolution of those issues in a speedy, fair, and transparent manner by increasing the flow of medical information among the employee, the insurer, and the department.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 16, 20-25 (1996). See <em>Scheffer\u2019s Case, </em>419 Mass. 251, 255-257 (1994); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>415 Mass. 218, 222-225 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Consistent with the act\u2019s goal of transparency is the filing and inspection provision in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 20 (providing that \u201call\u201d medical reports relevant to workers\u2019 compensation proceeding must be filed with department and open to inspection of all parties). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30A (employees shall be furnished with copies of medical reports).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, although G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 45, itself does not provide that the report of the insurer\u2019s physician must be furnished to the employee, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a720 and 30A, reflect the Legislature\u2019s intent to make medical reports, including \u00a7 45 reports, generally available to employees and, if such reports are not voluntarily provided, to make them the subject of compelled discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">That the employee\u2019s right of access and inspection translates to a right of compelled discovery also finds support in the liberal provisions for discovery of medical records and reports provided by the act and department regulations. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 5, grants authority to the department to promulgate rules and regulations authorizing \u201ca party, on or after the filing of any [workers\u2019 compensation claim], to serve on any party, employer or medical provider rendering medical treatment to the claimant, a request to produce, and permit the party making such request to inspect and copy, any medical notes, treatment reports and employment records.\u201d Of particular relevance is the regulation providing that on \u201cwritten motion of an appropriate party, the administrative judge . . . may require . . . any request for discovery, including any request submitted under 452 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7] 1.12(1) or (2) [(2008)], be complied with.\u201d 452 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.12(4)(a) (2008).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> By providing that an administrative judge may order compliance with \u201cany request for discovery, including\u201d that specifically provided for in 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.12(2), this regulation grants the administrative judge broad authority to order discovery that is not limited to the reports of medical treatment providers but may include the reports of examinations by a \u00a7 45 medical examiner. This interpretation is consistent with decisions of the board that reflect the practice of permitting liberal discovery of a variety of records containing medical information. See, e.g., <em>Young </em>v. <em>Evans Delivery, </em>23 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 391, 404-406 (2009) (all medical records of employee\u2019s treating physician, including correspondence from employee\u2019s attorney kept in employee\u2019s medical chart, discoverable by employer); <em>DiReeno </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>5 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 242, 244 n.4 (1991) (administrative judge allowed employee\u2019s motion to produce report of physician retained by self-insurer that was neither offered at conference nor at hearing by self-insurer).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">We therefore agree with the board that the employee was entitled to obtain a copy of the \u00a7 45 report through discovery.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">4. <em>Use of \u00a7 45 report to cross-examine the impartial physician. </em>The appointment of an impartial physician pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2), is intended \u201cto avoid or minimize situations where \u2018dueling doctors\u2019 present conflicting medical evidence concerning the nature and cause of the employee\u2019s injury and the degree of disability.\u201d <em>Schejfler\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 257. Because of the impartial physician\u2019s unique role in the workers\u2019 compensation scheme, we agree with the board that the employee must be able to use the \u00a7 45 report to cross-examine the impartial physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Appointment of an impartial physician is mandated when a workers\u2019 compensation claim involving a disputed medical issue has advanced to the hearing stage of department proceedings. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., supra </em>at 224. The impartial physician\u2019s report, which must reflect determinations regarding both the cause and extent of disability,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> is \u201cadmitted into evidence at the hearing\u201d before the administrative judge, where it \u201cconstitute[s] prima facie evidence of the matters contained therein.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2). Materials, including medical records and reports, may be submitted for consideration in connection with the impartial physician\u2019s report. See <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, </em>424 Mass. 16, 23-24 (1996); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., supra </em>at 223-224. Thus, the impartial physician is akin to a master who considers evidence submitted by the parties and \u201cwhose determination of the medical issues the administrative judge reviews\u201d at the hearing. <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Except in limited circumstances, the procedure set forth in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2), does not contemplate direct admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>in evidence of additional medical testimony, or of medical records or reports of doctors engaged by an employee, employer, or insurer. Such additional medical evidence may be admitted only on a finding by the administrative judge that it is necessary \u201cdue to the complexity of the medical issues involved or the inadequacy of the report submitted by the impartial medical examiner.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2). See <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">A procedure that limits the presentation of relevant evidence and relies on the impartial physician to provide prima facie evidence of the cause and extent of disability in the context of a workers\u2019 compensation claim risks denying a party (and, in particular, an employee) the opportunity fairly to present that party\u2019s position on the disputed medical issue, which, in the tort context, a party would do by offering his or her own medical evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 19-24. See <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136, 139 (1914) (provisions of act \u201cto be construed liberally for the protection of the injured employee, whose rights to compensation [at common law] [the act] has taken away\u201d). Thus, the \u00a7 11A (2) procedure must permit \u201cthe claimant to develop and put before the relevant decision makers medical testimony she considers favorable to her claim.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 23. This is accomplished, in part, by the ability of the parties (1) to submit \u201cmedical records relevant to the issue[]\u201d for consideration in connection with the impartial physician\u2019s report, and, once the report has issued, (2) to depose the impartial physician regarding relevant facts and information. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We are here concerned only with the deposition of the impartial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>physician. Through cross-examination of the impartial physician at deposition, the parties have the opportunity to \u201cinquire into the basis of [the impartial physician\u2019s] report [and the impartial physician\u2019s] unfavorable conclusion in the light of [submitted medical] records and reports, and in this way bring these materials to the administrative judge\u2019s attention [at the] hearing and perhaps argue on their strength that the judge should authorize additional medical testimony.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 23. Such materials may also be used to \u201cattack, discredit or refute\u201d the impartial physician\u2019s report. <em>Id. </em>at 24, quoting <em>Meunier\u2019s Case, </em>319 Mass. 421, 423 (1946). By providing to the impartial physician supplemental material that was unavailable to the party at the time of the impartial examination and \u00a7 11A report, the deposition also provides a party with an additional opportunity to inform the impartial physician\u2019s opinion. See <em>Cheetham </em>v. <em>US Mfg. Co., </em>19 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 351, 354 n.5 (2005) (party cannot \u201cbe denied the right, if sought, to develop the impartial [physician\u2019s] opinion regarding the medical issues in dispute\u201d through deposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The self-insurer argues that an employee may not use a \u00a7 45 report in cross-examination of an impartial physician because, unless and until the self-insurer places such a report at issue, it constitutes inadmissible hearsay. We address this claim briefly, even though in the procedural posture of this case, we do not know what the report contains or what use the impartial physician will make of it. The self-insurer\u2019s position rests on the principle that an expert\u2019s opinion, including that of an impartial physician, must \u201cbe based solely on the expert\u2019s \u2018direct personal knowledge\u2019 or [otherwise] admissible evidence,\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 592 (2000), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>414 Mass. 235, 238 (1993), and that the only hearsay exception for admission of medical reports provided by department regulations is limited to \u201cmedical reports prepared by physicians engaged by said party.\u201d 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.11(6) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The argument fails. As G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11 A, expressly provides, the deposition is \u201cfor purposes of cross examination.\u201d Pursuant to \u00a7 11 A, the impartial physician\u2019s report, containing his or her opinions on the matters considered, is already in evidence, and is entitled to be treated as prima facie evidence. The cross-examination permitted in the deposition is designed to test those opinions. That the impartial physician may change his or her opinion as a result of the deposition, see, e.g., <em>Iandosca </em>v. <em>Rotman Elec. Co., </em>10 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 558, 560-561 (1996), and that additional medical information presented at the deposition may form the basis of the impartial physician\u2019s revised opinion, see, e.g., <em>Leppo </em>v. <em>Rusco Steel Co., </em>17 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 499, 500-501 (2003), does not change the basic fact that the deposition is primarily for cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Even if we assume, without deciding, that a party who cross-examines the impartial physician is confined to independently admissible evidence, the argument still fails. Expert opinions, including those of an impartial physician, may be based \u201con facts or data not in evidence if the facts or data are independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion.\u201d <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 703 (2011). Thus, a \u00a7 45 report need not itself be admissible, but only the report\u2019s underlying facts or data. Medical reports in general are \u201cindependently admissible\u201d at department hearings pursuant to G.

L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2), provides for the appointment of an impartial medical examiner (impartial physician) when a workers\u2019 compensation claim advances to the hearing stage of the proceedings and involves a disputed medical issue. The \u00a7 11A report constitutes prima facie evidence of the contested medical issue at the hearing. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11A (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The parties agree, and we proceed on the assumption, that the motion was filed on July 8, 2005, although the record before us does not include evidence of its filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The hearing before the administrative judge commenced on January 31, 2006. On that date, the employee testified and the impartial physician\u2019s report was submitted in evidence. In addition to requesting permission to depose the impartial physician, the employee sought to admit additional medical evidence. The administrative judge deferred ruling on the motion for additional medical evidence until after the deposition, and the motion was subsequently denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) concluded that the employee should \u201cbe granted the opportunity to cross-examine the impartial physician, using the report of the [G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 45,] medical expert [(\u00a7 45 report)],\u201d and that the self-insurer should \u201cbear the costs associated with the further deposition.\u201d It is plain from the context of the board\u2019s decision that the reference to \u201cthe further deposition of Dr. Shea\u201d is an error and that the intended reference was to Dr. Basta, the impartial physician.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\">In <em>Anzalone </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp.

In its summary of the proceedings, the court included the fact that the officer had filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits and that \u201cthe MBTA sent [the employee] to a number of physicians for examinations and evaluations [but] refused to supply [the employee] with copies of the medical reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121. In a footnote, the court adverted to the employee\u2019s right to obtain copies of the reports despite the fact that the status of the workers\u2019 compensation claim was not at issue on appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 121 n.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b80-13\">The board does not assert that the \u00a7 45 report is subject to mandatory filing, and we have not discovered any statute or regulation that imposes sanctions for the failure to file, in contrast to G.

If a physician provided by the employee is not present at the examination, it shall be the duty of the insurer to file with the division a copy of the report of its examining physician or physicians if and when such report is to be used as the basis of any order by the division.

Viewed in the context of the entire workers\u2019 compensation scheme, see <em>Price </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>322 Mass. 476, 480 (1948), we think G.
