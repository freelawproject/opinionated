The defendant was found guilty of one count of assault and battery of the victim, and the defendant appealed. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment of conviction, concluding that \u201cthe victim\u2019s 911 call was admissible, as it was an excited utterance and was not testimonial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beatrice, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 153, 158 (2009).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review, \u201climited to issues relating to the April 7, 2006, 911 call.\u201d After oral argument, we stayed the appeal pending a decision by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>131 S. Ct. 1143 (2011), which considered a confrontation clause challenge to the admissibility in evidence of hearsay statements made to the police by a homicide victim before he died, and invited the parties to file supplemental memoranda after that case was decided on February 28, 2011. We conclude that the victim\u2019s 911 call was an excited utterance and was not testimonial because we can infer from the victim\u2019s statements during the call that the victim had just been assaulted, that the victim was still in the same apartment building as the assailant, and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>victim was in danger until the police came or the defendant fled. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Because further appellate review is limited to the admission of the tape recording of the 911 telephone call, and because the judge rested its admission solely on inferences arising from the contents of that call, we turn directly to it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While no transcript of the telephone call was offered in evidence, we have listened to the tape recording and set out the audible portions of the conversation:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The 911 operator: \u201c911 . . . Hi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The caller: \u201cI\u2019m using my neighbor\u2019s phone. I live at [street address and apartment number]. My boy friend just beat me up. He beat the shit out of me. I need a cruiser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The 911 operator: \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">The caller: \u201cJoseph Beatrice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The 911 operator: \u201cJoseph?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">The caller: \u201cYup. Joseph Beatrice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">The 911 operator: \u201cBeatrice?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">The caller: \u201cYup.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">The 911 operator: \u201cOk. Is he still in your apartment?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">The caller: \u201cHe\u2019s still there, he\u2019s packing his stuff now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">The 911 operator: \u201cDo you need an ambulance?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">The caller: \u201cUmm. Please. And I, I need you to send the cops now, before he leaves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-18\">The 911 operator: \u201cOk. We\u2019ll send someone out. Ok?\u201d The caller: \u201cYup.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-19\">The 911 operator: \u201cOk . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>In <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment bars \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d The victim here was unavailable to testify because of her invocation of the right against self-incrimination, and the defendant had no prior opportunity to cross-examine her regarding the incident. Accordingly, her hearsay statements in the tape-recorded telephone call properly are admissible only if they pass two tests. First, the statement must be admissible under our common-law rules of evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>456 Mass. 280, 295, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 181 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>452 Mass. 236, 243 (2008). Second, the statement must be non-testimonial for purposes of the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The Commonwealth argues that admission of the statements on the 911 tape recording was proper because the victim\u2019s statements during the telephone call were excited utterances. \u201cA statement will be considered a spontaneous [or excited] utterance \u2018if (1) there is an occurrence or event \u201csufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer,\u201d and (2) if the declarant\u2019s statement was \u201ca spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, supra </em>at 246, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>437 Mass. 620, 623 (2002). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, supra </em>at 296; Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803(2) (2011). Both prongs were satisfied in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The statements to the police operator were made \u201cin circumstances that reasonably negated premeditation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>v. <em>Santiago, supra </em>at 625. The victim\u2019s voice on the telephone reflected that she was very upset and breathing heavily, and she reported that she had \u201cjust\u201d been assaulted by the defendant and agreed that she needed an ambulance. We conclude that the statements were excited utterances.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Turning to the question whether the statements were testimonial, the Supreme Court declared in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Consequently, for a statement to be nontestimonial, there must be an ongoing emergency, and the primary purpose of the interrogation must be to meet that emergency, not to prove past events that may be relevant to criminal investigation or prosecution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because these are preliminary facts that determine the admissibility of evidence, its proponent, here the prosecution, bears the burden of proving them by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>459 Mass. 442, 447 (2011); Mass. G. Evid., <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 104(a) &amp; note, at 10. \u201cWe accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact unless clearly erroneous but independently apply constitutional principles to the facts found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, supra </em>at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u201cThe existence of an ongoing emergency must be objectively assessed from the perspective of the parties to the interrogation at the time, not with the benefit of hindsight. If the information the parties knew at the time of the encounter would lead a reasonable person to believe that there was an emergency, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>if that belief was later proved incorrect, that is sufficient for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 1157 n.8.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[Wjhether an emergency exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent inquiry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1158. The circumstances may reflect an ongoing emergency where the victim is seriously injured and requires medical assistance, see <em>id. </em>at 1159, 1165 (victim bleeding from life-threatening gunshot wound); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, supra </em>at 299-300 (same); where the victim\u2019s safety is at substantial risk, see <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 817 (victim being beaten during 911 call); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, </em>447 Mass. 737, 745 (2006) (same); where the dispatched police officers responding to the scene may be at risk from an armed assailant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, supra </em>at 300; or where an armed assailant poses a substantial risk to the public at large. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Here, based on the victim\u2019s report to the 911 operator, she had \u201cjust\u201d been severely beaten by her boy friend and agreed she wanted an ambulance, but there is no suggestion that her injuries were serious or life threatening, that her boy friend was armed with a dangerous weapon, or that her boy friend posed any risk to the public at large. Nor does she suggest that she was being beaten at the time of her telephone call or that her boy friend was presently where she was. In these circumstances, a reasonable person would believe there was an ongoing emergency only if there was a continuing risk to the victim, that is, a substantial risk that her assailant may find her and continue his assault on her before the police arrived on the scene. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>(in domestic violence cases, Supreme Court \u201cfocused only on the threat to the victims and assessed the ongoing emergency from the perspective of whether there was a continuing threat to them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The motion judge rested his denial of the motion in limine solely on the content of the tape recording of the 911 telephone call, and the trial judge admitted the tape recording in evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>based on the motion judge\u2019s ruling, so we similarly limit our examination of the relevant circumstances in determining whether the prosecution met its burden of proving an ongoing emergency. We conclude, based on the tape-recorded call and reasonable inferences from its content, that the judge did not err in finding an ongoing emergency because, objectively, the circumstances reasonably indicated that the victim continued to be at substantial risk at the time of the telephone call.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">It is reasonable to infer from the victim\u2019s words and her tone that the victim\u2019s boy friend had just beaten her severely and that she thought it urgent that the police arrive on the scene \u201cnow, before he leaves\u201d her apartment. While it is not precisely clear where the victim was when she was calling, it is reasonable to infer that she was at the apartment of a neighbor in the same apartment building where she lived: she asked both for a police cruiser to stop the defendant before he left her apartment and for an ambulance for her, but she provided the police operator only with her street address and apartment number, not with a separate address where she was then located. This suggests that she wanted the cruiser for him and the ambulance for herself to be dispatched to her home address. Where a woman has \u201cjust\u201d been severely beaten by a boy friend in an apparent act of domestic violence, where the woman remains in a neighboring apartment, and where the assailant is \u201cpacking his stuff\u201d (suggesting that her assailant had lived with the victim and had just decided to move out), it is reasonable to conclude that the ongoing emergency continues until the police have arrived and secured the scene, or until the assailant has left the scene. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 828 (2006) (\u201cemergency appears to have ended\u201d when defendant drove away from premises)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; <em>id. </em>at 829 (in consolidated case, no ongoing emergency after police arrived at home, heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>no arguments, and saw no violence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>450 Mass. 215, 226 (2007), <em>S.C., ante </em>12 (2011) (no ongoing emergency where defendant, after trying to run victim over with vehicle, had dropped victim [from whom he was separated] at her home and left in vehicle). Until then, even if the assailant is not armed, a reasonable person would recognize that an enraged boy friend might demand or even force entry into a neighbor\u2019s apartment, or lie in wait until the victim leaves the neighbor\u2019s apartment, in an attempt to do her further harm. Because of this danger, we would expect the police to treat it as an emergency, and not delay in sending a police cruiser to the address. Until the threat had been dispelled by the arrival of the police or the departure of the defendant, the emergency was ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">In evaluating whether the primary purpose of the interrogation was to meet that ongoing emergency, rather than to prove past events that may be relevant to criminal prosecution or investigation, our inquiry is objective; \u201cthe relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals\u2019 statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\u201d <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra </em>at 1156. While a reasonable person responding to an ongoing emergency would first ask questions designed to address the emergency, \u201c \u2018a conversation which begins as an interrogation to determine the need for emergency assistance\u2019 can \u2018evolve into testimonial statements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1159, quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 828. The Supreme Court has recognized that, in domestic disputes, \u201c[officers called to investigate . . . need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim,\u201d so such \u201cinitial inquiries\u201d often produce nontestimonial statements. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 832, quoting <em>Hiibel </em>v. <em>Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., </em>542 U.S. 177, 186 (2004). Where a 911 call is \u201ca call for help against a bona fide physical threat\u201d or provides \u201cinformation enabling officers immediately to end a threatening situation,\u201d rather than \u201ca narrative report of a crime absent any imminent danger,\u201d the primary purpose of the call is to meet an ongoing emergency. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 827, 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>To determine whether the primary purpose of an interrogation is to meet an ongoing emergency, we focus on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\">\u201c(1) whether the 911 caller was speaking about \u2018events <em>as they were actually happening </em>rather than describing] past events\u2019; (2) whether any reasonable listener would recognize that the caller was facing an \u2018ongoing emergency\u2019; (3) whether what was asked and answered was, viewed objectively, \u2018necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to learn . . . what had happened in the past,\u2019 including whether it was necessary for the dispatcher to know the identity of the alleged perpetrator; and (4) the \u2018level of formality\u2019 of the interview (emphasis in original).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galicia, </em>447 Mass. 737, 743-744 (2006), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, supra </em>at 827. All of these factors support the conclusion that the primary purpose of the interrogation during the 911 call in this case was to meet an ongoing emergency rather than to prove past events to enable criminal prosecution or investigation. As described by the victim, all the events were actually happening at the time of the call (\u201che\u2019s packing his stuff now\u201d) or had just happened (\u201cmy boy friend just beat me up\u201d). A \u201creasonable listener\u201d would recognize that the caller faced an ongoing emergency, and the listener (the 911 operator) asked only questions that were necessary to address the emergency. The operator asked for the assailant\u2019s name so that the responding officers could identify the person who had just beaten the victim and for his present location (\u201cIs he still in your apartment?\u201d) so they could find him, and also asked if the victim needed an ambulance to ensure that the caller received appropriate medical assistance. The caller was not asked to provide, and did not volunteer, any specific details as to what had happened in the past. The interview was informal and very brief, which was consistent with an interview whose purpose was to respond to an emergency rather than to develop a case for prosecution. See <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>131 S. Ct. 1143, 1160 (2011), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822 (2006) (\u201cformality suggests the absence of an emergency and therefore an increased likelihood that the purpose of the interrogation is to \u2018establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,\u2019 \u201d but \u201cinformality does not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>indicate the presence of an emergency or the lack of testimonial intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The 911 telephone call was not testimonial because the primary purpose of the interrogation was to meet an ongoing emergency, rather than to prove past events to develop a case for criminal prosecution. The judge, therefore, did not err in admitting the tape recording of the telephone call in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">-The defendant also was charged with threatening to commit a crime and intimidation of a witness in connection with this incident, but these charges were dismissed at the request of the prosecution. In addition, the defendant was charged with threatening to commit a crime and assault and battery in connection with another incident on April 12, 2006, involving the same victim. The defendant was found not guilty of these charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, guarantees that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lao, 450 Mass. 215, 222 (2007), <em>S.C, ante </em>12 (2011).
