L. c. 149, \u00a7 150 (\u00a7 150), providing for a mandatory award of treble damages to a prevailing employee, should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>applied in an action brought by an employee against her employer for violation of the Wage Act before the amendment\u2019s effective date. We conclude that the amendment should be read to apply only prospectively, to claims arising on or after the amendment\u2019s effective date of July 12, 2008. Because the Superior Court judge applied the amendment retrospectively to this case, we remand to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">1. Background'.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff, Elena Rosnov, worked as an attorney in the law office of the defendant, John H. Molloy, from early February, 2006, until her resignation on June 26, 2006. As a term of her employment, Rosnov was to be provided a referral fee of forty per cent of any contingency fee that Mol-loy or his office received in connection with the settlement or damage award in any case that Rosnov referred to Molloy. In March of 2007, a case that Rosnov had referred to Molloy the preceding year reached a partial settlement of $2.5 million. Ultimately, Molloy received attorney\u2019s fees in connection with the partial settlement in the amount of $432,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">On April 17, 2007, Rosnov filed a complaint in the Superior Court against Molloy, claiming his failure to pay her a referral fee connected to the case was a breach of contract and violated the Wage Act, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148, 150 (Wage Act).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She sought to recover a portion of the attorney\u2019s fees Molloy had received. By agreement of the parties, the trial was bifurcated, and the liability portion of Rosnov\u2019s contract claim was tried to a jury without reference to damages; the parties agreed that if there was liability on the contract claim, the amount of contract damages was $173,000, or forty per cent of $432,500. In March, 2009, a jury found that an oral contract for the division of fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>existed between Rosnov and Molloy, and that Molloy had breached the contract by not providing Rosnov a referral fee. Thereafter, the trial judge considered, without a jury, whether Rosnov\u2019s referral fee constituted a \u201ccommission\u201d under the Wage Act, and if so, whether Rosnov was entitled to treble damages under \u00a7 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The judge found that Rosnov was an employee under the Wage Act and that the fee qualified as a commission. The judge further concluded the version of \u00a7 150 amended after this case was filed applied, \u201cbecause violators of the Wage Act have always been subject to treble damages. . . . This is not a case where the amendment to the statute substantially changes parties\u2019 rights and expectations.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge thus concluded that Rosnov was entitled to a mandatory award of treble damages, or $519,000, plus interest. Molloy appealed, and we granted his application for direct appellate review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>As earlier indicated, the only question we address is which version of \u00a7 150 should be applied in this case: \u00a7 150, as amended through St. 2008, c. 80, \u00a7 5 (chapter 80), effective July 12, 2008; or \u00a7 150, as amended through St. 2005, c. 99, \u00a7 2, the version of the statute in effect in 2007 when Rosnov filed her complaint. This is a question of statutory interpretation, and therefore one that we review de novo. See, e.g., <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cintolo, </em>415 Mass. 358, 359 (1993) (\u201cStatutory interpretation is a pure question of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">a. <em>Statutory retroactivity. </em>The presumption that statutes operate prospectively is well established. <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>448 Mass. 441, 448-449 (2007) (\u201cTo the extent that there may be uncertainty about the application of new legislation, it must be resolved against retroactivity\u201d). See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>2 NJ. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 41.4, at 400-401 (7th ed. 2009) (\u201cRetrospective operation is not favored by courts, and a law is not construed as retroactive unless the act clearly, by express language or necessary implication, indicates that the legislature intended a retroactive application\u201d). As this court has explained, however, statutes may operate retroactively in certain circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201cIn the absence of an express legislative directive, this court has usually applied \u2018[t]he general rule of interpretation . . . that all statutes are prospective in their operation, unless an intention that they shall be retrospective appears by necessary implication from their words, context or objects when considered in the light of the subject matter, the pre-existing state of the law and the effect upon existent rights, remedies and obligations. Doubtless all legislation commonly looks to the future, not to the past, and has no retroactive effect unless such effect manifestly is required by unequivocal terms. It is only statutes regulating practice, procedure and evidence, in short, those relating to remedies and not affecting substantive rights, that commonly are treated as operating retroactively, and as applying to pending actions or causes of action.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"><em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 318 (1993), quoting <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, </em>364 Mass. 624, 626 (1974). See <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>422 Mass. 666, 670 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Rosnov argues that the presumption of prospective application does not apply to chapter 80 for two reasons: because the statute relates only to remedies and not to substantive rights; and because the legislative history of this amendment evinces an intent on the part of the Legislature that the amendment be applied retroactively. Conversely, Molloy contends that chapter 80 pertains to substantive rights because it alters the extent of a party\u2019s liability; and that in any event there is insufficient evidence of a clear legislative intent that chapter 80 be retroactively applied. For the reasons that follow, we agree with Molloy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">b. <em>Substantive right. </em>Before chapter 80 was passed, the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>portion of \u00a7 150, as amended through St. 2005, c. 99, \u00a7 2, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\u201cAny employee claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of [the Wage Act or certain other statutes] may, at the expiration of ninety days after the filing of a complaint with the attorney general . . . institute and prosecute in his own name and on his own behalf, or for himself and for others similarly situated, a civil action for injunctive relief and any damages incurred, <em>including treble damages for any loss of wages and other benefits. An employee so aggrieved and who prevails in such an action shall be entitled to an award of the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorney fees\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>Bradford Group, </em>444 Mass. 698 (2005) <em>(Wied</em>mann), this court concluded that \u201cthere is nothing in the plain language\u201d of \u00a7 150 requiring an automatic award of treble damages, where \u201c[t]he text of the statute states only that a plaintiff \u2018may\u2019 institute a suit for damages that includes a request for treble damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 709. We held that an award of treble damages under \u00a7 150 lies in the judge\u2019s discretion, citing with approval the conclusion in <em>Goodrow </em>v. <em>Lane Bryant, Inc., </em>432 Mass. 165, 178-179 (2000) <em>(Goodrow), </em>that \u201ctreble damages are punitive in nature, allowed only where authorized by statute, and appropriate where conduct is \u2018outrageous, because of the defendant\u2019s evil motive or his reckless indifference to the rights of others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wiedmann, supra </em>at 710, quoting <em>Goodrow, supra </em>at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The <em>Wiedmann </em>case was decided on July 21, 2005. Effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>July 12, 2008, three years later, the provision of \u00a7 150 concerning treble damages was amended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cAn employee so aggrieved who prevails in such an action <em>shall be awarded treble damages, as liquidated damages, for any lost wages and other benefits </em>and shall also be awarded the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Chapter 80 effected a critical change in the language of the statute, removing the provision that treble damages \u201cmay\u201d be awarded, and replacing it with the directive that treble damages \u201cshall be awarded.\u201d See <em>Wiedmann, supra </em>at 710, and cases cited (\u201cmay\u201d is permissive; \u201cshall\u201d imposes mandatory obligation).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We recognize that \u201cthe distinction between legislation that concerns \u2018substantive rights,\u2019 and legislation that concerns \u2018procedures\u2019 and \u2018remedies,\u2019 has proved to be difficult to draw.\u201d <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. at 319. In <em>Fontaine, </em>the court concluded that amendments to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, providing for recovery of punitive damages in a discrimination case and multiple damages in an age discrimination case, could not be retroactively applied. <em>Id. </em>at 317, 320-321. We explained, \u201clegislation limiting or increasing the measure of liability, while arguably remedial in the broad sense of that word, generally is considered to impair the substantive rights of a party who will be adversely affected by the legislation. In the absence of a provision mandating retrospective application, we have not assumed that such legislation applies to claims arising prior to enactment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319-320, and cases cited. The damages allowed by the amended version of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9, provided the potential for an increase in a defendant\u2019s liability, that could, of course, ripen into an actual increase when those damages were imposed. See <em>id. </em>at 320. For that reason, in the absence of an \u201cexpress directive\u201d by the Legislature that the enhanced damage provisions of the amendments were \u201cto apply to cases pending at the time of their enactment, or to conduct occurring prior thereto,\u201d <em>id., </em>we concluded that the plaintiff there \u2014 whose age discrimination case was commenced before the amendments to c. 15IB, \u00a7 9 \u2014 could not recover increased damages. <em>Id. </em>at 319-321.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Similarly, in this case, where only a potential for treble damages existed before, certainty of their imposition is now the rule. The 2008 amendment to \u00a7 150 increases a defendant\u2019s measure of liability because the discretion of a judge <em>not </em>to award treble damages \u2014 where, for example, the judge did not find the defendant\u2019s conduct to have been outrageous or recklessly indifferent, see <em>Wiedmann, </em>444 Mass. at 710 \u2014 has been removed; treble damages must be awarded. This represents a marked increase in the liability a defendant faces, and thus affects the defendant\u2019s substantive rights. See <em>Landgraf </em>v. <em>USI Film Prods., </em>511 U.S. 244, 283-284 (1994) (\u201cThe <em>extent </em>of a party\u2019s liability . . . is an important legal consequence that cannot be ignored .... [In no case] in which Congress ha[s] not clearly spoken, have we read a statute substantially increasing monetary liability of a private party to apply to conduct occurring before the statute\u2019s enactment\u201d). Cf. <em>Cudlassi </em>v. <em>MacFarland, </em>304 Mass. 612, 613 (1939) (amendment to dog bite statute eliminating automatic double damages provision would not apply to plaintiff who was bitten by dog and brought suit before amendment took effect). Absent an express legislative directive to the contrary, therefore, the mandatory treble damages provision of \u00a7 150 should not be retroactively applied. <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. at 320-321. We turn to the question whether there is such a legislative directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">c. <em>Legislative intent. </em>By its terms, chapter 80 gives no indication the Legislature intended that the amended version of \u00a7 150 be applied retroactively. See <em>Fleet Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>448 Mass. 441, 450 (2007) (no \u201cexplicit pronouncement\u201d from Legislature that statutory amendment extinguishing substantive right was to be applied retroactively; amendment held to operate prospectively only). Contrast <em>Child Support Enforcement Div. of Alaska </em>v. <em>Brenckle, </em>424 Mass. 214, 219 (1997) (finding express intention of Legislature to apply Uniform Interstate Family Support Act retroactively in specific words of statute and given its procedural nature). Rosnov argues, however, that the legislative history of chapter 80 reveals an intent that its treble damage provision be retroactively applied, even if chapter 80\u2019s plain text does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The undertaking to amend the treble damage provision of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u00a7 150 began before the <em>Wiedmann </em>case was decided in July of 2005. See 2005 House Doc. No. 3775; 2005 Senate Doc. No. 928. Subsequent to the decision in <em>Wiedmann, </em>a new draft of these bills was filed, first as 2005 House Doc. No. 4343, and then as 2006 House Doc. No. 4663. The preamble of 2006 House Doc. No. 4663 stated that \u201cthe purpose of this Act is to clarify the language of the statute to reiterate the intent of the Legislature that such treble damages be mandatory.\u201d The treble damages clause proposed in 2006 House Doc. No. 4663 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cAny employee so aggrieved and who prevails in such an action shall be awarded treble damages, as liquidated damages, for any loss of wages and other benefits; and such employee shall also be awarded the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">House Doc. No. 4663 passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but then was vetoed by the Governor and was never enacted. 2006 House J. 2203.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Rosnov nonetheless points to 2007 Senate Doc. No. 1059, which ultimately was enacted in 2008 as chapter 80. Senate Doc. No. 1059 was entitled \u201cAn Act to clarify the law protecting employee compensation,\u201d and included a separate section (\u00a7 8) that identified the purpose of the act as clarifying the existing law and \u201creiterat[ing] the original intention of the general court that triple damages are mandatory.\u201d At some point \u2014 it may have been while the bill was in third reading<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u2014 the title changed to \u201cAn Act further regulating employee compensation,\u201d and that \u00a7 8 was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">As a general rule, when language is removed from a bill before its final passage, we presume its deletion to have been intentional. See <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wyman-Gordon, Co., </em>422 Mass. 551, 556 (1996). See also <em>Moakley </em>v. <em>Eastwick, </em>423 Mass. 52, 59 (1996) (elimination from enacted art preservation statute of two provisions present in earlier House bill indicates \u201cpurposeful determination\u201d to limit applicability of statute to art created after statute\u2019s enactment). Rosnov argues this presumption does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>not apply here because (1) the deletion occurred while the bill was pending before the Committee on Bills in the Third Reading; (2) that committee\u2019s authority is restricted to making changes in form but not substance; and (3) accordingly, the deletion of \u00a7 8 of the bill and change of its title \u201ccould be seen as an indication that the Legislature thought [the language] was obvious or duplicative,\u201d and therefore unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">We are unconvinced that Rosnov\u2019s assumption about the Legislature\u2019s thought process is correct; the best that can be said is that the Legislature\u2019s intent on the retroactivity issue is murky. Certainly, chapter 80 does not reflect the \u201cunequivocally clear\u201d legislative intent required for this court to decide in favor of retrospective application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Sentry Fed. Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Co-operative Cent. Bank, </em>406 Mass. 412, 414 (1990) (\u201cUnless the legislative intent is unequivocally clear to the contrary, a statute operates prospectively, not retroactively\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Rosnov also focuses on the fact that chapter 80 originated in the Senate two years after this court\u2019s decision in Wiedmann; she finds in this timing further support for her position that in enacting chapter 80, the Legislature was only clarifying and restating its original position in relation to mandatory treble damage awards, not changing it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">It is true that this court has interpreted \u201cswift legislative action in the wake\u201d of a contrary judicial ruling to evince legislative intent to clarify its position on the issue. <em>Swift </em>v. <em>AutoZone, Inc., </em>441 Mass. 443, 449-450 (2004). See <em>Fitz-Inn Auto Parks, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>350 Mass. 39, 42 (1965) (where statutory \u201camendment was enacted soon after the present controversy arose . . . it is just as logical to regard it as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>a clarification of an ambiguity and a legislative interpretation of the original act\u201d). But there is no basis to do so here. In <em>Wied-mann, </em>444 Mass, at 709-710, we construed \u00a7 150 to vest discretion in judges regarding the award of treble damages. Chapter 80, altering this interpretation, was enacted almost three years after the <em>Wiedmann </em>decision with no emergency preamble. This cannot qualify as a \u201cswift\u201d response. <em>Swift </em>v. <em>AutoZone, Inc., </em>441 Mass. 443, 449-450 (2004). Moreover, proposed changes to \u00a7 150 originated in the Legislature even before this court\u2019s opinion in the <em>Wiedmann </em>case was issued. In the circumstances, we are left with no clear indication that chapter 80 was meant to explain \u00a7 150, rather than simply to amend it, which is the Legislature\u2019s prerogative. The presumption of prospective operation of a statutory amendment is not overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because we conclude the 2008 amendment to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, does not apply retroactively to the present case, we vacate the judgment as to damages against Molloy and remand the case to the Superior Court for consideration whether treble damages are appropriate under the standard set out in <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>Bradford Group, </em>444 Mass, at 709-710.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the New England Legal Foundation and Associated Industries of Massachusetts; Massachusetts Employment Lawyers Association, Greater Boston Legal Services and affiliated organizations; and William J.

Because we conclude chapter 80 does not apply retroactively to the conduct at issue in this case, we need not consider these constitutional arguments.

Rosnov cites the Senate\u2019s rejection of the Governor\u2019s proposed amendments as demonstrating that the Legislature intended chapter 80 as a response to <em>Wiedmann </em>and that chapter 80 should therefore be retroactively applied. The argument fails. The Legislature\u2019s rejection of the Governor\u2019s amendments tells us nothing about whether the Legislature intended its continued adherence to chapter 80 as passed to operate retroactively. Instead, this rejection demonstrates only that the Legislature wanted the law, at least going forward, to provide mandatory treble damages for any violation of the Wage Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Rosnov filed in this court a motion for \u201cpartial summary disposition\u201d relative to her award of single damages.
