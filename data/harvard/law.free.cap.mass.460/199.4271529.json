Following an investigation by police and fire officials, the defendant, Mark D. Tremblay, was indicted by a grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>on charges of malicious burning of personal property in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 5; damage to property for the purpose of intimidation in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 39; and a civil rights violation under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 37. The defendant filed a motion to suppress statements that he made to the police during the course of their investigation. After a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court denied the motion, and the case proceeded to trial. A jury returned guilty verdicts on all three charges. The Appeals Court affirmed the convictions, concluding that none of the statements made by the defendant to a State trooper was involuntary, and, therefore, the motion to suppress was properly denied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tremblay, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 318-319 (2010). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. He now contends that his motion to suppress should have been allowed because statements that he made \u201coff the record\u201d during his interview with the State trooper were not voluntary. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We begin with a summary of the motion judge\u2019s findings, supplemented by uncontroverted testimony from the suppression hearing that was implicitly credited by the judge. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 477 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Harold Nelson lived in a home adjacent to a lake in Chelms-ford. He was the owner of a twenty-foot Bay liner boat. On April 27, 2002, the boat was atop a trailer on land that was across the street from where Nelson lived. That evening, the defendant, who owned a home next door to Nelson, was hosting a small gathering at his house. At around 11:20 p.m., while Nelson was at home in bed, his boat erupted in flames. The fire caused extensive damage to the vessel, and investigators concluded that it had been intentionally set.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Trooper Peter Cummings of the State police, who was working for the fire and explosion investigation section of the State fire marshal\u2019s office, was assigned to assist personnel from the Chelmsford police and fire departments with their investigation of the fire. On May 8, 2002, Cummings and Chelmsford fire investigator Henry Houle conducted interviews with various individuals, including several who had attended the defendant\u2019s gathering on April 27. Principally as a result of their conversa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>tion with one of the party guests, the defendant became the focus of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">At around 4 p.m. on May 8, Trooper Cummings telephoned the defendant\u2019s residence and spoke with his wife. Cummings identified himself and the purpose of his call, namely, that he wanted to speak with the defendant in connection with the fire investigation. The defendant\u2019s wife told Cummings that the defendant was at a ballfield, and she gave him the defendant\u2019s cellular telephone number. Cummings proceeded to telephone the defendant, identified himself, and stated the purpose for his call, which the defendant said that he had been expecting. Cummings asked the defendant if there was some place where they could get together to talk about whatever information the defendant could provide, and Cummings offered to drive to the ballfield. The defendant said that he preferred not to meet there because numerous distractions would make conversation difficult. Trooper Cummings suggested, as an alternative, the Chelmsford central fire station, and they agreed to meet at that location in five to ten minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">When Cummings and Houle, who were traveling in an unmarked vehicle and were casually dressed, arrived at the fire station, the defendant was already there, waiting in his car. After introductions, the three men went inside the fire station and upstairs to a conference room on the second floor. The room had several windows, two doors (one of which provided access to the roof), and a conference table where the men sat; a section of the room that was used as a bedroom for firefighters was partitioned off from the conference area.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Trooper Cummings again informed the defendant that he was investigating the fire on Nelson\u2019s boat, that he was collecting information from several people, and that he wanted to hear about the defendant\u2019s activities and observations during the evening of April 27. Cummings told the defendant that he wanted to take a written statement from him, and, assuming that the defendant had no objections, Cummings would write the statement in the first person and then the defendant could review and sign it. Cummings told the defendant that he wanted him to be as specific as possible in his recollections of the evening. Cummings did not tell the defendant that he was a suspect or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>target of the investigation. Moreover, having determined that the defendant was not in custody, Cummings did not advise him of his Miranda rights. The defendant expressed his willingness to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">During the interview, which lasted a little more than one hour, the demeanor of Trooper Cummings was sympathetic and understanding. He did not yell at or threaten the defendant, and the tone of his voice was conversational. At one point, he closed the windows because of outdoor construction noise, but there was no indication that the room became uncomfortable. The defendant, then approximately fifty years old, appeared relaxed, focused, and coherent. On two or three occasions, he left the conference room to engage in cellular telephone calls. The interview included small talk, and Trooper Cummings told the defendant that if he needed to leave to pick up his son from a ball game, the interview could be continued at a later time. The defendant chose to stay and finish the interview. At no point did he ask to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The defendant first discussed with Cummings and Houle his two jobs, one working for a company that moved equipment for professional sports teams, and the other installing so-called \u201ckill switches\u201d in police cruisers. Houle did not ask the defendant any questions, but, when Cummings left the room for several minutes to answer a page, he did engage the defendant in a brief conversation about his work and about the Red Sox. At some point during the interview, Trooper Cummings asked the defendant if he had any idea who might have been responsible for setting fire to Nelson\u2019s boat. The defendant responded that he \u201chad his suspicions.\u201d When asked to elaborate, the defendant suggested that Cummings probably had heard about some of the \u201cgay activities\u201d going on at Nelson\u2019s house, but the defendant was reluctant to describe those activities for a written statement. Instead, he expressed a preference for having a discussion about Nelson\u2019s activities \u201coff the record.\u201d Trooper Cummings responded, \u201cFine, you know, we\u2019ll go off the record.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Speaking in an increasingly agitated manner and using some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>profane language, the defendant proceeded to express his anger about openly sexual conduct purportedly occurring at Nelson\u2019s house in plain view of the defendant\u2019s home, and about the reluctance of the defendant\u2019s son to spend time at their lake house because of those activities. As agreed, Trooper Cummings did not include these particular comments and opinions in the written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The interview ultimately resulted in the production of a five and one-half page written statement consisting largely of nonin-criminating recollections and observations of the defendant\u2019s own activities during the evening of April 27. Trooper Cummings persuaded the defendant to include in the written statement a \u201cwatered-down version\u201d of his \u201coff-the-record\u201d comments about Nelson\u2019s so-called \u201cgay activities.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The written statement also set forth the defendant\u2019s opinion that the fire \u201cmay have been caused by a lover\u2019s quarrel\u201d between \u201csame-sex partners\u201d who have \u201cfrequent arguments between them.\u201d The written statement was reviewed by the defendant as Cummings read it aloud, corrections were made and initialed by the defendant, and the statement was signed by the defendant, Cummings, and Houle. The written statement did not include the defendant\u2019s \u201coff the record\u201d comments, which the defendant sought to suppress, to the effect that the defendant\u2019s son did not want to stay at their lake home any longer because of the sexual activities described in the written statement; that the defendant did not approve of such activities; and that he was \u201cfucking pissed\u201d about what was going on in Nelson\u2019s yard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">After the defendant had signed the statement, Trooper Cum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>mings became more confrontational and told the defendant that, based on his conversations with several party guests and his examination of the fire scene, he did not believe parts of the defendant\u2019s story. Cummings further told the defendant that he would not listen to the defendant\u2019s \u201cbullshit\u201d anymore, but that if the defendant wanted to tell the truth, then Cummings would listen. Cummings then asked the defendant about a conversation between the defendant and one of the party guests, during which the defendant allegedly told the guest that he had changed his shirt during the evening of April 27 because he had spilled gasoline on himself. The defendant insisted that he did not know what Cummings was talking about. When asked about the location of the shirt, the defendant said that he assumed it was at his house and offered to produce it, but he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Toward the end of the interview, Trooper Cummings told the defendant that he could be indicted for arson, and that it was time to start telling the truth. The defendant professed that he could provide no further help. Cummings ended the interview by saying to the defendant, \u201cGood luck, you\u2019re going to need it.\u201d The defendant then left the fire station. Approximately fifteen to twenty minutes had elapsed from the time that the defendant signed the written statement to the time that he walked out of the fire station.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Following a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements to Trooper Cummings on May 8, 2002, a Superior Court judge denied the motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge first concluded that Trooper Cummings\u2019s interview with the defendant was not a custodial interrogation. As such, Cummings was not required to read the defendant the Miranda rights before the defendant made oral or written statements, and those statements did not need to be excluded from evidence on that ground. The judge next concluded, based on the totality of the circumstances, that Trooper Cummings\u2019s agreement that certain limited statements by the defendant would be \u201coff the record\u201d did not render those particular statements involuntary. The judge stated that, apart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>from this agreement by Cummings, there were no other factors present that would indicate that the defendant was coerced into making the statements. Further, the judge stated that, although the defendant \u201cwas likely misled concerning the ultimate use against him of his more offensive description of his neighbor\u2019s alleged sexual preference and conduct,\u201d the defendant had been speaking voluntarily with Trooper Cummings before any promise or assurance was made, and he agreed to have the essence of his comments included in his written statement. Indeed, the judge continued, the fact that the defendant was \u201csufficiently savvy to ensure that the version which was potentially more harmful to [the defendant] was not included in the written statement [was] another indication of the absence of coercion.\u201d Accordingly, all of the oral and written statements made by the defendant to Trooper Cummings on May 8 were deemed admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact and will not disturb them absent clear error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gomes, </em>453 Mass. 506, 508-509 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>375 Mass. 349, 354 (1978). We make an independent determination as to the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996). Questions of credibility are the province of the motion judge who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>447 Mass. 274, 280 (2006). Our review here is based on the facts as developed at the suppression hearing, not at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grandison, </em>433 Mass. 135, 137 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We begin our analysis by pointing out that the present case is not one that is governed by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966) <em>(Miranda). </em>In that case, the United States Supreme Court established a \u201cprophylactic\u201d mechanism, see <em>New York </em>v. <em>Quarles, 461 </em>U.S. 649, 653 (1984), for safeguarding the privilege against self-incrimination afforded by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution to an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation. See <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 444. The Court\u2019s primary impetus for establishing the Miranda warnings was its concern that the coercive atmosphere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>created by police custody and interrogation would \u201csubjugate the individual to the will of his examiner,\u201d wholly undermining the exercise of free and rational choice and jeopardizing the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 457-458. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>456 Mass. 280, 286, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 181 (2010). To protect an individual from such presumptive coercion, the Supreme Court concluded that unless the individual was given specific warnings prior to making any statements during a custodial interrogation, those statements would not be admissible at trial. See <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 467, 476. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Here, the defendant has not challenged the judge\u2019s finding that he was not in custody while he was being interviewed by Trooper Cummings, and, therefore, no Miranda warnings were required. The defendant\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that his motion to suppress should have been allowed because Trooper Cummings\u2019s representation to the defendant that certain statements would be \u201coff the record\u201d rendered those statements involuntary. In the defendant\u2019s view, Cummings\u2019s representation was the functional equivalent of telling the defendant that what he said would not be used against him, thereby providing an impetus for the defendant to express his anger at and negative feelings for Nelson. We conclude that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the judge properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">It is well established that a confession or an admission is admissible in evidence only if it is made voluntarily. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheriff, </em>425 Mass. 186, 192 (1997). At a suppression hearing, a defendant\u2019s statement initially is presumed to be voluntary, placing the burden on the defendant to produce evidence tending to show otherwise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>450 Mass. 173, 177 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>371 Mass. 462, 471 n.3 (1976). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>429 Mass. 60, 65 (1999). Where such evidence is forthcoming, through a motion and affidavit or a proffer, the presumption disappears, and the Commonwealth then bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement was made voluntarily. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 439 (2004); <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 64-65; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 151-152, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). See also J.A. Grasso &amp; C.M. McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 18-9[d], at 18-85 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u201cThe test for voluntariness ... is \u2018whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, the will of the defendant was overborne to the extent that the statement was not the result of a free and voluntary act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>428 Mass. 478, 483-484 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395 (1997). A voluntary statement is one that \u201cis the product of a \u2018rational intellect\u2019 and a \u2018free will,\u2019 and not induced by physical or psychological coercion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeBlanc, </em>433 Mass. 549, 554 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>432 Mass. 82, 85 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>403 Mass. 575, 581 (1988). \u201cUnder this \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 test, we consider all of the relevant circumstances surrounding the interrogation and the individual characteristics and conduct of the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, </em>420 Mass. 656, 663 (1995). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>402 Mass. 333, 340 (1988), <em>S.C., </em>412 Mass. 353 (1992), and 420 Mass. 242 (1995). Relevant factors include, but are not limited to, \u201cpromises or other inducements, conduct of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s age, education, intelligence and emotional stability, experience with and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of the discussion of a deal or leniency (whether the defendant or the police), and the details of the interrogation, including the recitation of Miranda warnings.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 413 (1986). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, supra. </em>\u201cThe presence of one or more factors suggesting a statement may have been made involuntarily is not always sufficient to render the statements involuntary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, supra </em>at 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The motion judge found that, at the time of the defendant\u2019s statements to Trooper Cummings on May 8, 2002, the defendant was a fifty year old man, involved in two businesses, in apparent good mental and physical condition, and unimpaired by alcohol or drugs. There is nothing in the record to suggest that he lacked education or intelligence. The defendant periodically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>engaged in cellular telephone calls during the course of the interview, and he chose to stay and finish the interview, even after being given the option to leave and continue at a later time. The judge stated that there was no credible evidence that the defendant had had any experience with the criminal justice system that would have prepared him for his encounter with law enforcement officials on May 8, but the judge found that the manner and place of \u201cinterrogation\u201d were not overtly coercive. The judge stated that the only questionable tactic by Trooper Cummings was his agreement to the defendant\u2019s request that a limited portion of the defendant\u2019s oral statements be \u201coff the record.\u201d We turn now to the import of that agreement on the defendant\u2019s subsequent statements and whether it rendered them involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">As a general matter, law enforcement officials must exercise caution when employing deception or trickery or when giving assurances to a suspect during an interrogation. With respect to the former, we have, over the years, expressed our disapproval of police tactics that employ the use of false statements during an interrogation because such tactics cast doubt on the voluntariness of any subsequent confession or admission. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, supra </em>at 432, and cases cited. Nonetheless, we also have repeatedly held that such deception or trickery does not necessarily compel suppression of the confession or admission but, instead, is one factor to be considered in a totality of the circumstances analysis. See <em>id. </em>at 432-433. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>420 Mass. 666, 673 (1995) (use of false information by police to elicit incriminating statements from defendant is relevant factor in determining whether statements were made involuntarily in violation of due process). In those cases where \u201cthe use of a false statement is the <em>only </em>factor pointing in the direction of involuntariness, it will not ordinarily result in suppression, but ... if the circumstances contain additional indicia suggesting involuntariness, suppression will be required\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, supra </em>at 433. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Selby, supra </em>at 663-665 (where use of false information by detectives, in effort to elicit incriminating statements from defendant, was only factor suggesting alleged coercion, defendant\u2019s statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>held voluntary in totality of circumstances and, therefore, not suppressed), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 563, 567-568 (1979), cert. dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980) (communication of misinformation about strength of Commonwealth\u2019s case, taken alone, not sufficient to establish involuntariness, but presence of other factors suggesting possible coercion will result in suppression of inculpatory statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">In a distinct but related vein, assurances made by the police to a suspect for the purpose of securing a confession or admission may render the suspect\u2019s statements involuntary. Such assurances frequently arise in the context of a suggestion by the police that the defense would benefit from a confession. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, supra </em>at 563-564. \u201cAn officer may suggest broadly that it would be \u2018better\u2019 for a suspect to tell the truth, may indicate that the person\u2019s cooperation would be brought to the attention of the public officials or others involved, or may state in general terms that cooperation has been considered favorably by the courts in the past. What is prohibited, if a confession is to stand, is an assurance, express or implied, that it will aid the defense or result in a lesser sentence.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 564. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brian, </em>445 Mass. 720, 727-728, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 898 (2006) (where, among other factors, detective stopped short of making assurances to defendant about benefits of confessing, defendant\u2019s statement deemed voluntary, not coerced); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395-396 (1997) (statement by police officer that it would be in defendant\u2019s best interest to tell \u201chis side of the story\u201d did not constitute coercion that overrode will of defendant and rendered confession involuntary); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>397 Mass. 410, 414-415 (1986) (statements not induced by assurances of protection or leniency deemed voluntary); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fournier, </em>372 Mass. 346, 348-349 (1977) (good faith promise by police officer not to disclose defendant\u2019s statement to particular patrolman was not inducement to confess because promise \u201cmerely limited the use to be made of the statement the defendant was ready to make\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 267-269 (2004) (misrepresentation of defendant\u2019s right to defend himself at trial, by officer\u2019s incessantly repeated statement that defendant must tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>his side of story \u201cnow-or-never,\u201d irretrievably tainted defendant\u2019s subsequent confession, rendering it involuntary).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Trooper Cummings\u2019s statement to the defendant that they could go \u201coff the record\u201d to discuss the defendant\u2019s opinions about Nelson is not one that fits squarely within the purview of either engaging in trickery or making assurances that a statement will benefit the defense. As to the former, Cummings simply was acquiescing to the defendant\u2019s request that certain of his comments not be included in the written statement that Cummings was preparing with the defendant\u2019s agreement and cooperation. By not including those comments in the written statement, Cummings fulfilled his promise to the defendant and, therefore, did not engage in trickery or deception.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to the latter, Trooper Cummings never gave the defendant any assurances of protection, leniency, or the like. Nonetheless, given that Cummings told the defendant that they could go \u201coff the record\u201d for a portion of their interview, we consider whether certain of the defendant\u2019s statements were involuntary because he could have believed that his \u201coff the record\u201d comments would not be used against him, and, therefore, he was free to say whatever he wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The focus of our inquiry is on coercion because that is the hallmark of an involuntary statement. As we have emphasized, we examine whether the defendant\u2019s will was overborne to the extent that his \u201coff the record\u201d statements were not the result of a rational and voluntary act, and our decision is based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding Trooper Cummings\u2019s interview with the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souza, </em>428 Mass. 478, 483-484 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, supra. </em>This is not an area of the law that is governed by bright-line rules, but is one that requires a fact-intensive analysis. We recognize that a slightly different factual scenario from the one presented here could result in a different outcome.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nonetheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>we decide the case before us, not one that may arise in the future with other factual variables.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Here, after expressing his reluctance to have his opinions about Nelson\u2019s activities included in the written statement, the defendant asked that those comments be \u201coff the record.\u201d Trooper Cummings acquiesced. The transcript of the suppression hearing does not suggest that Cummings pressured or otherwise coerced the defendant into making incriminating statements by indicating that they would be \u201coff the record.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Further, we do not conclude that Trooper Cummings\u2019s representation, by itself, was inherently coercive as a matter of law given that our analysis is based on a totality of the factual circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Once he had expressed his blunt opinions about Nelson\u2019s activities, the defendant then went back \u201con the record\u201d by agreeing to have a \u201cwatered-down version\u201d of his comments included in the written statement. As such, the written statement contained nothing that was \u201coff the record,\u201d and there is no evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>police coercion with regard to the defendant\u2019s decision to include the \u201cwatered-down version\u201d of his comments in the written statement. The defendant was perfectly free to exclude his \u201coff-the-record\u201d comments from the written statement, to make changes to the written statement when he reviewed it, or to refuse to sign it altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">With respect to the few oral statements that remained \u201coff the record,\u201d Trooper Cummings\u2019s simple acquiescence to the defendant\u2019s request that certain of his comments be \u201coff the record\u201d was not so manipulative or coercive that it deprived the defendant of his ability to make a free and rational choice about whether to make such comments in the first instance. This fact, together with all the other circumstances surrounding the interview, which we already have determined did not suggest co-erciveness, supports the conclusion that the defendant\u2019s \u201coff the record\u201d statements were not involuntary. We do not foreclose the possibility that, in different circumstances, if a law enforcement officer tells a suspect that his statements will be \u201coff the record,\u201d a tactic that should be avoided, subsequent statements by the suspect may be deemed involuntary because of the presence of indicia of coercion. Here, however, based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s May 8 interview with Trooper Cummings, that is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The defendant\u2019s \u201coff the record\u201d statements were not involuntary, and, therefore, his motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-16\">In the interest of privacy, we use the same pseudonym adopted by the Appeals Court.

I mean do you think it will do any good that, you know, maybe you\u2019re bringing some attention to the fact that, you know, you\u2019ve been subjected to all of this,\u2019 and that he agreed with me and thought that, you know, maybe we should put something in there. Which, I guess, is what you\u2019re reading. It\u2019s a little bit of a watered down version of what his opinions were.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-8\">These oral statements were admitted at trial.

Testimony regarding the fire investigation and the circumstances surrounding the May 8, 2002, interview was provided by Trooper Cummings and by Henry Houle, the Chelmsford fire investigator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\">At the suppression hearing, defense counsel stated that he did not contend that Trooper Cummings was trying to trick the defendant or was acting with malice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\">See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>10 F.3d 1024, 1028-1032 (3d Cir. 1993) (agent\u2019s statement to suspect that he could tell agent what had happened \u201coff the cuff,\u201d coupled with agent\u2019s reference to prior relationship with suspect as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>basis for inviting suspect to confide in agent, agent\u2019s promise to suspect that statements were not going to be used against him, and agent\u2019s provision of Miranda rights to suspect on previous day, rendered suspect\u2019s confession involuntary and, therefore, inadmissible).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Contrary to the assertion in the dissent, Trooper Cummings never agreed not to testify at trial regarding what the defendant said \u201coff the record,\u201d and Cummings never made any promises to the defendant that his \u201coff the record\u201d statements would not be used against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b237-11\">The dissent proposes that we should reach just such a conclusion \u2014 that Trooper Cummings\u2019s representation is inherently coercive and, consequently, it alone suffices to render the defendant\u2019s \u201coff the record\u201d comments involuntary. This position contradicts the dissent\u2019s acknowledged agreement with the court that the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s \u201coff-the-record\u201d statements is based on a totality of the circumstances. The import of the dissent is that the factual circumstances surrounding a police interrogation become wholly irrelevant because a single action by an officer, here, a statement that a particular discussion could be \u201coff the record,\u201d is deemed inherently coercive, thereby rendering a defendant\u2019s subsequent statements involuntary. No longer would we consider all of the relevant circumstances surrounding the interrogation and the individual characteristics and conduct of the defendant. Instead, one factor, albeit one that has the <em>potential </em>to render subsequent statements involuntary, becomes dispositive, to the exclusion of all else. That is not, and never has been, our jurisprudence with regard to testing the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statements to police. The effect of the dissent is a wholesale erosion of our totality of the circumstances analysis, one that has provided a fair, clear, and workable framework for evaluating the myriad circumstances that can, and do, arise during a police interrogation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b238-8\">Gants, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAy\">(dissenting, with whom Ireland, C.J., joins). I agree with the court that the defendant was not in custody during the interrogation and therefore was not entitled to the warnings required under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966) <em>(Mir</em>anda). I also agree that the sole issue in this case is whether the Commonwealth has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s statements to Trooper Peter Cummings and the Chelmsford fire investigator that Trooper Cummings assured the defendant were \u201coff the record\u201d were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>made voluntarily, and that the voluntariness of these \u201coff the record\u201d statements is based on the totality of the circumstances. I further agree that the record suggests that the defendant was intelligent, that he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the interview, and that the only aspect of the interview that raises an issue of voluntariness is Trooper Cummings\u2019s assurance to the defendant that certain statements were \u201coff the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">I respectfully dissent because I conclude that, where a law enforcement officer promises a suspect that what he says will be off the record, and the suspect speaks to the police in reliance on that promise, the failure to keep that promise is so significant a factor in the totality of the circumstances that it alone suffices to render such statements involuntary. Because the off-the-record statements that were not suppressed were important evidence of the defendant\u2019s motive to commit the arson, I conclude that the judge\u2019s error in denying the motion to suppress these statements was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the judgment of conviction should be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The phrase, \u201coff the record,\u201d has two meanings: \u201cnot recorded as official evidence of a proceeding, such as a trial or deposition,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1196 (9th ed. 2009), and \u201c[c]onfidential; not for publication or attribution.\u201d The Dictionary of American Slang 398 (3d ed. 1995).

Under the first meaning, a statement that is \u201coff the record\u201d would not be admitted in evidence at a criminal trial. Under the second meaning, a statement that is \u201coff the record\u201d may not be quoted or attributed to the declarant, but may be used by the listener to provide background or context to other information the listener has learned, or to develop new information, such as by providing leads that a reporter or investigator may follow up. Under either meaning, an investigator who agrees to accept information from a suspect \u201coff the record\u201d agrees not to testify at trial as to what the declarant said off the record. Here, Trooper Cummings did just that, and the motion judge concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201cthe defendant was likely misled concerning the ultimate use against him\u201d of the statements he made \u201coff the record.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 432 (2004), we recognized that police \u201ctrickery\u201d during an interrogation may cast doubt on the voluntariness of a suspect\u2019s statement. The trickery at issue in that case was the use of a ruse to make the suspect believe that the police had more evidence than they did. <em>Id. </em>at 427 (police suggested to suspect that they possessed videotape surveillance recording of area around residence on day it burned). We concluded that \u201cwhere the use of a false statement [by the police] is the <em>only </em>factor pointing in the direction of involuntariness, it will not ordinarily result in suppression, but ... if the circumstances contain additional indicia suggesting involuntariness, suppression will be required\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 433, and cases cited. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>437 F.3d 1059, 1065 (10th Cir. 2006), quoting <em>Clanton </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>129 F.3d 1147, 1158 (10th Cir. 1997) (\u201cIt is well-settled that a confession is not considered coerced merely because the police misrepresented to a suspect the strength of the evidence against him\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">But there are at least three other forms of police trickery that more severely undermine voluntariness: false promises of leniency in return for a suspect\u2019s statement, false representations regarding the defendant\u2019s right to defend himself at trial, and false promises that the statement will not be used against the suspect. As to false promises of leniency, we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">\u201cAn officer may suggest broadly that it would be \u2018better\u2019 for a suspect to tell the truth, may indicate that the person\u2019s cooperation would be brought to the attention of the public officials or others involved, or may state in general terms that cooperation has been considered favorably by the courts in the past. What is prohibited, if a confession is to stand, is an assurance, express or implied, that it will aid the defense or result in a lesser sentence.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>377 Mass. 552, 564 (1979), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>dismissed, 445 U.S. 39 (1980). We have more recently reaffirmed that, where this line is crossed, the suspect\u2019s statements will be found involuntary. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 269 (2004) (because other grounds tainted defendant\u2019s confession, \u201cwe need not determine whether any implied assurance of leniency made to [the defendant] crossed the line we set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Meehan, [supra]\u201d); Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>424 Mass. 382, 395 (1997) (\u201cofficer suggesting that the defendant should tell \u2018his side of the story\u2019 fell short of the assurance prohibited in <em>Meehan\u201d). </em>See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lopez, supra </em>at 1064-1065 (confession involuntary where Federal agent promised that defendant will spend fifty-four fewer years in prison if he confessed to killing victim by mistake).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">As to false representations regarding the defendant\u2019s right to defend himself at trial, where the interrogating police officer told the defendant that this was his \u201conly opportunity\u201d to offer an explanation for why he hit the victim and \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t give us a reason ... a jury\u2019s never going to hear a reason,\u201d we declared that the misrepresentation of the defendant\u2019s right to defend himself at trial \u201cis a particularly egregious intrusion\u201d on a fundamental right that \u201cis different in degree from false statements regarding the strength or existence of incriminating evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, supra </em>at 268, 269. We concluded that this type of misrepresentation \u201ccasts substantial doubt on the voluntariness of a subsequent confession and on the integrity of the interrogation process leading up to it . . . [that] would be extremely difficult for the Commonwealth to overcome in any case, and it has not done so here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The misrepresentation at issue here \u2014 false promises that a statement will not be used against the suspect \u2014 casts as much substantial doubt on the voluntariness of the statement as false promises of leniency and false representations regarding the defendant\u2019s right to defend himself at trial. Where the police falsely assure a suspect that his statement will aid the defense or result in a lesser sentence, the suspect is misled to believe that he will help himself by making a statement to the police. Where the police falsely represent a suspect\u2019s right to defend himself at trial, the suspect is misled to believe that he must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>speak now or lose the opportunity to offer an explanation as to what happened or the reasons underlying his actions. Where the police falsely promise that a suspect\u2019s statement will not be used against him, the suspect is misled to believe that what he says to the police will not be repeated before a grand jury or at trial. \u201c[G]iven the uniquely influential nature of a promise from a law enforcement official not to use a suspect\u2019s inculpatory statement, such a promise may be the most significant factor in assessing the voluntariness of an accused\u2019s confession in light of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>10 F.3d 1024, 1030 (3d Cir. 1993).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">A suspect\u2019s understanding that anything he says can and will be used against him is so fundamental that where a suspect is in custody, the United States Supreme Court requires that a suspect be so advised as part of the Miranda warnings. <em>Miranda, supra </em>at 469. The police owe no obligation to furnish this warning to a suspect, like the defendant, who is not in custody when interrogated, but there is a world of difference between the police remaining silent as to whether a suspect\u2019s statement will be used against him and the police affirmatively telling a suspect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>that his statement will <em>not </em>be used against him. \u201cIt is only through an awareness of these consequences [that anything said can and will be used against a suspect] that there can be any assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the privilege [against self-incrimination]. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Id. </em>Consequently, where a suspect is assured by an interrogating law enforcement officer that his statement will not be used against him, a statement arising from such an assurance is involuntary. See <em>Streetman </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>812 F.2d 950, 957 (5th Cir. 1987) (\u201c[C]ertain promises, if not kept, are so attractive that they render a resulting confession involuntary. ...

The immunity that was promised not only protected the defendant from the admission in evidence of statements he made to Federal agents while serving as an informant, but also protected him from any derivative use of these statements, and from any use, direct or derivative, of all conversations intercepted during the course of court-authorized electronic surveillance at three separate locations, even conversations in which the defendant did not participate. <em>Id. </em>at 82-83. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that these broad promises of use and derivative use immunity were unenforceable because Federal agents lacked the authority to make them. <em>Id. </em>at 91. The court briefly addressed the defendant\u2019s claim of involuntariness, and rejected it because there was no evidence of any threats, retaliation, violence, or \u201cconsciously misleading conduct on the part of the [Federal] agents,\u201d and because the defendant was neither incarcerated nor under investigation at the time of the asserted promise, and \u201cenjoyed a friendly \u2014 even social \u2014 relationship\u201d with the Federal agents. <em>Id. </em>at 92. In short, the promises made to Flemmi were extraordinarily broad claims of immunity that exceeded the authority of the Federal agents and these promises were made to him as an informant, not as a suspect during interrogation. Therefore, the circumstances in the <em>Flemmi </em>case are far different from those in the other cases cited. Even the <em>Flemmi </em>court appeared to recognize that its case was distinguishable because it cited with approval both <em>United States </em>v. <em>Swint, </em>15 F.3d 286, 290-291 (3d Cir. 1994), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 1028.

I conclude that the statements the defendant made \u201coff the record\u201d should be suppressed, and the conviction should be reversed because the admission of these statements was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>1 respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">At trial, Trooper Peter Cummings admitted that he had lied to the defendant when he assured him that what he said would be \u201coff the record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Judge Richard A. Posner has written that \u201cthe courts\u2019 actual as distinct from articulated standard [for involuntariness] is to ask whether the government has made it impossible for the defendant to make a <em>rational </em>choice as to whether to confess \u2014 has made it in other words impossible for him to weigh the pros and cons of confessing\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rutledge, </em>900 F.2d 1127, 1129 (7th Cir.), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 875 (1990). He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">\u201cIf the officers, fully intending to use anything [the defendant] said against him, had said to him, \u2018Tell us all you know about the drug trade, and we promise you that nothing you tell us will be used against you,\u2019 then he would have a strong argument that any ensuing confession had been extracted by fraud and was involuntary. . . . For in our hypothetical case the officers would have deflected [the defendant] from weighing the pros and cons of confessing and going in the direction that the balance leaned. Alternatively, [the defendant] could in our hypothetical case hold the government to its promise, and could do so whether or not the promise was fraudulent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1130.

See <em>ante </em>at 210 n.7. That prior relationship was relevant only because it strengthened the inference that the defendant believed the Federal agent\u2019s assurance that he would not use what he said against him. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walton, supra </em>at 1030. Here, where Trooper Cummings expressly agreed that part of what the defendant said would be off the record and even negotiated with the defendant to place certain off-the-record statements \u201con the record,\u201d there is no reason for the defendant to have disbelieved the trooper\u2019s assurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b247-5\">At a retrial, the prosecution would be able to offer in evidence all of the defendant\u2019s statements to Trooper Cummings and the fire investigator except those made off the record during the interview, including all the information that Trooper Cummings included in his report of the interview.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
