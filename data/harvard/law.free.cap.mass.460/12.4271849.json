He asserts error in (1) the admission of evidence of a conversation between the victim and their daughter that supplied motive for the murder; (2) the denial of his motion for a mistrial arising out of a witness\u2019s unanticipated change in her testimony, and the disclosure of the defendant\u2019s previous trial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> during the Commonwealth\u2019s direct examination of the witness; (3) the prosecutor\u2019s use during closing argument of an erroneous time-line chart, and calling for a conviction on less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt; (4) the judge\u2019s refusal to give a so-called <em>Bowden </em>instruction, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980); and (5) a jury instruction that failed adequately to explain deliberate premeditation. We affirm the conviction and decline to reduce the degree of guilt or order a new trial pursuant to our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">1. <em>Background. </em>The defendant and the victim had three children. They lived in an apartment in Chelsea. The defendant exerted considerable control over his wife. He would not allow her to have a driver\u2019s license, and he consistently denied visits by friends and relatives. He eavesdropped on her telephone conversations. They argued often, and he was physically abusive. One of their sons once heard the defendant threaten to kill the victim if she left him. The defendant and the victim had separated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>for about one year before the murder, but he had continued his efforts to control her life. The victim kept their Chelsea apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The victim began dating a man she had met three years before. He had moved to Brooklyn, New York, and she began to visit him there. They agreed he would move into her Chelsea apartment, which he did, on May 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">On the evening of April 30, 2000, the victim and the defendant went out to dinner. Their daughter, who had been sleeping, was awakened by the sound of the victim screaming and crying as she returned home. She told her daughter that they went out to dinner because she wanted to tell the defendant she intended to file for divorce, and that her boy friend would be moving in the next day. She said the defendant had just tried to run her over with his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">On May 1, the victim paged the defendant from a store and asked him to help her carry some groceries home. He arrived in a white van he used in his business as a self-employed contractor. He drove the victim to her apartment and helped her carry the groceries upstairs. That night, the victim\u2019s boy friend arrived at her apartment with his belongings.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">At about 8 a.m. the next morning, May 2, the boy friend left to apply for a job. The victim was alive at the time. Between 8:30 and 8:55 a.m., two neighbors noticed a white van parked on the street near the victim\u2019s apartment building. Between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., Jose Santiago, another tenant in the victim\u2019s apartment building, arrived there with his brother. A tire on his car was flat, and he walked to the rear of the apartment building to get some tools to fix the tire. The defendant, whom he knew, was walking down the driveway toward the street. Santiago greeted the defendant but received no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Santiago also encountered Francisco Guzman, the landlord, at the rear of the building. Guzman was working on a car. They talked for a few minutes. Santiago and Guzman both noticed that the back door to the building was open. Guzman had gone outside to work on his car sometime between 8:45 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. Just before he went out he heard a \u201cdragging\u201d sound coming from the master bedroom of the victim\u2019s apartment. He locked the back door of the building on his way out.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The victim\u2019s boy friend returned to the apartment sometime after 10 a.m. He found the victim, unresponsive, on her bed. He saw blood on her left side, and her neck was black. He promptly telephoned 911. Chelsea police were dispatched at 10:14 a.m.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The victim was transported by ambulance to a nearby hospital. She died on May 17, 2000, due to strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The defendant gave a statement to police on the afternoon of May 2, 2000. He said he had left his home at about 8 a.m. to buy a door at the South Bay Home Depot store for a client in Waltham. He then bought breakfast at a McDonald\u2019s restaurant near Meridian Street in the East Boston section of Boston. At about 9:15 a.m. he telephoned the victim to inquire about the results of a medical test he had undergone. He then drove to his client\u2019s home in Waltham via Routes 16 and 60, stopping for gasoline en route. He arrived at his client\u2019s home at about 10:30 a.m., where he worked until 2 p.m., installing the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Police investigated the defendant\u2019s potential alibi, confirming that he purchased a door at the South Bay Home Depot store at 8:50 a.m. on May 2, 2000. Police also confirmed that the defendant had installed a door at his client\u2019s home in Waltham on that day. Police determined that it would take about fifteen minutes to drive from the store to the McDonald\u2019s restaurant where the defendant said he bought breakfast, and about seven minutes to drive to the victim\u2019s apartment in Chelsea. That particular restaurant is not on a direct route from the Home Depot store to the client\u2019s Waltham home, and there are at least six other McDonald\u2019s restaurants on a direct route from the Home Depot store to the Ghent\u2019s Waltham home. A State police lieutenant drove at \u201cnormal speed\u201d from the McDonald\u2019s restaurant to the Ghent\u2019s Waltham home, following the route indicated by the defendant. With a delay at a train crossing, the trip took forty-three minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The sole defense witness, a tenant who lived at the Waltham home of the defendant\u2019s client, testified that she was awakened by construction noises at about 10:50 a.m. or 11 a.m. on May 2, 2000. She looked out her window and saw a white van. A postal supervisor who was monitoring the route of a letter carrier on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>that day, keeping detailed records, testified that the letter carrier began delivering mail at 10:35 a.m. on May 2, 2000, on the street in Waltham where the client\u2019s house was located. The letter carrier also testified. He estimated it takes about five minutes to reach the end of the street. Neither the supervisor nor the letter carrier heard any construction noise nor did they see a white van on the street that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">2. <em>Hearsay evidence. </em>The prosecutor asked the defendant\u2019s daughter if the victim told her on April 30, 2000, what \u201ccaused him to try to run her over\u201d with his car. The defendant argues that this question called for testimony that was speculative as to the defendant\u2019s state of mind, and as such was objectionable. There was no objection, thus our review is under the standard of a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">We agree with the defendant that the question was objectionable. It called for speculation about the defendant\u2019s state of mind. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Millyan, </em>399 Mass. 171,183 (1987). However, the answer would have been admissible as an excited utterance in response to a properly phrased series of questions directed at the cause of the victim\u2019s crying and screaming at that moment. \u201cThe underlying exciting event may be proved by the excited utterance itself.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>436 Mass. 252, 255 (2002). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 803 (2) (2011). The underlying exciting event, the defendant\u2019s attempt to run over the victim after she told him she was filing for divorce and that her boy friend was moving in that night, was relevant evidence as to the defendant\u2019s motive to kill. There was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">After the daughter testified about the victim\u2019s explanation for her emotional state, the prosecutor asked her whether the victim then did something. She testified that the victim \u201cpaged [the defendant].\u201d The prosecutor asked if there was a response to the page, to which the daughter testified the telephone rang, the victim answered the telephone and said to the defendant, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d while she was \u201cstill crying hysterically, shaking, [and] screaming.\u201d There was no objection. The defendant contends that this was not an excited utterance. We disagree. The evidence indicated the victim continued to be under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>influence of the defendant\u2019s attempt to run her over, and the absence of any abatement of that excitement during the telephone call created an inference that she was indeed talking to the defendant. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">3. <em>Motion for a mistrial. </em>The defendant argues on appeal that it was error to deny his motion for a mistrial, or alternatively, to strike the testimony of a witness, the basis of whose testimony changed from that on which she was allowed to testify, and because the prosecutor\u2019s examination of the witness disclosed the fact of the defendant\u2019s prior trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The prosecutor notified defense counsel three days before trial was scheduled to begin that the daughter of Francisco Guzman, the landlord, had just disclosed for the first time to an agent of the Commonwealth, that she saw the defendant descending the back stairs from the victim\u2019s apartment on the morning of the murder. Defense counsel filed a motion for a continuance to investigate the accuracy of this information. He also requested a voir dire of the witness, which was conducted the day before trial commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The witness testified at the voir dire that she met with the prosecutor and investigators three days before trial and told them something about the case she had not previously disclosed to anyone except to her twin brother some time after the defendant\u2019s original conviction. She disclosed that she saw the defendant coming down the back stairs from the victim\u2019s apartment on the morning of the murder. She said she had not previously disclosed this information because she was afraid. The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">At trial, the witness testified she was awakened on the morning of May 2, 2000, by the sound of loud banging noises, and the screaming and yelling of a woman coming from the victim\u2019s apartment, which was directly above her apartment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the noise stopped she opened the back door of her apartment and saw the defendant coming down the stairs. They made eye contact. Anticipating impeachment on the point, the prosecutor asked if she mentioned this to police at the time. She said she remembered mentioning it. The prosecutor himself then started <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>to impeach her with the transcript of her testimony in 2002, but he appears to have been distracted by a rapid series of side bar conferences and he did not resume what he set out to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">At the end of the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination, defense counsel moved to strike the witness\u2019s testimony, or in the alternative, for a mistrial, arguing that he was faced with the difficulty of having to deal with the issue of a late disclosure by the witness that had evolved into a late disclosure by the <em>Commonwealth,</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as well as the difficulty he would have in cross-examining a witness who remembered little. He also complained that his only means of impeachment was the witness\u2019s prior recorded testimony from the defendant\u2019s first trial, the fact of which had become apparent by the prosecutor\u2019s efforts to impeach her. He stressed that any use of her prior recorded testimony would only emphasize the existence of the first trial. The motion to strike and the motion for a mistrial were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Defense counsel cross-examined the witness effectively. He emphasized her failure to mention anything to her father, who was out in the yard at the time and at one point came into the apartment. He elicited testimony that underscored the presence of extensive gaps in her recollection of other details. He dwelled on her failure to telephone police. He emphasized that she was friendly with the victim and that she knew something about the victim\u2019s boy friend, but she had no recollection of details. Finally, he secured her admission that she had no recollection of what she told police on the day of the murder. He never impeached the witness with her prior testimony. In his closing argument he referred to her testimony essentially as preposterous, then pinned it on the Commonwealth with great effect by suggesting the prosecutor\u2019s theory of the case depended on that fanciful testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In his closing argument the prosecutor tried to distance himself from the witness, describing her as anything but \u201c[l]ikable, cooperative, exact and . . . nice.\u201d Continuing, he stated he had no idea \u201cwhy she behaved the way she did from the witness stand .... And if you chose to dismiss her testimony outright, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>if you chose to say, T don\u2019t believe her, don\u2019t want her involved in any part of this case,\u2019 I can\u2019t really blame you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Review of a decision denying a motion for a mistrial is for an abuse of discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>405 Mass. 339, 345 n.8 (1989). \u201c[T]he burden of demonstrating an abuse of discretion is a heavy one.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Medeiros, </em>395 Mass. 336, 351 (1985). It requires a showing that \u201cno conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by him.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bys, </em>370 Mass. 350, 361 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">It is important to state at the outset that the defendant does not claim that the Commonwealth goaded him into moving for a mistrial such that principles of double jeopardy might be implicated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301, 311-312 (1984). Nor does the record suggest any such misconduct. There is nothing to show why the Commonwealth would have withheld evidence that an eyewitness had seen the defendant leaving the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Similarly, to the extent that the late disclosure was the result of the witness\u2019s failure to disclose what she knew until three days before trial, and that the prosecutor then promptly provided defense counsel with her statement, there has been no showing of a violation of a discovery order by the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ira I. </em>439 Mass. 805, 809-811 (2003). The defendant does not offer this as a basis for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The defendant\u2019s focus, instead, is on the \u201cpotential misconduct by the Commonwealth\u201d when the witness testified at trial that she remembered telling police the day of the murder that she saw the defendant descending the back stairs from the victim\u2019s apartment. The problem with the defendant\u2019s position is that he has not shown that the witness did tell police on the day of the murder that she saw the defendant descending the back stairs. He acknowledges that there is only \u201cpotential\u201d for this conclusion. The judge made no findings to this effect, and trial counsel (who is not appellate counsel) did not request a voir dire during the trial. Instead, he proceeded with his cross-examination and succeeded in obtaining a statement from the witness to the effect that she really had no recollection what she told police on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Even if the witness in fact had told police that she saw the defendant inside the apartment building on the morning of the murder, he has not shown how he was prejudiced. The defendant correctly notes that although the witness\u2019s testimony was incriminating, it also was exculpatory. It was incriminating because she was the only witness who placed him inside the victim\u2019s apartment building near the time of the murder. It was exculpatory because the late disclosure was at variance with her previous statements and therefore provided a basis to challenge her credibility as a key Commonwealth witness. Whether the evidence was incriminating, exculpatory, or both, where, as here, there has been disclosure but no evidence of bad faith, the question becomes whether the defendant had sufficient time to adjust to the disclosure in shaping and preparing his defense. Stated another way, the defendant must show prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>426 Mass. 67, 70 (1997) (denial of motion for two-week continuance not abuse of discretion where defendant failed to show prejudice by late disclosure of inculpa-tory fingerprint evidence); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 435, 441-443 (1992) (abuse of discretion in denial of mistrial where defendant demonstrated that more time was needed to develop defense fully after late disclosure of exculpatory evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Despite his assertion that the late disclosure provided him no time to adjust his trial strategy, the defendant has shown no prejudice. The defense was alibi, which defense counsel announced in his opening statement, saying, \u201cThis case is a case about a door and a clock. Nothing more.\u201d Although the landlord\u2019s daughter placed him inside the victim\u2019s apartment building on the morning of the murder, defense counsel had thoroughly discredited her and jeopardized the Commonwealth\u2019s credibility in the process. He essentially transformed the in-culpatory aspect of her testimony into its full exculpatory value, driving the prosecutor to embark on the extremely unusual tactic of disavowing the witness\u2019s entire testimony. If there was even a possibility of error, which we doubt, there certainly was no prejudice to his alibi defense from the late disclosure of the testimony of this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The defendant further argues that he was entitled to a mistrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>because the prosecutor referred to a \u201cprior proceeding\u201d (four times) and a \u201ctrial transcript\u201d (once) when questioning the witness, and because the prosecutor and the witness each referred to her testimony at a prior occasion \u201c[a]t court\u201d (once). This is not a case like <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Arsenault, 361 Mass. 287, 299-300 (1972), where numerous references to a \u201cprior proceeding,\u201d together with the statement of a witness who met the defendant in prison, gave rise to an inference that the defendant had been tried previously and convicted. There was no evidence the defendant was in prison. There was nothing intentional about these few references and they appear to have been used by the prosecutor out of frustration over the witness\u2019s unresponsiveness. No curative instruction was requested, suggesting that experienced defense counsel\u2019s evaluation was to call no further attention to the references in question. We conclude that there was no prejudice, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Qualls, </em>440 Mass. 576, 583-584 (2003), and that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Because the witness\u2019s testimony as to her observations of the defendant inside the apartment building on the morning of the murder was admissible, and because there was nothing objectionable about the questions soliciting that testimony, there was no error in denying the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">4. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and his use of a time-line chart during closing argument to address the defendant\u2019s alibi were misleading, and he called for a conviction based not on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but on common sense. Although defense counsel objected to the use of the chart, the basis for the objection was that he had not seen it before. He made no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument itself. Consequently, the issue of the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument is unpreserved, and we review to determine whether any error created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 681 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">A prosecutor is \u201centitled to marshal the evidence and suggest inferences that the jury may draw from it.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drayton, </em>386 Mass. 39, 52 (1982). Inferences need not be in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>escapable, just reasonable and possible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marquetty, </em>416 Mass. 445, 452 (1993). A prosecutor may not \u201cmisstate the evidence or refer to facts not in evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, 399 </em>Mass. 514, 516 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument was grounded in the evidence and we are satisfied that he did not misrepresent any witness\u2019s testimony. The thrust of his argument simply was that after considering the variety of ranges and estimates of times contained in the testimony of the witnesses, there was a window of time from 9:24 to 9:52 a.m. on May 2, 2000, that was unaccounted for in the defendant\u2019s statement to police during which he could have committed the murder. In short, his alibi was not air tight. The prosecutor made it clear to the jury that not all the testimony of the witnesses fit neatly into his analysis, but those differences could be explained as human error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He told the jury he was \u201cusing conservative numbers\u201d and he was \u201cnot trying to stretch anything.\u201d He then said, \u201cIf there is something about what I\u2019m saying that\u2019s unreasonable, then dismiss it. You don\u2019t have to take my word for it.\u201d The argument was both fair and reasonable, and the absence of any objection from experienced defense counsel suggests there was nothing unfairly prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, </em>395 Mass. 354, 360 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The time-line chart was nothing more than a chalk. It served as a useful, nonprejudicial aid to jurors in understanding the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, which referred to numerous approximations of times of day. There has been no showing that it was an inaccurate reflection of that closing argument. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>454 Mass. 440, 446 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Finally, the prosecutor did not ask the jury to apply a \u201ccommon sense\u201d burden of proof rather than \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d His request that the jury apply their common sense was proper, and did not diminish the reasonable doubt standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>419 Mass. 192, 202-203 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">5. Bowden <em>instruction. </em>The defendant asserts error in the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>refusal to give an instruction that reflected the rule of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980) <em>(Bowden). </em>As we have stated on many occasions, \u201ca judge is not required to instruct on the claimed inadequacy of a police investigation. <em>\u2018Bowden </em>simply holds that a judge may not remove the issue from the jury\u2019s consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boateng, </em>438 Mass. 498, 507 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>432 Mass. 578, 590 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 767 (2009); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>439 Mass. 678, 687 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on Federal cases is misplaced. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>524 F.3d 134, 138-139 (1st Cir. 2008). <em>Bowden </em>does not create a \u201cdefense\u201d in the sense that it creates an element of proof that the Commonwealth must prove or disprove beyond a reasonable doubt, such that a particular instruction is required. <em>Bowden </em>merely recognizes that a defendant is entitled to present evidence that \u201ccertain tests were not conducted or certain police procedures not followed [that] could raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt in the minds of the jurors.\u201d <em>Bowden, supra </em>at 486. Defense counsel presented such evidence, and he argued the absence of various tests and the failure to seize certain items of physical evidence as matters demonstrating inadequacies of the investigation. He did what <em>Bowden </em>permitted him to do, but <em>Bowden </em>requires nothing more. The judge\u2019s instructions on credibility and reasonable doubt were adequate, and they allowed the defendant the opportunity to present fully this factual issue to the jury. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">6. <em>Deliberate premeditation instruction. </em>There is no merit to the argument that the instruction on deliberate premeditation was erroneous. The judge delivered the approved instruction from the Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 7-10 (1999). The instruction that the defendant now contends, for the first time on appeal, should have been given, has been rejected recently in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 397-398 (2008). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">7. <em>G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the entire record, the briefs, and the arguments, and see no reason to reduce the degree of guilt or order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-10\">The defendant\u2019s first trial resulted in a conviction of deliberately premeditated murder that was affirmed on appeal. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lao, </em>443 Mass. 770 (2005). He subsequently filed a motion for a new trial alleging that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise challenges under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to certain statements admitted in evidence. The motion was denied, but we reversed and ordered a new trial.
