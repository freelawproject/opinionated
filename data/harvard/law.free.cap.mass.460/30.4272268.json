Ct. 1473 (2010) <em>(Padilla). </em>In <em>Padilla, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that defense counsel\u2019s failure to advise a client that a consequence of his guilty plea likely would be deportation constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 1483. The defendant asserts that he was similarly ill served by his counsel and asks us to vacate his guilty pleas. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">To decide this case, we must determine whether <em>Padilla </em>applies retroactively to the defendant\u2019s collateral challenge to his convictions, and, if so, whether he has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s shortcomings. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that <em>Padilla </em>is to be applied retroactively on collateral review of guilty pleas obtained after the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (eff. April 1, 1997). We also conclude that the defendant has made an insufficient showing that had he been properly informed of the immigration consequences of his guilty pleas, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. Therefore, we affirm the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The following facts are drawn from the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact and the incident report filed by the police. On February 16, 2004, two Boston police officers were monitoring the Mattapan Square area of Boston when they observed a group of teenagers standing at the comer of Babson Street and Crossman Street. As they drove by, the defendant made eye contact with one officer and then began walking away from the group. The officers turned their vehicle around and noticed the defendant standing on the front porch of a house with his hands in his pockets. The officers pulled up to the home and asked the defendant if they could speak with him. The defendant met the officers on the sidewalk, and the officers noticed a strong odor of alcohol. The defendant admitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>drinking and that he was only seventeen years of age. The defendant stated that his friend lived at the home, but a resident in the home denied knowing the defendant. One officer conducted a patfnsk of the defendant out of concern that he might have a weapon and found two small bottles of brandy. The officers placed the defendant under arrest for being a minor in possession of alcohol. A search incident to arrest of the defendant revealed multiple bags of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine and marijuana, a cellular telephone, and $1,115 in cash.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The arrest took place 339 feet from the Mildred Middle School property line. During the booking procedure, after being read his Miranda rights, the defendant stated that the marijuana was packaged as \u201cdime-bags, $10.00 each\u201d and that the crack cocaine was packaged in \u201c$10.00 rocks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">On February 2, 2005, the defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A; possession of a class D substance with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C; and underage possession of liquor, G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 34C. In return, the Commonwealth agreed to the dismissal of two counts of school zone violations, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 321, each of which carried a mandatory minimum two-year house of correction sentence and, if charged in an indictment, a maximum fifteen-year prison term. The defendant was sentenced to two years in a house of correction, with five months to be served and the balance suspended, and two years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">On December 15, 2009, the United States Department of Homeland Security served the defendant with a notice to appear, stating that he was subject to removal from the United States for being convicted of an aggravated felony and for being convicted of a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This prompted the defendant to file his first motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), in which he sought to withdraw his guilty pleas on the ground that they were not knowing and voluntary because he did not understand the intent element of the crimes. That motion was denied on February 9, 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 14, 2010, the defendant filed his second motion for a new trial, this time alleging ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In support of his second motion, the defendant filed an affidavit of counsel who represented him at the plea hearing, in which she averred that she had been unaware that the defendant was not a United States citizen, and had no memory of discussing any immigration consequences that might arise from his pleas of guilty. The defendant also submitted an affidavit stating that he was not told that his guilty pleas would result in deportation. Although the tape recording of the plea hearing was no longer available,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5the docket sheet in the case bears the stamp: \u201cDeportation Warning Given,\u201d and the court file includes a tender of plea form, signed by the defendant, which states: \u201cI understand that if I am not a citizen of the United States, conviction of this offense may have the consequences of deportation . . . .\u201d The tender of plea also bears the judge\u2019s signed certification that \u201cthe defendant was informed and advised that if he or she is not a citizen of the United States, a conviction of the offense with which he or she was charged may have the consequences of deportation,\u201d as well as defense counsel\u2019s signature certifying that she had explained this provision (and other provisions) of the law to the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge denied the defendant\u2019s second motion for a new trial without a written decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>2. <em>Retroactivity. </em>Because the decision in <em>Padilla </em>came after the defendant\u2019s convictions were final, we must determine whether the holding in that case applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Federal law on the retroactive application of constitutional decisions was articulated in <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288 (1989) (Teague).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In that case, the Supreme Court held that a \u201cnew\u201d constitutional rule of criminal law does not apply on collateral review to convictions that were final before the new rule was announced.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 301. \u201cUnder the <em>Teague </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>framework, an old rule applies both on direct and collateral review, but a new rule is generally applicable only to cases that are still on direct review.\u201d <em>Whorton </em>v. <em>Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The Supreme Court in <em>Teague </em>acknowledged the difficulty of determining when a rule is new, and chose not to define a \u201cnew rule\u201d except to state that, \u201c[i]n general, ... a case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government. ... To put it differently, a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Teague, supra </em>at 301. In fairness, the Supreme Court, since <em>Teague, </em>has given broad articulation to the meaning of when a mle is \u201cnew,\u201d thus limiting review in collateral challenges, and \u201cvalidat[ing] reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts\u201d even though they are \u201ccontrary to later decisions.\u201d <em>Butler </em>v. <em>McKeller, </em>494 U.S. 407, 414 (1990). See <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>542 U.S. 406, 411 (2004), quoting <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>506 U.S. 461, 468 (1993) (court must ascertain \u201clegal landscape\u201d existing at time conviction became final); <em>O\u2019Dell </em>v. <em>Netherland, </em>521 U.S. 151, 156 (1997) (\u201cwe will not disturb a final state conviction or sentence unless it can be said that a state court, at the time the conviction or sentence became final, would have acted objectively unreasonably by not extending the relief later sought in federal court\u201d); <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Collins, supra </em>at 467, quoting <em>Saffle </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>494 U.S. 484, 488 (1990) (holding is new and thus not ordinarily retroactive \u201cunless reasonable jurists hearing petitioner\u2019s claim at the time his conviction became final \u2018would have felt compelled by existing precedent\u2019 to rule in his favor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">It is thus not surprising that the Commonwealth argues that the rule announced in <em>Padilla </em>is a \u201cnew\u201d rule because it was not \u201cdictated\u201d by precedent and \u201cabrogated both widespread federal and stated precedent.\u201d Indeed, in concluding that defense counsel was ineffective by failing to advise her client of the virtually automatic deportation consequences of his guilty plea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the Supreme Court in <em>Padilla </em>effectively changed the law in the nine circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals that had previously addressed the issue. See <em>Broomes </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 1251 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1034 (2004); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>322 F.3d 1198 (9th Cir. 2003); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>202 F.3d 20 (1st Cir. 2000); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354 (5th Cir. 1993); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Del Rosario, </em>902 F.2d 55 (D.C. Cir. 1990); <em>United States </em>v. <em>George, </em>869 F.2d 333 (7th Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yearwood, </em>863 F.2d 6 (4th Cir. 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>778 F.2d 764 (11th Cir. 1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Santelises, </em>476 F.2d 787 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">However, as the Supreme Court has also stated: \u201cEven though we have characterized the new rule inquiry as whether \u2018reasonable jurists\u2019 could disagree as to whether a result is dictated by precedent, the standard for determining when a case establishes a new rule is \u2018objective,\u2019 and the mere existence of conflicting authority does not necessarily mean a rule is new.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 410 (2000), quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 304 (1992) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Of particular relevance to the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel raised in <em>Padilla, </em>Justice Kennedy has noted that it may be harder to find a \u201cnew rule\u201d in a case where the existing precedent established a general standard that can only be applied after analysis of the facts of a given case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">\u201cWhether the prisoner seeks the application of an old rule in a novel setting . . . depends in large part on the nature of the rule. If the rule in question is one which of necessity requires a case-by-case examination of the evidence, then we can tolerate a number of specific applications without saying that those applications themselves create a new rule .... Where the beginning point is a rule of this general application, a rule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one not dictated by precedent.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\"><em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, supra </em>at 308-309 (Kennedy, J., concurring).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 382. Reflecting this same view, the Supreme Court, in <em>Bousley </em>v. <em>United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 619-620 (1998), rejected an invitation to find that <em>Teague </em>barred a defendant\u2019s claim that his plea was not voluntary because he was misinformed about the elements of a crime, concluding that \u201c[t]he only constitutional claim made here is that petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing and intelligent. There is surely nothing new about this principle . . . <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">With this framework in mind, we look more specifically to the holdings and reasoning of <em>Padilla </em>and of the watershed Sixth Amendment case of <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984) <em>(Strickland), </em>on which it relies. There is no question that the holding in <em>Padilla </em>is an extension of the rule in <em>Strickland, </em>which articulated the two steps required for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">\u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 687. See <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1482-1483. Nor is there any question that the Supreme Court was applying the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>standard when it concluded that the failure of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation was constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>It is important, therefore, to review the precise way in which <em>Strickland </em>governs ineffective assistance claims. In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that the proper standard for constitutionally adequate representation was \u201creasonably effective assistance,\u201d and that to prevail on a claim of constitutional ineffectiveness, a \u201cdefendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687, 688. A court faced with such a claim must inquire \u201cwhether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690. Although in its <em>Strickland </em>decision the Supreme Court listed certain \u201cbasic duties\u201d of an attorney such as avoiding conflicts of interest and keeping a client informed of developments in the prosecution, it declined to define the constitutional obligations of counsel in more specific terms, <em>id. </em>at 688, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201cMore specific guidelines are not appropriate. The Sixth Amendment refers simply to \u2018counsel,\u2019 not specifying particular requirements of effective assistance. It relies instead on the legal profession\u2019s maintenance of standards sufficient to justify the law\u2019s presumption that counsel will fulfill the role in the adversary process that the Amendment envisions. . . . The proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\"><em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court went on to explain that a court reviewing an ineffective assistance claim \u201cmust judge the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Thus, the <em>Strickland </em>case \u201c[b]y its very terms . . . provides a general standard which calls for some examination of the facts.\u201d <em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, supra </em>at 308 (Kennedy, J., concurring). The beginning point is a rule of general application designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts. <em>Id. </em>at 308-309 (Kennedy, J., concurring). The Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in subsequent cases applying <em>Strickland </em>lends further support to the proposition that such claims present the sort of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>case-by-case application of a general standard that will rarely create a \u201cnew rule.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra </em>at 390, the Supreme Court held that the question whether the defendant was seeking to apply a \u201crule of law that was clearly established\u201d when his conviction became final was \u201ceasily answered because the merits of his claim are squarely governed by our holding in <em>Strickland.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court explained: \u201cThat the <em>Strickland </em>test \u2018of necessity requires a case-by-case examination of the evidence,\u2019 obviates . . . neither the clarity of the rule nor the extent to which the rule must be seen as \u2018established\u2019 by this Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 391, quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, supra </em>at 308 (Kennedy, J., concurring). See <em>Osagiede </em>v. <em>United States, </em>543 F.3d 399, 408 n.4 (7th Cir. 2008), quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, supra </em>(Kennedy, J., concurring) (holding that, although petitioner cited no case where <em>Strickland </em>claims had succeeded under particular theory, application of <em>Strickland </em>in novel context did not create new rule). The Supreme Court then used the language of retroactivity analysis: \u201cThis Court\u2019s precedent \u2018dictated\u2019 that the Virginia Supreme Court apply the <em>Strickland </em>test.... And it can hardly be said that recognizing the right to effective counsel \u2018breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra, </em>quoting <em>Teague, supra </em>at 301. The Court noted that \u201cthe <em>Strickland </em>test provides sufficient guidance for resolving virtually all ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 484 (2000) (Flores-Ortega), also illustrates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>particular applications of <em>Strickland </em>are not necessarily \u201cnew rules,\u201d even when the Court resolves conflicting authority. In that case, the Supreme Court settled a conflict among some of the circuit courts of the United States Court of Appeals regarding the obligations of counsel to inform their clients about their appellate rights. <em>Id. </em>at 476. The First and Ninth Circuits had adopted a bright line rule that constitutionally effective counsel must file a notice of appeal unless the defendant specifically instructs otherwise and failing to do so was \u201cper se deficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 478. The Supreme Court rejected the bright line rule as inconsistent with <em>Strickland's </em>holding that \u201cthe performance inquiry must be whether counsel\u2019s assistance was reasonable considering all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 688.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Despite the existence of conflicting authority prior to the Court\u2019s decision, and the relative specificity of the rule that the Supreme Court laid out,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> courts that have considered the question have found that <em>Flores-Ortega </em>did not announce a new rule. See <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>493 F.3d 1135, 1143-1144 (9th Cir. 2007) (\u201cEach time that a court delineates what \u2018reasonably effective assistance\u2019 requires of defense attorneys with respect to a particular aspect of client representation, see <em>Strickland, [supra </em>at 687], it can hardly be thought to have created a new principle of constitutional law\u201d); <em>Frazer </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>430 F.3d 696, 704-705 (4th Cir. 2005) <em>(\u201cFlores-Ortega </em>simply crystalizes the application of <em>Strickland </em>to the specific context presented by [the defendant\u2019s] claim\u201d); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>359 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>F.3d 646, 655 (3d Cir. 2004) <em>(Strickland </em>is \u201crule of general applicability,\u201d and identification of <em>\u201cparticular </em>duty,\u201d to consult regarding appeal options, is not basis for classifying rule as \u201cnew\u201d). But see <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>283 F.3d 697, 708 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 874 (2002) (appearing, without discussion, to assume that <em>Flores-Ortega </em>created new rule, but finding that case was inapplicable).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">A conclusion that <em>Padilla </em>is not a \u201cnew rule\u201d but merely an application of <em>Strickland </em>is also informed by the reasoning and language of the <em>Padilla </em>decision itself.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court began its discussion of constitutional effectiveness by chronicling the extensive changes in immigration law in the past decades, from a system where deportation was rare and often preventable by a favorable exercise of judicial or administrative discretion, to a system where deportation is a near-mandatory consequence of many convictions. <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1478-1480. As a result of these consequences, \u201c[t]he importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1480. The Court cited the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-546 (effective April 1, 1997) (IIRIRA), as pivotal, and the point at which, \u201cif a non-citizen has committed a removable offense . . . , his removal is practically inevitable . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1480. HRIRA \u201celiminated the Attorney General\u2019s authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation, an authority that had been exercised to prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens during the 5-year period prior to 1996.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing IIRIRA. Coupled with an expansive class of deportable offenses, see <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1478-1480, enactment of IIRIRA \u201cdramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen\u2019s criminal conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1480. Thus, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cdeportation is an integral part \u25a0 \u2014 \u25a0 indeed, sometimes the most important part \u2014 of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specific crimes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Where the Supreme Court of Kentucky (in Padilla) declined to consider the increasing importance of the severe immigration consequences arising from criminal convictions by labeling deportation from the United States as \u201ccollateral consequences\u201d of a criminal conviction to which the representation required by the Sixth Amendment, and interpreted in <em>Strickland, </em>did not extend, the Supreme Court pointed out that the distinction between \u201ccollateral\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d consequences had never been made in its Sixth Amendment jurisprudence and is not well suited to evaluating deportation, a consequence which is so \u201cintimately related to the criminal process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1481-1482. Consequently, the Supreme Court concluded that advice about deportation is not categorically removed from the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 1482.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Finding <em>Strickland </em>applicable, the Supreme Court went on to apply <em>Strickland </em>to the context of advice about immigration consequences. <em>Id. </em>at 1482-1483. Noting that the standard for constitutionally deficient representation was \u201cnecessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1482, the Court cited to numerous practitioner sources and a prior Supreme Court case, <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv. </em>v. <em>St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289 (2001), as evidence that \u201c[t]he weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1482. In the case of the defendant in <em>Padilla, </em>the removal statute made clear that a conviction would make him removable, and his counsel affirmatively misadvised him, making it an easily identified case of deficient representation. <em>Id. </em>at 1483. However, in light of the prevailing norms it had recognized and described, the Court went further to articulate more specifically the requirements of constitutionally adequate counsel in the representation of noncitizens facing immigration law consequences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">\u201cWhen the law is not succinct and straightforward . . . a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences. But when the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Rejecting the invitation to limit its holding to cases of affirmative misadvice, the Supreme Court noted that such a rule would encourage attorneys to be silent as to these consequences, <em>id. </em>at 1484, and concluded: \u201cIt is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so \u2018clearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 62 (1985) (White, J., concurring) <em>(Hill). </em>This is the definitive application of an established constitutional standard on a case-by-case basis, incorporating evolving professional norms (on which the standard relies) to new facts. It is not the creation of a new constitutional rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">A fair reading of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Padilla </em>also suggests that the Justices themselves assumed that their holding would be retroactively applied. For example, the Court\u2019s opinion spoke specifically to the Solicitor General\u2019s concern that its decision would open the \u201cfloodgates\u201d and disturb the finality of convictions, <em>id. </em>at 1484, in terms that would have been superfluous if the holding were not applicable to convictions already final. <em>Id. </em>at 1485 (\u201cIt seems unlikely that our decision today will have a significant effect on those convictions already obtained as the result of plea bargains\u201d). See, e.g., United States vs. Hubenig, No. 6:03-mj-040 (E.D. Cal. July 1, 2010); <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramirez, </em>29 Misc. 3d 1201(A) (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2010). The Court pointed out that as a practical matter its ruling would not undermine the finality of large numbers of convictions that had already been obtained by plea bargains for several reasons. First, because for \u201cat least the past 15 years, professional norms have generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the deportation consequences of a client\u2019s plea.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1485.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Second, because in the then twenty-five years since <em>Strickland, </em>claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at the plea stage are far \u201cless frequently the subject of collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>challenges than convictions obtained after a trial,\u201d in large measure because the relief to be obtained, a new trial, \u201cimposes its own significant limiting principle\u201d \u2014 the loss of the benefit of the bargain obtained through the plea. <em>Padilla, supra. </em>Third, because to obtain relief under <em>Strickland, </em>the defendant must also meet the high bar of demonstrating prejudice resulting from counsel\u2019s below-standard performance, that is, \u201cthat a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In sum, the opinion in <em>Padilla </em>relies primarily on citation to <em>Strickland </em>itself; <em>Strickland </em>controls ineffective assistance claims by providing a broad rule of reasonableness grounded in professional norms and applied with regard to the factual circumstances of each case. See <em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 308-309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chaidez, </em>730 F. Supp. 2d 896, 901 (N.D. Ill. 2010). In asking the Court to rule that the affirmative misadvice that he received from his lawyer presented a case of ineffectiveness, the defendant in <em>Padilla </em>sought only an application of <em>Strickland </em>that several courts had already reached. See <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1493-1494 n.4 (Alito, J., concurring). Although the Court articulated its holding more broadly, in what Justice Alito believed was a \u201cdramatic departure from precedent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1488 (Alito, J., concurring), it simply held that, given the growing importance of immigration consequences of criminal convictions, reasonable attorneys following professional standards would not fail to advise their clients of these consequences and ultimately concluded that a failure to notify a defendant about immigration consequences clearly satisfies <em>Strickland's </em>test for ineffectiveness. See <em>id. </em>at 1484. Finally, the Court plainly contemplated collateral challenges to prior guilty pleas based on its ruling.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that the holding in <em>Padilla </em>is to be applied retroactively to criminal convictions obtained after the effective date of IIRIRA, April 1, 1997, the point at which deportation became \u201cintimately related to the criminal process\u201d and \u201cnearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen offenders.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1481. We now turn to whether the defendant has sufficiently proved ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The standard for ineffective assistance of counsel in Massachusetts was articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Strickland, </em>we have held that satisfying the <em>Saferian </em>standard necessarily satisfies <em>Strickland. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>394 Mass. 251, 256 n.3 (1985) (\u201cConsideration of the Massachusetts test of ineffective assistance of counsel . . . leads us to the conclusion that if the <em>Saferian </em>test is met, the Federal test is necessarily met as well\u201d). We must determine \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The defendant asserts that he was never told of the immigration consequences of his plea. He has presented an affidavit of his counsel at the plea hearing, stating that she was not aware that the defendant was not a United States citizen and had no memory of discussing immigration consequences with him. The Commonwealth argues that the defendant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show that he was not advised of the deportation consequences of his guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Under <em>Padilla, </em>\u201c[constitutionally competent] counsel must inform her client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1486. Central to the Court\u2019s decision was its reference to the professional standards of the legal community. <em>Id. </em>at 1482-1483. National and Massachusetts performance guidelines require criminal defense counsel to interview a defendant and gather significant personal information in order to represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>him. See National Legal Aid and Defender Ass\u2019n, Performance Guidelines for Criminal Representation \u00a7 2.2(b)(2) (1995); General Policies Applicable to all Assigned Counsel, CPCS Performance Standards Governing Representation of Indigents in Criminal Cases, \u00a7\u00a7 2.2, 4.1, 5.4(o) (rev. 2004). As the Court in <em>Padilla </em>recognized, national guidelines also \u201csupport]] the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1482, citing National Legal Aid and Defender Ass\u2019n, Performance Guidelines for Criminal Representation, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 6.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Here, as in <em>Padilla, </em>the consequences of the defendant\u2019s plea were clear. See <em>id. </em>at 1483. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2006 &amp; Supp. III 2009), \u201cAny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, . . . other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable.\u201d The defendant pleaded guilty to possession of a class B substance, to wit, crack cocaine, with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94A, \u00a7 32A, and possession of a class D substance, to wit, marijuana, with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C, either of which made him subject to deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). That the defendant\u2019s counsel failed to ascertain that the defendant was not a United States citizen may be sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Saferian </em>standard because effective representation requires counsel to gather at least enough personal information to represent him. As the Supreme Court in <em>Padilla </em>recognized, \u201c[i]t is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so \u2018clearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1484. If counsel was unaware of her Ghent\u2019s immigration status when she represented him and has no memory of discussing any immigration consequences of his plea, it is highly unlikely that she ever informed him that his guilty pleas carried a substantial risk of deportation. Considering existing professional norms, and the holding in <em>Padilla, </em>the defendant has made a sufficient showing that counsel\u2019s failure satisfies the first prong of <em>Saferian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>consequence of counsel\u2019s serious incompetency must be prejudicial. We have defined prejudice in such claims as \u201ca \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that \u2018but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahar, </em>442 Mass. 11, 15 (2004), quoting <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In the context of a guilty plea, in order to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d requirement, the defendant has the burden of establishing that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill, supra </em>at 59. See <em>Premo </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>131 S. Ct. 733, 743, 744 (2011). At a minimum, this means that the defendant must aver that to be the case. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 60.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In addition, he must \u201cconvince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1485. To prove the latter proposition, the defendant bears the substantial burden of showing that (1) he had an \u201cavailable, substantial ground of defence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra </em>at 96, that would have been pursued if he had been correctly advised of the dire immigration consequences attendant to accepting the plea bargain; (2) there is a reasonable probability that a different plea bargain (absent such consequences) could have been negotiated at the time<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>; or (3) the presence of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that support the conclusion that he placed, or would have placed, particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>emphasis on immigration consequences in deciding whether to plead guilty. <em>Hill, supra </em>at 60.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>Premo </em>v. <em>Moore, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The record in this case suggests that the driving factor in the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was the avoidance of the mandatory minimum jail (or prison) sentences that would have attached to the two school zone charges that were subsequently dismissed as part of the plea bargain. The evidence stacked against the defendant left little prospect of escaping those sentences, after which, of course, he would have faced the same deportation consequence that he faces now. Warnings of possible deportation given to him orally by the judge, and in a writing that he signed at the time of the plea, apparently gave him no pause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>In response, the defendant has not alleged in his affidavit that had he known the deportation consequences of his plea, he would have insisted on going to trial, stating only that he \u201cdid not understand at that time of the plea that I could be removed [from] this country for a conviction of intent to distribute the drugs.\u201d He also has failed to explain, let alone demonstrate, why, in view of all the considerations at issue at the time of his plea, it would have been rational to plead not guilty and proceed to trial. In his brief, the defendant simply states that his request to withdraw his plea after he received the notice to appear for removal \u201cmanifests such actual prejudice,\u201d and asks, \u201cShould the first prong be satisfied, the matter may be remanded to the trial court on the second prong . . . .\u201d We decline to do so where the defendant has come nowhere near meeting the burden he bears on the issue of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the foregoing reasons, although we hold that <em>Padilla </em>v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473 (2010), is to be retroactively applied to convictions obtained on or after April 1, 1997, the defendant here has failed to demonstrate that, but for his counsel\u2019s failure to advise him of the immigration consequences of his plea, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for a new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The defendant brought a motion to suppress this evidence in the Dorchester Division of the Boston Municipal Court.

A slight majority of these courts has concluded that <em>Padilla </em>is not a \u201cnew rule\u201d but merely an application of <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668 (1984) <em>(Strickland), </em>and thus applies retroactively on collateral review.

While some State appellate courts have chosen to deviate from <em>Teague, </em>see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>202 P.3d 1130, 1138-1140 (Alaska 2009), we have yet to consider whether we should accept the invitation of the Supreme Court and adopt a broader application of new constitutional rules. Because we conclude that <em>Padilla </em>is retroactive even under <em>Teague, </em>we need not consider the question today.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">There are two exceptions to the rule announced in <em>Teague. A </em>new constitutional rule will apply retroactively if it (1) places certain primary conduct outside of what can be prohibited by use of the criminal law; or (2) requires the observance of procedures \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>Teague, supra </em>at 310-311, quoting <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 667, 693 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). No court has found that either of the <em>Teague </em>exceptions is applicable to <em>Padilla. </em>The first exception does not apply because the decision concerns counsel\u2019s duty to inform a client about immigration consequences and does not place any conduct outside the realm of criminal behavior. See <em>Teague, supra </em>at 311.

Indeed, the Supreme Court in <em>Padilla </em>stated that including deportation consequences in the plea bargaining process, \u201cthe defense and prosecution may well be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1486. \u201cCounsel who possess the most rudimentary understanding of the deportation consequences of a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain creatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as by avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically triggers the removal consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No such showing, however, has been made in this case, and speculation alone on that subject is not sufficient. Even if the defendant had established that a plea of guilty to the lesser included offenses of possession of cocaine and marijuana (which are not aggravated felonies under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227[a][2][A][iii] [2006 &amp; Supp. III 2009]), would have been reasonably likely in the circumstances, he would have remained subject to deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2006 &amp; Supp. III 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">We are cognizant of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Washington where it concluded that, in light of the particular severity of the deportation consequences to someone who had earned permanent residency in this country and made it his home, it would be \u201crational\u201d for a defendant to \u201ctake his chances\u201d at trial even though the sentencing differential between the offense to which he pleaded guilty (rape in the third degree, with a range of imprisonment from six to twelve months) and the offense for which he would have stood trial (rape in the second degree with a range of imprisonment from seventy-eight to 102 months) was substantial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>171 Wash. 2d 163, 175, 176 (2011). Each case will, of course, stand on its own facts. In <em>Sandoval </em>(as in <em>Padilla), </em>the defendant had been incorrectly advised by his attorney regarding the immigration consequences of his guilty plea. The court, in concluding the defendant had established prejudice, gave heavy weight to the fact that the defendant had been \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the risk of deportation at the time he agreed to the plea, and entered the plea because he \u201ctrusted [his] attorney to know that he was telling the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The Commonwealth argues that the defendant has not demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>prejudice because the docket sheet shows that the deportation warning was given during the plea colloquy, and the tender of plea form (signed by the judge and the defendant) constitutes further evidence that the defendant was on notice of deportation as a possible consequence at the time he tendered his pleas. While the receipt of such warnings is not an adequate substitute for defense counsel\u2019s professional obligation to advise her client of the likelihood of specific and dire immigration consequences that might arise from such a plea, see <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1486 n.15 (\u201cthe plea form . . . used in Kentucky courts [also] provides notice of possible immigration consequences\u201d), we agree that it may be relevant to the prejudice prong of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Safe-rian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, supra </em>at 182 (Johnson, J., concurring) (\u201cwarnings are highly relevant to determining whether the client faced prejudice\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
