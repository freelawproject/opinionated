G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6. At the close of evidence, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty, which was denied. The defendant was found guilty, was sentenced to two years in a house of correction, with six months to serve followed by probation, and was required to register as a sex offender. He appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. He argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty because there was insufficient evidence to convict him, and that his statement to police was improperly admitted in evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>conclude that there was insufficient evidence of his intent to kidnap the boy, we reverse the judgment and set aside the verdict. Judgment shall enter for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><em>Facts. </em>We present the essential facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">On September 1, 2008, at approximately 1:30 p.m., the boy was walking along Dorchester Avenue in the Dorchester section of Boston, on his way to a pharmacy to pick up prescriptions for his mother. The boy testified that \u201ca man,\u201d later identified as the defendant, \u201cdrove right next to [him]\u201d and stopped his vehicle, a four-door sedan. The driver\u2019s window was open. Even though the boy could not recall the first thing the defendant said to him, he \u201cstepped back\u201d so that he was approximately three feet from the sedan, and \u201cheard someone say, \u2018Get into the car.\u2019 \u201d* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The boy \u201csaid \u2018no\u2019 and then walked away.\u201d He went \u201cstraight to the pharmacy,\u201d which was fifty yards away. The entire exchange took approximately \u201c[t]wo seconds,\u201d and the boy was not \u201cface-to-face close\u201d to the defendant. The defendant drove away. In response to the prosecutor\u2019s question whether the boy thought the defendant was following him, the boy stated, \u201cKind of, yeah.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">On cross-examination, in response to the question whether the defendant followed him, the boy stated that he did not notice anything because he did not look at the vehicle after he said \u201cno\u201d and walked away. The boy testified that the defendant was driving back \u201ctoward the street\u201d as he headed toward the pharmacy, and that the defendant did not pull his vehicle over a second time or speak to the boy again. The defendant never showed a weapon, got out of his vehicle, or threatened the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">A witness, who was in her vehicle parked across the street, saw the interaction between the boy and the defendant. She \u201cbelieve[d] the car was there for a few minutes\u201d after the interaction because she was able to note the registration plate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>After the defendant drove away, the witness saw the boy again, approached him, and asked what had happened.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The boy then went home. The witness telephoned the police and gave them a description of the vehicle and its registration plate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The police found the defendant a short time later; he was arrested. A police officer testified that, while the defendant was in a holding cell, he read the defendant his Miranda warnings but did not have the defendant sign a waiver form. The officer testified that the defendant was a little \u201ctipsy\u201d but he was able to understand fully what the defendant said to him. The officer asked the defendant some questions. Relevant here is the defendant\u2019s response to the officer that he had wanted the boy to go home with him where he planned to \u201clisten to music\u201d with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The defendant did not call any witnesses and did not testify. His defense was presented through cross-examination and argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>In reviewing the denial of a required finding of not guilty, we review the evidence introduced up to the time the Commonwealth rested its case to determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient for a reasonable jury to infer the existence of each essential element of the crime charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>370 Mass. 147, 150 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). No essential element of the crime may be left to a jury\u2019s conjecture, surmise, or guesswork. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>359 Mass. 77, 88 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">We begin by addressing the defendant\u2019s contention that his statements to police that he wanted to take the boy home to listen to music with him were improperly admitted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We need not address the issue because, as detailed below, even considering the defendant\u2019s statements, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>The crime of attempted kidnapping requires, in relevant part, the intent to \u201cforcibly or secretly\u201d confine or imprison another person \u201cagainst his will,\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26, and an overt act toward the commission of the crime, G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banfill, </em>413 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1992). A child of \u201ctender years\u201d is not able to give consent to be taken from a parent\u2019s custody. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>431 Mass. 188, 189-192 (2000) (defendant\u2019s taking willing twelve year old girl to out-of-State motel was against will of parents; girl\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d to kidnapping immaterial).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In the context of the kidnapping statute, the word \u201cconfine\u201d has been interpreted to mean \u201cany restraint of a person\u2019s movement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 241 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lent, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 705, 710 (1999). The parties have not cited, and we have not found, any discussion in our case law concerning the meaning of the phrase \u201csecretly confine.\u201d According to Professor LaFave, confinement is \u201csecret\u201d in nature \u201cwhen it serves to isolate or insulate the victim from meaningful contact or communication with the public, that is, when the confinement is in a place or in a manner which makes it unlikely that members of the public will know or learn of the victim\u2019s unwilling confinement within a reasonable period of time.\u201d 3 W.R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 18.1(c), at 17 (2d ed. 2003). This court indorsed this definition, albeit implicitly, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 215 (2000), where the defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and kidnapping. In that case, in addition to the use of force to confine the victim, the defendant prevented the victim from telephoning his mother and from meeting with visitors who came to the house where he was being held. <em>Id. </em>at 231. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the defendant confined the victim \u201cby force and in secret.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 238-239 (although part of victim\u2019s confinement was forcible, defendant used ruse to get her to follow him to isolated place).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The defendant argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove that he had the intent forcibly or secretly to confine the boy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banfill, supra </em>at 1003, this court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted kidnapping on similar facts. There, the defendant, who was driving a truck, stopped three to five feet from the complainant, a thirteen year old girl, and asked directions to a certain street. <em>Id. </em>at 1002. Because the defendant \u201clooked at [her] funny\u201d and was asking his question \u201cin a weird way,\u201d the girl lied, telling him that she was only visiting her grandmother and did not know where the street was. <em>Id. </em>Just as she was about to leave, he \u201ctold [her] to get in\u201d his truck. <em>Id. </em>The girl ran away. <em>Id. </em>The entire interaction lasted approximately twenty-five seconds, and \u201cthe defendant did not \u2018make a move toward\u2019 her in any way, . . . open the truck door or display a weapon, and he did not \u2018try to grab out\u2019 at her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1002-1003. The court held that the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed. <em>Id. </em>at 1003. Because the court found insufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent to kidnap the child, the court did not reach the issue whether the defendant\u2019s statement to \u201cget in\u201d his truck constituted an overt act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The Commonwealth argues that the <em>Banfill </em>case is distinguishable because here there was sufficient evidence that the defendant intended to \u201csecretly confine\u201d the boy, where the defendant followed the boy after the boy refused to get into the vehicle and admitted that he wanted the boy to come home with him to listen to music. Concerning whether the defendant followed the boy, the Commonwealth asserts that there was sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s criminal intent because he \u201ccommanded\u201d the boy to \u201cget into the car,\u201d and because the boy testified that he \u201c[k]ind of, yeah\u201d <em>thought </em>that the defendant followed him. Assuming, without deciding, that following a child in these circumstances would be sufficient evidence of an intent forcibly or secretly to confine a child, the testimony that the defendant \u201c[k]ind of, yeah\u201d followed the boy is equivocal as to whether the defendant actually followed him after their interaction. Moreover, the boy testified on cross-examination that he did not \u201cnotice anything\u201d about the defendant\u2019s vehicle because he did not look at it once he walked away. In addition, the eyewitness believed that the defendant\u2019s vehicle \u201cwas there for a few minutes\u201d after the defendant\u2019s interaction with the boy. She did not testify that the defendant subsequently followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>the boy before he drove away; rather, she testified that he drove away while the boy was in the pharmacy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eramo, </em>377 Mass. 912, 913 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Croft, </em>345 Mass. 143, 145 (1962) (\u201cWhen the evidence tends equally to sustain either of two inconsistent propositions, neither of them can be said to have been established by legitimate proof\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">We also are not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s statements that he \u201cwanted to take [the boy] home\u201d to \u201clisten to music\u201d are sufficient to support an inference of a specific intent to \u201cisolate or insulate the [boy] from meaningful contact or communication with the public.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 3 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra. </em>As discussed, there is no evidence that the defendant did anything but drive away after the boy refused to get into the vehicle.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Corson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>428 Mass. 193, 197 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mandile, </em>403 Mass. 93, 94 (1988) (evidence insufficient if it relies on conjecture and speculation).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-15\">The defendant also argues that the statute requiring him to register as a sex <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>offender violates his substantive due process rights. Because of our conclusion, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\">A detective, who had spoken to the boy and written a police report, testified on cross-examination that the boy told him that the defendant asked him where he was going and whether the boy \u201cwanted a ride.\u201d The detective did not recall that the boy said that the defendant said, \u201cGet into the car.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-9\">There was conflicting testimony whether the witness talked to the boy while he was in the pharmacy or after he came out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The defendant did not move to suppress his statements or object to the officer\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s implicit waiver of his Miranda rights. He did file several motions in limine, including a motion in limine for a \u201cvoir dire\u201d as to his statements, which is noted on the docket as \u201cfiled.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Although it is not dispositive, we note that police found the defendant sitting in his vehicle <em>outside </em>his home, listening to music. There is no evidence to support an inference that the defendant intended to prevent the boy from contact with the public if the two sat in his vehicle while listening to music. In addition, one of the police officers who went to talk to the defendant testified that the defendant\u2019s mother and \u201canother gentleman\u201d were at home at that time. There is no evidence to support an inference that the defendant believed that he would be alone in the home with the boy or that he could isolate him despite the presence of others. But see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 216-218 (2000) (victim forcibly and secretly confined even though family friend knew victim lived with defendant and was concerned about his well-being); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Titus, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 216, 221 (1992) (kidnap victim confined in vehicle). See also 3 W.R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 18.1(c), at 17 (2d ed. 2003) (confinement usually in vehicle or residence; can occur even if third party is present).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Because of our conclusion concerning the defendant\u2019s intent, we need not address whether the defendant\u2019s statement to \u201cget into the car\u201d constituted on overt act. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Banfill, </em>413 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Cordy, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AL5\">The defendant\u2019s conviction of attempted kidnapping must be affirmed if a reasonable jury could infer that he formed the intent to \u201cwithout lawful authority, forcibly or secretly confine[] or imprison[] another person within this commonwealth against his will,\u201d G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26; see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saylor, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 117, 121-122 (1989), and, having failed in the perpetration, took an overt act toward the commission of that crime. G. L. c. 274, \u00a7 6. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>455 Mass. 408, 412 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">A rational fact finder could have determined that the defendant ordered an eleven year old boy, with whom he was not acquainted, to get into his car, with the admitted intention of taking the boy to the defendant\u2019s home. Because this is sufficient evidence to infer that the defendant took an overt act to \u201csecretly confine\u201d the boy,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I would not have reversed his conviction. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">As a threshold matter, the defendant\u2019s order that the boy \u201cget into the car\u201d is plainly an overt act toward the commission of the crime of kidnapping. On the question of secret confinement, I agree with the court, <em>ante </em>at 142, that the statutory term \u201cconfinement\u201d \u201chas been broadly interpreted to mean any restraint of a person\u2019s movement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 237, 241 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lent, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 705, 710 (1999). An adult\u2019s asportation of a child, inside a moving car, plainly would have been a \u201crestraint\u201d of the child\u2019s \u201cmovement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The issue becomes whether the attempted act of the defendant bore sufficient indi-cia of secrecy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The court states, <em>ante </em>at 142, that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 215 (2000), we implicitly indorsed Professor LaFave\u2019s definition of the phrase \u201csecretly confine[]\u201d as confinement \u201cin a place or in a manner which makes it unlikely that members of the public will know or learn of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>unwilling confinement within a reasonable period of time.\u201d 3 W.R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 18.1(c), at 17 (2d ed. 2003). However, the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, supra, </em>does not cite to Professor LaFave\u2019s treatise. Nor does it discuss, as a factor bearing on the culpability of a defendant, the likelihood that \u201cmembers of the public will know or learn\u201d of the confinement. In the <em>Perry </em>case, there was evidence that the victim was often bound, gagged, and physically abused over a period of months in the defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, ultimately leading to the victim\u2019s death. The court concluded that the evidence against the defendant on the charge of kidnapping (either by forcible or secret confinement) was sufficient on theories of both joint and individual liability where the defendant knew the victim was bound and gagged, participated in some of the acts of abuse, and would stand blocking the entry to the stairs leading to the room where the victim was held when certain visitors came to the house. <em>Id. </em>at 231. I do not read that case, or any other case we have decided, to support the proposition that we have adopted Professor LaFave\u2019s precise definition of secret confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It seems to me that the evidence here was sufficient for a rational juror to conclude that the defendant attempted secretly to confine the boy. The defendant, without ascribing legal significance to the word, attempted what in everyday usage would be called an \u201cabduction\u201d of the boy. That is, by his own admission, the defendant intended first to confine the boy inside his car and then in a private home without legal authority. If successful, the defendant would have accomplished this without the knowledge of the boy\u2019s parents or legal guardians and, had a vigilant witness not recorded the defendant\u2019s registration plate number, without leaving any independent information that authorities could use to ascertain the missing boy\u2019s whereabouts. This is sufficiently \u201csecret\u201d as the term must be understood by its ordinary usage. See <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 720 (2002), quoting <em>Champagne </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>429 Mass. 324, 326 (1999) (general and familiar rule is that statute must be interpreted \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Even still, under Professor LaFave\u2019s definition, a rational jury could conclude that the defendant intended to confine the boy in a manner rendering it \u201cunlikely that members of the public [would] know or learn of the victim\u2019s unwilling confinement within a reasonable period of time.\u201d 3 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra. </em>The evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant planned to take the boy inside a car, drive him to an unknown residence, and, at the very least, hold him for an indefinite amount of time, all without informing anyone who could assiduously assure that the boy was safe. This would afford an ample and \u201creasonable period of time\u201d for the boy\u2019s parents to become struck with panic or, worse yet, for the boy to be harmed, before any appropriate members of the public could meaningfully learn of the confinement in time to come to his aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The court states that the police found the defendant outside his home listening to music, and that the defendant\u2019s mother was inside the home, as support for its conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to support an inference that the defendant intended to \u201cisolate or insulate the [boy] from meaningful contact or communication with the public.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 144 &amp; n.5, quoting 3 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra. </em>This view of sufficiency could be read to suggest that a putative kidnapper who confines a child against his will, inside a car or private home, might escape liability if the car is not completely removed from public view or if there is another person in close enough proximity that the child could theoretically communicate his or her discontent with the confinement. Such a reading would be contrary to our law. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, supra </em>at 216-218 (victim forcibly and secretly confined even though family acquaintance and others were aware that he was staying at defendant\u2019s home and being systematically abused there).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">In this case, when ordered into the car, the boy had the presence of mind to continue on to the pharmacy to pick up his mother\u2019s prescriptions. Had he not been so alert, and had he entered the confines of the defendant\u2019s car, I fail to see how this would not be a clear-cut case of kidnapping. In falling short, it constituted an attempted kidnapping. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The court is correct to point out, <em>ante </em>at 142, that the eleven year old boy is a child of \u201ctender years\u201d and is per se held \u201cagainst his will\u201d if he is held without the consent of his parents or legal guardian. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>431 Mass. 188, 191 (2000). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>5 Allen 518, 526 (1863); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moyles, </em>45 Mass. App. Ct. 350, 354 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The Commonwealth did not argue that the defendant\u2019s command, \u201cGet into the car,\u201d was sufficient to show an intent forcibly to confine the boy.
