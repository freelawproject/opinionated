The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether a motion filed by PCG for admission of an attorney pro hac vice was properly denied by a judge in the Superior Court. We conclude that PCG\u2019s motion should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>1. <em>Background. </em>The following facts are taken from the allegations of PCG\u2019s amended complaint pending in the Superior Court. Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s representation of PCG in Massachusetts arose in connection with two lawsuits that originated in California. In 2002 and in 2005, respectively, Ellen Costigan obtained two judgments against the company Converge, LLC, and its parent, Converge, Inc. (collectively Converge), in California<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; Seyfarth Shaw represented Converge in connection with both cases. Costigan had been an employee of Converge,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the first action was one for unpaid wages, brought before the California Labor Commission (commission) in 2001. The commission awarded Costigan approximately $130,000 in unpaid wages, interest, and penalties. Seyfarth Shaw, on behalf of Converge, unsuccessfully appealed the award to the California Superior Court, and on November 2, 2002, the court entered judgment against Converge on the commission\u2019s award. At some point in this time period, Converge relocated to Massachusetts, and on November 29, 2002, Costigan commenced an action against Converge in the Superior Court for Essex County seeking to enforce the unpaid wages judgment (Essex County action).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">In March of 2003, PCG purchased substantially all of Converge\u2019s assets. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, Converge remained responsible for Costigan\u2019s two claims against Converge, and agreed to indemnify PCG for any losses arising out of them. Seyfarth Shaw at the time continued to represent Converge in connection with Costigan\u2019s claims, but also took on PCG as a client for various matters. However, Seyfarth Shaw did not disclose to PCG any actual or potential conflicts of interest relating to its representation of both Converge and PCG.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">On May 16,2003, less than two months after the asset purchase of Converge by PCG, Seyfarth Shaw filed an unsealed motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to withdraw as counsel for Converge in the Essex County action. In the motion, Seyfarth Shaw stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-5\">\u201cSeyfarth Shaw is informed, and therefore believes, that [Converge]: (i) is no longer in business; (ii) no longer has any employees, other than several directors and officers outside of Massachusetts, or any facilities; (iii) has no tangible or intangible assets in Massachusetts; and (iv) cannot pay Seyfarth Shaw for additional services. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cSeyfarth Shaw\u2019s withdrawal will not result in a material adverse effect on [Converge], Even assuming, arguendo, that [Costigan\u2019s] Motion for Summary Judgment is allowed, that ruling will have no effect on [Converge]. [Costigan\u2019s] action is solely to enforce a judgment of a foreign jurisdiction. [Converge] has no assets in Massachusetts. Therefore, [Costigan] will be unable to enforce in Massachusetts the judgment [she] obtains, if any, against [Converge] in this action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s motion to withdraw was allowed, and Converge thereafter was defaulted. In December, 2003, judgment entered in the Essex County action against Converge in the amount of $143,840.67. Converge did not pay the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In March of 2002, Costigan filed an action against Converge alleging sex discrimination and wrongful discharge in the California Superior Court. Seyfarth Shaw, representing Converge, removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. Later, and over Converge\u2019s objection, Seyfarth Shaw withdrew from representing Converge. Converge defaulted in the action as a result of Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s withdrawal, and a default judgment of more than $3 million entered against Converge in November, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">On July 25, 2006, Costigan commenced an action in the Superior Court for Norfolk County (Norfolk County action) against PCG and Converge, seeking to enforce against both companies the 2005 California default judgment and to enforce against PCG only the 2002 unpaid wages judgment. Seyfarth Shaw represented PCG in this action; Converge did not appear. In July, 2007, following a bench trial, a Superior Court judge found that the 2003 asset purchase of Converge by PCG was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>de facto merger of the two companies as well as a fraudulent transfer, thereby rendering PCG liable for both of Costigan\u2019s California judgments against Converge. Soon thereafter, judgment in the Norfolk County action entered against PCG in the amount of $3,323,802 plus interest. In December, 2007, PCG, represented by new counsel, entered into a settlement agreement with Costigan, and PCG\u2019s appeal from the Norfolk County judgment was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">PCG filed the present action against Seyfarth Shaw in the Superior Court for Suffolk County in July of 2009. The amended complaint includes claims for legal malpractice, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of G. L. c. 93A, based in substantial part on Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s alleged conflict of interest arising from its dual representation of Converge and PCG in connection with the Costigan claims, and failure to advise PCG of that conflict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On or about October 2, 2009, PCG served on Seyfarth Shaw a motion to admit both William A. Brewer, III, and Robert L. Gamer pro hac vice as PCG\u2019s trial counsel. Gamer is a senior counsel in the New York City office of the Dallas-based law firm of Bickel &amp; Brewer, and Brewer is a partner in the same firm. Garner is a member in good standing of the State bars of New York and New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">Although Seyfarth Shaw initially assented to PCG\u2019s motion, PCG never filed it with the court. Instead, on October 29, PCG filed a motion to admit only Gamer pro hac vice. Also on October 29, an article appeared in an Internet issue of the National Law Journal entitled, \u201cFormer client sues Seyfarth Shaw, claiming malpractice, conflict of interest.\u201d The article summarized many of the allegations of PCG\u2019s complaint, and in particular, included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cAccording to the lawsuit, Seyfarth\u2019s mistakes include filing an unsealed motion to withdraw from representing Converge in Essex County Superior Court when Costigan filed suit there to enforce the California wage judgment. PCG argues that Seyfarth\u2019s description of Converge as an insolvent, virtually nonexistent company \u2018would provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ammunition for Costigan to assert a successor liability claim.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">\u201cPCG\u2019s lawyer, Bill Brewer of Dallas-based Bickel &amp; Brewer, said PCG\u2019s deal with Converge was structured as an asset purchase not a merger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201c <em>\u2018The difficulty is that Seyfarth [filed court] papers in an attempt to relieve itself of its responsibility to another client of theirs, Converge, that not only misstated the facts, but stated the facts in a way that supported their [</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em>] notion of [PCG\u2019s] successor </em>liability.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">\u201cTaking this position when withdrawing from the Converge case jeopardized Seyfarth\u2019s fiduciary responsibility to PCG, he said.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">In response to this article, Seyfarth Shaw withdrew its assent to PCG\u2019s motion to admit Garner pro hac vice, and filed an opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">A Superior Court judge (motion judge) held a hearing on the motion on November 19, 2009. Seyfarth Shaw argued primarily that Brewer\u2019s comment quoted in the article violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.6, 426 Mass. 1392 (1998), and served as a ground to deny the motion to admit Garner pro hac vice. The motion judge denied PCG\u2019s request for Gamer\u2019s pro hac vice admission. PCG appealed from the denial to the Appeals Court, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>\u201c[A] member of the bar, in good standing, of any other state may appear, by permission of the court, as attorney or counselor, in any case pending therein, if such other state grants like privileges to members of the bar, in good standing, of this commonwealth.\u201d G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 46A, inserted by St. 1935, c. 346, \u00a7 2. However, as this court has stated, \u201cper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>mission of the judicial department is not merely important but is essential to the right to appear as an attorney under G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 46A,\u201d <em>DiLuzio </em>v. <em>United Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers, Local 274, </em>391 Mass. 211, 215 (1984) <em>(DiLuzio), </em>and \u201cthe degree of discretion accorded a judge in deciding whether to admit an out-of-State attorney is broad.\u201d <em>Merles </em>v. <em>Lemer, </em>391 Mass. 221, 223 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The motion judge denied PCG\u2019s motion \u201csubstantially for the reasons set forth in [Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s] opposition.\u201d We turn, therefore, to the two reasons Seyfarth Shaw presented in its written opposition to PCG\u2019s motion to admit Garner pro hac vice; these are the same principal grounds the firm advances on appeal. First, Seyfarth Shaw stated, and argues here, that PCG is adequately represented by local counsel, an element judges consider in exercising their broad discretion to decide whether to allow an attorney to appear pro hac vice. Second, and the primary reason asserted below and on appeal, Seyfarth Shaw claims that Brewer\u2019s comment to the National Law Journal violated Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.6, 426 Mass. 1392 (1998).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We consider the second reason first.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">a. <em>Violation of rule 3.6. </em>Rule 3.6 (a) precludes a lawyer who is involved in the litigation of a case from making an out-of-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>statement \u201cthat a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter.\u201d However, rule 3.6 (b) \u201cidentifies specific matters about which a lawyer\u2019s statements would not ordinarily be considered to present a substantial likelihood of material prejudice, and should not in any event be considered prohibited by the general prohibition of paragraph (a).\u201d Comment [4] to rule 3.6. See <em>Matter of Cobb, </em>445 Mass. 452, 475 n.7 (2005) (\u201cRule 3.6 .. . concerning trial publicity, contains a safe harbor provision for certain extrajudicial statements\u201d). See also Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, \u00a7 109 (c), at 162-163 (2000) (same, discussing earlier version of rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Seyfarth Shaw focuses on Brewer\u2019s statement that Seyfarth Shaw \u201cmisstated the facts,\u201d and argues that Brewer, in using this phrase, was charging Seyfarth Shaw with lying in court papers, or, as Seyfarth Shaw puts it, using words \u201cwhich describe Seyfarth as a law firm that, in its own self-interest, intentionally filed false submissions to courts.\u201d As such, the argument goes, Brewer was impugning Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s \u201ccharacter, credibility, and reputation,\u201d thereby placing the comment within the class of subjects \u201cwhich are more likely than not to have a material prejudicial effect on a proceeding,\u201d Comment [5] to rule 3.6, and thus covered by the proscription set forth in rule 3.6 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">We think Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s characterization of Brewer\u2019s statement exaggerates the level of the statement\u2019s negative impact, but in any event, Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s argument fails. Rule 3.6, adopted in the Commonwealth in 1997, replaced the more restrictive S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 7-107 (G), as appearing in 382 Mass. 788 (1981).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rule 3.6 follows in substance the corresponding American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Professional Conduct, as amended in 1994.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the sources cited previously indicate, rule 3.6 (a) delineates prohibited conduct, while rule 3.6 (b) sets out exceptions, providing safe harbor for certain categories of statements that do not violate the prohibition in rule 3.6 (a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under rule 3.6 (b), \u201ca lawyer may state: (1) the claim, offense, or defense involved, and, except when prohibited by law, the identity of the persons involved; [and] (2) the information contained in a public record.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u201c(6) a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved, when there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest; . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>A review of the record establishes that Brewer\u2019s remark quoted in the National Law Journal falls well within these two exceptions. Brewer\u2019s statement that Seyfarth Shaw, \u201cin an attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>relieve itself of its responsibility to . . . Converge,\u201d filed court papers \u201cthat not only misstated the facts, but stated the facts in a way\u201d that supported Costigan\u2019s notion of PCG\u2019s successor liability in large measure tracks directly the allegations of PCG\u2019s complaint. PCG alleges the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">\u201c3. Defendants, at various times, defended both Converge and PCG Trading against Costigan\u2019s claims \u2014 at times blurring the line regarding which client they were representing. <em>... In fact, in attempting to rid themselves of Converge in order to continue representing PCG Trading, defendants filed an unsealed document in the Essex County Superior Court, which contained statements that were later relied upon as evidence by the Norfolk County Superior Court in holding PCG Trading liable for the prior judgments against Converge. </em>Defendant did not disclose to PCG Trading their prior statements that were adverse to the interests of PCG Trading. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201c25. Nevertheless, defendants filed their withdrawal motion without regard to its potential negative impact on PCG Trading. . . . Defendants were well aware that Converge, Inc. had <em>insufficient </em>assets to pay [Costigan\u2019s] Wage Judgment.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] <em>They also knew that, because PCG Trading had purchased substantially all of Converge, Inc. </em>\u2019s <em>assets, their description of Converge as an insolvent, virtually nonexistent company would (and later did) provide ammunition for Costigan to assert a successor liability claim against PCG </em>Trading.\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">As the quoted allegations show, Brewer, in words generally identical to those used in the complaint, summarized in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>comment a primary \u201cclaim\u201d (Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.6 [b] [1]) of PCG against Seyfarth Shaw. The substance of the claim is that in filing the motion to withdraw in the Essex County action, the law firm, in a breach of its fiduciary duty to PCG, supplied an important ground for Costigan\u2019s subsequent argument that PCG was responsible for the judgments against Converge on a theory of successor liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">To the extent the complaint itself does not allege that Sey-farth Shaw\u2019s motion to withdraw \u201cmisstated\u201d facts, the public court filings in the Norfolk County action do reflect the misstatement to which Brewer referred. Those court filings are matters of \u201cpublic record.\u201d Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.6 (b) (2). They reveal that a cornerstone of the defense advanced by Seyfarth Shaw on PCG\u2019s behalf in the Norfolk County action was that Converge was not the insolvent shell with no assets that Sey-farth Shaw had described in its Essex County motion to withdraw. Instead, Seyfarth Shaw argued that Converge was a viable corporation with stock holdings worth $6 to $10 million, as well as contract rights and other assets. Placing the conflicting representations in Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s Essex County and Norfolk County court filings side by side makes clear that Brewer\u2019s statement that Seyfarth Shaw had \u201c[filed court] papers\u201d (the Essex County withdrawal motion) that \u201cmisstated the facts\u201d finds support in the public record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that no violation of rule 3.6 has been shown.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">It is true that courts have upheld denials of pro hac vice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>admissions when based on a finding of unethical conduct by the lawyer in question. See, e.g., <em>Panzardi-Alvarez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>879 F.2d 975, 981 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1082 (1990), and cases cited (judge did not abuse discretion in denying lawyer\u2019s pro hac vice admission given evidence of ethical violations in criminal matter). It is not, however, a proper exercise of discretion to base a denial on a claimed violation of a rule of professional conduct when, in fact, no violation has occurred. See, e.g., <em>Obert </em>v. <em>Republican W. Ins. Co., </em>398 F.3d 138, 143, 147 (1st Cir. 2005) (striking revocation of lawyers\u2019 pro hac vice status based in part on violation of local ethical rules, where record did not support such violation). The motion judge erred insofar as she based her denial of the pro hac vice motion on an alleged violation of rule 3.6 by Brewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">b. <em>Other grounds for denial of pro hac vice admission. </em>As an additional or alternate justification for denying Gamer\u2019s pro hac vice admission, Seyfarth Shaw contends that PCG is adequately represented by local counsel. Although our cases indicate this is a relevant consideration, we have never concluded that this reason alone would be sufficient to support the denial of a motion for admission pro hac vice; rather, it is but one factor to be considered. See <em>Merles </em>v. <em>Lemer, </em>391 Mass. at 224 (\u201cCompetency of existing counsel is a relevant factor in adjudging pro hac vice motions . . . as an element shaping the judge\u2019s discretion in civil cases\u201d); <em>DiLuzio, </em>391 Mass. at 216 (\u201cThis element</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of adequate representation by existing counsel, when combined with the already extended procedural history of this case, may have reasonably prompted the judge to deny the motion\u201d). Accordingly, the rationale for denial of Gamer\u2019s motion under mle 3.6 having failed, the existence of adequate local representation cannot constitute, by itself, an independent ground to uphold the denial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The order denying the motion to admit Robert L. Gamer pro hac vice is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The amended complaint of PCG Trading, LLC (PCG), contains a number of allegations, some contradictory, concerning which party or parties \u2014 Converge, Inc., or Converge, LLC, or both \u2014 the California judgments were against.

Comment [3] to rule 3.6 states: \u201cThe Rule sets forth a basic general prohibition against a lawyer\u2019s making statements that the lawyer knows or should know will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.\u201d Comment [4], in turn, states: \u201cParagraph (b) identifies specific matters about which a lawyer\u2019s statements would not ordinarily be considered to present a substantial likelihood of material prejudice, <em>and should not in any event be considered prohibited by the general prohibition of paragraph (a). </em>Paragraph (b) is not intended to be an exhaustive listing of the subjects upon which a lawyer may make a statement, but statements on other matters may be subject to paragraph (a)\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">PCG may have intended to allege that Seyfarth Shaw was \u201cwell aware that Converge, Inc. had <em>sufficient </em>assets.\u201d We raise the point because \u201csufficient assets\u201d seems more consistent with the position PCG takes in its brief on appeal, as well as the position that Seyfarth Shaw itself took while defending PCG in the Norfolk County action in 2007 \u2014 namely, that Converge <em>did </em>have more than sufficient assets at the time Seyfarth Shaw filed its motion to withdraw. Neither party has mentioned the quoted allegation from the complaint on appeal. Even assuming no typographical error, for the reasons discussed <em>infra </em>in the text, we conclude that the complaint and the papers filed in the Norfolk County action, taken together, furnish Brewer \u2014 and by extension, Gamer \u2014 a safe harbor within the meaning of Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.6 (b) (1) and (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Seyfarth Shaw contends that Brewer\u2019s comment about misstating the facts is actually not supported in the complaint or any public record, because all Seyfarth Shaw stated in the Essex County motion to withdraw was that Converge had \u201cno tangible or intangible assets <em>in </em>Massachusetts,\u201d and there is no court paper or other public record indicating that this Massachusetts-focused point was a misstatement. The argument puts form over substance. As stated here in the text, the position argued by Seyfarth Shaw on behalf of PCG in the Norfolk County action was that Converge had valuable stock shares that would be available to satisfy Costigan\u2019s judgments. Given the nature of these claimed assets, whether they were physically located in Massachusetts seems beside the point. The judge who tried the Norfolk County action concluded the stock in question was not available essentially because it had no external market value, and never discussed its physical location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b300-8\">In light of our determination that Brewer\u2019s statement did not put him in violation of rule 3.6, there is no basis on which to find Gamer in derivative violation. PCG argues that even if Brewer\u2019s statement were to contravene the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>rule, Gamer could not be held to account for the statement in light of the fact that Gamer alone, and not Brewer, is seeking admission pro hac vice. We disagree. Brewer and Gamer are associated with the same firm, and the record indicates both have participated in this litigation. Even if Gamer is the only attorney from the firm who files an appearance in the case, Brewer is prohibited from making a statement that, if made by Gamer, would be in violation of rule 3.6 (a). See Mass. R. Prof. C. 3.6 (d), 426 Mass. 1392 (1998) (\u201cNo lawyer associated in a firm or government agency with a lawyer subject to paragraph [a] shall make a statement prohibited by paragraph [a]\u201d). See 2 G.C. Hazard &amp; W.W. Hodes, The Law of Lawyering \u00a7 32.8 (3d ed. Supp. 2011) (\u201cModel Rule 3.6 [d] is a slightly redundant reminder that lawyers may not evade their responsibilities under Rule 3.6 [a] by using a surrogate spokesperson from the same law firm or governmental agency\u201d). It would seem to follow that a judge permissibly could exercise her discretion to deny a motion to admit an attorney pro hac vice based on conduct by another attorney in the firm that contravened rule 3.6 (a). In this case, however, the issue is not presented because Brewer\u2019s conduct was not in violation of rule 3.6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">PCG also argues it will be prejudiced by the loss of its trial counsel of choice. It appears the motion judge did not consider this point. As a general matter, the prejudice that could result from the denial of pro hac vice admission for a party\u2019s counsel of choice is a relevant factor for the judge to consider in ruling on a motion for admission pro hac vice.
