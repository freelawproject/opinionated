The defendant argues that he is entitled to reversal of the convictions and a new trial on the grounds that the court room was improperly closed during individual voir dire of prospective jurors; the judge, outside the presence of the defendant, improperly questioned jurors and discussed questions from the jury; he was improperly denied a posttrial evidentiary hearing on the possible bias of two deliberating jurors; the trial judge committed evidentiary errors; the judge\u2019s instructions on malice, voluntary manslaughter, and self-defense were in error; and his trial counsel was ineffective in many respects. We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and the denial of his motion for a new trial, and we decline to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. We recite the facts as the jury could have found them at trial, reserving other facts for later discussion. The events giving rise to the indictments took place on June 28, 1991, in the apartment of Carol Drew (Carol)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Fall River. The defendant was the long-time boy friend of Carol\u2019s daughter, Janice Drew (Janice). As of June, 1991, Janice and the defendant had lived together for approximately eight years and they had a four year old daughter together, but around June 9, Janice left the defendant in Maine, taking their daughter with her. She and the child came to the Fall River area, and by June 28, they were living in a homeless shelter in neighboring New Bedford. The defendant was desperate to find Janice and their daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Early in the morning of June 28, following a telephone call from the defendant, Carol told her son George Eldridge (George), who was staying with her, that the defendant was coming to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>apartment. The defendant arrived and said he had some important information for Roy Drew (Roy), another son of Carol. Following a brief conversation, the defendant left, with plans to return thereafter to speak with Roy. Later that morning, the defendant returned at the same time as Roy; the defendant told Carol, George, and Roy that he had compromising videotapes of Janice, and that he had shown them to the police. Roy left to get Janice, leaving the defendant with George for several hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">That afternoon, Carol, Roy, Janice, and the child rejoined George and the defendant in Carol\u2019s apartment. Carol, Roy, Janice, George, and the defendant engaged in a tense discussion around the kitchen table regarding the defendant\u2019s desire to have Janice and the child return to live with him; Janice\u2019s refusal to do so; the Drew family\u2019s demands for financial support from the defendant; and the defendant\u2019s claim that his videotapes of Janice were damaging to her. Some time into the conversation, the defendant went to his car and retrieved a brown satchel and one videotape. He played a portion of it for Roy, George, and Janice; it showed Janice engaged in sexual acts. When the Drews denied the videotape was damaging, the defendant returned to his car and came back with a small blue suitcase, containing additional videotapes. He played the second videotape depicting Janice in sexual acts, and Roy, George, and Janice grew more upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The conversation resumed in the kitchen. Janice said she wanted $7,000 from the defendant to move with the child and her brothers out of State, and resettle where he could not find them. The defendant claimed to have a videotape of Janice with two men. When Janice, visibly upset, claimed she had been raped by the two men, the defendant acknowledged setting up the rape in order to record it. He then said that he would give George the money Janice wanted, and that he intended to kill himself. Janice watched the defendant walk to the brown satchel, open it, and pull out a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">George had been standing near the kitchen table with his head down, and when he looked up, he saw the defendant standing near the apartment door with a gun in his hand. Roy was next to the defendant. Roy stepped forward and told the defendant to give him the gun. The defendant took a step toward Roy, the gun fired, and Roy fell to the floor. George, standing on the other side <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>of the table next to Janice, pulled her to the floor, and another shot was fired. George then stood up and lifted up one of the kitchen chairs, holding it in front of himself; the defendant shot George in the left hand. After George fell to the floor, the defendant kicked him and shot him in the shoulder. The defendant then went into the bedroom where Carol was holding the child. He pointed the gun at Carol, but it did not fire. Janice ran into the bedroom after the defendant and began hitting him on the back with her hands; the defendant turned, put the gun to her head, and \u201cclicked it,\u201d but the gun again did not fire. The defendant hit Janice on the head with the gun, and she fell to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The defendant left the apartment. Carol yelled for someone to contact the police, and a neighbor did. The police arrived almost immediately. George survived his two gunshot wounds, but Roy died as a result of a gunshot wound to the chest. The police discovered the defendant\u2019s car parked near the apartment, and in it found many of the defendant\u2019s belongings, including at least four identification cards showing the defendant\u2019s photograph and a variety of names, none of them the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">b. The defendant testified at trial. He explained that he set up the videotape surveillance of Janice because he suspected she was an unfit parent, but that in early June, 1991, when Janice discovered that he had recorded her, she left him in Maine and took the child. The defendant further explained that the focus of all his activities was to find Janice and the child and to seek a resolution of the issues between him and Janice so that he could be with the child. He arrived at Carol\u2019s apartment early in the morning of June 28, and sometime later, Roy arrived. He and Roy then left the apartment and went to the defendant\u2019s car, where he showed Roy the videotapes he had brought as well as a gun. Roy proposed that they sell the gun, and when that turned out not to be immediately possible, Roy took possession of the gun. Roy and the defendant eventually returned to Carol\u2019s apartment, and at some later point, Roy left to get Janice and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">According to the defendant, in the conversation after Roy and Janice returned, Janice and her brothers insisted that Janice would be moving out of State with the child, and they demanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>money \u2014 at least $8,500 \u2014 from him. He denied responsibility for setting up or videotaping a rape of Janice, but once he retrieved and played the two videotapes, \u201ceveryone was screaming at [him].\u201d He tried to leave the apartment, but George blocked his exit. Roy was on the defendant\u2019s other side, and the defendant turned so that he was backed up against the wall. Roy was saying the defendant would never have visitation rights to see his daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">At this point, his daughter ran across the room, screaming for the defendant to help her. George was repeatedly demanding the money that the defendant had indicated he would provide for Janice. When the defendant reached into the brown satchel to get the money, Roy hit the defendant low in the stomach with the gun, which had been in Roy\u2019s possession since the morning, causing the defendant to bend over. Roy had both hands on the gun. The defendant, still holding the blue suitcase in one hand, with his other hand \u201cgrabbed\u201d the gun and Roy\u2019s hand and twisted them. George grabbed the defendant\u2019s arm in a grip the defendant could not break, and the defendant struggled with Roy, who was \u201csmashing\u201d him against the wall. When the defendant\u2019s arm was pulled, the gun went off, and Roy fell to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">George then hit the defendant with a chair, and the defendant picked up the gun from where it had fallen on Roy\u2019s prone body. The defendant shot at the chair twice to scare George. George tried to push the defendant down the stairs, and the defendant pulled the trigger of the gun again, this time hitting George. Thereafter, the defendant briefly picked up his daughter, who was standing by herself in the bedroom. Carol then pushed him, and when he turned around to leave the bedroom, Janice grabbed him. The defendant could not get away, and \u201cmight have hit [Janice] on the top of the shoulder maybe twice.\u201d At that point, the defendant put the gun on the table, briefly went over to George and saw that George was breathing. The defendant then turned to see about Roy, but Carol yelled repeatedly that she was going to kill the defendant, so he left the apartment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The defendant\u2019s trial was held in the summer of 1994. At its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>conclusion, as stated, the jury, inter alia, found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree of Roy, and of armed assault with intent to kill George,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but not guilty of assault with intent to murder Carol or Janice. While the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending in this court, he filed a motion for a new trial that was heard by a Superior Court judge (motion judge) other than the trial judge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After a nonevidentiary hearing, the motion judge denied the new trial motion in a comprehensive written decision. The defendant timely appealed, and his consolidated appeal from his convictions and from the denial of his motion for a new trial is now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">2. <em>Jury claims. </em>The defendant raises several claims related to the selection of the jury, and to communications between the judge and members of the jury. We consider these claims sequentially.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">a. <em>Public trial rights during individual voir dire. </em>The defendant argues his right to a public trial guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution was violated when jurors were questioned individually by the trial judge in her lobby, from which the public was excluded. The record shows prospective jurors were questioned by the trial judge one at a time in the presence of the defendant, counsel for both sides, the court reporter, and the court clerk. The trial took place during the summer and the court room was warm. The judge explained to the defendant the reason for the move as follows: \u201cWe have chosen to have it in chambers with as comfortable a proceeding as possible as opposed to the courtroom. I know the air conditioning isn\u2019t everything we would like it to be. . . . Considering the building, this is the best we can do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">The defendant argues that conducting individual voir dire in the trial judge\u2019s lobby constituted at least a partial closure of the court room, and that the judge made no findings that would justify such a closure. He claims never to have waived his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>rights to a public trial, and that his counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the partial closure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commonwealth counters that defense counsel validly consented on the defendant\u2019s behalf to individual voir dire in the judge\u2019s lobby, and that the defendant\u2019s claim of a Sixth Amendment violation was waived when he failed to preserve the issue through objection after the closure had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The closing of a proceeding to the public may implicate rights guaranteed by the First and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 106 (2010). The public trial right applies to jury selection proceedings. <em>Id.., </em>citing <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>130 S. Ct. 721, 723-724 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>434 Mass. 823, 831-832 (2001). A violation of the right to a public trial \u201cis a structural error and not susceptible to harmless error analysis.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), supra </em>at 105, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baran, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 296 (2009). However, the court considers \u201cwhether the defendant raised this issue in a timely manner because \u2018the right to a public trial, like other structural rights, can be waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), supra </em>at 105-106, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edward, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 162, 173 (2009).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unlike waiver of the right to counsel, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Means, </em>454 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>81, 89-90 (2009), this court has not required that waiver of public trial rights be memorialized in a colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The defendant had a right to individual voir dire in open court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>434 Mass. at 831. See <em>Presley </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>130 S. Ct. at 724 (accused has \u201ca right to insist that the voir dire of the jurors be public,\u201d absent overriding interest to contrary). The record does not suggest the requirements were met for a partial closure of the court, i.e., a substantial reason for closure; closure no broader than necessary to protect the interest likely to be prejudiced; consideration of reasonable alternatives; and adequate judicial findings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>459 Mass. 271, 282 (2011), citing <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 48 (1984). However, the defendant waived his rights by consenting to the proceedings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He was present throughout voir dire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>and, in light of his complaints of discomfort, on balance was helped more than harmed by the setting. The defendant points to no factors suggesting, notwithstanding the waiver, that a substantial likelihood a miscarriage of justice occurred. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, supra </em>at 832-833. We therefore decline to order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">b. <em>Questioning of jurors during trial. </em>In his motion for a new trial, and again on appeal, the defendant argues that he was excluded from certain portions of the trial in violation of his rights to confrontation and due process guaranteed by art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The background to the defendant\u2019s claim follows. At the beginning of the fourth day of trial, the judge spoke to a juror (Juror A) who was a cook at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Framingham (MCI-Framingham).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Juror A said that when he heard the prosecutor say Janice had been prosecuted, he \u201cwonder[edj\u201d whether he would know her.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge instructed Juror A not to discuss the matter with other jurors and not to consider where Janice served her sentence as relevant to the case. The judge then spoke with another juror (Juror B), who explained that she had unanticipated child care problems. Neither defense counsel nor the prosecutor was a party to the judge\u2019s separate conversations with Juror A and Juror B, but the judge immediately related the contents of the conversations to both counsel.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge proposed that Juror B, but not Juror A, be excused; defense counsel agreed and agreed to proceed with fifteen jurors. The judge then excused Juror B.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Subsequently, on the eighth day of trial, the judge again spoke with Juror A, at sidebar.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Juror A stated he did recognize Janice from MCI-Framingham, but that he had never had a conversation with her. He agreed that the prior contact with Janice had no effect on his ability to be fair and impartial, and no bearing on the case. Immediately thereafter (and with counsel still present), the judge questioned another juror (Juror C) about whether the juror had given a signal of recognition to a spectator. Juror C said he had not, and had not noticed anyone among the spectators. Defense counsel was present at sidebar for this second interaction with Juror A, and the interaction with Juror C, but the defendant was not at sidebar with them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">When a judge conducts an inquiry about a consequential matter, such as an allegation of serious misconduct of a juror or a suggestion of juror bias, the defendant is entitled, based on confrontation and fair trial rights, to be present. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>415 Mass. 502, 530 (1993), and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robichaud, </em>358 Mass. 300, 301-303 (1970) (reversal required under art. 12 where defendant excluded, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, from hearing on juror misconduct). The defendant, however, may waive this right. More particularly, if the defendant makes no request to be present, the judge takes no steps to exclude him, and counsel never objects to his absence, the issue is waived and this court will not address it on appeal. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 238 (2000), and cases cited. In addition, the judge may conduct administrative formalities outside the defendant\u2019s presence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, supra </em>at 530-531, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>MacDonald (No. 1), </em>368 Mass. 395, 399 n.3 (1975). Even where the inquiry is about a consequential matter, the defendant\u2019s absence does not necessarily constitute reversible error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, supra </em>at 530 n.25. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>412 Mass. 267, 286-287 (1992) (absence of defendant from col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>loquy with juror not reversible error where defendant was fully informed and agreed to discharge of juror).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">It would have been better practice for the judge to involve counsel and, if requested, the defendant in the conversation with Juror A on the fourth day of trial, because the juror was disclosing a matter that might suggest bias. However, where the judge and Juror A had substantially the same conversation in the presence of counsel on the eighth day as they had had on the fourth day, error, if any, does not require reversal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>412 Mass. at 286-287. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>415 Mass. at 522, 530-531 (exclusion of defendant and counsel from interviews regarding possible juror intimidation compounded other jury errors; reversal required).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">With regard to Jurors B and C, there was no error. Juror B\u2019s communication of her child care concerns was an administrative matter, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Angiulo, </em>415 Mass. at 530, and the judge properly involved counsel before taking any action based on her conversation with the juror. The colloquy with Juror C occurred at sidebar with the defendant\u2019s counsel present and, as with the second conversation with Juror A, the defendant waived his own presence at sidebar when he did not ask to be present and his counsel did not object. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">c. <em>Responding to questions from the jury during their deliberation. </em>The defendant argues he was improperly excluded on two occasions from discussion between the judge and counsel regarding questions from the jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A defendant has the right through his counsel to be consulted as the judge fashions a response to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>any jury question of \u201clegal significance.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Floyd P., </em>415 Mass. 826, 833-834 (1993). We conclude that here the defendant\u2019s rights were protected. On the first question from the jury, relating to the assault and battery charge, defense counsel was consulted and agreed to the judge\u2019s response as submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We see no indication in the record that any discussion of the second jury question occurred from which the defendant could have been excluded.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The judge should have consulted with counsel on the second question, but in the circumstances, where the judge repeated her earlier instruction on deliberate premeditation almost verbatim and where there was no error in the substance of the instruction, we conclude there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">d. <em>Denial of posttrial hearing on potential juror bias. </em>The defendant claims the motion judge erred in denying an eviden-tiary hearing on potential bias or lack of impartiality of two jurors. The first was Juror A, described in Part 2(b), <em>supra. </em>The second was a juror (Juror D) who, at the time of trial, was living with a man who worked as a guard at the jail where the defendant was then being held. The defendant proffered evidence in his motion for a new trial that the guard disliked the defendant and was overheard saying he knew the defendant would \u201cget what he deserves\u201d because his (the guard\u2019s) girl friend was on the jury. The guard allegedly stated he could telephone his girl friend to find out what was going on, but added that he would not do so. Juror D did not disclose any relationship to a person in law enforcement during empanelment, but she was not asked to do so as the juror questionnaire asked only about family relationships with members of law enforcement, and not other relationships, even if intimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">We find no error. The trial judge adequately explored potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>bias issues with regard to Juror A, as described above. With respect to Juror D, the defendant\u2019s proffer did not sustain his burden to show pretrial bias. In individual voir dire during empanelment, Juror D assured the judge that she would have no problem being fair and impartial in the trial, and the judge found she stood indifferent. The defendant offered no evidence that Juror D was aware of the guard\u2019s negative opinion of the defendant, or that the juror shared his opinion of this defendant or of defendants generally. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Somers, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 921-922 (1998) (error to discount juror\u2019s own expressed concerns of bias deriving in part from fianc\u00e9e\u2019s views on gun control). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>377 Mass. 192, 201 (1979) (defendant bears initial burden to show extraneous influence). We conclude the defendant\u2019s proffer was insufficient to require an evidentiary hearing into any undisclosed bias of Juror D.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">3. <em>Evidentiary errors. </em>The defendant raises three claims of error pertaining to the admission and exclusion of evidence. Because, except as noted, he did not object at trial, we review the claims to determine whether there exists a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). As the motion judge was not the trial judge and took no evidence, we review these evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>issues de novo. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Lykus, 451 Mass. 310, 326 (2008).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">a. <em>Evidence of state of mind. </em>The defendant argues error in the admission of evidence that the Drew family was afraid of the defendant, claiming that the evidence was not relevant to any material issue at trial and served only to prejudice the jury unfairly against him. The claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Beginning with defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, the defendant sought to portray himself as a dedicated father seeking only to protect and care for his daughter. Counsel stated in his opening that before June 28, the defendant was trying repeatedly to have contact with members of the Drew family in order to find Janice and his daughter, but that the family in substance sought to extort money from him in exchange for allowing the defendant to see his child, and that on June 28 in Carol\u2019s apartment, the same extortionate message was delivered. The defendant himself later testified that on June 28, Roy announced that Janice was present in Carol\u2019s apartment to talk about visitation with the child; that they (the Drew family) had all decided that Janice required at least $5,000 to relocate and another $3,500 to pay for school; and that both George and Roy repeatedly and insistently demanded money from him before Roy hit the defendant with the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Given the defendant\u2019s version of the events of June 28 and the preceding weeks, including in particular his claim that on June 28, he acted in self-defense in response to Roy and George\u2019s aggressive extortion efforts, evidence that the Drew family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>members were afraid of the defendant at that time was relevant to rebut the defendant\u2019s very different picture of what happened.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Magraw, </em>426 Mass. 589, 593-594 (1998) (\u201cA murder victim\u2019s state of mind becomes a material issue if the defendant opens the door by claiming that the death was a suicide or a result of self-defense, that the victim would voluntarily meet with or go someplace with the defendant, or that the defendant was on friendly terms with the victim\u201d). It is true that evidence of the state of mind of various members of the Drew family, strictly speaking, went beyond evidence of fear of the defendant on the part of the two direct victims, Roy and George. However, because the defendant sought to portray the family as a whole as the aggressor, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The defendant further argues that the judge erred in excluding evidence about two conversations he had with Roy that he claims were relevant to his state of mind at the time of the shooting. During trial, he sought to testify as to what Roy said in those conversations, but the prosecutor objected to both, and these objections were sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Defense counsel made no offer of proof at trial (or on appeal) as to the contents of the claimed conversations, and again did not do so in his motion for new trial. On the present record, therefore, we can discern neither the substance of what the testimony would have indicated, nor the state of mind that it was being proffered to show.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>371 Mass. 160, 174 (1976) (counsel made no offer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>proof and then unresponsive offer of proof when questions put to defendant during direct examination were excluded; \u201cfailure to make an offer of proof when it is required is fatal\u201d).

Evid. \u00a7 103(a)(2) (2011) (no error may be predicated on ruling excluding evidence unless \u201cthe substance of the evidence was made known to the court by an offer of proof or was apparent from the context within which the questions were asked\u201d). Moreover, the defendant\u2019s testimony about what happened in Carol\u2019s apartment immediately before and during the shooting directly focused, in part, on his state of mind; the defendant does not explain what other or additional aspect of his state of mind would have been revealed by evidence of the conversations. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">b. <em>Evidence of prior bad acts. </em>Janice testified that she did not tell anyone about the alleged rapes<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> because \u201cI was afraid that [the defendant] would blame me and I would end up getting another beating from him.\u201d The defendant argues that this statement improperly implied a pattern of prior bad acts on his part, and its admission was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that the prosecution may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged, but such evidence may be admissible if relevant for some other purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986). For example, \u201c[a] witness who has been impeached by [her] testimony that [s]he was silent in circumstances naturally calling for expression may explain why [s]he was silent.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 880 (1984). Although, in contrast to the witness in the <em>Errington </em>case, Janice was not directly impeached by her failure to report the incident, see <em>id. </em>at 879-880, the defendant\u2019s theory was that Janice was \u201cvery promiscuous\u201d and \u201cthrew out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>an accusation\u201d of rape when it appeared her brothers might be angry with her and inclined to side with the defendant.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In these circumstances, Janice\u2019s testimony served to rehabilitate her credibility. And, as previously stated (see note 22, <em>supra), </em>there was other evidence, not objected to, that put before the jury the issue of the defendant\u2019s abuse of Janice.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\u201c[Tjhere is ground for excluding [evidence of another offense committed by the defendant] if the prejudice likely to be generated by it outweighs its probative value[,] a matter on which the opinion of the trial judge will be accepted on review except for palpable error.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 462-463 (1981). Here, on objection by counsel, the judge stated, \u201cAs the basis for the reason why [Janice] did not tell, I\u2019m going to allow it to stand.\u201d The ruling was not unreasonable, and we find no error.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">4. <em>Jury instructions. </em>There are three claims of error in the jury instructions. The defendant did not object at trial, and therefore we review the challenged instructions to determine whether any created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>420 Mass. 479, 483 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">a. <em>Deliberate premeditation. </em>The defendant complains that the instruction on malice in the judge\u2019s charge on the elements of murder by deliberate premeditation erroneously referenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>all three prongs of malice. Because \u201conly the first prong of malice [specific intent to kill] can support a conviction of deliberately premeditated murder,\u201d we agree that the judge\u2019s malice instruction was incorrect. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>434 Mass. 570, 588 (2001). However, the judge clearly explained that before the jury could find the separate element of deliberate premeditation to have been proved, they were required to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant decided (and thereby intended) to kill the victim.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Squailia, </em>429 Mass. 101, 107 (1999). There is no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice where, as here, the judge\u2019s instruction on deliberate premeditation was such that \u201ca reasonable juror could only have understood that a guilty verdict... by reason of deliberate premeditation required a finding of purposeful conduct that included a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of a specific intent to kill.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jenks, </em>426 Mass. 582, 585 (1998), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>424 Mass. 242, 247, cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1123 (1997). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>427 Mass. 541, 544-545 (1998), and cases cited.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">b. <em>Voluntary manslaughter. </em>After correctly defining voluntary manslaughter, and explaining that voluntary manslaughter is distinguished from murder based on the absence of malice, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\u201cIn order to prove a defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the Commonwealth must prove three elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt, that this defendant inflicted an injury upon Roy Drew from which he died, <em>and that the defendant injured Roy Drew as a result of sudden combat or in the heat of passion </em>or using excessive force in self-defense\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">As the defendant argues, the emphasized portion of the judge\u2019s statement erroneously articulates the Commonwealth\u2019s burden. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>427 Mass. 714, 716 (1998) (\u201cThe correct rule is that, where the evidence raises the possibility that the defendant may have acted on reasonable provocation, the Commonwealth must prove, and the jury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did <em>not </em>act on reasonable provocation\u201d [emphasis added]). However, the judge followed this incorrect statement of burden with an accurate description of the type of provocation sufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter and the type that is not sufficient (e.g., \u201cmere insulting words or threatening gestures\u201d), and then correctly stated: \u201cHowever, a killing does not have to be spontaneous with the provocation in order to be done in the heat of passion. <em>Where there\u2019s evidence of provocation the Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not commit this killing in the heat of passion\u201d </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">We do not read one part of the judge\u2019s charge in isolation; \u201crather, \u2018[t]he test of a charge is the impression which it makes as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vives, </em>447 Mass. 537, 542 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quigley, </em>391 Mass. 461, 467 (1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1115 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glacken, </em>451 Mass. 163, 168-169 (2008). We have here one incorrect instruction, one correct instruction, and a third instruction (see note 29, <em>supra) </em>that is simply unclear on the question of burden. Although in the circumstances we cannot say that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>\u201ccenter of gravity\u201d of the judge\u2019s charge to the jury \u201cplainly rested on the side of the correct instruction,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>439 Mass. 532, 544 (2003), we also \u201ccannot conclude that \u2018the center of gravity . . . was strongly on the side of misstatement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fickling, </em>434 Mass. 9, 20 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>427 Mass. at 717.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>\u201cIf you determine the Commonwealth has not met its burden on the element of malice, then you would determine whether or not the Commonwealth has met its burden on the issue of manslaughter which is an unlawful killing of a human being, absence of malice, malice being mitigated, or negated rather, by the elements of passion, sudden combat, and provocation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>Moreover, the defendant does not appear to have been entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction based on provocation. While voluntary manslaughter differs from murder because of the absence of malice, voluntary manslaughter nonetheless involves an intentional killing. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>408 Mass. 803, 807 (1990). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, 427 </em>Mass. at 716; Model Jury Instructions on Homicide 32 (1999). The defendant testified that Roy hit him \u201clow\u201d with the gun, causing him to bend over, and that a struggle ensued during which Roy had two hands on the gun, the defendant had one, the gun then went off in a manner that the defendant described as \u201can accident,\u201d and Roy fell; according to the defendant, he did not \u201ceven see the gun go off\u201d and did not see Roy get shot. There is thus no indication that Roy\u2019s actions \u201ctrigger[ed] a sudden loss of self-control in the defendant\u201d that caused him to kill Roy intentionally. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>453 Mass. 90, 95 (2009). Because a theory of reasonable provocation is fundamentally inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of defense at trial, we find no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arising from any error in the judge\u2019s instruction. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>407 Mass. 731, 737-739 &amp; nn.7, 8 (1990) (where defendant\u2019s argument on appeal that judge should have instructed on felony-murder in the second degree premised on lesser included offense of larceny was \u201cinconsistent with the defendant\u2019s trial strategy\u201d of seeking acquittal based on self-defense, there was no substantial risk of miscarriage of justice in judge\u2019s failure to give instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">c. <em>Self-defense. </em>The defendant argues the judge erroneously stated the Commonwealth\u2019s burden with respect to self-defense when she instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-7\">\u201cThe Commonwealth must prove . . . that the shooting or killing of Roy Drew was not done in self-defense, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the Commonwealth must further prove that \u2014 strike that. If the Commonwealth fails to prove that it was done in self-defense but proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with excessive force, then it becomes an unlawful killing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Although the defendant is correct that the judge\u2019s second sentence should have been, \u201cIf the Commonwealth fails to prove that it was <em>not </em>done in self-defense,\u201d as the motion judge found, this slip of the tongue followed directly at least five correctly articulated instructions that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not excusable by reason of self-defense. Then, immediately following the incorrect articulation, the judge stated, correctly, \u201cIf there is evidence, it\u2019s up to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the defendant may have acted in self-defense, then the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense.\u201d Reading the charge as a whole, as we must, no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice arises from the single misstatement made between two series of correct instructions on self-defense. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, </em>445 Mass. 837, 844-845 (2006) (no substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice where misstatement in malice instruction was between two correct instructions; when instructions are construed as whole, little chance exists that jury would have misunderstood correct import).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The defendant further contends that the judge\u2019s instruction improperly diluted the Commonwealth\u2019s burden on self-defense (as well as accident). The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201cIf the Commonwealth fails to meet its burden beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an unlawful killing, to wit, the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not an accident or that it was not done in self-defense, then the jury would be <em>warranted </em>in returning a verdict of not guilty on the charge of the murder indictment on Roy Drew\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">As the Commonwealth concedes, in this context, the use of the word \u201cwarranted\u201d is improper because the jury in fact would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number><em>required, </em>to return a verdict of not guilty if the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not an accident or that it was not done in self-defense. Nonetheless, despite this isolated misstatement, the entirety of the charge on self-defense \u201cshows that the jury\u2019s verdict of deliberately premeditated murder in the first degree \u2018would have been substantially unsullied\u2019 by any alleged error in the judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>420 Mass. 479, 493 (1995), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, 414 </em>Mass. 252, 267 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Finally, the defendant argues error in the fact that the judge did not instruct the jury on the use of nondeadly force in self-defense. Because the force he testified to using against Roy was that of his hands, and not the gun that fired during that struggle, the argument goes, the defendant was entitled to such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">At its core, the defendant\u2019s argument appears to be that his use of his hands \u2014 nondeadly force \u2014 in struggling with Roy set the stage for the accidental discharge of the gun, and for this reason, he was entitled to an instruction explaining that he was justified in the use of nondeadly force \u201cin circumstances giving rise to a \u2018reasonable concern over his personal safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>440 Mass. 731, 739 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baseler, </em>419 Mass. 500, 502-503 (1995). We disagree. It is true that in determining whether an instruction on deadly or nondeadly force is called for, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is what level of force was used, not what the resulting injuries were.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 396 n.3 (1998). Nevertheless, in considering self-defense as a justification for homicide, the critical point is whether the action or actions taken by the defendant in claimed self-defense actually resulted in the victim\u2019s death. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopes, supra </em>at 740.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Here, there is no dispute that Roy\u2019s death was caused by a gunshot, unquestionably deadly force. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number><em>Santos, </em>454 Mass. 770, 773 (2009) (where gun went off during struggle between defendant and victim, defendant entitled to instruction on self-defense with dangerous weapon [deadly force]). The defendant\u2019s argument that his use of force stopped with the use of his hands, and that the subsequent gunshot actually causing the death was only accidental, does not put the use of nondeadly force in self-defense into play as a justification for the killing, but simply raises a defense of accident. The judge properly instructed the jury on accident.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The extent of force that the defendant may have used, whether deadly or nondeadly, is irrelevant to a theory of accident. The defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the nondeadly use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">5. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In addition to the defendant\u2019s claims, reviewed above, that were framed in part as claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, see note 21, <em>supra, </em>the defendant also argues that in a number of specific respects, his trial counsel\u2019s conduct in the preparation for and during trial deprived him of constitutionally effective assistance of counsel, and that these deficiencies require a new trial.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">a. <em>Failure to investigate. </em>According to the defendant, counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>failure to retain an expert to conduct an independent forensic investigation of the crime scene had two prejudicial consequences: it denied the defendant the opportunity to develop and present independent evidence to support his version of events and contradict the Commonwealth\u2019s; and it also deprived him of the ability to mount a defense based on inadequacies in the Commonwealth\u2019s investigation of the crimes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980) <em>(Bowden).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">In support of his motion for a new trial, the defendant filed an affidavit by Peter R. DeForest, a professor of criminalistics, who opined, inter alia, that the crime scene investigators\u2019 failure to investigate gunpowder residue patterns and trajectory patterns of bullets, and to conduct additional chemical testing of gunshot and powder discharge, removed a significant opportunity to test witness credibility.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> However, the defendant has not shown that even if his trial counsel, who apparently was appointed or retained to represent him in or around December of 1992 \u2014 almost sixteen months after the defendant was arraigned and almost eighteen months after June 28, 1991, the date of the shootings \u2014 had retained an expert in forensic investigation, the kinds of testing of gunpowder residue on Roy\u2019s hands, measurement of bullet trajectories, and other analyses described by DeForest could even have been conducted; Roy had been dead for over a year, and there is no evidence as to the condition of the apartment in question. Moreover, even if this kind of investigation could have been made, the defendant has offered, through DeForest, only a theoretical possibility that it would have proved fruitful for the defendant. To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, even under the more favorable standard provided by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1982), it must be shown that counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>error \u201cwas likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant has not made that showing here.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">With respect to the defendant\u2019s second argument, that counsel\u2019s failure to use a forensic expert deprived the defendant of a chance to assert a <em>Bowden </em>defense, there is no question that \u201c [defendants have the right to base their defense on the failure of police adequately to investigate a murder in order to raise the issue of reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt in the minds of the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Phinney, </em>446 Mass. 155, 165-166 (2006), citing <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. at 486. It is also true that the DeForest affidavit demonstrates the police did not conduct every test that could have been conducted.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> However, the defendant has failed to show \u2014 through the affidavit or otherwise \u2014 that the forensic examinations DeForest describes were reasonably necessary or appropriate for the police to conduct in order to investigate the shootings properly, such that the failure to conduct them might create a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s guilt. As the Commonwealth points out, at the time of the police investigation of the crime scene, all the available witnesses with personal knowledge provided the police with congruent statements about the defendant\u2019s role as the person who brought the gun to the apartment and shot it at Roy, George, and Janice; the location of the projectiles in the kitchen cabinet and bedroom floor was consistent with the witnesses\u2019s statements, as were the medical examiner\u2019s observations that the shot that killed Roy was fired at very close range; the defendant himself had fled, abandoning his car that contained .357 ammunition; and the gun was missing. In the circumstances, it is difficult to see why the police or the medical examiner would have been obliged to conduct more or different measurements or tests than they did. The defendant has not shown that trial counsel\u2019s alleged failure to mount a <em>Bowden </em>defense was mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>festly unreasonable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Candelario, </em>446 Mass. 847, 854 (2006), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">b. <em>Failure to examine Pamela and Janice as to potential bias. </em>The defendant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to examine his sister, Pamela, concerning her custody dispute with Janice over his daughter. As a basis for this claim, the defendant asserts that the custody dispute was relevant because it illuminated Janice\u2019s potential bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The argument fails. We agree with the motion judge, who found that \u201c[t]he transcripts are replete with evidence which established the bias of the members of the Drew family toward the defendant.\u201d Janice gave testimony on direct and cross-examination describing discord and ill will between herself and the defendant. It is not clear what, if anything, would have been added concerning Janice\u2019s potential bias; at best, this testimony would have been cumulative. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockham-mer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 876-877 (1991) (improperly precluded testimony \u201camounted to a separate and discrete basis of impeachment of the complainant\u2019s credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">c. <em>Failure to object to identification cards. </em>The defendant argues that it was unreasonable for trial counsel not to move to exclude or to object to the admission of photograph identification cards (cards) seized from the car the defendant drove to the scene of the shooting, or to testimony about the defendant\u2019s use of these cards and other aliases. Each of the cards featured a photograph of the defendant, but bore a name other than the defendant\u2019s name. The defendant argues admission of this evidence improperly suggested criminal propensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">\u201cAliases can be suggestive of bad character and prior criminality, and therefore raise a possibility that the jury will improperly consider criminal propensity.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>442 Mass. 1002, 1002 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>423 Mass. 506, 514 (1996). The same may well be said of cards featuring an accurate photograph of a person but the use of a name different from the person\u2019s actual name. However, \u201ca prosecutor may refer to, or ask witnesses about, a defendant\u2019s nickname or alias when there is a reason to do so,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>458 Mass. 684, 697 (2011), and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>same is true of photographic identification. Here, the Commonwealth\u2019s questions were relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s premeditation about the possibility of committing a crime with a gun, and specifically to his intent to flee and conceal his identity after having committed it<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> \u2014 actions bearing on consciousness of guilt. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 582-585 (1982).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> An objection was not likely to be sustained. In his direct examination of the defendant, counsel had the defendant acknowledge his use of aliases, and then counsel clarified on redirect examination that the defendant had not used these cards for many years before the shootings \u2014 i.e., that they were not created or obtained in June of 1991. This was not a manifestly unreasonable approach for counsel to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">6. <em>G.

Late in the first day of jury empanelment, defense counsel notified the trial judge that the defendant wished to waive his presence during the voir dire. The defendant explained he had to go to the bathroom, needed to drink water, and was injured by the shackles. The transcript then quotes the defendant saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really being heard.\u201d The judge responded that wearing shackles while in transit to and from the court room was not unusual, that the defendant could have a glass of water, and that they had just taken a break. The defendant repeated that he was thirsty, but the judge said, \u201cAll of us are working under the same conditions,\u201d and did not agree to permit the defendant to leave. The defendant was again in court when jury selection continued on the second day. In the context of the discussion, it is possible that the comment, \u201cIt\u2019s really being heard,\u201d was mistranscribed, because otherwise it is a nonsequitur; he may, for example, have said, \u201cIt\u2019s really been hard.\u201d At any rate, it is apparent from the transcript that the defendant wished to have less of a role, not more of one, in the juror voir dire proceedings. We do not find any instance in the record where the defendant raised any objection to the voir dire other than his desire to waive his own presence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>434 Mass. 823, 832 (2001), this court reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>for substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice a claim that public trial rights were violated during a murder trial.

In <em>Horton, </em>as in this case, the defendant argued his counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the judge\u2019s conducting individual voir dire of prospective jurors in a place other than open court. <em>Id. </em>at 831. Without using the word \u201cwaiver,\u201d the court in effect applied a waiver analysis in concluding that \u201c[t]he defendant did not object to conducting voir dire in the jury deliberation room, and he never asserted that it violated his right to a public trial\u201d and therefore \u201cfailed to preserve the issue for appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 832. In other words, the court concluded that the defendant waived his claim of constitutional error. However, perhaps in light of the fact that it was conducting its review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, the court in the <em>Horton </em>case then applied an additional layer of review, for a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>We apply the same analysis here. To do otherwise would require either that we allow no review of a waived constitutional claim, or that we apply a structural error analysis despite the waiver. The former option would give less protection to waived constitutional rights than to ordinary claims of unpreserved errors in the context of a G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, review. The latter would require us to ignore \u2014 at great cost to the public interest in the finality of verdicts \u2014 the established rule that public trial rights may be waived. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 1), </em>456 Mass. 94, 105-106 (2010), and cases cited. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 637 (1997). We therefore restate that the principal issue in regard to the defendant\u2019s claim is one of waiver, but we will also apply an extra level of review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Although he brought up other complaints, neither the defendant nor his counsel raised any concern about the judge\u2019s decision to conduct individual voir dire in her lobby. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>379 Mass. 874, 875-876 (1979), and cases cited (incumbent on defendant and counsel to object to exclusion of public from trial). Although not directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>relevant to the question whether there was a waiver at trial, we note that the defendant did not raise the issue in his motion for a new trial, in either of the two supplements he filed to that motion, or at the hearing on the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\">The juror had raised the subject with the judge via a court officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The juror apparently was referring to a statement made by the prosecutor in his opening statement the prior afternoon, on the third day of trial, to the effect that Janice had been prosecuted by the Bristol County district attorney\u2019s office and had been sentenced for statutory rape. Juror A clarified he had not talked to anyone about the matter, and agreed with the judge\u2019s question or suggestion that if he recognized Janice, it should not affect him as far as the case was concerned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b763-10\">The court reporter transcribed the judge\u2019s conversations with Juror A and Juror B and the judge\u2019s relaying of those conversations to both counsel. The record shows that the judge accurately described her conversations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b764-6\">This second colloquy with Juror A occurred because Janice conveyed to the judge that she thought she recognized the juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Although the defendant was not present at sidebar, the record does not indicate that he was absent from the court room during the sidebar conversations, that he asked to be present at sidebar, that the judge actively excluded him, or that defense counsel objected to his absence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\">At this second conversation with Juror A at sidebar, the defendant waived his own right to be present where he did not ask to be present, and defense counsel did not object on his behalf. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>432 Mass. 214, 238 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\">At any rate, any suggestion of bias was highly attenuated. The juror indicated that although he recognized Janice from the \u201cmeal line\u201d at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Framingham, nothing about her stood out in his mind. That Janice had been in prison was not extraneous evidence: the prosecutor mentioned in his opening statement that Janice was prosecuted and sentenced for statutory rape of the defendant\u2019s teenage son and Janice testified to these facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b765-10\">The first question from the jury related to the charge of assault and battery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>of Janice, a charge of which the defendant was found not guilty. The second was a request for \u201cclarification on the term \u2018deliberate premeditation.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Even if counsel failed to consult the defendant adequately, error, if any, was harmless because on this charge the jury acquitted the defendant. See note 16, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\">In open court, presumably in the defendant\u2019s presence, and with an opportunity for counsel to object, the trial judge simply repeated her earlier instructions on deliberate premeditation to the jury; the clear implication in the record is that the judge did not discuss the issue with counsel prior to reinstructing the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b767-6\">We also agree with the motion judge that the defendant\u2019s submissions in his motion for a new trial did not amount to any implication of misconduct by Juror D. While the guard\u2019s alleged statement suggests he knew that his girl friend was serving on the defendant\u2019s jury, the timing of the jury service alone would have allowed the guard to reach that conclusion. The record indicates the trial judge was the only judge sitting in the Superior Court in New Bed-ford for parts of the defendant\u2019s trial; we surmise no other long trial coincided with this one. At any rate, to the extent the defendant implies the boy friend directly influenced Juror D\u2019s opinion of the defendant, the critical inquiry is whether there is any evidence the boy friend actually communicated to Juror D information or an opinion that may have affected her impartiality. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guisti, </em>434 Mass. 245, 251-253 (2001). The defendant does not proffer any such evidence of extraneous influence, but instead argues the mere fact of Juror D\u2019s close relationship with a member of law enforcement raises the possibility that Juror D was biased against the defendant. This argument is insufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b767-7\">For those claims that were preserved at trial, we look to see whether error, if any, prejudiced the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In his motion for a new trial, the defendant raised the errors reviewed in this section as erroneous rulings of the trial judge, as well as, in most instances, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because of counsel\u2019s failure to object. We have stated that \u201cif a defendant convicted of murder in the first degree is unable to show on his direct appeal that, as to an unpreserved claim of error, there is a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice, he would not prevail by asserting as to the same issue the ineffectiveness of his counsel.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>411 Mass. 678, 682 (1992). Accordingly, in conducting our review in this case under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we do not focus primarily on whether or not counsel\u2019s performance was adequate, but on \u201cwhether there was an error in the course of the trial (by defense counsel, the prosecutor, or the judge) and, if there was, whether that error was likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the motion judge in this case that, aside from the issue discussed, see note 22, <em>infra, </em>there was no error in the evidentiary rulings challenged by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The Commonwealth concedes on appeal, as it did while opposing the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, that Janice\u2019s testimony she telephoned personnel at a shelter for victims of domestic violence and told them she had fled from the defendant and was scared of him should not have been admitted. Because the testimony was cumulative of other properly admitted testimony of Janice about the defendant\u2019s violent, abusive behavior toward her \u2014 including that he ripped \u201cthe phones off the walls\u201d in their Maine apartment while yelling, \u201cSo, you think you\u2019re going to leave me?\u201d on learning that Janice was leaving with their daughter \u2014 the error was not likely to have influenced the jury\u2019s conclusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianchi, </em>435 Mass. 316, 324 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b769-8\">When defense counsel asked, \u201cAs a result of [the second] conversation, did anything occur?\u201d the defendant responded, \u201cYes, I discontinued to try to raise the money.\u201d To the extent one might look for an alternative to the absent offer of proof, this testimony does not supply it \u2014 that is, the defendant\u2019s response gives no hint that the substance of Roy\u2019s statement would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>relevant to the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Qualls, </em>440 Mass. 576, 585 (2003) (victim\u2019s statement, hours before being shot, that he stabbed defendant\u2019s cousin, followed by defendant\u2019s becoming angry and pacing, not hearsay because offered to show defendant\u2019s state of mind and possible motive).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\">As outlined in Part 1 (a), <em>supra, </em>before the shooting, Janice said in the presence of Roy, George, and the defendant that she had been raped by two men and that the defendant \u201chad set the whole thing up.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Janice herself testified that when she said she had been raped and that the defendant had set it up to videotape it, \u201c[t]he tide turned. [George and Roy] finally saw [the defendant] as what I\u2019d been trying to tell them, you know, that he was abusive . . . .\u201d Defense counsel pursued on cross-examination the theory that Janice accused the defendant of setting up and videotaping the rape only to convince George and Roy to take her side.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b771-9\">To the extent the defendant argues a limiting instruction should have been given, because no such instruction was requested, the failure to give one was not error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875, 882 (1984), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The defendant briefly notes also that the trial judge excluded examination directed at alleged incestuous relationships between Janice and her brothers, proffered as being relevant to Janice\u2019s bias. While we may not agree with the judge that Janice\u2019s alleged incestuous relationship with Roy, especially, was \u201ctotally irrelevant\u201d to the issue of her bias against the defendant, we think that on this record, where there was already substantial evidence of Janice\u2019s strong hostility toward the defendant, the prejudicial impact of evidence of incest outweighed any probative value it might have had. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\">Specifically, the judge explained that in order to prove deliberate premeditation, the Commonwealth \u201cmust prove that this defendant thought before he acted, that he formed a plan no matter how simple to murder after deliberation,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he sequence would be, first, the deliberation and premeditation, then the decision to kill, and lastly, the killing in furtherance of the decision.

The court rejected the argument because the evidence \u201cleft no reasonable doubt that the victim died as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>of asphyxiation by ligature strangulation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 740, and \u201cno view of the evidence would support a reasonable inference that the victim had died as a result of a punch to the neck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>429 Mass. 44, 46, 47 (1999) (\u201cNondeadly force, such as the force of one\u2019s fists, hands, and arms, is considered to be nondeadly even if a death results\u201d; where defendant raised self-defense and presented evidence he \u201cdid not intend to kill or seriously harm [victim] and that the force he used was unlikely to do so\u201d when he strangled victim by placing his arm around victim\u2019s neck, instruction on nondeadly force should have been given).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The judge defined \u201caccident\u201d as \u201can unexpected happening that occurs without intention or design on the part of the defendant.\u201d She then explained, \u201cThe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooting of Roy Drew was not an accident.
