L. c. 119, \u00a7 24, alleging that Daisy was a child in need of care and protection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After trial, a judge in the Juvenile Court concluded that Daisy was a child in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>need of care and protection and dispensed with the need for her parents\u2019 consent to adoption, guardianship, custody, or other disposition of the child pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 26, which effectively terminated the parents\u2019 rights. <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>392 Mass. 696, 698 (1984). Only the mother appealed. The Appeals Court affirmed, holding that \u201cthe judge was well-justified in concluding that it was in the best interests of Daisy that the parental rights of the mother be terminated.\u201d <em>Adoption of Daisy, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 768, 784 (2010). We granted the mother\u2019s application for further appellate review but limited our review to a single issue: whether G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 82, which in certain circumstances allows the admission in evidence in a civil proceeding of \u201cout-of-court statements of a child under the age of ten describing any act of sexual contact performed on or with the child,\u201d applies where the child was under the age of ten when she made the statements but ten years of age or older at the time of trial. We conclude that the statute applies where the child was under the age of ten when she made the statements, regardless of her age at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><em>Background. </em>Because the factual background of this case is carefully detailed in the Appeals Court\u2019s opinion, <em>Adoption of Daisy, supra </em>at 769-777, and because we have limited further appellate review to a single issue of statutory interpretation, we briefly summarize the facts as found by the judge. When Daisy was nine years of age, she reported to a school social worker that her father had been repeatedly sexually abusing her; the social worker filed a report of abuse. After this first revelation, while still nine years of age, she told at least three other persons of the sexual abuse her father inflicted on her: the program director of the residential program she attended, a court-appointed investigator, and a clinician specializing in trauma evaluation. The mother refused to believe Daisy\u2019s allegations against the father. The department removed Daisy to a foster home, but her mother visited on an \u201cevery other week\u201d schedule. In December, 2007, Daisy stated that she no longer wanted to visit with her mother after the mother\u2019s repeated failure to believe Daisy\u2019s accounts of the father\u2019s sexual abuse. Daisy never resumed the visits with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>In August and September, 2008, when Daisy was eleven years of age, the judge conducted a hearing under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 82, regarding the admissibility of the out-of-court statements that Daisy made before she was ten years of age describing her sexual abuse. Relying on the testimony of an expert who provides clinical treatment to children traumatized by sexual abuse, the judge found that Daisy was \u201cunavailable\u201d as a witness under \u00a7 82 <em>(b) </em>(5) because \u201ctestifying as a witness would likely cause severe psychological or emotional trauma.\u201d The judge held under \u00a7 82 (c) that Daisy\u2019s out-of-court statements \u201cwere made under circumstances inherently demonstrating a special guarantee of reliability,\u201d finding that each of the four witnesses had documented her statements to him or her; that the clarity of each statement was \u201cunequivocal\u201d and the meaning was \u201cdirect, straightforward and unambiguous\u201d; that the time and circumstances of disclosure made each statement reliable; that there was sufficient corroborative evidence of the substance of her statements; and that Daisy was \u201csincere and genuine\u201d when she made each statement. The judge ruled that the statements could be admitted as substantive evidence under \u00a7 82 at the parental termination of rights trial, which began in September, 2008, and concluded in October, 2008. Daisy did not testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 82, the \u201cout-of-court statements of a child under the age of ten describing any act of sexual contact performed on or with the child . . . shall be admissible as substantive evidence\u201d in a civil proceeding (except those brought under G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 23 or \u00a7 24), where the statement is offered as evidence of material fact and is more probative on the point than any other evidence the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; the person who heard the statement testifies; the child is unavailable as a witness as defined in \u00a7 82 <em>(b)\\ </em>and the statement is reliable, as defined in \u00a7 82 (c). The full text of \u00a7 82 appears below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Because Daisy was the age of eleven years when these state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ments were admitted at trial, we must consider the meaning of the phrase, \u201cout-of court statements of a child under the age of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ten.\u201d Daisy\u2019s out-of-court statements are properly admissible under \u00a7 82 only if this clause refers to the age of the child at the time the statements are made rather than to the age of the child at the time the statements are offered in evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">In interpreting a statute, we look first to its language as the \u201cprincipal source of insight into legislative intent.\u201d <em>Water Dep\u2019t of Fairhaven </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>455 Mass. 740, 744 (2010), quoting <em>Providence &amp; Worcester R.R. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>453 Mass. 135, 142 (2009). Where the meaning of the language is plain and unambiguous, we will not look to extrinsic evidence of legislative intent \u201cunless a literal construction would yield an absurd or unworkable result.\u201d <em>Boston Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oilers, Local 3, </em>458 Mass. 155, 162 (2010). See <em>Halebian </em>v. <em>Berv, </em>457 Mass. 620, 630 (2010). Where the meaning of a statute is not plain from its language, we consider the \u201ccause of its enact<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 490 (2009), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>367 Mass. 360, 364 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Applying that standard of statutory interpretation, we believe that it is adequately clear, albeit not perfectly clear, that the phrase, \u201cout-of-court statements of a child under the age of ten,\u201d means statements made out-of-court by a child who was under the age of ten.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The alternative interpretation argued by the mother \u2014 that the phrase means statements made by a child who is under ten at the time the statement is offered in evidence \u2014 adds language to the statute that the Legislature chose not to include. \u201cWe do not read into the statute a provision which the Legislature did not see fit to put there, nor add words that the Legislature had an option to, but chose not to include.\u201d <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court for the County of Worcester, </em>446 Mass. 123, 126 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Because the meaning of the language is not crystal clear, we consider whether our interpretation of the statute is consistent with its purpose, which we have earlier characterized as striking a \u201cbalance between the parents\u2019 due process right to rebut evidence and the State\u2019s need to protect children.\u201d <em>Adoption of Quentin, </em>424 Mass. 882, 892 (1997). We conclude that it is consistent. Because the out-of-court statement of a child declarant is fixed in time and precedes the admission of the statement in evidence, this interpretation protects all children who describe their sexual abuse before they were ten years of age, no matter how long it takes before the sexual abuse becomes the subject of a civil proceeding. It also protects young children from the risk that a delay in the investigation or trial of a sexual abuse case may render inadmissible their out-of-court statements, and it eliminates a sexual abuser\u2019s incentive to delay the trial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>prevent the admission of the child\u2019s damaging hearsay statements. Finally, this interpretation also protects young children from a dilemma that Daisy may have faced had the judge adopted the mother\u2019s interpretation \u2014 either testify and endure the psychological or emotional trauma that likely will result from testifying in court, or avoid the trauma of testifying and endure the psychological or emotional trauma that likely will result if the parent\u2019s abuse cannot be proved and the child returns to the custody of the abusive parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The mother argues that this interpretation of \u00a7 82 must be rejected because it will lead to the \u201cabsurd result\u201d that hearsay statements made by a child under ten years of age may be admitted in evidence even though the child at the time of trial is substantially older, perhaps sixteen or seventeen years of age. We do not believe this result is absurd, because the hearsay statements will only be admissible under \u00a7 82 if the child is unavailable, as defined in \u00a7 82 <em>(b). </em>If testifying at trial would not cause the older child severe psychological or emotional trauma, and if none of the other grounds to find unavailability is present, the statements would not be admissible without the older child testifying. If, despite the passage of years, testifying would still cause the child severe psychological or emotional trauma, or if the older child is unavailable because of a physical or mental illness, the invocation of a privilege, lack of memory, incompetence, or because the child cannot be located, we see nothing absurd about admitting such testimony of sexual abuse where a judge has found it reliable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the phrase, \u201cout-of-court statements of a child under the age of ten,\u201d in G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 82, refers to hearsay statements made by a child when the child was under the age of ten, not to hearsay statements made by a child who is under the age of ten at the time the statement is offered at trial. We therefore conclude that the hearsay statements by Daisy that were made when she was under the age of ten but admitted in evidence when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>was eleven years of age were properly admitted, and affirm the judge\u2019s decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-17\">The petition was filed on November 3, 2006, by the Department of Social Services, which is now called the Department of Children and Families (department).
