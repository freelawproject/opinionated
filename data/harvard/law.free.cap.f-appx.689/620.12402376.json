Phillips Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Frank Sturgell wants to be an architect in Colorado but has not been able to satisfy the licensing requirements. He filed this lawsuit against the Colorado Attorney General\u2019s office and several of its high-ranking officials, alleging that they violated state and federal law by failing to effectively police the board that regulates architects and establishes qualifications for their licensure. The district court gave Mr. Sturgell several opportunities to amend his complaint to fix deficiencies in form, and substance and to comply with Fed. R. Civ. P. 8. But even with these revisions, it found his claims to be frivolous and thus dismissed his amended complaint with prejudice under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) before the defendants were served. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Mr. Sturgell points out a number of perceived flaws in the State\u2019s licensing system for architects and alleges that Attorney General Cynthia Coffman and Senior Assistant Attorney General John Roberts harmed him through their inaction. He cites their failure to enforce C.R.S. \u00a7 12-25-314 (\u201cQualifications for architect licen-sure\u201d) or define the minimum competency required for his profession and asks the court to direct the officials to fulfill their duties and to remove them from office. He also asserts violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (\u201cInterference with commerce by threats or violence\u201d) and several state criminal statutes. Last, he vaguely references a violation of his constitutional rights, which the district court generously interpreted as a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as compensatory, consequential, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">Because Mr. Sturgell was proceeding in forma pauperis (IFP) when he filed his amended complaint, \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) mandates that the district court dismiss his claims if it determines they are frivolous. A claim is frivolous under \u00a7 1915(e) when \u201cit lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. </em>Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Here, the district court rejected each claim on the merits and dismissed the amended complaint as \u201clegally frivolous.\u201d R. at 60. Mr. Sturgell then filed this timely appeal. He identifies 19 specific issues, but the core issue is whether the district court\u2019s frivolousness determination was proper. It was.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-13\">Where, as here, a frivolous determination \u201cturns on an issue of law,\u201d we review that determination de novo. <em>Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1259 (10th Cir. 2006). As the district court did, we construe the amended complaint liberally because Mr. Sturgell appears pro se. <em>See Hall v. Bellman, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991). Having carefully considered the briefs and record in this case, we agree with the district court\u2019s assessment. We affirm the dismissal for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned order of September 21, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Finally, we deny Mr. Sturgell\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal and advise him that he is responsible for the immediate payment of the unpaid balance of his appellate filing fee. An appellant seeking leave to proceed IFP must show \u201cthe existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir. 1991). Mr. Sturgell has not done this. His arguments on appeal do not meaningfully address the deficiencies that led to the dismissal of his amended complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R, App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
