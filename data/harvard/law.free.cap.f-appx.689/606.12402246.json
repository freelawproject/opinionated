Matheson, Jr., Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AEn\">Mark A. Prentice, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. He also seeks leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we deny both requests and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Az9\">On December 19, 2013, Mr. Prentice pled guilty to federal drug conspiracy and money laundering charges. On June 18, 2014, the court sentenced Mr. Prentice to 300 months in prison and entered final judgment against him on June 20, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The next year, on July 6, 2015, Mr. Prentice filed a pro se motion, which he titled a \u201c\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and which the court re-characterized as a \u00a7 2255 motion. The court gave Mr. Prentice the chance to file his motion using a standardized \u00a7 2255 form, but the court warned against Mr. Prentice raising any new claims not originally presented in his July 6 motion. On December 4, 2015, Mr. Prentice filed the standardized \u00a7 2255 form and raised new claims not raised in his July 6 motion. Mr. Prenctice filed two supplements to his motions on October 6 and November 3, 2016. In his two motions, Mr. Prentice raised 11 claims, including claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">The court denied Mr. Prentice\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction claim, and it denied the remaining claims as time-barred. The court also denied Mr. Prentice a COA to appeal its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Mr. Prentice filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 59(e) to alter, amend, or reconsider the court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion, which the court-also denied. The court again denied a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">On February 13, 2017, Mr. Prentice filed a motion for the court to reconsider its COA denial, which the court similarly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">'Mr. Prentice must obtain a COA to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). Where, as here, the district court dismissed the motion on procedural grounds, we will grant a COA only if Mr. Prentice can demonstrate both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">We agree with the district court that Mr. Prentice\u2019s appeal does not warrant a COA. On appeal, Mr. Prentice does not challenge the court\u2019s ruling that his claims were time-barred. He instead contends the court erred in dismissing his claims because their merits \u201ctrump\u201d any issue concerning their timeliness. Aplt. Br. at 3. Specifically, he states: \u201c[A] claim of involuntary servitude trumps the time bar in question and jurisdictional denial of counsel and lack of subject matter jurisdiction claims must be heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He states that a COA is justified \u201cto address whether [his] subjection to involuntary servitude trumps the one year limitation period and/or whether the ... one year li[m]itation violates the 13th [Amendment's prohibition of involuntary servitude,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Mr. Prentice\u2019s argument lacks merit. The Supreme Court has held that dismissing a \u00a7 2255 motion as' time-barred is proper \u2014 without assessing the motion\u2019s merits. <em>Cf. Dodd v. United States, </em>545 U.S. 353, 359, 125 S.Ct. 2478, 162 L.Ed.2d 343 (2005) (recognizing that the time-bar for \u00a7 2255 motions creates \u201cthe potential for harsh results in some cases\u201d but declining \u201cto rewrite the statute that Congress has enacted\u201d). He has thus not raised a question over which reasonable jurists could debate.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">To the extent he seeks to raise a separate claim under the Thirteenth Amendment, or argue that such a claim would \u201ctrump\u201d any time bar under \u00a7 2255, we deny a COA because Mr. Prentice failed to raise this as a separate claim in district court. And to the extent Mr. Prentice challenges the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over his criminal case and sentence, his claim lacks merit. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 (providing that federal district courts have jurisdiction for cases involving federal crimes).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">III. DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">We deny Mr. Prentice\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss this matter. We also deny Mr. Prentice\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\">. Because Mr. Prentice is proceeding pro se, we construe his pleadings and arguments on appeal liberally. <em>See Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Pinson, </em>584 F.3d 972, 975 (10th Cir. 2009) (\"[W]e must construe [a pro se litigant\u2019s] arguments liberally; this rule of liberal construction stops, however, at the point at which we begin to serve as his advocate,\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b639-17\">. The motion was titled a \u201cPro Se Motion Asking [the District] Court to Adhere to its Obligation to Satisfy Itself of Art.
