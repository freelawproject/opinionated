See Fed, R. App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 84(J). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s November 5, 2015 order dismissing appellant\u2019s bankruptcy appeal be affirmed. Although the filing injunction relied on by the district court in this case does not apply to bankruptcy appeals, see U.S. ex rel. Yelverton v. Fed. Ins. Co., 831 F.3d 585, 589 (D.C. Cir. 2016), this court nonetheless affirms the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal on the merits, see Jones v. Bernanke, 557 F.3d 670, 676 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (\u201c[W]e may affirm a judgment on any ground the record supports\u201d). Appellant is barred by the doctrine of res judicata from avoiding the transfer of the Homeplace tract to appellees under either 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548 or \u00a7 522. By order filed August 6, 2015 in Yelverton v. Marm, No. 11-7063, this court dismissed the appeal of the district court\u2019s order affirming the dismissal of the adversary proceeding No. 10-bk-10004 as moot, without vacatur. See U.S. Bancorp. Mortg. v. Bonner Mall P\u2019ship, 513 U.S. 18, 29, 115 S.Ct. 386, 130 L.Ed.2d 233 (1994) (\u201cMootness by reason of settlement does not justify vacatur of a judgment under review.\u201d). Further, because the Homeplace tract is not property of the bankruptcy estate, appellant\u2019s claim of exemption is without effect. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(1); id. \u00a7 541(a)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-19\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. See Fed. R, App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
