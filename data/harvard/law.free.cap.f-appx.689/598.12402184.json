Tymkovich Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ABl\">Harold Eugene Bell seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. We deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-26\">In 1996, Bell was charged in federal court with several drug-related offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Shortly thereafter, the government filed an information alleging that Bell qualified for a sentence enhancement under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Following his conviction by a jury, the district court imposed life imprisonment, a sentence mandated under \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii) because Bell had three prior California felony convictions for drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In November 2014, California enacted Proposition 47, codified at Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 1170.18. Among other things, the new law \u201cpermits previously-convicted defendants to petition the court for a \u2018recall of sentence,\u2019 which, if granted ... effectively reclassif[ies] their qualifying felonies as misdemeanors.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>838 F.3d 968, 971 (9th Cir. 2016) (quoting \u00a7 1170.18(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">In 2016, after Bell successfully petitioned a California state court to reclassify his three prior felony convictions as misdemeanors under \u00a7 1170.18(k), he filed for habeas relief under \u00a7 2255, arguing that there were no longer any felony convictions to support the life sentence imposed under \u00a7 841. The district court denied Bell\u2019s motion, concluding that the change in state law did not alter the historical fact that Bell had three final state felony convictions at' the time he was sentenced, which mandates an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">To be entitled to a COA, Bell must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the required showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Although Bell could file a statutory claim in the district court under \u00a7 2255, he can obtain a COA only if he has made \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a <em>constitutional </em>right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (emphasis added). In other words, Bell could file a \u00a7 2255 motion in district court based on the argument that his sentence violates \u00a7 841, but he cannot appeal the denial of relief unless he makes a substantial showing of a constitutional violation. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Taylor, </em>454 F.3d 1075, 1079 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[N]o matter how clearly the \u00a7 2255 movant can show that the district court erred in denying a statutory claim in his habeas petition, he is not entitled to a COA to have his claim heard' on appeal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Try as he might to raise a constitutional violation, Bell\u2019s argument is a statutory one: \u201c[Wjhether or not a federal recidivist sentence enhancement based on a prior state conviction is undermined when the state conviction is retroactively reduced by subsequent state action.\u201d Def./Aplt.\u2019s Combined Request for COA and Opening Br. at 12. And his argument that his sentence violates his constitutional rights to Due Process and Equal Protection under <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 295, 303, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005), is unavailing. Setting aside whether the defendant had a constitutional right to resen-tencing, <em>Johnson </em>concerns the right to reopen a federal sentence where a defendant successfully attacks a state conviction in state court, i.e., the conviction is vacated. Here, Bell\u2019s convictions were neither attacked nor overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Because Bell has failed to demonstrate the violation of a constitutional right, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-28\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
