Kelly, Jr. Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Defendant-Appellant Jason Wayne Carey appeals from the sentence imposed after pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of explosives. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 842(i)(l), 844(a)(1). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we remand to the district court to vacate the judgment and resentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Mr. Carey was sentenced to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. 1 R. 42-44. The PSR recommended a guideline range of 37 to 46 months, based in part on Mr. Carey committing the offense \u201csubsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K1.3(a)(2); see 3 R. 3-4. The prior violent felony was pointing a weapon at another person in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1289.16. See 3 R. 4. But in United States v. Titties, 852 F.3d 1257, 1275 (10th Cir. 2017), we held that a conviction under this statute does not qualify as a crime of violence under the Armed Career Criminal Act. This definition resembles that found in the sentencing guidelines. The government concedes that this intervening decision controls here. Aplee. Br. at 4. Accordingly, we REMAND to the district court to vacate its judgment and resentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b660-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
