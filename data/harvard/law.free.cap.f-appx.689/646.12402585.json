Appellants argue that the district court abused its discretion by failing to address declarations filed with their reply brief and by relying on other district court fee awards as evidence of the prevailing market rate for IDEA fee litigation. Appellants contend, specifically, that the decisions cited by the district court lack any evidence of market rates in the Washington, D.C. area.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-21\">We reject both arguments. The district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to address two cursory declarations, which contain no mention of specific rates and were submitted for the first time with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 reply. Nor did the court err in relying on other fee decisions, three of which referred to the <em>Laffey </em>matrix, a schedule of market rates for complex federal litigation in Washington, D.C. <em>See Covington v. District of Columbia, </em>57 F.3d 1101, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (noting that, to demonstrate the prevailing market rate, plaintiffs may \u201cprovide ... evidence of recent fees awarded by the courts\u201d); <em>National Association of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense, </em>675 F.2d 1319, 1325 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (\u201c[D]ata about fee awards in other cases help to ensure comparable treatment of like cases.\u201d); <em>cf. Eley v. District of Columbia, </em>793 F.3d 97, 100-01 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (discussing <em>Laffey </em>matrices and explaining that such \u201cfee matrices [are] one type of evidence that \u2018provide[s] a useful starting point\u2019 in calculating the prevailing market rate\u201d (quoting <em>Covington, </em>57 F.3d at 1109)).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Pursuant to Rule 36 of this court, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Apr P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
