Holmes, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b1024-16\">Appellant Ark Valley Credit Union (\u201cAVCU\u201d) appeals the judgment entered against it and in favor of Appellee J. Michael Morris (\u201cTrustee\u201d) in an adversary proceeding in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy ease. The primary issue in this appeal is whether \u00a7 58-4214 of the Kansas Manufactured Home Act (\u201cKMHA\u201d) is the exclusive means for determining whether a mobile home is a fixture for purposes of the attachment of a security interest or whether a court may also look to Kansas common law to make that determination, as the district court and bankruptcy court did in this case. Exercising our jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), we affirm the judgment in favor of the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-18\">The parties are familiar with the facts and procedural background, so we will limit. our recitation of the background to that which is necessary for the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-19\">In the mid-1990s, Jeffrey Kent Gracy (\u201cDebtor\u201d) bought land in Caldwell, Kansas, and moved a manufactured home (also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>known as a mobile home) onto the property. Debtor and his wife lived in the home together until his wife passed away. Debt- or continued to live there after his wife\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-4\">In 2009, Debtor borrowed $21,000 on a home equity line of credit. To secure the loan, Debtor granted AVCU a mortgage on his Caldwell property. The mortgage did not note the presence of the manufactured home on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">A year later, Debtor obtained a second line of credit in the amount of $26,000. He used this money to build a detached garage on the property. Like the first mortgage, the second mortgage did not reference the manufactured home, but Debtor believed that both mortgages had granted a lien on the land, the manufactured home, and the detached garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">Debtor filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2013. He claimed the Caldwell property as his homestead and did not list the manufactured home as personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">The Trustee filed an adversary proceeding to avoid AVCU\u2019s alleged lien in the manufactured home as unperfected under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(a) because the lien was not noted on the home\u2019s certificate of title as required by state statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> AVCU asserted that it had not taken a lien in the home and therefore there was nothing for the Trustee to avoid. The bankruptcy court agreed with AVCU, concluding that no liens had attached to the mobile home because the mortgage did not sufficiently describe it. The Trustee appealed that decision to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-10\">On appeal, the district court vacated the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision, concluding that the mortgage\u2019s property description included all fixtures, which would include affixed mobile homes. The court therefore remanded for the bankruptcy court to consider whether the mobile home could be considered a fixture under Kansas common law. In doing- so, the district court rejected AVCU\u2019s contention that the KMHA was the exclusive means for determining whether a mobile home could be considered a fixture in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-11\">On remand, the bankruptcy court concluded that the mobile home was a fixture under Kansas common law and that it was subject to AVCU\u2019s mortgages. The bankruptcy court further concluded that because AVCU had not properly perfected its security interests in the mobile home, the trustee could avoid AVCU\u2019s mortgage liens and preserve them for the benefit of the estate. AVCU appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to the district court and that court affirmed. AVCU now appeals from the judgment entered in favor of the Trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">When a district court acts in its capacity as a bankruptcy appellate court, as the district court did in this ease, \u201cwe review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision independently.\u201d <em>Paul v. Iglehart (In re Paul), </em>534 F.3d 1303, 1310 (10th Cir. 2008). We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>view de novo the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusions and we review for clear error its factual findings. <em>Id, </em>Although \u201c[w]e do not defer to the district court\u2019s intermediate appellate analysis, ... we may look to it to inform our review of the' result reached by the bankruptcy court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">AVCU\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that compliance with the KMHA is the exclusive way to change the status of a manufactured home from personal property to a fixture. Under the KMHA, a mobile home is considered a fixture if it is permanently affixed to the real property and its title has been eliminated. <em>See </em>Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 58-4214. Because it is undisputed that Debtor did not eliminate the title to his mobile home, AVCU asserts that the home could not be considered a fixture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-7\">In support of its argument that \u00a7 58-4214 provides the sole means of converting a manufactured home from personal property to a fixture, AVCU relies on <em>Wachovia Bank, N.A. v. Morris (In re Thomas), </em>362 B.R. 478 (10th Cir. BAP 2007). In that decision, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) concluded that the \u201cKansas common law of fixtures\u201d could not \u201capply to manufactured homes in harmony with \u00a7 58-214.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87. The BAP explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1026-8\">The clarity of the process outlined in \u00a7 58-4214 plainly protects parties holding, or seeking to acquire, interests in manufactured homes. If the common law were also applicable to determine the fixture status of a manufactured home, that high degree of certainty would be ineffective absent a subsequent judicial determination that a given manufactured home had, or had not, become a fixture under the common law standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq5\"><em>Id. </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-12\">Although the BAP focused on the certainty of the process for determining whether a mobile home is a fixture under \u00a7 58-4214 versus the uncertainty of the process for making that same determination under the common law, the BAP did not undertake an analysis of the statutory language to determine whether the legislature intended \u00a7 58-4214 to provide the exclusive means for making the fixture determination. In contrast, the district court rejected AVCU\u2019s position that \u00a7 58-4214 provides the exclusive means for determining whether a mobile home is a fixture after analyzing the statutory language consistent with principles of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">In its appellate brief, AVCU argues that \u201c[t]he BAP decided that simplicity was paramount. And that should be the rule.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 11. AVCU further argues that \u201c[t]o adopt a rule that requires a complex determination when a simple one is available causes many problems for those that are simply trying to move through transactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And then AVCU asks the rhetorical question: \u201cIs it a stretch to assume that the Kansas Legislature intended the simple over the complex?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11-12. AVCU fails, however, to explain how the district court erred in its analysis of the statutory text. We are not persuaded by AVCU\u2019s argument that the simplicity of the process outlined in \u00a7 58-4214 demonstrates that the legislature intended for it to be the exclusive means to make the fixture determination. Instead, we agree with the district court\u2019s analysis of the statutory text, which led it to conclude that the Kansas legislature did not intend for \u00a7 58-4214 to exclude common law as a means for making the fixture determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The district court first noted that the Kansas Supreme Court has not ruled on this issue, so it proceeded to interpret \u00a7 58-4214 according to state rules of statutory construction, <em>see Finstuen v. Crutcher, </em>496 F.3d 1139, 1148 (10th Cir. 2007). The Kansas Supreme Court has indicated that \u201cstatutory interpretation begins with the language selected by the legislature.\u201d <em>Moser v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>289 Kan. 513, 213 P.3d 1061, 1064 (2009) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). The relevant statutory provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1027-4\">Whenever a manufactured home or mobile home is permanently affixed to real property, by placement upon a permanent foundation of a type not removable intact from such real property, the manufactured home or mobile home shall be considered for all purposes an improvement to real property, if the certificate of title which has been issued or is required to be issued for such manufactured home or mobile home pursuant to K.S.A. 58-4204, and amendments thereto, is eliminated pursuant to this section. If the certificate of title has been eliminated pursuant to this section, the ownership of the manufactured home or mobile home shall be an incident of ownership of the real property where it is located under governing real property law. If the certificate of title has been eliminated pursuant to this section, a separate security interest in the manufactured home or mobile home shall not exist, and the manufactured home or mobile home shall only be subject to a lien as part of the real property where it is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 584214(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">The district court began with the first sentence of the statutory provision, explaining that \u201cthe word \u2018whenever\u2019 indicates the timing or frequency of the creation of a fixture under the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Morris v. Ark Valley Credit, </em>536 B.R. 887, 894 (D. Kan. 2015). The district court next looked to the definition of \u201cwhenever,\u201d which means \u201cat any or every time that\u201d and the definition of \u201cshall,\u201d which \u201cindicates a mandatory conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Read in conjunction with the rest of the provision, the court concluded that this language means that \u201cat any time or every time that a manufactured home is permanently affixed to realty and the title is eliminated, it must be treated as a fix-, ture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But the court noted that \u201cwhenever\u201d is not exclusive language, and \u201cthe [legislature could have employed other simple combinations of words instead of \u2018whenever\u2019 to indicate exclusivity, such as \u2018only when\u2019 or \u2018only if.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court therefore concluded that \u201c[a] plain reading of K.S.A. \u00a7 58-4214 thus indicates that every time the conditions are met, the home is a fixture; it does <em>not </em>plainly read that a manufactured home can only become a fixture if the conditions are met.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">We agree with the district court that the statute\u2019s plain language \u201cdoes not exclude common law as a means of converting a manufactured home into a fixture; it mere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ly provides a set of conditions under which one can guarantee that a mobile home will be treated as a fixture.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>We therefore see no reversible error in the district court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 58-4214 of the KMHA does not exclude the application of common law to determine whether a manufactured home is a fixture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">AVCU appears to argue in the alternative that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that Debtor\u2019s manufactured home was a fixture under the common law test. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. at 17-18. \u201c[W]hether a piece of property is a fixture is a question of fact,\u201d <em>City of Wichita v. Eisenring, </em>269 Kan. 767, 7 P.3d 1248, 1259 (2000), and we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, <em>In re Paul, </em>534 F.3d at 1310.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">The factors for determining whether a manufactured home is personal property or a fixture are: \u201c(1) annexation to the realty; (2) adaptation to the use of that part of the realty with which it is attached; and (3) the intention of the party making the annexation.\u201d <em>Stalcup v, Detrich, </em>27 Kan.App.2d 880, 10 P.3d 3, 8 (2000). The bankruptcy court found that all of these factors were shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">AVCU argues solely that the manufactured home was not permanently affixed to the realty, which relates to the first factor. AVCU does not address the other two factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">With respect to the first factor, the bankruptcy court noted that the manufactured home was set on piers that are set on concrete slabs and that the home was anchored to the piers and slabs with straps but was not otherwise attached. Although the court recognized that it was plausible that the home could be removed from the ground, it also recognized that courts assess less importance to the annexation factor than they do to the other two factors. The court explained that \u201cwhen there is persuasive evidence that the property hasj been adapted to the land\u2019s use and that the annexor intended it to become part of the land, those latter proofs make up for a lesser degree of the permanence of the attachment.\u201d Aplt. App. at 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">The bankruptcy court found that the land at Caldwell was Debtor\u2019s homestead and that he placed his manufactured home on that land to inhabit as his homestead, which he has done for twenty years. The court noted that Debtor \u201csurrounded the home with brick skirting, built a porch and a back patio adjacent to it, and erected a large garage just by it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47. The court concluded that \u201c[ajdding these amenities and living in the home suggest [Debt- or\u2019s] efforts to adapt it to the use of the land as his homestead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also noted testimony from a realtor about the value that the manufactured home added to the land if the two were sold together, which also supported the court\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat the home has been successfully adapted to the use of the realty.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-13\">As for intent, the court concluded that it was clear that Debtor \u201cintended to make the property as a whole his homestead when he moved the manufactured home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>onto the realty and subsequently made further improvements to it while he continuously lived there over the next 20 years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48. And the court noted that AVCU \u201cpresented no evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also cited to Debtor\u2019s testimony'that he \u201cconsidered it his permanent home\u201d and that \u201che intended to encumber it along with his homestead real estate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">After considering all three factors, the bankruptcy court found that Debtor\u2019s manufactured home was a fixture. AVCU has failed to show that 'the bankruptcy court clearly erred in making this factual finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties' request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">. \"The so-called 'strong arm\u2019 powers of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544(a)(1) grant the trustee the status of a hypothetical lien creditor once the bankruptcy petition has been filed.\u201d <em>Morris v.
