Kelly, Jr., Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b648-24\">Defendant-Appellant Ricky Webster appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his motion to reduce his sentence made pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). United States v. Webster, No. 10-20101-02-CM, 2016 WL 4181294 (D. Kan. Aug. 8, 2016). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-25\">In July 2010, about a month before the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d) was enacted, Mr. Webster was charged with eight counts of drug and firearm-related offenses. 1 R. 27-32. Because he possessed over 50 grams of crack cocaine, he was subject to a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence under -21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii) (2006). Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), Mr. Webster pled guilty to Count One (conspiracy to manufacture and possess with the intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack) and to Count Six (possessing a firearm in furtherance of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>drug-trafficking crime). 1 R. 44. He also agreed to a sentence of 180 months of imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release. Id. at 50. Mr. Webster moved to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to conform with the PSA\u2019s more lenient penalties for offenses involving more than 50 grams of crack cocaine. See generally Dorsey v. United States, 567 U.S. 260, 265-70, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion because Mr. Webster\u2019s sentence was not \u201cbased on\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines and dismissed the motion. Webster, 2016 WL 4181294, at *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We review the district court\u2019s resolution of Mr. Webster\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for an abuse of discretion, but in so doing review the district court\u2019s interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) de novo. United States v. Sharkey, 543 F.3d 1236, 1238 (10th Cir. 2008), A district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant was originally \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In United States v. Graham, we held that we were bound by Justice Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence in Freeman v. United States, 564 U.S. 522, 534-44, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011). 704 F.3d 1275, 1277-78 (10th Cir. 2013). We therefore concluded that when a plea agreement \u201cdoes not use or employ a Guideline sentencing range, the defendant is not entitled to the benefit of the amendment.\u201d Id. at 1278 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Mr. Webster\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence. The plea agreement does not reference the guidelines other than to expressly disclaim their use in imposing Mr. Webster\u2019s sentence. 1 R. 51. Mr. Webster\u2019s sentence is therefore not based on the guidelines, and he is not entitled to a sentence reduction. See Freeman, 564 U.S. at 539,131 S.Ct. 2685 (Soto-mayor, J. concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Ams\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, it may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed, R. App. P. 32.1 and ioth Cir. R, 32.1,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
