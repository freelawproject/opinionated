Lucero Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">The district court dismissed Keith Finn\u2019s lawsuit against Great Plains Lending, LLC, based on tribal sovereign immunity. Finn appeals, contending that the district court should have granted his request for limited discovery into matters relevant to immunity. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">Great Plains is a limited liability company formed by the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians, a federally recognized tribe. Great Plains offers short-term loans at high interest rates. After the company made numerous automated calls to Finn\u2019s cell phone, he sued under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-18\">Great Plains filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), asserting that it was entitled to tribal sovereign immunity. Finn argued that sovereign immunity should not protect Great Plains because the company is actually controlled by and exists for the benefit of a non-tribal entity, Think Finance, Inc. He requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>limited jurisdictional discovery to substantiate this claim. The district court dismissed based on tribal sovereign immunity and denied Finn\u2019s request for jurisdictional discovery. Finn appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">\u201cAs a matter of federal law, an Indian tribe is subject to suit only where Congress has authorized the suit or the tribe has waived its immunity.\u201d Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Mfg. Techs., Inc., 523 U.S. 751, 754, 118 S.Ct. 1700, 140 L.Ed.2d 981 (1998). \u201cTribal immunity extends to subdivisions of a tribe, and even bars suits arising from a tribe\u2019s commercial activities.\u201d Native Am. Distrib. v. Seneca-Cayuga Tobacco Co., 546 F.3d 1288, 1292 (10th Cir. 2008); see also Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Cmty., \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2024, 2036-39, 188 L.Ed.2d 1071 (2014) (declining to limit tribal immunity for off-reservation commercial activities). Tribal immunity is a jurisdictional issue. Bonnet v. Harvest (U.S.) Holdings, Inc., 741 F.3d 1155, 1158 (10th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Finn appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request for limited jurisdictional discovery. \u201c[I]mmunity entitles a [sovereign] not only to protection from liability, but also from suit, including the burden of discovery, as a party, within the suit.\u201d Univ. of Tex. at Austin v. Vratil, 96 F.3d 1337, 1340 (10th Cir. 1996). Nevertheless, we have held that \u201c[w]hen ,.. there is a factual question regarding a ... sovereign\u2019s entitlement to immunity, and thus a factual question regarding a district court\u2019s jurisdiction, the district court must give the plaintiff ample opportunity to secure and present evidence relevant to the existence of jurisdiction.\u201d Hansen v. PT Bank Negara Indon. (Persero), TBK, 601 F.3d 1059, 1063-64 (10th Cir. 2010) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">As with other types of discovery, district courts possess discretion to permit jurisdictional discovery.. See Sizova v. Nat\u2019l Inst. of Standards &amp; Tech., 282 F.3d 1320, 1326 (10th Cir. 2002). We review the denial of such discovery for abuse of discretion. Breakthrough Mgmt. Grp., Inc. v. Chukchansi Gold Casino &amp; Resort, 629 F.3d 1173, 1189 (10th Cir. 2010). \u201c[A] refusal to grant [jurisdictional] discovery constitutes an abuse of discretion if the denial results in prejudice to a litigant. Prejudice is present where pertinent facts bearing on the question of jurisdiction are controverted or where a more satisfactory showing of the facts is necessary.\u201d Sizova, 282 F.3d at 1326 (citations and quotations omitted); see also Breakthrough Mgmt. Grp., 629 F.3d at 1189. It is Finn\u2019s burden, as the party seeking discovery, to demonstrate his entitlement. to jurisdictional discovery and the resulting prejudice from its denial. Breakthrough Mgmt. Grp., 629 F.3d at 1189 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">To determine whether a tribal entity is entitled to immunity, we consider the following factors: (1) the method of the entity\u2019s creation; (2) the entity\u2019s purpose; (3) the entity\u2019s \u201cstructure, ownership, and management, including the amount of control the Tribe has over the entit[y]\u201d; (4) \u201cwhether the Tribe intended for [the entity] to have tribal sovereign immunity\u201d; (5) the financial relationship between the Tribe and the entity; and (6) \u201cwhether the purposes of tribal sovereign immunity are served by granting [the entity] immunity.\u201d Id. at 1191. Finn argues that evidence produced from limited discovery could support his allegations regarding Think Finance\u2019s effective control of Great Plains, affecting the analysis of factors 2, 3, 5, and 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">We conclude that a more satisfactory showing regarding the actual workings of Great Plains and its financial relationship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>with the Tribe is necessary for a thorough consideration of the Breakthrough factors. Finn\u2019s allegations are specific and plausible. They are also supported by several pieces of circumstantial evidence, including website screenshots listing Great Plains as a Think Finance product, media reports, and judicial pleadings in a different case against Think Finance. In that case, Pennsylvania\u2019s Attorney General alleged that Think Finance contracted with three tribe-created payday lending companies, including Great Plains, to evade Pennsylvania\u2019s cap on interest rates and that the tribes received less than 5% of the profits generated. Additionally,, unlike in Breakthrough, 629 F.3d at 1189-90, in which we affirmed the denial of'jurisdictional discovery, Finn specifies which documents he would have sought in discovery and describes their relevance to the immunity analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Further, a recent California Supreme Court decision illustrates the potential importance of jurisdictional discovery in sovereign immunity cases involving tribe-created payday loan companies. In People ex rel. Owen v. Miami Nation Enters., 211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837, 386 P.3d 357 (2016), the California Supreme Court adopted the first five Breakthrough factors, and applying that test, denied immunity to two tribe-created payday loan companies. Id., 211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837, 386 P.3d at 371-73, 375. The court \u201c[took] into account both formal and functional considerations \u2014 in other words, not only the legal or organizational relationship between the tribe and the entity, but also the practical operation of the entity in relation to the tribe.\u201d Id., 211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837, 386 P.3d at 365. In this regard, the court noted that \u201cthe purpose factor considers the extent to which the entity actually promotes tribal self-governance; the control factor examines the degree to which the tribe actually, not just nominally, directs the entity\u2019s activities; and the financial relationship factor considers the degree to which the entity\u2019s liability could impact the tribe\u2019s revenue.\u201d Id., 211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837, 386 P.3d at 371. As the court recognized, \u201corganizational arrangements on paper do not necessarily illuminate how businesses operate in practice.\u201d Id., 211 Cal.Rptr.3d 837, 386 P.3d at 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The district court in this case largely relied on such formal arrangements as set forth in Great Plains\u2019 organizational paperwork to hold that tribal sovereign immunity applied. The court recognized that a contract detailing the profit ratio between Think Finance and Great Plains could be material to its decision, but it denied Finn the opportunity to obtain any such document. Thus, practically speaking, Finn has no way to secure evidence to verify \u2014 or disprove \u2014 his belief about Great Plains\u2019 lack of tribal control or benefit without engaging in the jurisdictional discovery that the district court disallowed. See Ignatiev v. United States, 238 F.3d 464, 467 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (holding that the district court erred in denying limited jurisdictional discovery because although plaintiff suspected the existence of policies relevant to sovereign immunity, he had no way to know if such policies actually existed absent discovery).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Under these circumstances, we conclude that there is a \u201cneed for further factual development\u201d regarding Great Plains\u2019 actual operation. Sizova, 282 F.3d at 1328. Of course, \u201cdiscovery should be ordered circumspectly and only to verify allegations of specific facts crucial to an immunity determination,\u201d and a' discovery , order should be- \u201cnarrowly tailored ... to the precise jurisdictional fact question presented.\u201d Hansen, 601 F.3d at 1064 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P, 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
