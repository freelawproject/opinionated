Moritz Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b628-22\">Victoria Wright filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, challenging (1) a state court conviction for obstructing a peace officer and (2) a corresponding restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-23\">After Wright filed her petition, a magistrate judge ordered Wright to file an amended petition or risk dismissal. According to the magistrate judge, Wright\u2019s petition was deficient, in part because she failed to allege facts demonstrating that she was in custody with respect to the conviction she was challenging. <em>See Anderson-Bey v. Zavaras, </em>641 F.3d 445, 453 (10th Cir. 2011) (\u201cTo obtain relief under \u00a7 2254, the applicant must be \u2018in custody\u2019 under the challenged judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-24\">Although Wright filed a response to the magistrate judge\u2019s order, she didn\u2019t file an amended petition by the court\u2019s deadline. So the district court dismissed the case without prejudice, citing Wright\u2019s \u201cfail[ure] to prosecute and file an amended application as directed.\u201d R. 72. In doing so, the district court also noted its agreement with the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that the petition didn\u2019t include sufficient factual allegations to demonstrate that Wright satisfied the in-custody requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wright now seeks a COA to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal, Because Wright fails to demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling,\u201d we deny Wright\u2019s request for a COA and dismiss the appeal. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain habeas claims only if the petitioner is \u201c \u2018in custody\u2019 under the challenged judgment.\u201d <em>Anderson-Bey, </em>641 F.3d at 453; see \u00a7 2254(a). And habeas petitioners must allege facts that show they meet this in-custody requirement. <em>See United States v. Bustillos, </em>31 F.3d 931, 933 (10th Cir. 1994) (\u201cThe party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court must demonstrate that the case is within the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">It\u2019s clear that Wright was incarcerated when she filed her habeas petition. But the record shows that she was sentenced to time served for her obstruction conviction. Accordingly, that sentence necessarily expired long before Wright filed her petition. Therefore, as the magistrate judge pointed out, there\u2019s no indication that Wright\u2019s current incarceration \u201cis related to\u201d the conviction she now seeks to challenge. R. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">In fact, in her response to the magistrate judge\u2019s order, Wright admitted that she wasn\u2019t currently incarcerated for the conviction she challenges in her petition. Instead, she pointed out that petitioners may meet the in-custody requirement by showing they\u2019re subject to \u201crestraints not shared by the public generally that significantly confine and restrain freedom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54; <em>see Mays v. Dinwiddie, </em>580 F.3d 1136, 1139 (10th Cir. 2009). But Wright failed to identify any specific \u201crestraints\u201d that she might be subject to as a result of her challenged conviction. And none are apparent from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">In short, we find nothing in Wright\u2019s petition, the record, or Wright\u2019s brief to suggest that she was in custody for the obstruction conviction when she filed her habeas petition. Therefore, we deny Wright\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this case. As a final matter, we grant Wright\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pau-peris.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b628-17\"> This order isn't binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judi-cata, and collateral estoppel. But it may be cited for its persuasive value. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b629-8\">. We liberally construe Wright\u2019s pro se filings. But it is not our role to act as her advocate. <em>James </em>v. <em>Wadas, </em>724 F.3d 1312, 1315 (10th Cir. 2013).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
