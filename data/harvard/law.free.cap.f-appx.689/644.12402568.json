Petitioner, a group representing suppliers of parts for airplane repairs, challenges and seeks to enjoin certain Guidance revisions that require parts to have specified documentation before they can be installed on European airplanes. Petitioners also challenge FAA Notice 8900.360 (May 2, 2016), which announced that the FAA and EASA had agreed temporarily to postpone the compliance deadline for that requirement. Petitioner\u2019s objection rests on the proposition that European Union regulations under some circumstances permit the use of parts lacking the documentation' required under the revised Maintenance Annex Guidance. But the Guidance revisions describe EASA\u2019s view of the documentation required to comply with European law, so an injunction against FAA enforcement would provide petitioner\u2019s members no relief. See <em>Spectrum Five LLC v. Federal Commc\u2019ns Comm\u2019n, </em>758 F.3d 254, 260-261 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (holding plaintiff lacked standing to challenge agency order because redress of the alleged harm depended on action by \u201can international organization that is not regulated by our government and therefore not bound by this Court or the [agency]\u201d and because plaintiff failed to show that a favorable ruling would create a \u201csignificant increase in the likelihood\u201d that its injury would be redressed). Accordingly petitioner lacks standing and we lack subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Pursuant to Rule 36 of this Court, this disposition will not be published. The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing <em>en banc. </em>See Fed. R. Apf. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
