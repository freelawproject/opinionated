Bacharach, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b646-21\">Mr. Michael Davis Bryant is a federal prisoner who sought habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court dismissed for lack of statutory jurisdiction, reasoning that Mr. Bryant had failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>show that the remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective. Mr. Bryant appeals and seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We affirm and grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The Unavailability of Relief Under \u00a7 2241</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Mr. Bryant moved to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 in the Eastern District of Washington, and the district court denied the motion. Mr. Bryant then unsuccessfully asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to allow the filing of a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Unable to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, Mr. Bryant initiated the present case, filing a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the District of Colorado. The district court dismissed for lack of statutory jurisdiction, concluding that Mr. Bryant had failed to demonstrate that the remedy in \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Mr. Bryant argues that his sentence should not have been enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act. The sole issue is whether this argument could be entertained through a habeas action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court answered \u201cno,\u201d reasoning that the sole remedy in this case was a motion to vacate the sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The typical remedy for a challenge to the validity of a federal sentence is vacatur under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir. 1996). If this statutory remedy is otherwise available, it would authorize vacatur of the sentence if it had been unconstitutional, unlawful, or imposed without authority. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a). But vacatur of the sentence entails restrictions on timeliness and the filing of second or successive motions. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)-(f), (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">An alternative remedy is sometimes available through a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. But \u00a7 2241 cannot ordinarily be used to address the validity of a sentence because of the availability of a remedy under \u00a7 2255. <em>Johnson v. Taylor, </em>347 F.2d 365, 366 (10th Cir. 1965) (per curiam). An exception exists, allowing a prisoner to challenge the validity of a sentence under \u00a7 2241 when the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Prost v. Anderson, </em>636 F.3d 578, 584 (10th Cir. 2011) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">To determine whether the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d the court focuses on \u201cprocess\u201d rather than \u201csubstance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The test is whether the petitioner had an <em>opportunity </em>to present and argue his claim under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>If the claim could have been presented in the initial \u00a7 2255 motion, the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is neither inadequate nor ineffective. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">Mr. Bryant makes three arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\">1. He cannot file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-14\">2. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals erred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-15\">3. He did not realize the need to make certain claims until the Ninth Circuit issued its decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-16\">We reject each argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-17\">First, Mr. Bryant argues that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or ineffective because the Ninth Circuit would not permit him to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. But his inability to file a second \u00a7 2255 petition \u201cdoes not establish that the remedy in \u00a7 2255 is inadequate.\u201d <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1179 (10th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-18\">Second, he argues that the Ninth Circuit erred on the merits. But, even if true, a \u00a7 2255 remedy is not inadequate or ineffective \u201csimply because a court errs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>rejecting a good argument.\u201d <em>Prost v. Anderson, </em>636 F.3d 578, 590 (10th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Finally, Mr. Bryant argues that he did not realize the need to present certain arguments until he saw the Ninth Circuit\u2019s opinion. But even if Mr, Bryant had not realized the need to make an argument, he could have made it. Thus, the remedy in \u00a7 2255 was not inadequate or ineffective. <em>Id. </em>at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">$ \u215c $</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The district court correctly concluded that Mr. Bryant could not obtain relief under \u00a7 2241. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Leave to Proceed in Forma Pauperis</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Mr. Bryant also seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis. The Court grants this request.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-22\"><em> </em>We conclude that oral argument would not materially help us to decide this appeal. As a result, we are deciding the appeal based on the briefs. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P, 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-23\">This order and judgment does not constitute binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. But the order and judgment may be cited for .its persuasive value under Fed. R. App. P. 32.1(a) and 10th Cir. R. 32.1(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
