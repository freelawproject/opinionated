Matheson, Jr., Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b923-21\">Defendant-Appellant Andre Twitty appeals from his conviction in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>States District Court for the District of Colorado for two counts of mailing threatening communications, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c). He argues the district court abused its discretion in admitting two sets of exhibits at trial, requiring reversal. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">\n<em>A.1999 Conviction and Post-Conviction Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">In 1999, Mr. Twitty was convicted in a Georgia federal district court for making bomb threats and threatening federal law enforcement. Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) David Leta prosecuted Mr. Twitty. Judge J. Owen Forrester presided over the trial and sentencing. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Mr. Twitty filed two habeas petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which Judge For-rester denied. The Eleventh Circuit denied Mr. Twitty\u2019s appeal of one of the denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">From 2005 to 2008, Mr. Twitty filed seven habeas petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and one Rule 60(b)(4) motion to vacate the judgment in federal district court in Connecticut, where he was serving his sentence at a federal penitentiary. Judge Peter Dorsey denied each petition and motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">\n<em>B.Threatening Letters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">In 2011, Mr. Twitty, while incarcerated at the federal prison in Florence, Colorado, mailed a letter addressed to Northern District of Georgia U.S. Attorney Sally Yates and another to the U.S. district court in Connecticut. The letters contained threats directed to AUSA Leta, Judge Forrester, Judge Dorsey, the Eleventh Circuit, the Second Circuit, and the U.S. Attorney for Georgia. He later admitted to writing and mailing each of those letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">As an example, one letter described how Mr. Twitty \u201cstarted having these \u2018DREAMS\u2019\u201d of killing AUSA Leta and Judge Forrester. <em>See </em>SROA at 10. Another letter mentioned ricin \u2014 a deadly poison\u2014 and specific weapons and ammunition. <em>See, e.g., </em>SROA at 5 (mentioning a Colt .357 and Remington .700). The letters also mentioned specific court orders. <em>See </em>SROA at 9 (mentioning an Eleventh Circuit \u201cfraudulent\u201d order).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-14\">\n<em>C.First Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">The letters led to his prosecution and conviction for two counts of mailing threatening communications, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 876(c), in federal district court in Colorado. On appeal, we affirmed his conviction. <em>United States v. Twitty, </em>591 Fed.Appx. 676, 684 (10th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-16\">The Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded for further consideration in light of its decision in <em>Elonis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015). <em>Twitty v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 90, 193 L.Ed.2d 7 (2015) (Mem.). <em>Elonis </em>clarified that the mental state for a \u00a7 876(c) offense requires that a defendant \u201ctransmit\u00ed] a communication for the purpose of issuing a threat or with knowledge that the communication will be viewed as a threat.\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2012. On remand, we reversed Mr. Twitty\u2019s conviction and remanded to the district court because the district court did not instruct the jury on the requisite mental state of \u00a7 876(c) at the first trial. <em>United States v. Twitty, </em>641 Fed.Appx. 801, 805, 808 (10th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>D. <em>Second Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Following our reversal, the Government filed a second superseding indictment charging Mr. Twitty with the two counts of violating \u00a7 876(c). The indictment included a charge that he sent the letters \u201cfor the purpose of issuing a threat, and with knowledge that the communication[s] would be viewed as a threat,\u201d as required by <em>Elonis. </em>ROA, Yol. 1 at 71, 73. At trial, the Government introduced Mr. Twitty\u2019s threatening letters, SROA, Exs. 1-2, and copies of the court orders denying his direct appeal and habeas petitions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Twitty\u2019s counsel objected to the orders\u2019 admission on relevancy and hearsay grounds. The court overruled the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The Government also introduced photos of the weapons and ammunition described in Mr. Twitty\u2019s letters. SROA, Exs. 18-26. Mr. Twitty\u2019s counsel objected based on relevancy and Federal Rule of Evidence 403.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court overruled those objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">After being instructed on the proper mental state under <em>Elonis, </em>the jury found Mr. Twitty guilty of both counts of mailing threatening communications. The court sentenced him to 60 months in prison on the first count and 78 months on the second count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">On appeal, Mr. Twitty argues the district court erred in admitting (1) the court orders and (2) the weapons and ammunition photos. We deny both of Mr. Twitty\u2019s challenges and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">We review both of Mr. Twitty\u2019s challenges to a district court\u2019s admission of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ford, </em>613 F.3d 1263, 1267 (10th Cir. 2010). \u201cUnder the abuse of discretion standard, the decision of a trial court will not be disturbed unless the appellate court has a definite and firm conviction that the lower court made a clear error of judgment or exceeded the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances.\u201d <em>In re Nat. Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litig., </em>845 F.3d 1010, 1017 (10th Cir. 2017) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">1. Admission of Court Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">Mr. Twitty argues the court erred in admitting the court orders because they were (1) irrelevant, (2) hearsay, and (3) unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">At trial, Mr. Twitty\u2019s counsel objected to the orders\u2019 admission on only the first two bases \u2014 relevancy and hearsay'\u2014 and raised no objection that the orders were unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Mr. Twitty failed to make an unfair prejudice objection in district court and has not argued plain error on appeal, we do not address that issue. <em>See United States v. De Vaughn, </em>694 F.3d 1141, 1159 (10th Cir. 2012) (declining to consider an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>argument not raised in district court where the defendant fails to show on appeal that he meets the plain-error standard). We thus only address his preserved arguments based on relevancy and hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">a. <em>Relevancy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the redacted court orders over Mr. Twitty\u2019s relevancy objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Evidence is relevant if \u201cit has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d and \u201cthe fact is of consequence in determining the action.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 401. \u201cIrrelevant evidence is not admissible.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">At trial, the Government used the orders to help explain why Mr. Twitty made the threats in his letters. This evidence helped to prove his intent to issue a threat or his knowledge that such communication would be viewed as a threat \u2014 as required to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 876(c). <em>Elonis, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Mr. Twitty does not challenge that the orders were relevant to provide context to his letters. Mr. Twitty concedes that each order ruled against him and thus \u201cis relevant to his motive for issuing a threat.... \u201d Aplt. Br. at 11; <em>see also id. </em>at 15. But, he argues, \u201cthe other language in the orders\u201d \u2014 which he argues portrayed him \u201cas contentious, litigious and unreasonable\u201d and were \u201cdisparaging\u201d towards him \u2014 \u201cis mostly irrelevant to whether the motive was more or less probable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 15. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">The language contained in the orders\u2014 not just the courts\u2019 rulings \u2014 was relevant to Mr. Twitty\u2019s motive to send the threatening letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">First, to the extent the orders criticized Mr. Twitty, the orders\u2019 language would make it more probable that Mr. Twitty had a motive \u2014 beyond just the rulings \u2014 to threaten the orders\u2019 authors.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-11\">Second, Mr. Twitty\u2019s own letters show the language in the orders \u2014 and not just the fact that he lost in each order \u2014 motivated him. For example, in one letter he referenced a passage in an Eleventh Circuit opinion and stated: \u201cIs that right? That is not what there [sic] own [expletive omitted] law states.\u201d SROA at 9. His references to particular language in the court orders tend to show the orders\u2019 language motivated him to threaten the recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-12\">Third, Mr. Twitty argues the orders are not relevant because some of them were \u201cissued years before the letters were sent.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 15. But his letters\u2019 reference to the orders makes them relevant. For example, the letter mentioning a \u201cRule 60(b)(4) motion,\u201d SROA at 4, shows the 2008 order denying his motion motivated him to write the letter. <em>See id. </em>at 45, 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-13\">The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in admitting the orders over Mr. Twitty\u2019s relevancy objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-14\">b. <em>Hearsay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in admitting the court orders over Mr. Twitty\u2019s hearsay objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">Hearsay is \u201ca statement that ... the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and ... a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">On appeal, Mr. Twitty asserts, but fails to explain, why the orders contained hearsay statements. The orders were not hearsay because they were not offered to prove the truth of the statements in the orders. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>Rather, they were offered to show their effect on the listener (Mr. Twitty), to establish his intent to send threatening communications, and to provide context for Mr. Twitty\u2019s letters. Such evidence is not hearsay. <em>See United States v. Smalls, </em>605 F.3d 765, 785 n.18 (10th Cir. 2010) (explaining statements were not hearsay when offered to establish their effect on the listener and to provide context for a defendant\u2019s statements, rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted).</p>\n<p id=\"aet-dedup-0\">* * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the court orders over Mr. Twitty\u2019s relevancy and hearsay objections. We thus affirm Mr. Twitty\u2019s conviction on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">2. Admission of Weapon and Ammunition Photos</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Mr. Twitty challenges the admission of photos depicting weapons and ammunition. He had objected that the photos were (1) irrelevant and (2) not admissible under Rule 403. On appeal, Mr, Twitty clarifies that his Rule 403 objections were based on the photos\u2019 potential for unfair prejudice and cumulativeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">First, we disagree that the photos were irrelevant. They gave context to Mr. Twitty\u2019s letters referencing the same weapons and ammunition depicted in the photos and also made his intent to threaten more likely because the photos showed that Mr. Twitty\u2019s letter referred to real, rather than fictitious, firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">Second, the photos were not unfairly prejudicial and did not, as Mr. Twitty argues, \u201cserve[ ] only to frighten the jury.\u201d Aplee. Br. at 17. The photos helped to prove the letters\u2019 purpose of communicating a threat. Although the photos were not included in Mr. Twitty\u2019s letters, they showed the potential danger of the weapons referenced in the letter. The photos\u2019 probative value was not \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d by any risk of unfair prejudice\u2014 as required for exclusion under Rule 403. <em>See United States v. Cerno, </em>529 F.3d 926, 935 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cUnder Rule 403\u2019s balancing test, it is not enough that the risk of unfair prejudice be greater than the probative value of the evidence; the danger of that prejudice must <em>substantially </em>outweigh th\u00e9 evidence\u2019s probative value.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">Third, the photos were not cumulative, as Mr. Twitty contends, because the Government introduced only one photo for each type of weapon or ammunition referenced in the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Fourth, Mr. Twitty asserts the court erred by admitting the photos without conducting its own balancing analysis on the record of the photos\u2019 potential for unfair prejudice. But \u201c[w]e have consistently upheld implicit Rule 403 determinations when the determinations are supported by the record\u201d because we can conduct a <em>\u201cde novo </em>balancing where the trial court failed to make explicit findings, to support a Rule 403 ruling.\u201d <em>United States v. Lazcano-Villalobos, </em>175 F.3d 838, 846-47 (10th Cir. 1999). The court\u2019s failure to make specific 403 findings thus does not warrant reversal because our own de novo balancing review supports the photos\u2019 admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the photos over Mr. Twitty\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the court orders and photos of weapons and ammunition referenced in Mr. Twitty\u2019s letters. We therefore deny his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>appeal and affirm his conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.
