Matheson, Jr. Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Joel Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez, proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his request for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we agree the district court lacked authority to reduce Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s sentence, but vacate the district court\u2019s order denying the motion and remand for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. We also deny Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s request to proceed <em>informa pau-peris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">In January 2012, a jury convicted Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez of Distribution of More than 50 Grams of Actual Methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(viii) (Count 1) and Distribution of a Mixture and Substance' Containing a Detectable Amount of Cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) (Count 2). The district court sentenced him to 120 months in prison for each count \u2014 the mandatory statutory minimum required under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii) \u2014 to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">In May 2012, Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him a \u201csafety-valve\u201d adjustment that would have allowed a sentence below the statutory minimum. We rejected his challenge and affirmed his sentence. <em>United States v. Chavira-Nunez, </em>496 Fed.Appx. 885, 888 (10th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-16\">In September 2013, he filed a motion in district court to set aside, vacate, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The court denied the motion and we denied a certificate of appealability. <em>United States v. Chavira-Nunez, </em>563 Fed.Appx. 651, 652 (10th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-17\">Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez then filed a motion in district court to reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that: (1) the Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory, rather than mandatory; (2) the court could reduce his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); (3) his status as a de-portable alien restricts him from partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>ipation in prison programs that could reduce his sentence, favoring resentencing; and (4) that a proposed bill in the U.S. House of Representatives, H.R. 3382,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would reduce mandatory minimum sentences. The court denied the motion, concluding that none of Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s arguments support a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez timely filed the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez raises two issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">First, he attempts to argue that his trial counsel\u2019s assistance was ineffective under the Sixth Amendment. He had already raised this argument in his September 2013 \u00a7 2255 motion, <em>Chavira-Nunez, </em>563 Fed.Appx. at 652, which was denied, and he does not qualify for a second \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To the extent he makes his ineffective assistance of counsel argument to support his request for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-8\">Second, he requests a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c) based on Amendment 782. We also lack jurisdiction to consider this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">\u201cWe review a denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Lucero, </em>713 F.3d 1024, 1026 (10th Cir. 2013) (citing <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1238 (10th Cir. 2008)). The scope of a district court\u2019s authority to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), however, is a question of law we review de novo. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">B. <em>Legal Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-14\">A district court is authorized to modify a defendant\u2019s sentence only when Congress has expressly granted the court jurisdiction to do so, <em>United States v. Gay, </em>771 F.3d 681, 686 (10th Cir. 2014), which Congress did in \u00a7 3582(c), <em>United States v. Baker, </em>769 F.3d 1196, 1198 (10th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-15\">Section 3582(c) permits a district court to modify a sentence in three circumstances: (1) on motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons if special circumstances exist; (2) when expressly permitted by statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35; or (3) when the United States Sentencing Commission has lowered the Sentencing Guideline range. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>United States v. Henriquez-Ser</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number><em>rano, </em>327 Fed.Appx. 766, 768 (10th Cir. 2009) (unpublished).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">\u201cTo be eligible for a sentence reduction under the third circumstance, \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the applicable Guidelines range must have been lowered by an amendment to the Guidelines listed in \u00a7 lB1.10(d) of the Guidelines Manual.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>655 Fed.Appx. 714, 716 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A)). If an amendment applies, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment \u201cafter considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable,\u201d so long as the \u201creduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>Lucero, </em>713 F.3d at 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">C. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">1. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez argues for the first time on appeal that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to recommend that Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez enter a plea deal rather than go to trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because his ineffective challenge is not one of the three \u00a7 3582(c) circumstances, <em>Henriquez-Serrano, </em>327 Fed.Appx. at 768, we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">Our case law establishes that we have no jurisdiction under \u00a7 3582(c) to review an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 542-43 (10th Cir. 1997) (stating that \u201c[w]e have no jurisdiction under section 3582(c)\u201d to consider defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel\u2019s arguments);. <em>United States v. Carrillo-Perez, </em>670 Fed.Appx. 658, 659 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished) (refusing to consider defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel argument because \u201ca defendant cannot use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) appeal to attack his original judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A8c\">Although a \u00a7 3582 motion is a continuation of a prior criminal proceeding, the relief it offers is limited to the narrow sentencing issues prescribed in the statute itself. <em>United States v. Trujeque, </em>100 F.3d 869, 870 (10th Cir. 1996). \u201c[I]t cannot be used to create a new vehicle for a collateral attack on a conviction,\u201d such as an ineffective assistance of counsel challenge. <em>United States v. Verners, </em>136 Fed.Appx. 142, 145 (10th Cir. 2005) (unpublished) (citing <em>Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 542-43); <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315, 1327 n.13 (10th Cir. 2004) (\u201cGenerally, we only consider ineffective assistance counsel claims' on collateral review.\u201d). We thus lack jurisdiction to consider Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">2. Sentence Reduction</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez contends the district court erred by denying his motion for a sentence reduction. He argues that his sentence should have been reduced under Amendment 782, which retroactively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>\u201creduce[d] the base offense levels assigned to drug quantities in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, effectively lowering the Guidelines minimum sentences for drug offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Izenberg, </em>645 Fed.Appx. 614, 617 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished). We disagree with Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">A statutory minimum sentence generally precludes a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Lucero, </em>713 F.3d at 1027. A sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201cis not authorized and is not consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s policy statement if an applicable amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n.l(A) (2011)) (alterations and ellipses omitted). \u201cThus, in the situation where a defendant\u2019s sentence is cabined by a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, a district court lacks jurisdiction to grant the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Tubens, </em>644 Fed.Appx. 861, 862 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s sentence was based on the statutory mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.lO\u2019s policy statement therefore does not authorize a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As explained above, Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez was convicted of violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(viii), and the district court sentenced him to the 120-month mandatory minimum required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(vni). ROA Vol. 3 at 547 (\u201c[Cjongress has established a minimum sentence, so, there\u2019s no sense in my following the guidelines when the [Cjongress of the United States has proscribed a given sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">As this court said recently, \u201c[tjhat statutory minimum was not affected by Amendment 782 and, thus, the Amendment does not have the effect of lowering [the defendant\u2019s] sentencing range.\u201d <em>Tubens, </em>644 Fed.Appx. at 862. Because the statutory minimum controlled Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s sentence, \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii), no Guidelines amendment could lower his sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The district court properly concluded it lacked authority to reduce Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c). But rather than deny his motion on the merits, the court should have dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Graham, </em>704 F.3d 1275, 1279 (10th Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Laster, </em>659 Fed.Appx. 468, 473 (10th Cir. 2016) (unpublished). We vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s motion' and remand with instructions to enter an order dismissing-for lack of jurisdiction. We also deny Mr. Chavira-Nu\u00f1ez\u2019s request to proceed <em>ifp.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.
