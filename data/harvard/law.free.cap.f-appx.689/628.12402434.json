Olson appeals pro se from a district court order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of disability insurance benefits (DIB) and supplemental security income (SSI). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b661-17\">Olson has worked as a truck driver and <em>\u201ca </em>union field organizer/membership solicitor.\u201d R., Vol. I at 203. He has a high school education.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-18\">In 2010, at the age of 45, he applied for DIB and SSI, claiming disability due to high blood pressure, an enlarged heart valve, a bilateral \u201c[l]ung condition,\u201d migraines, and \u201c[vjision problems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506. In 2011, Olson added he had fainted and fallen off of a deck, fracturing two cervical vertebrae, but not requiring surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-19\">In April 2012, an administrative law judge (ALJ) held a hearing and found Olson not disabled. She relied heavily on the testimony of an independent neurologist, Gerald Winkler, M.D., who opined Olson\u2019s neck \u201csituation [wa]s stable,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 147, and he retained \u201cthe strength to carry out normal activities,\u201d but he should avoid \u201cexpos[ure] ... to further [neck] trauma,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 148. The Appeals Council vacated the decision, however, and remanded for consideration of Olson\u2019s \u201ccardiac impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-20\">On remand, the ALJ obtained testimony from cardiologist David West, M.D.; pul-monologist William Houser, M.D.; Olson; and a vocational expert. Dr. West described Olson\u2019s cardiac health as \u201conly minimally compromised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121. Dr. Houser opined that Olson has \u201ca reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>in breathing capacity\u201d caused by an enlarged heart, <em>id. </em>at 129, as well as sleep apnea, but he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a pulmonary disease,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 131. Olson testified he has \u201cconsistent[ly] [passed out] over the last [several] years\u201d and must use a wheelchair to prevent falls, <em>id. </em>at 87, and he needs a portable oxygen unit \u201c[b]ecause [his] oxygen level gets low,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 86. He claimed difficulty reading and \u201cseeing anything from center above,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 99, because of an \u201ceye problem ... in the back of [his] head,\u201d caused by his \u201cbroke[n] ... neck,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 102. A vocational expert (VE) testified a hypothetical claimant with Olson\u2019s age, education, and work history could perform several jobs in the national economy if limited to semi-skilled and light exertional work and certain other restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The ALJ again found Olson not disabled. The ALJ identified Olson\u2019s severe impairments as a cervical fracture, degenerative disc disease, obesity, bilateral hearing loss, and right ankle degenerative changes/sprain or strain. Despite these impairments, the ALJ found he had a residual functional capacity (RFC) compatible with light work, with restrictions related to reaching; ambulation; exposure to loud noises, extreme temperatures and dangerous machinery; and interactions with others. In doing so, the ALJ relied on the Physical RFC Assessment completed by a state agency consulting physician, Kyle Timmerman, M.D., who noted Olson \u201chad absolutely no neurological sequelae\u201d from his cervical fracture, <em>id. </em>at 967, and was being treated conservatively \u201cw/an Aspen collar,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The ALJ found the opinions and observations of Olson\u2019s own neurologist, Timothy Stepp, M.D., were \u201cnot inconsistent\u201d with the above RFC for light work. <em>Id. </em>at 61. In particular, the ALJ noted Dr. Stepp had observed Olson exhibit \u201c5/5 motor strength and nonspastic gait\u201d just five months after the fracture. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ did not, however, accept Dr. Stepp\u2019s conclusion expressed on a \u201cWork Form\u201d a year after the accident that Olson \u201cshould be considered permanently disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1265. The ALJ noted Dr. Stepp\u2019s conclusion did not \u201cassert any specific functional limitations, and it otherwise [was] conclusory to the ultimate issue of disability, which is a legal decision reserved to the Commissioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">The ALJ rejected a restrictive RFC because Olson had \u201cpresented] a false picture of himself\u2019 and \u201cundermine[d] his allegations of being disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56. In particular, the ALJ noted Olson had owned and managed a bar for nearly six months after his alleged disability-onset date. Further, the ALJ observed Olson had renewed his commercial driver\u2019s license in January 2013, with a motorcycle endorsement and no restrictions. Additionally, the ALJ recounted how an investigator from the Disability Investigation Unit (DIU) had contacted four of Olson\u2019s neighbors and they denied ever seeing Olson (1) \u201cbeing chauffeured by\u201d anyone, <em>id. </em>at 1816; or (2) using a wheelchair or oxygen. Consequently, the ALJ concluded Olson\u2019s claimed limitations could not be fully accepted in fashioning his RFC unless they were \u201cdirectly shown and supported by objective medical findings on a 12-month durational basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The ALJ then examined the medical records and testimonies from both hearings and concluded while Olson could not perform either of his prior jobs, he could perform other jobs in the national economy as identified by the VE: bench assembler; mail clerk; office helper; document preparer; circuit board assembler; and final assembler. The Appeals Council denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Olson, through a new attorney, then petitioned for review in federal court. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>district court affirmed, prompting this pro se appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">I.Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"ajj-dedup-0\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s ruling in a social security case and \u201cindependently determine whether the ALJ\u2019s decision is free from legal error and supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Wall v. Astrue, </em>561 F.3d 1048, 1052 (10th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Astrue, </em>602 F.3d 1136, 1140 (10th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Olson is proceeding pro se on appeal, we construe his briefs liberally, but we do not serve as his advocate. <em>Yang v. Archuleta, </em>525 F.3d 925, 927 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">II.Treating-Physician Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Olson argues the ALJ erred by discounting Dr. Stepp\u2019s opinions and relying on Dr. Timmerman\u2019s and Dr. Winkle\u2019s opinions. We disagree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">A treating physician\u2019s opinion must be given controlling weight. if it \u201cwell supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is consistent with the other substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Allman v. Colvin, </em>813 F.3d 1326, 1331 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the ALJ decides, however, that \u201cthe treating physician\u2019s opinion is not entitled to controlling weight, the ALJ must then consider whether the opinion should be rejected altogether or assigned some lesser weight.\u201d <em>Pisciotta v. Astrue, </em>500 F.3d 1074, 1077 (10th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">Here, the ALJ rejected Dr. Stepp\u2019s opinion only insofar as he opined Olson was disabled and unable to work. Although a treating physician may offer his \u201cjudgments about the nature and severity of [the claimant\u2019s] impairment(s),\u201d a treating physician may not render opinions that are essentially \u201cadministrative findings ... dispositive of a case,\u201d such as whether the claimant is disabled. SSR 96-5p, 1996 WL 374183, at *2. As the ALJ noted, Dr. Stepp\u2019s disability opinion was not accompar nied by any discussion of the functional limitations caused by Olson\u2019s symptoms, diagnoses, or prognoses. This omission was particularly significant given Dr. Stepp\u2019s earlier medical opinion that Olson \u201c[was] continuing to progress following his complex cervical spine injury\u201d and \u201cha[d] completely weaned himself from his cervical collar.\u201d R., Vol. I at 1115. We conclude the ALJ did not err in his treatment of Dr. Stepp\u2019s opinion concerning disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-14\">III.Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b663-15\">Olson argues the ALJ erred by finding his claimed limitations were not fully credible absent corroboration. \u201cCredibility determinations are peculiarly the province of the finder of fact, and we will not upset such determinations when supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Newbold v. Colvin, </em>718 F.3d 1257, 1267 (10th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). In finding Olson not fully credible, the ALJ cited multiple pieces of evidence suggesting Olson had exaggerated his symptoms and the resulting limitations. The ALJ\u2019s credibility findings were \u201cclosely and affirmatively linked to substantial evidence and not just a conclusion in the guise of findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the ALJ did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">IV. Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Olson attempts to assert multiple arguments not raised in the district court. For instance, he argues (1) the medical opinions of Dr. Timmerman and Dr. Winkle are not entitled to any weight because the doctors \u201chad malpractice judgement[s]\u201d against them, Aplt. Opening Br. at 2; (2) the ALJ was prejudiced because she tried to indict Olson and his father in 1992 when she was a federal prosecutor; (3) the ALJ \u201cordered a murder investigation ... by the Metro Squad,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 4; (4) the DIU investigation violated his \u201c4th, 5th, 8th and 14th Amendment! ]\u201d rights, <em>id.-, </em>(5) the ALJ required an unnecessary eye exam performed by one of her college classmates; and (6) his lawyers provided ineffective assistance \u201c[tjhroughout this case\u201d by \u201csaying the [DIU] investigation could not be put in the case file as it was heresay [sic],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">But if a \u201ctheory ,.. wasn\u2019t raised [in] the district court, we usually hold it forfeited.\u201d <em>Fish v. Kobach, </em>840 F.3d 710, 729 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). While we may consider a forfeited theory \u201cif failing to do so would entrench a plainly erroneous result,\u201d the theory\u2019s proponent must \u201cargue for plain error and its application on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Because Olson has made no plain-error argument on appeal, the arguments he failed to raise in the district court are waived. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b661-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir, R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32,1,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\">. Olson indicates \u2018\u2018[t]his case is about back pay,\u201d as he has been awarded benefits going forward based on recent neck and parathyroid surgeries. Reply Br, at 13,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\">. To the extent Olson complains the ALJ failed to take the \"advice of .,. all kind [sic] of other treating doctor [sic],\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 2, he does not mention how any one of those doctors' opinions bears on his limitations. This court \"routinely ... decline[s] to consider arguments that are ... inadequately presented[] in an appellant\u2019s opening brief,\u201d <em>Bronson v. Swensen, </em>500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2007), and we do so here as to Olson's unspecified treating physicians.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\">. To the extent Olson argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel in the district court, Olson had no Sixth Amendment right to counsel as a civil litigant. <em>See Johnson v. Johnson, </em>466 F.3d 1213, 1217 (10th Cir. 2006), Therefore, such a claim is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
