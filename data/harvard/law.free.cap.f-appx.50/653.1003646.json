Flateau appeals the district court\u2019s order awarding summary judgment to Appellees, South Carolina Commission for the Blind (\u201cSCCB\u201d), and Joseph Ray, on Flateau\u2019s claims of gender discrimination and retaliation brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-2000e-17 (2000). Flateau claims that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was improper because she produced sufficient evidence of her prima facie case as to both claims. <em>See Ross v. Communications Satellite Corp., </em>759 F.2d 355, 365 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-18\">Flateau first claims that the district court erred in its conclusion that she failed to establish her prima facie case of gender discrimination. To establish her claim, Flateau was required to demonstrate that she was denied a pay increase because of her gender. <em>See Autry v. North Carolina Dep\u2019t of Human Resources, </em>820 F.2d 1384, 1386 (4th Cir.1987). The record discloses that Flateau was denied a pay increase by the interim commissioner of SCCB, Michael Thompson, who evaluated the request in accord with state procedures regarding assumption of additional duties. Furthermore, the record also discloses that, during the same time frame, a male employee at SCCB was denied a pay increase for assumption of additional duties, and a female employee was granted a pay increase for additional duties. This contradicts Flateau\u2019s assertion of gender bias within the organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Flateau also points to Joseph Ray and Clinton Grier as two male employees who received supplemental salary increases for assumption of additional responsibilities. However, there is no indication that Thompson had anything to do with the salary increases. First, the record discloses that the board of directors for SCCB, not Thompson, approved Ray\u2019s salary increase. Second, Grier\u2019s salary increase was approved initially by a preceding SCCB commissioner; Thompson\u2019s involvement was limited to approving a continuation of the salary on the basis that Grier was going to continue in the position for the indefinite future. These facts fail to establish an inference of unlawful discrimination. <em>See Radue v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., 219 </em>F.3d 612, 617-18 (7th Cir.2000) (holding that plaintiff must demonstrate that the same supervisor was involved in comparable situations to demonstrate disparate treatment of similarly situated employees); <em>Stanback v. Best Diversified Products, Inc., </em>180 F.3d 903, 910 (8th Cir.1999) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Flateau next claims that she suffered retaliation as a result of filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). Specifically, she claims that a letter of reprimand written by Ray has interfered with her ability to receive promotions and pursue other state employment opportunities. It is well established that not every action taken by an employer adverse to the aggrieved party amounts to an adverse employment action within the scope of Title VII. <em>See Von Gunten v. Maryland, </em>243 F.3d 858, 866-67 (4th Cir.2001); <em>Page v. Bolger, </em>645 F.2d 227, 233 (4th Cir.1981) (en banc). In <em>Von Gunten, </em>under similar circumstances, we recognized that \u201ca retaliatory downgrade of a performance evaluation <em>could </em>effect a term, condition, or benefit of employment,\u201d but held that when \u201cdowngrade\u201d was not used \u201cas a basis to detrimentally alter the terms and conditions of the recipient\u2019s employment\u201d it did not constitute an \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d 243 F.3d at 867. Flateau conceded at deposition that she had been seeking employment without success for some sixteen months prior to the reprimand, and further, that following the reprimand, she had received several interviews. Thus, Flateau\u2019s reprimand like Von Guten\u2019s \u201cdowngrade\u201d does not constitute \u201can adverse employment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Because we find that Flateau failed to establish a prima facie case of either gender discrimination or retaliation, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
