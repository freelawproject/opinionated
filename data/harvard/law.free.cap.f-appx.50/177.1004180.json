Prince reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during the execution of a search warrant on his residence and vehicle and has appealed that order. Prince asserts the affidavit supporting the search warrants was insufficient to establish probable cause. Finding no such error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-23\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress evidence, we review the factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard and review the legal conclusions de novo. <em>United States v. Kitchens, </em>114 F.3d 29, 31 (4th Cir.1997). Thus, we review de novo the legal question of whether a search warrant and its supporting affidavit are legally sufficient, while according substantial deference to a neutral and detached judge\u2019s finding of probable cause. <em>United States v. Oloyede, </em>982 F.2d 133, 138 (4th Cir.1992). We must simply ensure that the judge had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>218, 246, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). According substantial deference to the issuing magistrate judge, we conclude that the affidavit established sufficient probable cause to search Prince\u2019s home and vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s denial of Prince\u2019s motion to suppress. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
