The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Vega to 135 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release, and ordered forfeiture of any interest Vega had in two vehicles. On appeal, counsel filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court erred in denying a minimal- or minor-participant reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Vega filed a pro se supplemental brief arguing that he was not informed of his right under the Vienna Convention to contact his consul; that the Attorney General changed methamphetamine from a Schedule III to a Schedule II controlled substance, placing it in conflict with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812, and his sentence exceeds the statutory maximum for a Schedule III drug; and that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-19\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying Vega a role-in-the-offense reduction. Vega acknowledged knowing that there were drugs in one of the vehicles he and his coconspirators were driving, and that the three were engaged in a drug transaction; further, he stayed with the vehicle containing the drugs, while his codefendants met with the confidential informant shortly before the arrest resulting in the charges underlying Vega\u2019s convictions. <em>See United States v. Ortiz, </em>236 F.3d 420, 422 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-20\">We also reject Vega\u2019s remaining arguments. His guilty plea forecloses his Vienna Convention argument, <em>see United States v. Guzman-Landeros, </em>207 F.3d 1034, 1035 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam); Congress has given the Attorney General authority to transfer drugs from one schedule to another regardless of the drug\u2019s initial placement in section 812, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 811(a)(1), 812(c); and not only did the indictment allege drug quantity, but Vega stipulated to the drug quantity and resulting base offense level that was used to calculate his sentence, <em>see United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995). Having reviewed the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ord independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b354-16\">.
