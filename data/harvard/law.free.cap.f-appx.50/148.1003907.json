Michael Dwight BROWN, Defendant-Appellant.</parties>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b174-16\">No. 02-4321.</docketnumber>\n<court data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b174-17\">United States Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b174-18\">Submitted Oct. 24, 2002.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b174-19\">Decided Nov. 13, 2002.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-21\">Kenneth W. Ravenell, Schulman, Treem, Kaminkow, Gilden &amp; Ravenell, P.A., Baltimore, Maryland, for Appellant. Thomas M. DiBiagio, United States Attorney, Philip S. Jackson, Assistant United States Attorney, Baltimore, Maryland, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b174-22\">Before WILLIAMS, MICHAEL, and GREGORY, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b174-23\">Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b174-24\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b174-25\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b174-26\">Michael Dwight Brown appeals his conviction and 360 month sentence for distributing 500 or more grams of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-27\">First, Brown argues that the district court erred in dismissing his motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence. We review a district court\u2019s legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>conclusions on a suppression motion de novo and the court\u2019s underlying factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). Brown\u2019s claim is meritless. The search warrant application established probable cause to search Brown\u2019s residence. See <em>United States v. Williams, </em>974 F.2d 480, 481-82 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Corral, </em>970 F.2d 719, 728 (10th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Anderson, </em>851 F.2d 727, 729 (4th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Second, Brown argues that the jury instructions issued by the district court were prejudicial. We review Brown\u2019s challenge to the jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Whittington, </em>26 F.3d 456, 462 (4th Cir.1994). This claim is meritless as well. The jury instructions were an accurate reflection of the applicable law and did not prejudice Brown\u2019s defense. See <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 32 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Cobb, </em>905 F.2d 784, 788-89 (4th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
