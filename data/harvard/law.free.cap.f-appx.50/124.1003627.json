An appeal may not be taken to this court from a final order denying relief under this section unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petition can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) 'that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Butler has not made the requisite showing. <em>Butler v. Young, </em>No. CA-02-56 (E.D.Va. July 16, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Butler\u2019s motions for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and to strike Appellee\u2019s response to these motions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
