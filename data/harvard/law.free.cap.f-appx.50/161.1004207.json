At sentencing on February 25, 2002, the district court enhanced his sentence, imposing a four-level increase to his offense level under <em>United States Sentencing Guideline Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (2000) based on the court\u2019s finding that Henry possessed the firearm in connection with the distribution of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-19\">Henry argues that the Government did not sufficiently prove a connection between the guns and the drug offense to warrant increasing his offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). However, this court has repeatedly recognized the close link between firearms and drug distribution. <em>See United States v. Ward, </em>171 F.3d 188, 195 (4th Cir.1999). In this case, the firearm was in Henry\u2019s hand, Henry admitted selling marijuana only hours before his apprehension out of the motel where he was found, and the room in which he was arrested contained a cell phone, pager, large amounts of cash, and a small amount of marijuana. The evidence produced at sentencing established by a preponderance that Henry possessed the handgun in connection with the felony offense of drug possession with intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 195 (recognizing that a Rolex watch, a wad of $1055, and a hand gun were all indicia of drug dealing). Accordingly, we affirm Henry\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-20\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
