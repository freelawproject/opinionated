An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a state court unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). In this case, the dismissal was based on the expiration of the state sentence McDowell sought to challenge, a procedural dismissal. We have reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>record and conclude that McDowell has not made the requisite showing, and thus we deny a certificate of appealability.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the dismissal is not considered procedural, we would still deny McDowell a certificate of appealability because he has not demonstrated \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of [his] constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. at 1604; <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny in forma pauperis status, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\"> Nor has McDowell stated a viable claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), as the district court held, based upon the use of the prior state conviction to enhance his federal sentence. While the district court inadvertently relied upon the wrong conviction (a 1989 drug conviction) in its analysis of the timeliness of McDowell's claim under \u00a7 2255, \u2018analysis based upon the proper conviction (possession of a firearm) yields the same result because the Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari for McDowell's possession of firearm conviction on February, 22, 2000. Therefore, McDowell\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus dated March 4, 2002, is untimely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Moreover, McDowell may not raise a claim relative to the federal sentence he currently is serving under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), because he may do so only if he has no adequate or effective remedy under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id.; In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 332-33 (4th Cir.2000). The fact that McDowell's challenge is untimely under \u00a7 2255 does not render his remedy under \u00a7 2255 inadequate and ineffective. <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d at 333; <em>In re Vial, </em>115 F.3d 1192, 1194 n. 5 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
