We have reviewed the record and conclude based on the reasons stated by the district court and the magistrate judge that Ply-male has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Plymale v. Markle, </em>No. CA-02-2-CVB (N.D.W.Va. Aug. 20, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-20\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
