Gibson appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security disability and supplemental security income benefits. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-23\">We must uphold the district court\u2019s disability determination if it is supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>Hays v. Sullivan, </em>907 F.2d 1453, 1456 (4th Cir.1990). Contrary to Gibson\u2019s argument, the ALJ properly credited the opinions of non-examining physicians over that of his treating physician in this case, as the latter\u2019s opinion is unsupported by the clinical evidence and is inconsistent with other substantial evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(d)(2), 416.967(d)(2) (2000); <em>Craig v. Chafer, </em>76 F.3d 585, 590 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Cir.1996). Moreover, while we agree with the district court that Gibson\u2019s new evidence would not have affected the ALJ\u2019s decision, inasmuch as it lacked objective support, we note that because the evidence did not relate to the period preceding the ALJ\u2019s decision, Gibson is not entitled to have the evidence considered. <em>See Wilkins v. Secretary of Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>953 F.2d 93, 96 (4th Cir. 1991). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Gibson v. Barnhart, </em>No. CA-01-101-1 (W.D.Va. Apr. 25, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
