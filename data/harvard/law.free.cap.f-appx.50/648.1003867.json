We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Willis v. Town of Trenton, </em>Nos. CA-96-6-4; CA-99-116-4; CA-01-13 \u2014 4; CA 01-133-4; CA-01-159-4 (E.D.N.C. Apr. 5, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"AKL\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
