We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">In criminal cases, the defendant is accorded ten days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 196 (4th Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s final judgment was entered on the docket on January 11, 1991. Watkins\u2019 notice of appeal was filed on June 12, 2002. Because Watkins failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
