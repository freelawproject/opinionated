A party seeking a writ bears the burden of proving that it has no other means of attaining the relief desired, <em>Mallard v. U.S. Dist Court for the Southern Dist. of Iowa, </em>490 U.S. 296, 309, 109 S.Ct. 1814, 104 L.Ed.2d 318 (1989), and that the right to issuance of the writ is \u201cclear and indisputable,\u201d <em>Allied Chemical Corp. v. Daiflon, Inc., </em>449 U.S. 33, 35, 101 S.Ct. 188, 66 L.Ed.2d 193 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-17\">MBTA asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-18\">The record of the proceedings in this court demonstrate (a) that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>judge has not been open to being educated on the law pertaining to this case and the facts giving rise to it by counsel for <em>both </em>parties and (b) that the trial judge is unmistakably biased in favor of the government and against MBTA. Despite two favorable decisions by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, MBTA has lost <em>every </em>substantive motion and ruling made by the trial judge in this case. Whatever position MBTA advances is either ignored or ruled against....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The trial court denied the motion to disqualify because the basis of MBTA\u2019s motion was its disagreement with the trial court\u2019s \u201clegal decisions, not its conduct.\u201d The arguments presented by MBTA are not sufficient to trigger this court\u2019s review by mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">MBTA\u2019s petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
