The district court sentenced Gil-Becerra to 12 months imprisonment to be followed by 1 year of supervised release. His counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing for reversal that the guilty plea was involuntary because Gil-Becerra was led to believe by his counsel that he would be sentenced to time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-22\">We conclude that the district court did not plainly err in accepting Gil-Becerra\u2019s guilty plea because he confirmed at his plea hearing that he realized, despite counsel\u2019s prediction, that he could be sentenced to up to 2 years imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Granados, </em>168 F.3d 343, 345 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam). Having found no nonfrivolous issues following our independent review of the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-23\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-24\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b826-20\">.
