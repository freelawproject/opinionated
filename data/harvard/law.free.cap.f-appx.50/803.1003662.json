On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief arguing that the district court should have granted Beltran-Bueno\u2019s motion for a downward departure because he agreed to be voluntarily deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The district court\u2019s comments at sentencing indicate that its decision not to depart was purely discretionary, and therefore the decision is unreviewable on appeal. <em>See United States v. Field, </em>110 F.3d 587, 591-92 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Moreover, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-25\">.
