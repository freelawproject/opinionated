For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s orders in No. 02-7117 and dismiss the appeal in No. 02-7408.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-24\">In No. 02-7117, Sadler challenges the denial of his motions requesting appointment of counsel, a bond hearing, and the dismissal of the supervised release violation charge. However, the record indicates there was sufficient probable cause for the district court to find Sadler violated his supervised release, to issue a warrant for his arrest, to have him detained pending a hearing on those charges. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3606 (2000). Further, because the district court had not yet scheduled a hearing, Sadler\u2019s request for appointment of counsel was premature. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-25\">In No. 02-7408, Sadler seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his \u00a7 2255 motion filed subsequent to his arrest for violating the terms of his supervised release. We have reviewed the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>ord and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Sadler has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See United States v. Sadler, </em>Nos. CR-95-134; CA-02-334-3-V (W.D.N.C. July 10, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">No. <em>02-7117 </em>\u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">No. <em>02-7408 </em>\u2014 DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
