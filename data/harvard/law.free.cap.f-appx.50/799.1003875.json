In his March 1998 application and later documents, Walker alleged disability since July 1997 from hypertension, chest pain, an ulcer, migraines, a hearing loss, diabetes, and problems with his shoulder, thumb, sinuses, knees, and back. After a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) found that Walker could perform his past relevant work as a security guard as he described the job requirements and as the job is performed in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-25\">We reject Walker\u2019s challenge to the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, as the ALJ listed the factors from <em>Polaski v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1320,1321-22 (8th Cir.1984), and then gave multiple valid reasons for finding not entirely credible Walker\u2019s statements as to the impact of his impairments on his ability to work. <em>See Lowe v. Apfel, </em>226 F.3d 969, 972 (8th Cir.2000) (if adequately explained and supported, credibility findings are for ALJ to make; ALJ is not required to discuss methodically each <em>Polaski </em>factor, as long as he acknowledges and examines them).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-26\">Walker also challenges the ALJ\u2019s residual-functional-capacity (RFC) findings, contending he cannot do a good deal of walking and standing, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567(b) (2002) (defining light work), or perform light work on a daily basis. We disagree: none of Walker\u2019s doctors gave him any restrictions during the relevant period, a nurse practitioner\u2019s opinion as to his RFC on \u201cbad\u201d days appeared to be based primarily on Walker\u2019s reports, and the ALJ\u2019s RFC findings were more generous to Walker than those of the Social Security Administration reviewing physicians. <em>See Pearsall v. Massanari, </em>274 F.3d 1211, 1217-18 (8th Cir.2001) (it is ALJ\u2019s responsibility to determine RFC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>based on medical records, observations of treating physicians and others, and claimant\u2019s description of his limitations; ALJ must first evaluate claimant\u2019s credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">As to Walker\u2019s remaining arguments, the ALJ adequately weighed the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 disability determination, <em>see Morrison v. Apfel, </em>146 F.3d 625, 628 (8th Cir.1998), and properly considered the combined effects of Walker\u2019s impairments, <em>see Hajek v. Shalala, </em>30 F.3d 89, 92 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-23\">. The Honorable John F. Forster, Jr., United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
