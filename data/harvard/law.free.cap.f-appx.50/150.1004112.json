Liver-man, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s order denying Liverman\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Liverman claims the indictment pursuant to \u00a7 922(g) violated his rights under the Commerce Clause. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. As the district court correctly concluded, Liverman\u2019s claim is foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134 (4th Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Wells, </em>98 F.3d 808 (4th Cir.1996). It is well established that a panel of this court cannot overrule the decision of another panel. <em>United States v. Najjar, </em>300 F.3d 466, 486 n. 8 (4th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-15\"> Although Liverman pled guilty, he reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
