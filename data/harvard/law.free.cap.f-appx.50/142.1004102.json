We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-19\">In civil cases against a nonfederal party, a litigant must file a notice of appeal within thirty days of the district court\u2019s entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1). The appeal period is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 267, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-20\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on May 13, 2002. Phelps\u2019 notice of appeal was due thirty days later, by June 12, 2002. Phelps\u2019 notice of appeal was signed, filed, and entered on June 13, 2002, one day after the expiration of her thirty day appeals period. Because Phelps failed to file a timely notice of appeal, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
