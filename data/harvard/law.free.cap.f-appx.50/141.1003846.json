We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-23\">State Farm moved for summary judgment and the Pools did not respond. The district court found, as a matter of law and upon the facts presented by State Farm, that the Pools had not complied with the policy requirements and that compliance is a condition precedent to bringing suit against the insurer. <em>See Fineberg v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., </em>113 N.C.App. 545, 438 S.E.2d 754, 755 (N.C.App.1994). Failure to comply with conditions precedent \u201cbars recovery as well as the right to bring suit under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that State Farm was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the facts presented in the motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), (e); <em>Custer v. Pan American Life Insurance Co., </em>12 F.3d 410, 416 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-24\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>tions are adequately presented in the material before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
