Robinson petitions for a writ of mandamus, alleging undue delay in the adjudication of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition. He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act, and vacation of his conviction and sentence. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the district court recently dismissed Robinson\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Moreover, to the extent Robinson takes issue with the denial of relief in his \u00a7 2254 petition, the district court\u2019s order may be challenged on appeal, so mandamus relief is not available. <em>See In re United Steelworkers, </em>595 F.2d 958, 960 (4th Cir.1979). Accordingly, although we grant Robinson\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
