On appeal Ellis raises one issue: whether the district court improperly found that the State Defendants were protected from her Title VII suit by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-25\">As noted by the district court, the Eleventh Amendment does bar private suits against unconsenting states unless Congress validly abrogates a state\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Alden v. Maine, </em>527 U.S. 706, 755-57, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999). However, the Supreme Court has held that in enacting Title VII, Congress properly abrogated the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity for such suits. <em>See Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, </em>427 U.S. 445, 456-57, 96 S.Ct. 2666, 49 L.Ed.2d 614 (1976) (holding that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 abrogates the states\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity); <em>see also Alden, </em>527 U.S. at 756, 119 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>S.Ct. 2240 (relying on Fitzpatrick). Thus, the district court erred by granting the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss on this ground. Accordingly, we vacate and remand this case to the district court to conduct proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
