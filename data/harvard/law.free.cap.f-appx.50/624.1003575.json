We dismiss the appeal of the former for lack of jurisdiction, because the notice of appeal was not timely filed, and affirm the latter order.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-23\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)). The district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint was entered on the docket on June 10, 2002, and the notice of appeal was filed July 22, 2002. Because Allmond failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal as to the June 10 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-24\">Regarding Allmond\u2019s appeal from the denial of his motion to remand, we find that Allmond\u2019s motion, filed after his suit was dismissed, was clearly untimely. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-25\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
