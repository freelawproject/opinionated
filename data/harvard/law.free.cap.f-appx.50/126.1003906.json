Davis appeals the district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release imposed pursuant to a conviction for possession of a firearm by a controlled substance abuser. Davis\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. On Davis\u2019s behalf, counsel contends that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Davis to twelve months of incarceration for his violations of the terms of supervised release. Davis was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">We have reviewed the claims and find no abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). In addition, we have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
