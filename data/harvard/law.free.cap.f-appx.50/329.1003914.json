Pozo waived his right to an evidentiary hearing and stipulated to violating conditions of his supervised release. Thereafter, the court revoked Pozo\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 7 months imprisonment and 2 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-23\">On appeal, Pozo argues the district court violated the Ex Post Facto Clause by imposing a revocation sentence that included both a term of imprisonment and a term of supervised release, because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h), which authorizes supervised release upon revocation of supervised release, was not in effect at the time Pozo\u2019s original offense was committed. This argument is foreclosed, however, by <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 702, 713, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000) (although \u00a7 3583(h) does not apply retroactively to offenses committed before September 13, 1994, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) already allows district courts to impose additional term of supervised release following reimprisonment; as \u00a7 3583(h) does not apply retroactively, ex post facto question does not arise). We note that the total of the terms of imprisonment and supervised release imposed upon revocation of Pozo\u2019s supervised release (31 months) does not exceed his original 60-month supervised-release term. <em>See United States v. St. John, </em>92 F.3d 761, 766 (8th Cir.1996) (maximum period of time defendant\u2019s freedom can be restrained upon revocation of supervised release is capped by original supervised-release term).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-24\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-20\">. The Honorable Nanette K. Laughrey, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
