Harris seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and denying relief on her motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). An appeal may not be taken in a proceeding under \u00a7 2255 unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion on the merits, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the appellant can make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Harris has not made the requisite showing. <em>See United States v. Hams, </em>Nos. CR-00-234; CR-00-235; CR-00-236; CA-01-800-1 (M.D.N.C. filed May 2, 2002; entered May 3, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
