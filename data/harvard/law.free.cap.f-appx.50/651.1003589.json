Boraders received a 10 month prison term. Boraders\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but asserts the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>district court erred by refusing to grant Boraders a two-point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) (2000). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction to the offense level for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>289 F.3d 254, 261 (4th Cir.2002). Because Boraders committed an identical state offense within three weeks of the time she entered her plea agreement, and claimed she was innocent at sentencing, we find the district court did not err in denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Even if the district court had committed error in not granting a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Borader\u2019s sentence is within the recommended guidelines range had the district court granted the reduction, and thus she was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Borader\u2019s conviction and sentence. As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and conclude that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
