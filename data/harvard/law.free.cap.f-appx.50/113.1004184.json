Johnson, Jr., appeals from the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the United States on Johnson\u2019s claim for refund of the 100% penalty assessed against him under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6672 (2000), and the United States\u2019 counterclaim for the remainder of the penalty, for the third and fourth quarters of 1994 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>and the first quarter of 1995. We have reviewed the record, including the district court\u2019s opinion, as well as the parties\u2019 briefs and find no reversible error. The evidence before the district court established that Johnson \u201cwillfully\u201d failed to pay over the payroll taxes at issue, within the meaning of \u00a7 6672. <em>See Plett v. United States, </em>185 F.3d 216 (4th Cir.1999). To the extent that Johnson challenges the government\u2019s alleged attempts to double-collect the unpaid taxes at issue, the district court\u2019s opinion clearly states that \u201cno double recovery ... shall be permitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>No. CA-98-3050-S (D.Md. Jan. 29, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
