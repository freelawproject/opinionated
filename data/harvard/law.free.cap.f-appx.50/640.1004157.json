To be entitled to a certificate of appealability, Grate must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). When a district court dismisses solely on procedural grounds, the petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate both (1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right,\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). Upon examination of Grate\u2019s petition, we cannot conclude that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether the district court correctly concluded the petition was untimely. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability, deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
