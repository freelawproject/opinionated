The sentence of the court below is erroneous, for the reason that the indictment only charges the defendant with murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-8\">Murder is divided in two degrees by chapter 197 of Laws of 1862. By s\u00e9ction 4 of this chapter, murder in the first degree is punishable with death, and by section 7 of the same chapter, murder in the second degree is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for any term not less than ten years. By this chapter, \u00a7 6, murder in the first degree is defined to he, \u201cFirst, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>when perpetrated from a premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, or of any human being ; Second, when perpetrated by any act imminently dangerous to others, and evincing a depraved mind regardless of human life, although without any premeditated design to effect the death of any particular individual; Third, when perpetrated in committing the crime of arson in the first degree. Such killing, unless it be murder in the first degree, or manslaughter, or excusable or justifiable homicide as hereinafter provided, or when perpetrated without any design to effect death by a person engaged in the commission of any felony, shall be murder in the second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-5\">The indictment does not charge the killing to have been \u201c perpetrated from a premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, or of any human being,\u201d nor \u201cby any act imminently dangerous to others, and evincing a depraved mind regardless of human life, although without any premeditated design to effect the death of any particular individual, nor in committing the .crime of arson in the first degree.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-6\">The indictment does not charge the defendant with murder in the second degree. For \u201c such killing, unless it be murder in the first degree or manslaughter, or excusable or justifiable homicide, as hereinafter provided, or when perpetrated without any design to effect death by a person engaged in the commission of any felony, shall be murder in the second degree.\u201d There are a great many cases of murder that will fall under the second degree, where the killing is not by \u201c a person engaged in the commission of any felony.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-7\">The words with \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d do not help the indictment, nor show in what degree murder is charged therein. The words \u201cfeloniously\u201d and \u201c with malice aforethought\u201d must be inserted in the indictment. \u2022 If either of these is omitted the defendant can only be convicted of manslaughter. <em>(Barb. Crim. L. 2d ed. </em>54. <em>The Peoples. Enoch,. </em>13 <em>Wend. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>173.) These words must be used as well in the se.cond degree of murder as the first degree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-5\">The indictment for manslaughter is the same as for murder, omitting the words \u201c of his malice aforethought,\u201d wherever they occur, and substituting the word \u201cslay\u201d for the word murder\u201d in the latter part of the indictment. <em>(Barb. Crim. L. 2d ed. </em>69.) The indictment should be framed with sufficient certainty to identify the offense * * * that the court may be able to give judgment and award the punishment which the law prescribes. \" <em>(Id. and authorities there cited.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-7\">The statute clearly requires that the degree of offense should be set forth in the indictment. \u201cUpon an indictment for any offense consisting of different degrees as prescribed in this chapter, the jury may find the accused not guilty of the offense <em>in the degree charged in the indictment; </em>and may find such accused person guilty of any degree of such offense inferior to that charged in the indictment.\u201d (3 <em>R. S.5th ed. </em>987, \u00a737. 3 Hill, 93. 3 <em>Park. Cr. </em>R. 182.) And again, \u201c when by law an offense comprises different degrees, an indictment may contain counts for the different <em>degrees of the same offense, </em>or for any of such degrees.\u201d (3 <em>B. 8. 5th ed. </em>1019, \u00a7 53. 8 <em>Wend. </em>211. 3 <em>Park. Grim. Bep. </em>15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-9\">In Indiana, malice being necessary to constitute murder either in the first or second degree, and the distinction between the offenses consisting in the fact that the act was accompanied either <em>with or without deliberation, </em>if the indictment simply charge the prisoner with having committed the offense <em>\"feloniously, willfully and of his malice aforethought,\u201d </em>the offense charged will be only murder in the second degree. <em>(Find </em>v. <em>State, </em>5 <em>Ind. Rep. </em>400.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b125-10\">An indictment for burglary in the first degree, which does not charge the entry to have been in one of the modes set forth in the statute definition of that degree of the crime, is fatally defective.\u201d <em>(Fellinger </em>v. <em>The People, </em>15 <em>Abb. </em>128.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>And the court in this case say, <em>\u201c </em>Under the present statute classifying the crime of murder into the first and \u201csecond degrees, a person might he indicted for murder in the second degree. This would be by. omitting the allegation of its being <em>premeditated, </em>or being committed in the perpetration of some other offense. If under such an indictment the jury should find the prisoner guilty of murder in the first degree, the conviction could not be sustained, nor would the defect be cured by the verdict.\u201d (15 <em>Abb. Pr. </em>134. <em>Fonts </em>v. <em>The State, </em>4 <em>Green, Iowa, </em>500.) This is precisely the case before the court. <em>(See Dedieu </em>v. <em>The People, </em>22 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>178.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-5\">II. The verdict of the jury is bad. The verdict is simply <em>\u201c </em>guilty,\u201d- but it don\u2019t say of what; whether of murder in the first or second degree. How could the court say the defendant was guilty of murder in the first or second degree ? The statute evidently requires the jury to find what the defendant is guilty of. There is no fact or allegation stated in this \u25a0 indictment that would not have had to be stated charging murder in the second degree. Suppose it contains allegations enough to charge murder in the first degree; yet the jury have not told us whether they found the defendant guilty of murder in the first or second degree.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-6\"><em>John S. Bates, </em>(dist. att\u2019y,) for the people.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b126-7\"><em>By the Court, </em>Gilbert, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABz\">The identical language which \u2018 the legislature employed, in the Revised Statutes, to define the crime of murder was, with the exception of the change in the third subdivision which is not material to the present case, retained in the amendatory act of 1862, dividing this crime into two degrees, and now constitutes, with the same exception, the definition of murder in the first degree. Under the former statute, it has been repeatedly held that the form of an indictment, at common law, like that upon which the prisoner was tried and convicted, was good and sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>charge the statutory definition of the crime, i. e. that the premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed, which the statute, applicable to this case, makes an indispensable ingredient of the crime, is comprehended in the averment of a willful and felonious killing with malice aforethought. This has been the rule of law in this state for over thirty years. <em>(People </em>v. Enoch, 13 <em>Wend. </em>159. <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>3 <em>Seld. </em>393.) We are not at liberty to change it. While it prevails, the crime charged in this indictment cannot legally be denominated murder in the second degree. That is defined to be a killing which is <em>not murder in the first degree, </em>or manslaughter, or excusable or justifiable homicide, or when perpetrated without any design to effect death, by a person engaged in the commission of any felony. It is not necessary to decide what facts other than those last stated, would constitute murder in the second degree. It is enough, that this indictment sets forth the higher crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">A general verdict is equivalent to a special verdict, finding all the facts which \"are well pleaded in the indictment. <em>(Arch. Pl. and Pr. </em>172, 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The jury might have found a special verdict, showing the facts, and required the judgment of the court thereon, (2 <em>B. 8. </em>421, \u00a7 68 ; <em>Id. </em>735, \u00a7 14,) or, if the evidence warranted it, they might have found the prisoner not guilty of murder in . the first degree, but guilty of either murder in the second degree or of manslaughter. (2 <em>R. S. </em>702, \u00a7 27. <em>Dedieu </em>v. <em>The People, </em>22 <em>N. Y. Rep. </em>178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Having found a general verdict upon an indictment charging the prisoner with having committed the crime of murder in the first degree, the court below were right in pronouncing the judgment upon the record. <em>(Com. </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>11 <em>Gray, </em>438. <em>White </em>v. <em>Com. </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>179. <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>7 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>415. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Com. </em>12 <em>Harris, </em>586.)</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">There have been, apparently, conflicting decisions on this subject, in some of the western states, but they proceed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>peculiar statutes, and ought not, therefore, to influence our determination.</p>\n<court id=\"b128-6\">[Dutchess General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"AR\">May 13, 1867.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The judgment should he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Asr\"><em>Lott, J.
