In late 1998 and early 1999, Roseberry was paid by the Pembertons to transport marijuana in his motorhome from Arizona to Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early October of 2000, Roseberry agreed to transport more than 1,000 pounds of marijuana. When Roseberry arrived in Phoenix to pick up the load, the Pembertons informed him that Fred Fottler would accompany him on the trip. Several large duffle bags of marijuana were then loaded into the motorhome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 20, 2000, Roseberry set off from Phoenix. Pursuant to a scheme he devised with his friend Charles Dvoracek, Dvoracek traveled to Wickenberg, Arizona, where he was supposed to intercept and \"steal\" the motorhome and marijuana while Roseberry and Fottler were eating at a Denny's restaurant. In the early morning hours of October 21, 2000, Dvoracek parked his truck on the side of the road and waited for the motorhome to stop at Denny's. Instead of stopping at the restaurant, however, Roseberry drove back onto the highway and continued north toward his home in Nevada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dvoracek followed the motorhome, which Roseberry soon pulled over onto the shoulder of the road. As Dvoracek pulled in behind, he heard two pops. Roseberry stepped out of the motorhome and told Dvoracek that he had \"shot the guy\" the Pembertons had sent to accompany him on the drug run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Roseberry shot Fottler in the back of the head. Fottler was still making gurgling noises, so Roseberry returned to the motorhome and shot him again. Roseberry and Dvoracek then wrapped Fottler's body in a blanket and dumped it into the gully on the side of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As Roseberry drove through Arizona, he threw his gun out the window of the motorhome. Roseberry and Dvoracek stopped in Kingman, Arizona, to remove other evidence of the crime. They took a blood-stained sheet from the motorhome and threw it over a fence. They also buried Fottler's wallet and moved one of the duffle bags of marijuana from the motorhome to Dvoracek's truck so Dvoracek could sell the drugs to raise money in case it became necessary to bail Roseberry out of jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   They arrived at Roseberry's home in Henderson, Nevada, on October 21, 2000, and put the motorhome and drugs into storage. Later that day, Roseberry confided to his wife that he killed Fottler so he could steal the marijuana and sell it himself. Roseberry told her that his story was going to be that \"some Mexicans\" with guns were in the motorhome and had killed Fottler while Roseberry was out of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Diane Roseberry called her brother, Otis Bowman, and asked him to fly in from Indiana, which he did on October 22, 2000. Two drug dealers flew in with Bowman. They agreed to purchase about 300 pounds of marijuana, which Bowman later transported to Ohio in Roseberry's motorhome. Roseberry and Dvoracek split the money from the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Fottler's body was soon discovered. Investigative leads from United States Customs agents led Yavapai County Deputy Sheriffs to Roseberry, whose motorhome customs agents had observed while surveilling a Tucson stash house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Roseberry was tried and convicted of first-degree murder and drug offenses. In the aggravation phase of his trial, the jury found that the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Roseberry murdered Fottler for pecuniary gain. In the penalty phase, Roseberry presented mitigation evidence on five statutory and five non-statutory mitigating circumstances. The jury determined that the mitigation evidence was not sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency and returned a verdict of death for the murder. The court sentenced Roseberry to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On direct appeal, the Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentences.\n   <em>\n    Roseberry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648500\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/360/#p363\">\n    210 Ariz. 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"648500\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/210/360/#p363\">\n    111 P.3d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Roseberry filed a petition for post-conviction relief (\"PCR\") in April 2012. The trial court denied the petition and the Arizona Supreme Court denied Roseberry's petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 22, 2015, Roseberry filed a sealed petition for writ of habeas corpus in this Court. (Doc. 23.) He filed an unsealed petition on August 8, 2016. (Doc. 32.) The petition raises 47 claims and dozens of subclaims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the pending motion for evidentiary development, Roseberry seeks expansion of the record, discovery, and/or an evidentiary hearing with respect to 27 of those claims.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71.) Dr. Conner tested Roseberry's IQ, which she measured at 108, and his memory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71-72, 77.) She also administered a personality inventory and psychopathy checklist to rule out personality disorders or psychopathology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 72-73, 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Dr. Conner concluded that Roseberry suffered from \"mild impairment\" involving \"frontal lobe functioning.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.) This impairment would affect his judgment, memory, and motor skills. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Dr. Conner discussed a number of risk factors that could have contributed to Roseberry's impairment, including two head injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She testified that \"according to medical history,\" Roseberry had fallen from a barn and experienced loss of consciousness with three hours of antegrade amnesia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.) She also noted the injury Roseberry had suffered at work, which resulted in brief loss of consciousness, disorientation, and \"typical head injury sequelae.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Conner testified that the injury \"wasn't enough that it was going to drastically make an impairment that he couldn't function,\" but it was \"one neurological risk factor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Diabetes was another risk factor because it affects blood flow to the brain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Conner testified that Roseberry had suffered two diabetic comas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80.) Finally, Dr. Conner stated that Roseberry's high blood pressure and sleep apnea were additional risk factors for brain impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80-81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Roseberry's counsel also presented videotaped statements from his mother, daughter, and son-in-law, and a letter from a friend. These witnesses offered humanizing information showing that Roseberry was a good father and father-in-law and praising him as kind, generous, and a man of integrity. The videotaped witnesses also discussed Roseberry's various ailments and head injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   During the PCR proceedings, counsel raised a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, challenging counsel's performance with respect to the testimony of Brown and Dr. Conner. (Doc. 46-2, Ex. RRRRR at 36-39.) PCR counsel ultimately conceded he could not establish prejudice; the PCR court agreed, denying the claim as meritless. (Doc. 46-4, Ex. HHHHHHH at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    b.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Roseberry seeks to expand the record with expert reports. Two of the reports are from experts retained by PCR counsel. In a report dated April 19, 2012, Dr. Barry Morenz, a psychiatrist, diagnosed Roseberry\n   with cognitive disorder not otherwise specified (\"NOS\"), depressive disorder NOS, anxiety disorder NOS, and pathological gambling; personality disorder NOS with paranoid and narcissistic features; and high blood pressure, sleep apnea, diabetes, angina, and prostate problems. (Doc. 62-5, Ex. 205.) Dr. Morenz also opined that due to these mental and physical difficulties, Roseberry was unable to assist in his \"appeals.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Dr. Alex Hishaw, a neuropsychiatrist, examined Roseberry and prepared a report dated June 28, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 206.) Roseberry underwent an EEG and an MRI. The EEG was normal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The MRI revealed \"no evidence of mass or mass effect, mild age related cerebral volume loss, areas of T2 prolongation in the deep periventricular white matter that was felt to represent diffuse microangiopathic changes, and no areas of abnormal enhancement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Hishaw noted that Roseberry experienced issues with fatigue and concentration. He found no \"underlying dementing process such as Alzheimer's\" and no \"difficulties in other areas of cognition such as language, visuospatial orientation, or frontal/executive function.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Dr. Hishaw acknowledged Roseberry's \"history of several head injuries,\" but noted that he was never hospitalized and never suffered a sustained period of unconsciousness \"and so at the most may have experienced mild traumatic brain injuries in the past.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The impacts the injuries \"might have had on his current cognition are unknown.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Hishaw concluded, \"I do not find significant reason for direct neurologically associated cognitive concern.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Roseberry also seeks to expand the record with a report from Dr. Robert Heilbronner, a neuropsychologist, dated February 17, 2017, and a letter dated March 10, 2017, from Dr. Erin Bigler, another neuropsychologist, who reviewed the brain imaging and neuropsychological studies performed on Roseberry. (Doc. 62, Ex's 207, 209.) Drs. Heilbronner and Bigler agree that \"Roseberry had compromised neuropsychological function at the time of the crimes.\" (Doc. 62, Ex. 209 at 6.) They base their conclusion on neuropsychological test results as well as information provided by family members describing changes in Roseberry's behavior around the time of the crimes, including increased agitation and anxiety, restlessness, paranoia, susceptibility to the influence of others, and out-of-control gambling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although Heilbronner and Bigler did not rule out head trauma as the cause of the decline in Roseberry's brain function, Bigler opined that the \"the imaging reflects more of a neurodegenerative state consistent with vascular pathology or progressive neurodegeneration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In addition, Roseberry seeks to expand the record with declarations from family members and acquaintances who attest that he grew up in a poor family, that his health was bad, that his mental status had been in decline and his behavior had changed around the time of the crimes, and that he had a serious gambling problem. (Doc. 57, Ex's 7-34.) The declarants also state that their belief Roseberry was either too timid or too smart to commit such a violent and \"dumb\" crime. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex's 16, 17, 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Having reviewed these materials and the other documents with which Roseberry seeks to expand the record in support of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, the Court concludes that additional evidentiary development is unnecessary for the Court to address the merits of the allegations. The Court will expand the record to include the materials relevant to the claim. These include Exhibits 1-34, 90-125, 129- 34, and 204-10. With these exhibits, the record is\n   sufficient for the Court to assess, under both prongs of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , Roseberry's challenges to counsel's investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence, including evidence of Roseberry's neuropsychological status at the time of the crimes. The Court denies Roseberry's request to expand the record with other materials and denies his request for discovery and an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Claim 26\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Roseberry alleges numerous instances of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel (Doc. 32 at 169-179), two of which were raised by PCR counsel and denied on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 46-2, Ex.

PCR counsel's performance is at issue only to the extent it serves as cause under\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   for the default of Roseberry's ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.
