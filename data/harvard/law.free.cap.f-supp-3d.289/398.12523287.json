Defendants now move for summary judgment, contending that: (1) there existed probable cause for all five arrests and prosecutions; (2) all Defendant-Officers are entitled to qualified immunity; and (3) all claims against the City should be dismissed because of the lack of any constitutional violations and the lack of any evidence of an official custom or policy that caused the alleged constitutional violations. For the following reasons, the Court finds that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment and that all of Plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Walston's April 10, 2013 Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 1, 2012, non-party NYPD Officer Dillan Krasteff responded to a police dispatch radio call for assistance at the 1000 block of Belmont Avenue in Brooklyn. (Defendants' 56.1 Statement (\"Defs. 56.1\"), at \u00b6 4.) When Officer Krasteff arrived at the location, he encountered Robert Davilla, who stated that a woman, identified as V.N., had climbed through his window seeking help. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5.) She was bleeding and in shock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Krasteff met with V.N. in Davilla's home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.) V.N. told Officer Krasteff that while she was walking to the corner store to buy cigarettes, she was confronted by a man known as \"Mellow,\" who told her that she \"got Reggie locked up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.) Mellow\n   then pulled her into an apartment on the second floor of 1029 Belmont Avenue, beat her, and tried to rape her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) V.N. also stated that Mellow released two dogs on her that mauled her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) V.N. explained that she escaped by jumping off the second-floor balcony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Krasteff observed that V.N. was covered in blood and had visible bites on her body, lacerations to her legs and arms, a swollen face, and a cut around her eyes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8.) V.N. was admitted to Brookdale Hospital, where she received fifty stitches and was treated for a broken ankle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) Officer Krasteff prepared a complaint report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   NYPD Detective (\"Det.\") Joseph Patton investigated the incident and interviewed V.N. at the hospital on December 10, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.) V.N. gave the same account to Det. Patton as she had given to Officer Krasteff. She added that when Mellow released his dogs on her, he told them to \"kill the bitch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She identified Walston a/k/a \"Mellow Yellow\" as her assailant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.) Det. Patton went to Walston's various known addresses \"a number of times\" to look for Walston, but was unable to locate him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) On March 28, 2013, the victim identified Walston in a photograph, confirming he was her attacker. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.) On March 29, 2013, the police department issued an I-Card for Walston, which signaled that he was wanted as a suspect or witness for questioning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) On April 10, 2013, officers from the Brooklyn North Warrant Squad brought Walston to the 75th Precinct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) Det. Patton arrested Walston for assault in violation of Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 120.05(1) and 120.05(1X), and swore out a criminal court complaint based on the statements made to him by V.N. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22.) The charges against Walston were ultimately dropped under the speedy trial provisions because the prosecutor could not locate the victim. (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Walston's May 25, 2013 Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 25, 2013, non-party NYPD Det. Radoslaw Terepka received a telephone call from a tipster advising Det. Terepka that the tipster had information about an illegal gun. (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6 25.) Det. Terepka and Defendant Officer Grieco went to meet the tipster that same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The tipster informed them that an individual by the name of \"Mellow\" had a gun in the basement of 1029 Belmont Avenue in Brooklyn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Det. Terepka stated that he knew from his experience in the 75th precinct that \"Mellow\" was Walston, who at the time was living at 1029 Belmont Avenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Det. Terepka communicated this information to the other police officers on his team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the early morning hours of May 25, 2013, Det. Terepka received a phone call from one of his fellow officers that he had recently seen Walston exiting the basement of 1029 Belmont Avenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.) Det. Terepka and Officer Grieco went to 1029 Belmont Avenue and spoke with non-party NYPD Officer Greg Minardi, who said that he had seen Walston leaving the building. (Deposition of David Grieco (\"Grieco Dep.\"), Dkt. 41-7, at 109:10-110:7.) A police officer entered the basement at 1029 Belmont Avenue and recovered an unloaded revolver wrapped in a sock. (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6 29.) Officer Grieco arrested Walston for criminal possession of a firearm in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 265.02(1). (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) Officer Grieco signed the criminal court complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) The District Attorney\n   ultimately dismissed the case on May 31, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Plaintiffs' July 9, 2013 Arrest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 4, 2013, a NYPD officer was shot in East New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) Brooklyn North Homicide received an anonymous tip that the shooter was hiding inside 1029 Belmont Avenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) M.M., the owner of 1029 Belmont Avenue, provided the NYPD with written permission to enter and search the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) M.M. advised the police that no one was supposed to be living in any of the apartments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On July 9, 2013, Emergency Service Unit (\"ESU\") officers went to 1029 Belmont Avenue to search the building. (Deposition of Angelica Valentine (\"Valentine Dep.\"), Dkt. 41-9, at 39:9-20.) The ESU found Plaintiffs Walston, Valentine, and their two children, living in one of the apartments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Officer Carrieri was informed by his fellow NYPD officers that M.M. had informed them that no one was supposed to be living in the building. (Deposition of Edgardo Carrieri (\"Carrieri Dep.\"), Dkt. 41-8, at 53:5-13, 60:18-61:12.) Upon discovering Plaintiffs' and their children in the apartment, Officer Carrieri's partner, Sargent Diego Dotres, called M.M. to confirm that Plaintiffs were not supposed to be living at the premises, which M.M. confirmed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Officer Carrieri did not recall whether he asked Walston or his family if they had a lease for the apartment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:17-50:16.) He arrested Plaintiffs for trespass in violation of Penal Law \u00a7 140.15(2), and signed a criminal court complaint. (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 47, 56.) M.M. also signed a supporting deposition to accompany the criminal court complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Officer Carrieri never saw Walston's children at 1029 Belmont Avenue or at the precinct after the arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 42.) According to Valentine, an unknown officer placed her children in a cell for about an hour before they were picked up by a relative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.) Valentine admitted that neither her daughter, who was less than a year old, nor her son, who was three years old, had any understanding of what was going on. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) At their arraignment, Plaintiffs learned for the first time that they were being charged with trespass. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.) They ultimately produced a lease for an apartment at 1029 Belmont Avenue and the charges against them were formally dismissed eight months later, on March 20, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Walston's December 28, 2013 Arrest (First)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 28, 2013 at 2:13 am, a police dispatcher reported over the radio that a 911 call had come in about a grey van driven by a woman. The dispatcher stated that a black male passenger pulled another woman into the van, strangled her, and punched her in the face. (Deposition of Lisa Miles, (\"Miles Dep.\"), Dkt. 44-13, at 19:2-16, 34:9-18.) The incident occurred near the intersection of Fulton Street and Logan Street. (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6 61.) At 2:20 am, a second caller reported an emergency at nearby 1029 Belmont Avenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 62.) Defendant Officer Miles heard the radio reports, and went to 1029 Belmont. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63.) When Officer Miles arrived, she saw a grey SUV with a female driver, a female passenger, a black male passenger, and a child inside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64.) One of the women, S.H., was screaming that she had called the police because the male in the vehicle (Walston) had been strangling her cousin (Valentine), the other adult female. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Valentine had injuries to her face that were consistent with the dispatch radio report. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 67, 69.) Officer Miles spoke to Valentine, who claimed that \"a group of girls\" had tried to assault her at another location. (Miles Dep., at 24:9-25:4.) Officer Miles concluded that Valentine's observable injuries were consistent\n   with what the complaining witness told her at the scene,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Walston had assaulted Valentine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:7-14, 70:4-8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on this information, Officer Miles arrested Walston for criminal obstruction of breathing (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , choking), assault, and harassment in violation of Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 121.11, 120.00(1) and 240.26(1). (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 68-70.) Officer Miles signed the criminal court complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75.) Officer Miles filled out the criminal court complaint incorrectly by stating that Valentine had told the Officer that Walston had hit and choked her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76.) Instead, the complaint should have stated that the witness S.H. provided this information to Officer Miles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The charges against Walston were dismissed on speedy trial grounds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Walston's December 28, 2013 Arrest (Second)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While Walston was in the 75th precinct in connection with his arrest by Officer Miles, the police realized that there was an open complaint report against Walton stemming from an incident on December 13, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80.) Non-party NYPD Officer Ramil Casimir had recorded in the complaint that S.A., the owner of a local gas station bodega, alleged that he had been threatened with a \"firearm\" by Walston. (Compl. Rep. of 12/13/13, Dkt. 41-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant Officer Gessner investigated the open complaint report. (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6 80.) Officer Gessner went to the gas station to interview S.A. and confirm the information in the report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81.) S.A. identified Walston and told Officer Gessner that Walston often came into the store and took merchandise. S.A. confronted Walston about his shoplifting on December 13, 2013 and Walston responded by threatening S.A. with a firearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 82.) S.A. viewed a photograph of Walston shown to him by Officer Gessner, and confirmed that Walston was the person who had brandished a gun at him on December 13, 2013. S.A. signed his name to the photo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83). Officer Gessner then returned to the precinct and arrested Walston for menacing under Penal Law \u00a7 120.14(1). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85.) Both Officer Gessner and S.A. spoke to the District Attorney's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 86.) When Officer Gessner spoke to the Assistant District Attorney, Officer Gessner advised that there was video surveillance of the incident, but that he had not attempted to view or recover it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 84.) S.A. did not sign an affidavit to accompany the criminal complaint. The District Attorney's office dismissed the charges on January 3, 2014 because the victim did not cooperate with the prosecution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Patton correctly determined that there was probable cause to arrest based on Officer Krasteff's complaint report and V.N.'s account of the attack. V.N. reported the attack right after it occurred and in vivid detail, including how Walston beat her and released his dogs on her. (Affidavit of Dillan Krasteff (\"Krasteff Aff.\"), Dkt. 41-3, at \u00b6 8-11.) Officer Krasteff observed dog bites, lacerations, and other injuries on V.N. that were consistent with her account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.) V.N. also received fifty stitches and treatment for a broken ankle at the hospital immediately after the alleged incident. (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6 11.) In addition, Walston was no stranger to V.N., who told Officer Krasteff that she knew Walston by the nicknames \"Mellow\" and \"Mellow Yellow,\" and identified him as her assailant. (Deposition of Joseph Patton (\"Patton Dep.\"), Dkt. 41-12, at 32:25-33:7, 35:10-19, 77:24-78:4.) Under these circumstances, there was no reason for Officer Krasteff or Det. Patton to doubt the veracity or accuracy of V.N.'s account of December 1, 2012 incident or her identification of Walston as the perpetrator. Therefore, Det. Patton was entitled to rely on the information provided by V.N., as corroborated by the physical evidence, as establishing probable cause to arrest Walston for the December 1, 2012 incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Walston argues that this evidence was insufficient because V.N. did not sign a sworn deposition. The Court disagrees. The mere fact that V.N. did not sign a deposition does not undermine her credibility or the reliability of her statements to the officers, which were bolstered by the unmistakable signs of injury she bore-dog bites, lacerations, and a broken ankle (which required medical treatment)-as well as the report of the civilian witness, Davilla, into whose window V.N. climbed to escape her attacker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Walston further argues that there was no probable cause because V.N. confirmed Walston's identity through a single photo. (Pl. Br., Dkt. 42, at 23-24.) In cases where a single photograph is shown to a victim to identify a person responsible for a crime, the Court must first decide whether the identification procedure unduly and unnecessarily suggested that the defendant was the perpetrator.\n   <em>\n    Raheem v. Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083193\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/257/122/#p133\">\n    257 F.3d 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 133 (2d Cir. 2001). If so, the Court must determine whether the \"identification was nonetheless independently reliable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11083193\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/257/122/#p133\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   With this standard in mind, the Court finds that the single photograph was not unduly suggestive. As stated above, V.N. identified Walston as her attacker immediately after the incident and claimed that she knew him previously. When she identified him in the photograph she was merely confirming for police that he was the perpetrator,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the man she knew as \"Mellow\" or \"Mellow Yellow.\" Walston casts no doubt on the validity of\n   the identification, which was sufficient to establish probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, even if the single-photo identification was unduly suggestive, V.N.'s identification was independently reliable. V.N. told the police that the attack was personal,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it was in response for \"getting Reggie locked up.\" (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6 7.) She also identified Walston's residence-1029 Belmont Avenue-as the site of the attack. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to both Officer Krasteff and Det. Patton, V.N. immediately and without hesitation identified Walston in as the perpetrator. She also offered the same, consistent account to both police officers. Accordingly, even assuming that the use of a single photograph was unduly suggestive, the Court finds that V.N.'s identification of Walston as her attacker was independently reliable and thus sufficient to establish probable cause to arrest Walston on April 10, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Malicious Prosecution Claim-April 10, 2013\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Walston's malicious prosecution claim is similarly without merit.

Regarding this claim, Walston simply repeats his challenges to the probable cause underlying Walston's arrest-arguments rejected above-and complain about law enforcement's inability to proceed with the case without the participation of the witness. (Pl. Br., at 24-25.) Walston, however, fails to point to the discovery of some intervening evidence or fact undermining the probable cause that supported the arrest. Walston also fails to put forth any evidence that Det. Patton acted with malice in conveying the information known to him to the prosecutor or in signing the criminal court affidavit.\n   <em>\n    Brogdon v. City of New Rochelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9433445\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/200/411/#p423\">\n    200 F.Supp.2d 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (to survive summary judgment, a plaintiff must elicit evidence \"showing ... some deliberate act punctuated with awareness of 'conscious falsity' to establish malice.\"). Furthermore, the Court finds it insignificant that four months elapsed between the attack and Walston's arrest. The NYPD investigated the crime between December 1, 2012 and April 10, 2013, including repeated attempts to locate Walston before the I-Card was issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In sum, because the undisputed evidence demonstrates that there existed probable cause to arrest and prosecute Walston for the December 1, 2012 attack on V.N., Walston's false arrest and malicious prosecutions claims relating to Walston's April 10, 2013 arrest must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

False Arrest Claim-May 25, 2013\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Walston asserts that he was falsely arrested on May 25, 2013 and prosecuted for criminal possession of a weapon. As an initial matter, the Court finds that Defendant Officer Grieco and Det. Trepka had probable cause to arrest Walston on this charge based on the information from a tipster about Walston having hidden a gun in the basement of 1029 Belmont Avenue, Officer Minardi's sighting of Walston leaving the building, and the recovery of a gun from the basement, as reported by the tipster.

Walston's argument is both factually and legally unpersuasive. Prior to Officer Gessner showing S.A. Walston's photograph, S.A. had identified Walston to both Officer Casimir (as memorialized in an open complaint report) and Officer Gessner as the person who had threatened him. S.A. made clear that he knew Walston from a number of prior incidents during which Walston had shoplifted at S.A.'s store and that these prior incidents were the catalyst for the threat incident on December 28, 2013. In determining whether probable cause existed, Officer Gessner was entitled to rely on S.A.'s allegations that a threat had been made and his identification of Walston as the person who had threatened S.A.\n   <em>\n    Miloslavsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837058\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/808/351/#p355\">\n    808 F.Supp. at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t is well-established that a law enforcement official has probable cause to arrest if he received his information from some person, normally the putative victim or eyewitness\");\n   <em>\n    Singer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414152\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/110/#p118\">\n    63 F.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (officer has probable cause to effect an arrest \"absent circumstances that raise doubts as to the victim's veracity\"). Moreover, the showing of a single photograph to the victim, S.A., was not unduly suggestive, given S.A.'s prior identification of Walston as the perpetrator and S.A.'s familiarity with Walston. (Defs. 56.1, at \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.) As with V.N., when S.A. identified Walston in the photograph, he was merely confirming that Walston was the person whom he had previously identified to the police,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the man who regularly stole items from S.A.'s shop.

Furthermore, even if the single-photo identification procedure was unduly suggestive, the Court finds that it was independently reliable for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Walston further argues that Defendant Officer Gessner erred by not investigating and reviewing available video that allegedly depicted Walston committing the crime. But courts in this Circuit have expressly held that police do not have to review surveillance video in order to establish probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wieder v.

Apr. 29, 2013) (dismissing claims of false arrest and malicious prosecution where plaintiff claimed that officers failed to review or obtain video surveillance footage and failed to interview witnesses). Here, the police had probable cause to arrest Walston for threatening S.A. on December 13, 2013 without obtaining and reviewing the store's surveillance video recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Malicious Prosecution-December 28, 2013 Arrest (Second)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As discussed, probable cause to arrest is probable cause to prosecute unless some\n   other information becomes known to the officer prior to the prosecution that would undermine probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Kinzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375677\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/316/139/#p143\">\n    316 F.3d at 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Walston offers no evidence of such intervening information, nor do they offer evidence of Officer Gessner's malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, because there existed probable cause to arrest and prosecute Walston for the December 13, 2013 threat incident, Walston's claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution based on his second December 28, 2013 arrest must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Qualified Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants raise a defense of qualified immunity to Plaintiffs' 1983 claims. The doctrine of qualified immunity entitles public officials to freedom from suit for acts undertaken in their official capacity if \"(1) their conduct does not violate clearly established constitutional rights, or (2) it was objectively reasonable for them to believe their acts did not violate those rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Weyant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639105\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/845/#p852\">\n    101 F.3d at 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the context of a qualified immunity defense to an allegation of false arrest, the defending officer need only show \"arguable\" probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

Therefore, the Court need not, and declines to, reach the merits of Defendants' qualified immunity defense, since arguable probable cause is a lower standard.\n   <em>\n    Harley v.
