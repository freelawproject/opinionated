CONCLUSION...985\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This motion raises the surprisingly rarely litigated question of whether and when a seeming prior conviction is actually a \"prior conviction\" for purposes of a sentencing enhancement in a criminal prosecution for possession of child pornography. It matters, because if the prior conviction is a \"prior conviction\" under federal law, the defendant faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. If the prior conviction is not a \"prior conviction,\" there is no mandatory minimum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant Christopher Scott Jepsen has moved to strike part of the Indictment against him on a charge of violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B) (possession of child pornography) that seeks an enhanced penalty pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) for a \"prior conviction.\" Jepsen contends the alleged \"prior conviction\" was not \"prior\" to the date on which he allegedly violated \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B). This is so, he contends, because his original sentence on the alleged \"prior conviction\" was vacated as \"illegal,\" and a new sentence and judgment were not imposed until after he allegedly committed the current offense. In short, he argues that a \"prior conviction\" requires that he was not only found guilty, but sentenced, and a valid judgment entered before the date of the alleged commission of the \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) offense for the \u00a7 2252(b)(2)\"prior conviction\" enhancement to apply. Not surprisingly, the prosecution disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Alleged Prior Conviction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The focus of Jepsen's Motion, and hence, the focus of the following background is on Jepsen's alleged \"prior conviction,\" rather than on the current charge against him. Jepsen admits that, on August 24, 2011, a jury in Iowa District Court for Crawford County found him guilty of two counts of sexual abuse in the third degree. The first was pursuant to IOWA CODE \u00a7 709.4(2)(c)(4), which applies when the victim was 14 or 15 years old and the defendant was at least four years older than the victim. The second was pursuant to IOWA CODE \u00a7 709.4(2)(b), which applies when the victim was 12 or 13 years old. On September 23, 2011, Jepsen was sentenced to two consecutive 10-year prison terms for the two counts of sexual abuse, but the state court suspended the prison sentences and placed Jepsen on probation for five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   September 23, 2011, Judgment and Sentence (Suspended), Defendant's Exhibit A. Neither party appealed from that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In October 2014, the state moved to revoke Jepsen's probation based on his alleged admissions that he had used the internet to obtain child pornography. While preparing for the revocation proceedings, the state prosecutor noticed that Jepsen's original sentence on the second count of sexual abuse was illegal, because the age of the victim made the offense a forcible felony, so Jepsen was not eligible for a suspended sentence. Opinion of Iowa Court of Appeals, Defendant's Exhibit E, 3 (citing IOWA CODE \u00a7 702.11 ). Thus, the state filed a Motion To Correct Illegal Sentence, pursuant to Rule 2.24(5)(a) of the Iowa Rules of Criminal Procedure, which permits correction of an illegal sentence \"at any time.\" Defendant's Exhibit B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 29, 2016, the Iowa District Court held a hearing on the state's Motion To Correct Illegal Sentence, granted the motion, ruled that the initial sentence was illegal, and overruled Jepsen's contention that a corrected prison sentence would violate his right not to be subjected to double jeopardy. Transcript Of Hearing, Defendant's Exhibit C, 11:16-15:22. The court resentenced Jepsen to two concurrent, unsuspended 10-year prison terms.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    at 36:24-37:7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That same day, the court filed a Corrected Judgment and Sentence, reiterating that, \"[o]n the 24th day of August, 2011, Defendant was found guilty of the crime[s]\" charged and stating Jepsen's corrected sentence on those charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   January 29, 2016, Corrected Judgment and Sentence, Defendant's Exhibit D, 1-2. On February 1, 2016, the court filed an Order, which stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   As further clarification of the court's Corrected Judgment and Sentence filed January 29, 2016, except to the extent any terms were reaffirmed and incorporated into the January 29, 2016, Corrected Judgment and Sentence, the court ORDERS that the September 23, 2011, Judgment and Sentence is void and vacated accordingly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Jepsen appealed the Corrected Judgment and Sentence on the ground that the court's failure to credit his corrected sentence for the time he served on probation violated his double jeopardy rights. Opinion of Iowa Court of Appeals, Defendant's Exhibit E, at 2. On April 5, 2017, the Iowa Court of Appeals conditionally affirmed Jepsen's new sentence and remanded for the district court to give Jepsen credit for time served in an \"alternate jail facility\" or a residential treatment facility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Jepsen sought further review by the Iowa Supreme Court, and that appeal remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Current Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On February 18, 2016, in a single-count Indictment, a grand jury charged Jepsen with \"possession of child pornography\" on or about August 5, 2014, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B) and 2252(b)(2). In pertinent part, for present purposes, the Indictment charged that \"[o]n or about September 23, 2011, defendant was convicted of two counts of sexual abuse in the 3rd degree in the Iowa District Court for Crawford County, Iowa.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On December 21, 2017, Jepsen filed the Motion To Strike Prior Conviction Enhancement now before me; on December 28, 2017, the prosecution filed its Response; and on December 31, 2017, Jepsen filed his Reply. On January 10, 2018, I entered an Order setting a hearing on defendant's Motion for Tuesday, January 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On January 11, 2018, Jepsen waived his personal presence at the January 23, 2018, hearing. The parties' arguments were particularly thoughtful and helpful to me in the disposition of this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Arguments Of The Parties\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Jepsen acknowledges that the question of whether any sentence on the charged offense may be enhanced for a \"prior conviction\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) is for the court, not a jury. He also acknowledges that, if the Indictment correctly alleges that he has a \"prior conviction\" of the nature described in the statute, he is subject to a minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and a maximum of 20 years in prison. If it doesn't, he faces no mandatory minimum sentence and the same 20-year maximum. Jepsen also acknowledges that the statute does not define \"prior conviction,\" so the court looks to federal, not state law, for a definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Jepsen contends that the disposition of his Motion depends upon the answers to two questions: (1) what must his \"prior conviction\" be \"prior\" to, and (2) when did he incur that \"conviction\"? He argues that the answer to the first question, under applicable federal law, is that he must have incurred the \"prior conviction\" before the date that he allegedly committed the federal child pornography offense. He contends that the answer to the second question is that he did not incur the \"conviction\" until a judgment was entered after sentencing on a finding of guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In support of his argument, Jepsen contends that, in\n   <em>\n    Deal v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n    508 U.S. 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), which considered the \"second or subsequent conviction\" enhancement in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), the Supreme Court recognized that the word \"conviction\" can mean either the finding of guilt or the entry of a final judgment on that finding, but that the context in which the word appears in \u00a7 924(c)(1) showed that it referred to the finding of guilt by a judge or jury. At oral arguments, Jepsen went further by arguing that\n   <em>\n    Deal\n   </em>\n   held that \"conviction,\" standing alone, was \"ambiguous.\" Jepsen argues that, here, in contrast, nothing in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) suggests that Congress intended \"conviction\" to mean just a finding of guilt, rather than the entry of a judgment of conviction, and that interpreting \"conviction\" in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) to mean the entry of judgment after sentencing does not produce a nonsensical result. Jepsen relies primarily on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pratt\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-20196,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202847573\">\n    2012 WL 2847573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Mich. July 11, 2012) (unpublished). He contends that the court in\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   saw nothing in the statute or other interpretive aids suggesting one meaning of \"conviction\" over another, so that the rule of lenity required the court to adopt the less punitive alternative. Although\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   did not involve a void judgment on the alleged \"prior conviction,\" as is the case, here, Jepsen argues that is immaterial, because a void judgment has no legal force or effect. Thus, he argues that the\n   only valid judgment against him in the state case is dated January 29, 2016, which is after he allegedly committed the charged federal child pornography offense on August 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In response, the prosecution argues that Jepsen was convicted by a jury and sentenced on two state offenses prior to the offense conduct resulting in the current federal charge, and that the fact that Jepsen was resentenced on the state offenses after the charged conduct does not warrant the relief he requests. The prosecution points out that it is undisputed that, on August 24, 2011, Jepsen was found guilty by a jury of two counts of sexual abuse in the third degree under state law. The prosecution also points out that it is also undisputed that, on September 23, 2011, Jepsen was sentenced on those two counts and a judgment entered. Thus, the prosecution argues, as of September 23, 2011, there had been a finding of guilt, sentencing, and entry of final judgment. Therefore, the prosecution argues, even if this court adopts the conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   , Jepsen had a cognizable \"prior conviction\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2252(b)(2) as of September 23, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In the alternative, however, the prosecution argues that the court should follow\n   <em>\n    United States v. Storer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8971805\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/918/#p921\">\n    413 F.3d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921-22 (8th Cir. 2005), which concluded that a \"prior conviction\" under the nearly identical language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2) does not require sentencing and a final adjudication of guilt, but only a finding of guilt by a jury or court. The prosecution points out that the finding of Jepsen's guilt on the two state charges was never voided or vacated, but was, in fact, reaffirmed in the Corrected Judgment and Sentence. Thus, the prosecution argues that Jepsen committed felony offenses against two children, and was convicted of those offenses, well before he committed the child pornography offenses with which he is now charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In reply, Jepsen argues that the Corrected Judgment and Sentence voided the September 23, 2011, Judgment and Sentence, so that that earlier Judgment and Sentence was a legal nullity. Jepsen agrees that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2), the \"prior conviction\" enhancement at issue is\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   , \"mirrors\" \u00a7 2252(b)(2). Nevertheless, he argues that\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   held only that a plea of nolo contendere in Florida state court that results in a finding of guilt with adjudication withheld is a \"conviction\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(2). He points out that, when a Florida court withholds adjudication, it is required to place a felony defendant on probation. In other words, he argues, even though the formal adjudication is withheld, the defendant is still subjected to a probationary sentence as a consequence of the finding of guilt. He argues that nothing in\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   suggests that a defendant has suffered a \"conviction\" before he learns the consequence of the finding of guilt. He also reiterates that there is no textual basis for the prosecution's reading of \u00a7 2252(b)(2), so that the rule of lenity should require the interpretation that favors a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At oral arguments, I asked the parties why the interpretation of \"prior conviction\" in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) was not controlled by the decision of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   and its subsequent decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stults\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4034096\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/575/834/\">\n    575 F.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2009),\n   <em>\n    cert. denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20U.S.%20915\">\n    559 U.S. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20S.%20Ct.%201309\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20L.%20Ed.%202d%201093\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Jepsen responded that\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stults\n   </em>\n   showed that a finding of guilt was a necessary condition for a \"prior conviction,\" but did not address or rule out the need for a sentence and judgment, as well. The prosecution responded that, from the circumstances presented in those cases, the court was holding that a finding of\n   guilt was the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   requirement for a \"prior conviction.\" I also asked why, if\n   <em>\n    Deal\n   </em>\n   held that \"conviction\" was \"ambiguous,\" did the Court not reach the rule of lenity? Jepsen responded that the Court concluded the ambiguity of the word was resolved by its context in \u00a7 924(c). Although Jepsen argued that the rule of lenity should not be applied based on the facts of a specific case, but any time the statutory language is ambiguous, he did concede that it was at least \"ironic\" to apply the rule of lenity, here, where his original sentence was illegal because it was too lenient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

The application of Jepsen's interpretation in three hypothetical scenarios, only one of which matches his situation, demonstrates that his interpretation leads to absurd results or, at the very least, strange consequences. Those hypothetical scenarios are shown, first, in graphic form, then discussed, below:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-86\">Scenario 3 Federal Commission Judgment Offense Scenario 2 Scenario 1 Commission Judgment Commission Judgment State 09/23/11 01/21/16 Offenses Judgment Corrected Judgment</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Scenario 1: Enhancement applies (Not this case)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Commission of and judgment on the federal offense are\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Corrected Judgment on the state offenses. Under Jepsen's interpretation, the enhancement applies, because there is a valid judgment (the Corrected Judgment) on the state offenses before commission of the federal offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Although the first scenario is not what happened here, Jepsen would likely agree that the enhancement would apply, under his interpretation, if he did not commit the federal offense until after what he considers to be the only valid judgment (the Corrected Judgment) on the state offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Scenario 2: Enhancement applies (Not this case)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Commission of and judgment on the federal offense are after the original Judgment on the state offenses, but\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the Corrected Judgment. Under Jepsen's interpretation, the enhancement applies, and Jepsen conceded that at oral arguments, because the original Judgment on the state offenses was still valid and was entered before commission of the federal offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The second scenario also is not what happened here: Jepsen was not found guilty or sentenced on the federal offense before the Corrected Judgment on the state offenses (and he still hasn't been).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Scenario 3: Enhancement does not apply (This case)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Commission of, but not judgment on, the federal offense occurs before the Corrected Judgment. In other words, the federal proceedings \"straddle\" the date of the Corrected Judgment. Under Jepsen's interpretation, the enhancement does not apply, because there is no valid judgment on the state offenses before commission of the federal offense, and the court knows that at the time of the federal sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The third scenario is what happened here: Jepsen committed the federal offense after September 23, 2011, and before January 29, 2016, but he was not found guilty or sentenced on the federal offense before January 29, 2016 (and he still hasn't been). This is the only scenario under Jepsen's interpretation in which it is clear at sentencing on the federal offense that there was no valid judgment on the state offenses before Jepsen committed the federal offense, and hence, no \"prior conviction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Under Jepsen's interpretation, there is an enhancement in the first two scenarios, but there isn't in the third scenario. Also, in both the second scenario and the third scenario, what is a \"prior conviction\" depends, in part, upon when the federal offense came to judgment, not merely on when the conduct violating the federal statute occurred, in relation to the alleged \"prior conviction,\" but that is contrary to the conclusion in Section II.B.1., above. In these scenarios Jepsen's criminal conduct on his state offenses and federal offense would be the same and would have occurred in the same order. Nevertheless, his potential mandatory minimum sentence on the federal charge would be dramatically and inexplicably different under the first two scenarios, where the \u00a7 2252(b)(2) enhancement would apply, from what it would be under the third, where the \u00a7 2252(b)(2) enhancement would not apply.

Certainly, there is none indicating that Congress intended the \"strange consequences\" of application of the \"prior conviction\" enhancement in \u00a7 2252(b)(2), as Jepsen has interpreted it, in various hypothetical situations. Even without specific legislative history, however, we are not completely without insight into congressional intent. The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Deal\n   </em>\n   antedated the passage of the \u00a7 2252(b)(2) enhancement. Thus, when it passed \u00a7 2252(b)(2), Congress was aware of the discussion of the multiple possible meanings of \"conviction\" in statutes imposing prior conviction enhancements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n    508 U.S. at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More specifically still, Congress was aware that, in\n   <em>\n    Deal\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court had distinguished \"conviction,\" meaning a finding of guilt, from \"judgment of conviction,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   which then- Rule 32(b)(1), now-Rule 32(k)(1), of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure defines as including both the adjudication of guilt and the sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n    at 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12096\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/129/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even if I did consider application of the rule of lenity, however, I would find its application to these facts exceptionally distasteful. This is so, because Jepsen's \"illegal\" sentence on one of the state offenses was way too lenient, not too harsh, where probation was not available for that offense, so that Jepsen's ultimate sentence on the state offenses pursuant to the Corrected Judgment and Sentence was considerably longer than it was pursuant to the original September 23, 2011, Judgment. While defense counsel may ultimately be correct that a judge cannot consider the specific facts of the underlying case in deciding whether to apply the rule of lenity, it would be, at a minimum, extraordinarily ironic to apply it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Therefore, under principles of statutory interpretation, Jepsen's state offenses were a \"prior conviction\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2252(b)(2), if he had been found guilty on those offenses prior to the date he allegedly committed the current offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. Application of the interpretation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I conclude that the Indictment properly charged Jepsen with a \u00a7 2252(a)(4) offense with a \"prior conviction\" that may subject him to the enhanced penalty of \u00a7 2252(b)(2). This conclusion is based on both the requirements of Eighth Circuit precedent and applicable principles of interpretation of a federal criminal statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Here, I am not persuaded by Jepsen's argument that there simply was no valid finding of guilt prior to his alleged violation of \u00a7 2252(a)(4). That argument is based on his contention that the January 29, 2016, Corrected Judgment and Sentence completely voided the September 23, 2011, Judgment and Sentence, making it a legal nullity. To the contrary, the Corrected Judgment and Sentence expressly reiterated that \"[o]n the 24th day of August, 2011, Defendant was found guilty of the [state] crimes\" at issue. Defendant's Exhibit D at 1. Thus, the Corrected Judgment and Sentence still recognized the validity of the August 24, 2011, finding of guilt. If there were any doubt that the August 2011 finding of guilt remained valid, the February 1, 2016, Order, eliminated any doubt by stating that the September 23, 2011, Judgment and Sentence was void and vacated, \"except to the extent any terms were reaffirmed and incorporated into the January 29, 2016, Corrected Judgment and Sentence.\" Plaintiff's Exhibit 1. Because the Corrected Judgment and Sentence expressly reaffirmed and incorporated the August 24, 2011, finding of guilt, there was a valid finding of guilt on the state crimes prior to the date Jepsen allegedly violated \u00a7 2252(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In short, Jepsen's state offenses count as a \"prior conviction\" within the meaning of \u00a7 2252(b)(2), because he had been found guilty on those offenses prior to the date he allegedly committed the current offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.
