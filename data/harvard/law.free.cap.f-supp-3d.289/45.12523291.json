INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case represents a dispute between certain public and not-for-profit hospitals and the Department of Health and\n   Human Services (\"HHS\") over the rates at which Medicare will begin reimbursing them for pharmaceuticals that they acquire through a federal program known as the 340B Program. Although the 340B Program has enabled eligible hospitals to purchase pharmaceuticals from manufacturers at discounts, Medicare has historically reimbursed those hospitals at rates that were significantly higher than acquisition costs. Healthcare providers, including Plaintiffs, claim that they have used this surplus to provide additional healthcare services to communities with vulnerable populations. But in 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), a component of HHS, issued a regulation which was designed to begin closing the gap between what hospitals were paying for drugs and the rates at which Medicare reimbursed those hospitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs in this action, three hospital associations and three of their member hospitals, contend that the Medicare reimbursement rate for 340B drugs is set by statute and that the Secretary exceeded his authority when he \"adjusted\" that statutory rate downward by nearly 30%. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-49, ECF No. 1. In order to preserve the\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs now seek a preliminary injunction directing HHS and the Acting Secretary not to implement these provisions pending the resolution of this lawsuit and any appeal. Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 2. In response, Defendants, HHS and the Acting Secretary, have opposed this motion and have themselves moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 17. For the reasons stated below, the Court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiffs have failed to present any claim to the Secretary for final decision as required by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20405\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

But in that case, even though the plaintiff had not presented his precise constitutional argument to the Secretary, there had been a \" 'final decision' by the Secretary with respect to the [plaintiff's] claim of entitlement to benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Indeed, the Court found that the named plaintiff, \"[t]hrough his answers to the state agency questionnaire, and his letter in response to the tentative determination that his disability had ceased, had specifically presented the claim that his benefits should not be terminated because he was still disabled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, \"[t]his claim was denied by the state agency and its decision was accepted by the [Social Security Administration].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, despite not presenting a particular constitutional argument to the Secretary, the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   -unlike the Plaintiffs here-\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   submitted a claim for definite benefits, which the Secretary had denied.

In that case, two organizations and one recipient of Medicare benefits sought to challenge the Secretary's decision to recover refunds that HHS had erroneously issued to Medicare beneficiaries.

The Secretary did not argue, however, that presentment must be accomplished, if at all, through a formal submission of a concrete claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot.

And the district court did not address this issue on its own. Rather, the district court held that associations may present claims on behalf of their members and concluded, without explanation, that the organizations' letters satisfied\n   \u00a7 405(g)'s presentment requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Action All. of Senior Citizens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206560\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/607/33/\">\n    607 F.Supp.2d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court then proceeded to consider the merits of plaintiffs' claims, but ultimately sided with the Secretary and granted his motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206560\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/607/33/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206560\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/607/33/\">\n    at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs then appealed the district court's decision. The Secretary did not cross-appeal on the jurisdictional issue and, in fact, conceded that the Circuit \"ha[d] jurisdiction to address the issues presented in th[e] appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee's Brief at 11 n.2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%206043968\">\n    2009 WL 6043968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Action All. of Senior Citizens v.

And while the Secretary did present an abbreviated version of the argument made to the trial court, the Secretary still did not argue that the generalized nature of the letters in anyway made them deficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682049,3551203\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/860/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After reviewing the case, the D.C.
