To assist district courts with exercising their discretion under \u00a7 505, the Supreme Court of the United States has directed district courts to consider \"several nonexclusive factors,\" including \"frivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness, and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597549\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1979/#p1985\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (alterations &amp; internal quotation marks omitted).

Under this method, the court multiplies the number of hours that the attorney reasonably expended on the litigation by a reasonable hourly rate.\n    <em>\n     McAfee v. Boczar\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694542\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/81/#p88\">\n     738 F.3d 81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 88 (4th Cir. 2013). Plaintiff's counsel claims that he spent 8.4 hours on each of the four defendants' cases and that his customary rate is $300 per hour. Thus, he seeks an attorney's fee award of $2,520 per defendant. In determining the reasonableness of counsel's requested fee, the Fourth Circuit has directed district courts to consider the following twelve factors:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n    (1) The time and labor expended; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions raised; (3) the skill required to properly perform the legal services rendered; (4) the attorney's opportunity costs in pressing the instant litigation; (5) the customary fee for like work; (6) the attorney's expectations at the outset of the litigation; (7) the time limitations imposed by the client or circumstances; (8) the amount in controversy and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorney; (10) the undesirability of the case within the legal community in which the suit arose; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship between attorney and client; and (12) attorneys' fees awards in similar cases.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694542\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/81/#p88\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 88 n.5 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the first three factors, the court is not convinced that 8.4 hours of work per defendant is reasonable. Counsel used substantially the same initial complaint in this case as he had already filed in another case pending in this district, and he filed the same formulaic default judgment motion against each of the four defendants. The eighth factor also counsels against an award of $2,520 per defendant because such an award is excessive when compared to the statutory damages award of $750 per infringement.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Other courts have recognized as excessive a request for $2,100 in attorney's fees based on a rate of $350 per hour.\n    <em>\n     Pumaras\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204707015\">\n     2017 WL 4707015\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6-7.

In another case, the District Court ruled that 9.1 hours was reasonable where a paralegal completed 7.2 hours of the work at a rate of $85 per hour.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Malibu Media, LLC v.

July 11, 2016).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Based on the foregoing, the court believes that two hours per defendant is a reasonable number of hours for an attorney to expend on each defendant in this case and that the attorney's hourly rate of $300 is a reasonable rate for attorneys in this area. Accordingly, the court will exercise its broad discretion to award $600 in attorney's fees per defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    As to costs, plaintiff requests the following amounts from each defaulting defendant: a court filing fee of $400; subpoena response costs paid to Comcast to identify each defendant of $90; a process service fee for service on Comcast of $25; a process service fee for serving each of the defendants of $100; and a fee to verify the military status of each of the defendants of $50. Although plaintiff's counsel seeks to divide amongst the four defaulting defendants the original $100 fee for service on Comcast, he did not request to divide the one-time $400 filing fee in a similar fashion. The court believes that dividing that filing fee between the defaulting\n    defendants is reasonable, and therefore, each of the four defaulting defendants will be liable for only $100 of the court filing fee. The court declines to award the remaining costs requested.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Accordingly, the court will award costs against each defendant in the amount of $100.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Finally, the plaintiff has also filed motions to dismiss with prejudice the action against the remaining defendants Braden Brennan, Paula Christian, and Yaser Medina.

Judgment will be entered in favor of plaintiff against each of those four defendants in the amount of $1,450, representing $750 in statutory damages and $700 in attorney's fees and costs. Those defendants will also each be permanently enjoined from any further infringement.
