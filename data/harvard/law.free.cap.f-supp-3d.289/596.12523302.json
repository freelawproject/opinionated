(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1, 8) (internal quotation marks omitted) Groupon bases its motion on the Court's adoption of Magistrate Judge Burke's Report and Recommendation denying a similar motion in related case\n   <em>\n    IBM v.

(D.I. 30 at 3-4) Claim 1 of the '967 patent is representative and recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A method for presenting interactive applications on a computer network, the network including a multiplicity of user reception systems at which respective users may request a multiplicity of available applications, the respective reception systems including a monitor at which the applications requested can be presented as one or more screens of display, the method comprising the steps of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   a. generating a screen display at a respective reception system for a requested application, the screen display being generated by the respective reception system from data objects having a prescribed data structure, at least some of which objects may be\n   stored at the respective reception system, the screen display including a plurality of partitions, the partitions being constructed from objects, the objects being retrieved from the objects stored at the respective reception system, or if unavailable from the objects stored at the respective reception system, then from the network, such that at least some of the objects may be used in more than one application;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   b. generating at least a first partition for presenting applications; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   c. generating concurrently with the first partition at least a second partition for presenting a plurality of command functions, the command functions including at least a first group which are selectable to permit movement between applications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   While the claims of the '967 and '849 patents differ slightly, the parties agree that both Filepp patents are directed to the same concept. (D.I. 30 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IBM v. Priceline\n   </em>\n   , C.A. No. 15-137-LPS-CJB D.I. 54 at 141-42) Rather than claiming a \"method for presenting interactive applications,\" like the '967 patent, the '849 patent claims are directed to a \"method for presenting advertising.\" Similarly, where the '967 patent recites \"partitions,\" the '849 patent claims \"portions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Step 1\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Step 1 requires the Court to consider whether the claims are directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea. Groupon contends that, through the adoption of the Priceline R &amp; R, this Court already determined that the Filepp patents are directed to the abstract idea of local storage. (D.I. 30 at 9) Furthermore, according to Groupon, the Filepp patents are materially distinct from those at issue in\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   because the Filepp patents fail to claim a specific implementation of a solution to a software problem, and instead only \"claim a functional result with nothing more than a suggestion to use conventional computer concepts to achieve it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   IBM responds that the Filepp patents are \"directed to achieving an improvement in computer capabilities-specifically, improving the capabilities of network hosts and computer networks.\" (D.I. 37 at 7) Prior to the Filepp patents, IBM contends, network-based interactive services operated by \"processing and stor[ing] all of the applications a user might request through a 'dumb terminal,' \" resulting in slower response times and limits on the number of users a single host could serve. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Filepp patents improved that functionality, according to IBM, by structuring applications and advertising as objects and selectively storing and retrieving those objects at the reception system, enabling the host to respond more quickly to user requests and, therefore, serve more users, more quickly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) IBM contends, therefore, that the Filepp patents are directed to an improvement in computer capabilities and, under\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, are patent-eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court agrees with IBM.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Priceline R &amp; R, the Court found the\n   Filepp patents directed to the abstract idea of local storage, but ultimately denied the motion to dismiss because claim construction and discovery were required before a finding on patent eligibility could be made. The Court found it was plausible that the claims, upon being construed, were patent-eligible under step 2 because they could \"be seen to improve the functioning of computer networks by 'reducing the demand on the host for processing resources.' \" ( Priceline R &amp; R at 48-50 (quoting '967 Patent at 10:60-65, '849 Patent at 10:64-11:2); Priceline Order at 2-3 )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Subsequently, the Federal Circuit issued\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   , finding that\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   did not \"broadly hold that all improvements in computer-related technology are inherently abstract and, therefore, must be considered at step two.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/\">\n    822 F.3d at 1335-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Claim 1 of the '967 patent discloses a \"method for presenting interactive applications on a computer network\" that requires three steps: \"generating a screen display at a respective reception system for a requested application;\" \"generating at least a first partition for presenting applications;\" and \"generating concurrently with the first partition at least a second partition for presenting a plurality of command functions.\" The specific computer-centric improvement is claimed in the first step, which requires that the screen display be \"generated by the respective reception system from data objects\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ... at least some of which objects may be stored at the respective reception system, the screen display including a plurality of partitions, the partitions being constructed from objects ... retrieved from the objects stored at the respective reception system, or if unavailable ..., then from the network.\" This method allows the computer to function more quickly by speeding the data storage process and reducing memory requirements, allowing the computer to serve more users.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Furthermore, contrary to Groupon's assertion that the claims of the Filepp patents \"merely use 'result-based functional language,' without disclosing\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     how\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to achieve the result\" (D.I. 192 at 2) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267251\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/1329/\">\n    874 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1337-38 ), the Filepp patents' claims are, in fact, more specific than those at issue in\n   <em>\n    Two-Way Media.\n   </em>\n   Rather than broadly using only generic functional language (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , solely claiming the step of \"generating a screen display\" without more), the Filepp patents' claims go on to describe the specific\n   architecture behind the claimed computer improvement by reciting how the screen display is generated (in part, by selectively-stored data objects at the respective reception system) and what it is generated from (data objects and partitions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Claims 1, 13, and 14 of the '849 patent similarly require \"configuring the advertising as objects that include advertising data\" and \"selectively storing advertising objects at a store established at the reception system.\" Claims 8 and 21 of the '849 patent require \"structuring advertising so that it may be selectively supplied to and retrieved at the reception systems for presentation to the respective users in accordance with the characterizations established for the respective reception system users\" and \"storing a predetermined amount of the advertising data in a store established at the respective reception systems.\" As a whole, the claims of the Filepp patents are not directed to local data storage generally, but recite specific features for improving computer functionality by generating screen displays and partitions by breaking the data content of applications or advertisements into objects, storing them locally, and selectively retrieving them when needed. This method reduces the processing demand on the host system, allowing the host to function more efficiently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Enfish\n   </em>\n   , this Court's finding \"that the claims are directed to an improvement of an existing technology is bolstered by the specification's teachings that the claimed invention achieves other benefits over conventional databases.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282681\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1327/\">\n    822 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1337 ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , '967 patent at 6:56-7:2, '849 patent at 6:57-7:3 (\"RS [ (Reception System) ] 400 includes a means to selectively store objects according to predetermined storage criterion, thus enabling frequently used objects to be stored locally at the RS, and causing infrequently used objects to forfeit their local storage location....

The claims are not directed to the abstract idea of data storage generally, but, rather, claim a specific implementation of computer-centric problem. The Court finds that the asserted claims of the Filepp patents are patent-eligible under step 1. The Court need not continue to step 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Groupon contends that the preemption threat of the Filepp patents is \"unacceptably high.\" (D.I. 30 at 18) In Groupon's view, the claims, as construed, \"cover any technology that generates a meaningful display of information to a user of a computer using some locally stored information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The focus of a preemption analysis is on whether the claims would \" 'disproportionately\n   t[ie] up the use of the underlying' ideas.\"\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2355\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188353\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/66/\">\n    132 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1294 ). The Court finds that the asserted claims of the Filepp patents do not tie up use of all technologies that generate a display using some locally stored data. As discussed above, the claims do more than relate to data storage generally; they claim a specific improvement implemented by breaking applications (or advertisements) into data objects and allowing for particularized local storage. Moreover, the claims do not preempt all manners of improving data storage. As IBM contends, \"[o]ne alternative is to transfer the entire interactive application to user reception systems at once, instead of breaking it up into data objects,\" and \"[a]nother alternative is to require users to retrieve content from the server each time the user interacts with the application, instead of storing data objects at the user reception system.\" (D.I. 37 at 19) The Court is persuaded that still other alternatives are also available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the asserted claims of the Filepp patents do not run afoul of preemption concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the asserted claims of the Filepp patents are not directed to an abstract idea and are directed to patent-eligible subject matter.
