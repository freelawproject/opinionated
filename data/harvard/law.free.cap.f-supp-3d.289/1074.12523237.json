INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Defendants Trader Joe's Company and Trader Joe's East Inc. (collectively, \"Trader Joe's\") move to dismiss Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\") on several bases. (ECF No. 55.) On June 2, 2017, the Court granted Trader Joe's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\"), with leave to amend. (ECF No. 54.) For the reasons discussed below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS, IN PART,\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES, IN PART,\n   </strong>\n   Trader Joe's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs allege a consumer class action relating to Trader Joe's allegedly illegal\n   and deceptive practices of under filling cans of tuna, despite consumers' expectations that the cans would contain an \"adequate amount.\" (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 1, 12-13, ECF No. 55.) Plaintiff Sarah Magier is a citizen of New York who purchased Trader Joe's Albacore Tuna in Water No Salt Added in New York, through the end of 2013, and wishes to represent a subclass of all class members who purchased Trader Joe's tuna in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 20.) Plaintiff Atzimba Reyes is a citizen of California, and purchased 5-ounce canned Trader Joe's Albacore Tuna in Water Salt Added. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) Reyes wishes to represent a subclass of all Californians who purchased Trader Joe's tuna. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As described in detail in the Court's prior order, (ECF No. 54), Plaintiffs determined that the Trader Joe's tuna cans were underfilled and underweight by commissioning testing with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (\"NOAA\") on December 1, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 2-7.) NOAA conducted this testing by evaluating the pressed cake weight (\"Pressed Weight Standard\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20161.190\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 161.190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). The Pressed Weight Standard is measured by using a complex process requiring specific machinery, and was promulgated by the FDA in 1957.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20161.190\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; (Mot. 3.) The NOAA tests based on this method determined that several varieties of Trader Joe's tuna fell 19.2%, 24.8%, 24.8%, 11.1%, 9.9%, and 13.9% below the Pressed Weight Standard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 2-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Trader Joe's canned tuna labels do not contain any statements regarding the \"pressed weight,\" but do contain representations as to the \"net weight\" (5 oz.), and the \"drained weight\" (4 oz.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice (\"RJN\"), Ex. 1, ECF Nos. 62-2, 62-4.) NOAA also tested the \"net weight\" and the \"drained weight\" of the tuna. (RJN, Ex. 2, ECF Nos. 62-2, 62-5.) Trader Joe's contends that, according to the NOAA tests, neither the average \"net weight\" nor average \"drained weight\" ever tested below 5 oz. or 4 oz., respectively. (Mot. 3.) Plaintiffs do not dispute this. As discussed at length in the Court's prior Order, (ECF No. 54), Trader Joe's criticizes the Pressed Weight Standard, which is currently under reconsideration by the FDA, as being outdated and inaccurate. (Mot. 3-4.) Trader Joe's also claims that its alleged failure to follow the Pressed Weight Standard did not deceive consumers because the temporary marketing permit (\"TMP\") the FDA granted to Chicken of the Sea International, Bumble Bee Foods, LLC, and StarKist Co. (collectively, \"Major Tuna Producers\") allows them to market tuna without having to comply with the labeling requirements associated with the Pressed Weight Standard. (Mot. 3-4; ECF No. 54.) Federal Regulations require producers of tuna to state, \"Below Standard in Fill,\" on cans of tuna that do not comply with the Pressed Weight Standard, unless the FDA granted the manufacturer a TMP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20161.190\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 161.190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20130.14\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The FDA extended TMP for the Major Tuna Producers indefinitely on March 7, 2016.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011813\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 11813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (RJN, Ex. 7.) Trader Joe's does not allege that they are currently\n   included in the TMP, but maintain that they applied in February 2017. (RJN, Ex. 8, ECF No. 62-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since the Court's prior Order dismissing the FAC on preemption grounds, Plaintiffs' SAC alleges three new categories of fact. First, instead of only violating the \"federally mandated minimum standard of fill\" set forth in title 21, sections 130.14(b) and 161.190 of the\n   <em>\n    Code of Federal Regulations\n   </em>\n   (SAC \u00b6 1), Trader Joe's also violates California's Sherman Food, Drug and Cosmetic Law (\"Sherman Law\"), which prescribes labeling requirements for certain foods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Plaintiffs also allege that Trader Joe's \"conduct runs contrary to the standard practices and procedures of other tuna manufacturers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Finally, Plaintiffs allege they relied on the statements on the label in making their purchases, and would not have purchased the tuna \"if the labels had properly contained the statement 'Below Standard in Fill,' \" as required by title 21, section 130.14 of the\n   <em>\n    Code of Federal Regulations\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs' SAC alleges claims for: breach of express warranty (Count I), breach of implied warranty of merchantability (Count II), unjust enrichment (Count III), negligent misrepresentation (Count VI), and fraud (Count VII). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SAC.) Plaintiff Magier also brings claims on behalf of herself and the New York subclass for violation of New York General Business Law sections 349, 350. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Counts IV &amp; V.) Plaintiff Reyes also brings claims on behalf of herself and the California subclass for violation of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"), Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), and False Advertising Law (\"FAL\").

LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A motion to dismiss under either Rule 12(c) or 12(b)(6) is proper where the plaintiff fails to allege a cognizable legal theory or where there is an absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Trader Joe's moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' SAC on several different grounds: (1) implied preemption; (2) the doctrine of primary jurisdiction; (3) equitable abstention; and (4) a failure to state a viable claim. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Implied Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Preemption may be express or implied.\n   <em>\n    Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730146\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/470/#p484\">\n    518 U.S. 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484-85,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730146\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/470/#p484\">\n    116 S.Ct. 2240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1730146\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/518/470/#p484\">\n    135 L.Ed.2d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). Express preemption occurs where Congress explicitly preempts state law.\n   <em>\n    Chae v. SLM Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517393\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/936/#p941\">\n    593 F.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 941 (9th Cir. 2010). Implied preemption occurs where: 1) \"state law actually conflicts with federal law;\" or 2) \"federal law occupies a legislative field to such an extent that it is reasonable to conclude that Congress left no room for state regulation in that field.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517393\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/936/#p941\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While, at times, the parties' briefing blurs the lines between these two distinct types of preemption, at issue here, is whether Plaintiffs' claims are impliedly preempted by the FDCA's mandate that all actions to enforce the FDCA are brought in the name of the United States, or, in limited circumstances, the states.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20337\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the prior Order, the Court held that Plaintiffs' claims were impliedly preempted because Plaintiffs' purported state-law claims did not sufficiently \"thread the gap\" within the Ninth Circuit's rule in\n   <em>\n    Perez v. Nidek Co.\n   </em>\n   and were actually an attempt to improperly enforce the FDCA. (June 2, 2017 Order, ECF No. 54.) Now, Plaintiffs assert claims under California's Sherman Law, which they claim provides an independent basis for relief, and precludes a finding of preemption. (Opp'n Part II.A, ECF No. 63.) Plaintiffs also maintain that the claims based on New York law also provide a right of action that is not an attempt to enforce the FDCA. (Opp'n 2-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   There is some tension in the law when it comes to courts' application of Supreme Court preemption precedent because the opinions, as well as the parties, often rely on express preemption cases, in an implied preemption scenario, and vice versa. The Court is guided by \"the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v.

In that instance, Plaintiffs would not be relying on the FDCA, but rather the standard set forth in California's Sherman Law. The fact that the California law does not specifically set forth the Pressed Weight Standard results from consideration of practicalities. If California were required to update its statutes every time the federal government changed a standard, it would constantly have statutes stating standards that did not mirror the federal scheme, which would then be expressly preempted by Section 343-1(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Samet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203124647\">\n    2013 WL 3124647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6.

Further, a significant portion of the parties' briefing is dedicated to describing the practices of the Major Tuna Producers, who, because of the TMP, do not have to identify their tuna cans as being \"Below Standard in Fill.\" Thus, consumers in the market are presented with at least three other tuna manufacturers whose \"standard practices and procedures\" are to do exactly what Trader Joe's does. Thus, this allegation does not set forth facts sufficient for the Court to find it plausible that a reasonable consumer would be misled on this basis. Plaintiffs have leave to amend this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At the hearing on Trader Joe's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' FAC, counsel explained that the potential for confusion, as it relates to the Pressed Weight Standard, occurs because there may be varying amounts of water or oil in the can, in addition to the tuna. The labels of all of the cans at issue here state directly on the front of the label in conspicuous text the various species of tuna, and phrases such as, \"in Olive Oil,\" or \"in Water.\" (RJN, Ex. 1, ECF No. 62-11.) Given that a reasonable consumer must consider his or her preference for water or olive oil in choosing a product to purchase, the Court finds it hard to imagine that such a consumer, acting reasonably, would not know that the contents of the can they are purchasing includes fish\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   water or oil.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ebner v.

A reasonable consumer, while appreciating that the tuna can would contain tuna and water or oil, may be misled if the amount of water or oil in the can is excessive.

Trader Joe's contends that to adequately allege that the can is misleading Plaintiffs need to set forth in detail the process Plaintiffs used to test the tuna pursuant to the Pressed Weight Standard, which they did not. (Mot. 15.)

Plaintiffs contend that they allege a claim because in addition to a product being suitable for its intended use-to eat-the implied warranty provides that the product is \"adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require\" and \"[c]onform[s] to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202314\">\n    Cal.

The Court grants Trader Joe's request and takes notice of the items identified in Trader Joe's Request for Judicial Notice (ECF No. 62) because the SAC necessarily relies on these documents, and neither party objects to their authenticity; in fact, the NOAA results are addressed to Plaintiffs' counsel.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
