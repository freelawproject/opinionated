The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (\"plaintiff\" or \"the Commonwealth\") alleges that the departments' issuance of the IFRs violates the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and the United States Constitution. The IFRs expand the religious exemption to the Affordable Care Act's (\"ACA\") contraceptive mandate and create a new moral exemption to that mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dordt College, a \"Christ-centered institution of higher learning located in Sioux Center, Iowa,\" and March for Life Education and Defense Fund (\"March for Life\"), a \"pro-life, non-sectarian advocacy organization\" located in Washington, D.C., are employers that wish to avail themselves of, respectively, the expanded religious exemption and the moral exemption. Both employers seek to avoid having to provide certain hormonal drugs and devices, perceived to be abortifacients, which are required by the contraceptive mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court is the motion to intervene of Dordt College and March for Life (collectively \"putative intervenors\"). Because the putative intervenors have failed to establish that their interests will not be adequately represented by the named defendants, that motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dordt College and March for Life\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Dordt College is a Reformed Christian institution of higher education located in Sioux Center, Iowa. The College is a non-denominational agency of the Christian Reformed Church of North America (CRCNA). An incorporated society composed primarily of the CRCNA owns and controls the College. The College \"unreservedly shares the Christian Reformed Church's religious views regarding abortion.\" That includes the belief that the\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   procurement of, participation in, facilitation of, or payment for abortion (including abortion-causing drugs and devices like Plan B and ella) violate the Sixth Commandment and is inconsistent with the dignity conferred by God on creatures made in His image.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The College also fulfills its religious commitments by providing health insurance to employees and their dependents and to students through a student health plan. The employee health plan offers various FDA-approved contraceptive methods but \"excludes ella and Plan B, which can and sometimes do act as abortifacients.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   March for Life is a nonprofit advocacy group that exists \"to oppose the destruction of human life at any stage before birth, including by abortifacient methods.\" The organization, \"[based] on scientific fact and medical knowledge ... holds as a basic tenet that human life begins at conception.\" Accordingly, March for Life is morally opposed to providing coverage for abortions or abortifacients in its health insurance plan. The organization opposes coverage of certain hormonal drugs and devices included in the ACA's contraceptive mandate that \"may prevent or dislodge an implanted human embryo after fertilization, thereby causing its death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The contraceptive mandate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The ACA generally requires that employer-sponsored healthcare plans include a range of preventive care services on a no-cost basis (\"the preventive services requirement\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018022\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   &amp; 300gg-13. That requirement mandates no-cost coverage\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   with respect to women, ... as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration [\"HRSA\"].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   S. Amdt. 2791, 111\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Congress (2009-2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, instead of including specific preventive care services, Congress delegated authority to HRSA, an agency within HHS. HRSA and HHS enlisted the Institute of Medicine (\"IOM\"), which convened a committee to assess what preventive services should be included. The IOM recommended that the services include\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient\n   education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   IOM Report at 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, when the HRSA promulgated its Women's Preventive Services Guidelines in August 2011, non-exempt employers became required to provide \"coverage, without cost sharing,\" for \"[a]ll Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling\" (\"the contraceptive mandate\"). Those guidelines went into effect in August, 2012. The HRSA updated the Women's Preventive Services Guidelines in December 2016, reaffirming that the Guidelines should continue to require full coverage for contraceptive care and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Accommodations for religious objections to the contraceptive mandate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In 2011, the relevant federal Departments issued regulations automatically exempting churches and their integrated auxiliaries, conventions and associations of churches and the exclusively religious activities of religious orders from the contraceptive care requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2013, the Departments issued regulations providing an accommodation for objecting religious non-profit organizations. The accommodation created a system whereby insurers and third parties paid the full cost of contraceptive care and employees received seamless coverage (\"the accommodation process\"). That process was expanded to cover closely held, for-profit companies in response to\n   <em>\n    Burwell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), in which the Supreme Court held that the contraceptive mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") for certain closely-held, for-profit employers.

In May, 2016, those cases were remanded to their respective circuit courts for further consideration of whether the accommodation process could be altered to address the religious employers' concerns while still providing seamless contraceptive coverage. In January, 2017, after reviewing more than 50,000 comments, the Departments announced that the answer was \"No\". No alternative, the Departments explained, would pose a lesser burden on religious exercise while ensuring contraceptive coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Dordt College and March for Life concede that they share a similar ultimate goal with the federal government but stress that their interests are \"distinct, direct and substantial and [ ] different in both kind and degree\" from the interests of the federal defendants. Such a difference does not constitute \"adversity of interest, collusion or nonfeasance\", even keeping in mind that those conditions are merely illustrative. It is true that Dordt College and March for Life engaged in a protracted legal battle against these very defendants primarily to obtain the legal protections that are contained in the IFRs.
