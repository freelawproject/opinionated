INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Owen Partridge brought this action, which seeks to recover unpaid wages against American Hospital Management Company, LLC (\"LLC\"); American Hospital Management Company, LMT (\"LMT\"); and Randall D. Arlett, who is President, Chief Executive Officer, and Managing Director of both corporations. Before this Court considered a motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration filed by Defendants or reached the merits of Mr. Partridge's claims, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, which the Court approved and incorporated into a consent decree. Unfortunately, however, entry of the settlement agreement and consent decree did not end this dispute. Several payment deadlines have passed but, according to Mr. Partridge, no money has changed hands. Consequently, the Court has agreed to revisit and rule on the parties' three pre-settlement motions: (1) Plaintiff's motion to strike an errata sheet filed by Defendants, (2) Defendants' motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration, and (3) Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Also before the Court is a motion by Defendants' counsel requesting permission to withdraw his representation. For the reasons explained below, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion to strike and denies Defendants' motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration. The Court grants Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment against Defendant LMT on the breach of contract count, but otherwise denies Plaintiff's motion. The Court also grants Defendants' counsel's motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Partridge initiated this action against his former employers-LLC, LMT, and Mr. Arlett-alleging that they have failed to pay him more than $107,000 in wages that he earned managing a hospital facility on their behalf in Tbilisi, Georgia. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 23, 37, ECF No. 2. In Count One of his Complaint, Mr. Partridge claims that Defendants breached two separate employment agreements (collectively \"the Agreements\")-a two-year agreement that he had entered with LMT in December 2015 (\"First Agreement\") and another agreement that he had entered with either LCC or both LLC and Mr. Arlett in or about August 2016 (\"Second Agreement\") which purported to ensure strict compliance with the terms of the First Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 23, 25-26, 29, 41-43. Mr. Partridge also contends that Defendants violated the District of Columbia Wage Payment and Collection Law by withholding wages (Count Two) and committed fraud by misrepresenting their intent to perform under the Agreements (Count Three).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-57. In addition, Mr. Partridge seeks a judgment declaring that a non-competition provision in the First Agreement is invalid as an unreasonable\n   restraint on trade (Count Five).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-72. The relevant provisions state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   During the term of [the First Agreement], [Mr. Partridge] shall devote his work efforts exclusively to the performance of this Agreement and shall not, without [LMT's] prior written consent, render to others services of any kind for compensation, or engage in any other business activity that would materially interfere with the performance of his duties under this Agreement. [Mr. Partridge] cannot work directly for Sayali Group D/B/A American Hospital Tbilisi during this time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   .........\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   During the [First Agreement] term, [Mr. Partridge] shall not, in any fashion participate or engage in any activity or other business competitive with [LMT]. In addition, [Mr. Partridge], while engaged by [LMT] shall not take any action without [LMT's] prior written consent to establish, form, or become employed by a competing business on termination of employment by [LMT]. [Mr. Partridge's] failure to comply with the provisions of the preceding sentence shall give [LMT] the right (in addition to all other remedies [LMT] may have to terminate any benefits that [Mr. Partridge] may be otherwise entitled to following termination of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Compl., Ex.

Erratta [sic] Sheet to Its Mot. Dismiss (\"Errata Sheet\") at 1, ECF No. 14. The motion to dismiss pointed to an arbitration clause in the First Agreement, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction....

Each party shall pay the fees of the arbitrator he selects and of his own attorneys, and the expenses of his witnesses and all other expenses connected with presenting his case. Other costs of the arbitration, including the cost of any record or transcripts of the arbitration, administrative fees, the fees of the third arbitrator, and all other fees and costs, shall be borne equally by the parties.

A at 5, ECF No. 2. Defendants also asked the Court to dismiss any claims asserted against Mr. Arlett as an individual, arguing that Mr. Arlett had not signed any agreement with Mr. Partridge in his personal capacity and that no pleading justified piercing the corporate veil to hold Mr. Arlett liable for any actions taken by LLC and LMT. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Soon after, Mr. Partridge asked the Court to strike counsel's errata sheet, arguing that LMT had purposely declined to join the motion to dismiss and that an errata sheet could not be used to join a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Strike Errata Sheet \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, ECF No. 15.

The \"lack of communication has le[d] to a deteriorated attorney-client relationship,\" counsel claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Moreover, counsel asserts that Defendants have \"outstanding legal bills in arrears.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Counsel maintains that his withdrawal can be accomplished with minimal prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On July 10, 2017, with Defendants' counsel's withdrawal motion still under advisement, Mr. Partridge filed a motion with the Court, which supplied the parties' settlement agreement and asked the Court to incorporate its terms into a consent decree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Enter Settlement Agreement, ECF No. 28. The settlement agreement-which, per its terms, became enforceable when Mr. Arlett signed it on June 19, 2017-specified that the Defendants would provide Mr. Partridge an initial payment of $50,000 by July 19, 2017. Consent Decree \u00b6\u00b6 1, 11, ECF No. 31. \"Upon receipt of the Initial Payment,\" the parties would \"release and covenant not to sue each other\" and would \"lodge a consent decree memorializing these terms and, except as necessary to enforce the decree, dismiss the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.

App. for a Rule to Show Cause Why Defs. Should Not Be\n   Held in Contempt of Court, ECF No. 35. According to Mr. Partridge, \"despite [Mr.] Arlett's representations that he would make payments, that he already had made payments, and that he would provide confirmation of payments,\" no payments-not even the initial payment of $50,000-have been made.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1308\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1 &amp; \u00b6 11. At the first of two status conferences held shortly after Mr. Partridge filed his show cause motion, the Court explained that it had viewed Defendants' payment of the initial $50,000 as a condition precedent to the parties' filing of the consent decree. Having heard for the first time through Plaintiff's show cause motion that no initial payment had been made, this Court thought it unwise to merely enforce the terms of the consent decree. Rather, the Court agreed to revisit the parties' pre-settlement motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court ordered Mr. Arlett to appear for a second status conference to be held the next month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 36 (\"[T]he parties, including individual Defendant Randall Arlett, shall appear for a status conference on September 19, 2017....\").

Mr. Partridge argues that the errata sheet, which clarified that Defendants' counsel had intended to submit the motion to dismiss on behalf of all three defendants, is not the appropriate means through which to join a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1308\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1308\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The use of errata sheets,\" he contends, \"is restricted to correcting typographic, stenographic, or other inconsequential errors.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1308\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1308\">\n    \u00b6 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

True enough, errata sheets are typically-and, perhaps, appropriately-used only to correct inconsequential errors. And instead of filing an errata sheet, Defendants' counsel likely should have sought leave to amend his motion to dismiss or requested an extension to permit him to file a separate motion to dismiss on behalf of LMT. But it is difficult to gather why the styling of Defendants' counsel's filing should predominate the Court's analysis. In all cases, the Court has substantial discretion to permit the filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cohen v. Bd. of Trustees of the Univ. of the Dist. of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310477,4252886\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/476/\">\n    819 F.3d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479-80 (D.C.

The Court is simply not persuaded that Defendants' counsel acted in bad faith in neglecting to include LMT in the motion to dismiss. Nor is the Court convinced that Plaintiff has suffered substantial prejudice due to the clarification. Mr. Partridge seemingly hopes that the Court will strike counsel's errata sheet, find that LMT failed to timely answer the complaint, declare LMT in default, and proceed toward a default judgment. As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Canady\n   </em>\n   , \"[s]uch a result ... would contravene the established policies disfavoring motions to strike, and favoring the resolution of cases on their merits.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263773\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/307/2/#p7\">\n    307 F.Supp.2d at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Accordingly, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion to strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Second, Defendants ask the Court to compel arbitration of claims asserted against LLC and LMT pursuant to an arbitration clause in the First Agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263773\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/307/2/#p7\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263773\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/307/2/#p7\">\n    at 5-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Namely, after Defendants filed their motion to compel arbitration and their response in opposition to Plaintiff's request for summary judgment, they consented to the filing of a settlement agreement for entry by this Court as a consent decree. In that agreement, the parties claimed to have resolved matters that would otherwise be heard through arbitration.

If Defendants had wanted to maintain the right to pursue arbitration, they needed only wait for the Court to rule on their motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration. Moreover, they could have reached an out-of-court settlement which did not subject them to this Court's jurisdiction. Instead, by their own conduct, Defendants mooted their motion to compel arbitration and prolonged resolution of this matter.

In support of their request for delay or denial of Plaintiff's motion, Defendants assert that affidavits submitted along with Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment come from individuals \"who may have a bias against the Defendants.\" Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 8. Defendants declare that, through discovery, they hope to scrutinize the \"motivation[s]\" of these individuals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Furthermore, they contend that other evidence offered by Plaintiff \"does not necessarily show [that] LLC had a duty to pay Plaintiff, Arlett had a duty to play Plaintiff[,] or that LMT was in breach of its duty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. This request is far too vague to justify denying or deferring action on Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. First, Defendants' contention about what sort of evidence discovery might produce is utterly speculative. Defendants have provided this Court with no reason to believe that discovery may produce statements that undermine the credibility of the affidavits Plaintiff has submitted. Second, Defendants have not made clear to this Court why the facts they intend to discover might be necessary to this litigation. For example, Defendants state only that they generally mistrust a declaration submitted by Jacquelyn Martin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 8. But they fail to specifically deny any assertion made in that declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Furthermore, it is readily apparent that Defendants are in a position to challenge many of the material factual allegations critical to this dispute. For example, Defendants have said nothing to dispute that at least some of them owe Mr. Partridge unpaid wages. Nor have they disputed the amount of unpaid wages owed. The Court struggles to imagine why Defendants would lack access to information that might enable them to show whether they have paid Mr. Partridge at all and, if so, how much they have paid him. Accordingly, it is not apparent to the Court how discovery might better enable Defendants to oppose Plaintiff's motion, when much of the information at issue in this case is already in their possession. As Defendants\n   have not shown why they might need additional discovery, the Court has no reason to delay resolving the motion until after discovery is taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Because the First Agreement unambiguously created a duty for LMT to pay Mr. Partridge and because LMT does not dispute that it breached that duty, the Court will enter judgment against LMT on this claim.

Indeed, Defendant LMT does not dispute that Mr. Partridge performed as required by the agreement or that it failed to pay Mr. Partridge according to the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Mr. Partridge asserts that they are nonetheless liable for breach of that agreement because they are alter egos of LMT.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ at 21-23. He provides insufficient support, however, to justify summary judgment in his favor. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovants, genuine issues of material fact remain regarding whether Mr. Arlett and LLC are alter egos of LMT such that they can be held liable for LMT's breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TAC-Critical Sys., Inc. v.

Indeed, Mr. Partridge's own argument that LMT alone failed to join a motion to dismiss submitted by the other Defendants seems to undermine his argument that the three parties are essentially one and the same. The Court denies Plaintiff's motion to the extent that it seeks judgment against LLC and Mr. Arlett for obligations under the First Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Second Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Mr. Partridge contends that even if LLC and Mr. Arlett are not liable for breach of the First Agreement, they are liable for breach of the Second Agreement in which they offered Mr. Partridge \"iron clad assurance[s]\" that future payments would be made in a timely manner, consistent with the terms of the First Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 II.E. Defendants dispute whether the Second Agreement constitutes a separate enforceable contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 9-10. Both parties present reasonable arguments to support their respective understandings of the contractual provision.

Summary Judgment on Count Two is Denied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Partridge also moves for summary judgment on Count Two, which asserts that Defendants violated the DCWPCL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2032-1301\">\n    D.C.

He also cites a handful of cases, which he contends counsel in favor of an interpretation of the DCWPCL that reaches employers outside of the District of Columbia. Pl.'s MSJ at 24 n.18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Lincoln-Odumu v. Med. Faculty Assoc., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206427645\">\n    2016 WL 6427645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. July 8, 2016) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As the Court explained above, the First Agreement is clearly and definitely an employment agreement promising certain wages to Mr. Partridge and obligating Defendant LMT to pay those wages. LMT employed Mr. Arlett. The Second Agreement, however, does not unambiguously outline any obligation for any defendant. And while Mr. Partridge has supplied enough evidence to show that LMT employed him, issues of fact remain regarding whether LLC or Mr. Arlett are alter egos of LMT. Therefore, issues remain regarding whether LLC and Mr. Arlett are Mr. Partridge's employers under the First Agreement. In light of the ambiguity, the Court will only consider whether LMT is Mr. Partridge's employer under the DCWPCL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On this record, the Court cannot say that Defendant LMT was Mr. Partridge's employer under the DCWPCL because Mr. Partridge has not demonstrated that LMT employed him in the District of Columbia. Mr. Partridge asserts that LMT is headquartered in the District of Columbia, but LMT appears to dispute that fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 3 (asserting that \"LMT is an Antigua &amp; Barbados Company\"). Mr. Partridge also asserts that communications sent from\n   LMT were transmitted from the District of Columbia. Even assuming that such a tenuous connection to the District of Columbia might suffice to say that an entity employed someone \"in the District of Columbia,\" Mr. Partridge, who performed his duties in Tbilisi, Georgia, supplies no evidence to support his claim. Because issues of material fact remain regarding whether any defendant employed Mr. Partridge in the District of Columbia, this Court denies Mr. Partridge's motion with respect to Count Two.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Summary Judgment on Count Five is Denied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Mr. Partridge argues that he is entitled to a declaration that he is not bound by restrictions on his prospective employment found in the First Agreement. Specifically, he argues that the Court should release him from any restrictions on his employment because LMT breached the First Agreement and, therefore, his performance is excused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s MSJ at 28. Mr. Partridge relies upon only one case, which interprets and applies Massachusetts law, to support his argument. Pl.'s MSJ at 28 (citing\n   <em>\n    L.G. Balfour Co. v. McGinnis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091324\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/759/840/#p845\">\n    759 F.Supp. 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (D.D.C. 1991) ). As Massachusetts law does not apply to the interpretation of any agreement in this case and Mr. Partridge has not demonstrated that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law under applicable law, his motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Counsel's Motion to Withdraw is Granted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, the Court considers whether Defendants' counsel should be permitted to withdraw from this case. In support of his request, counsel cites his \"deteriorating relationship\" with his clients, his clients' purported failure to pay for legal services he has provided, and counsel's belief that withdrawal can be accomplished without prejudice to the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Counsel Mot. to Withdraw at 1-2, ECF No. 27; Defs.' Counsel Reply to Pl.'s Resp. to Mot. to Withdraw at 2-3, ECF No. 32. Per Mr. Arlett's e-mail communication to the Court on September 19, 2017, Defendants do not oppose counsel's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arlett Letter, ECF No. 41. On the other hand, Plaintiff asks the Court to deny the motion, arguing that he will be prejudiced if Defendants' counsel is permitted to withdraw \"at this time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to Defs.' Counsel's Mot. to Withdraw at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Local Rule 83.6(c) bars an attorney from withdrawing except by court order when a trial date has been set, a party's written consent has not been obtained, or the party is not represented by another attorney. Local Civ. R. 83.6(c). The present motion to withdraw falls within the ambit of Local Rule 83.6(c) because no successor counsel has appeared to represent Defendants. A court has discretion to grant or deny an attorney's motion to withdraw.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sabre Int'l Sec. v. Torres Advanced Enter. Sols., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271156\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/219/155/#p158\">\n    219 F.Supp.3d 155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (D.D.C. 2016). Generally, a court will deny a motion if \"withdrawal would unduly delay trial of the case\"-a factor inapplicable here because no trial date has been set-or if withdrawal would \"be unfairly prejudicial to any party, or otherwise not be in the interest of justice.\" Local Civ. R. 83.6(d). Courts consider, among other things and as relevant, \"the length of time the case and dispositive motions have been pending, the time it would take for the unrepresented party to search for and secure new legal representation, and that degree of financial burden that counsel would suffer if the court required him to remain in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Laster v.

First, the Court takes note that, according to counsel, Defendants are in arrears on payments due for legal services already provided in this case. This Court recognizes that \"an attorney should not be in a position where he or she has not been paid, and yet must continue to work for the client at his or her own expense.\"\n   <em>\n    Honda Power Equip.

Polytop Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20Fed.%20Appx.%2037\">\n    2 Fed.Appx. 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39-40 (1st Cir. 2001) )). Second, the Court will take into account the deteriorated relationship between counsel and Defendants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Sabre Int'l Security\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271156\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/219/155/#p158\">\n    219 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   158-59 ;\n   <em>\n    Honda Power Equip.

The record reveals little about when and why the attorney-client relationship broke down, and neither counsel nor Defendants express a view about whether any conflicts might be reconcilable. But it stands to reason that, should current counsel remain in this case, there may be difficulties ahead for both counsel and Defendants if they are unable to communicate and to agree on how to proceed in this litigation. Third, more than three months have passed since Defendants represented that they needed thirty days to secure new counsel. Despite having had plenty of time, no new counsel has appeared on their behalf. The Court cannot permit Defendants to bring this litigation to a standstill by keeping current counsel in limbo. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' counsel's motion to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   While allowing Defendants' counsel to withdraw resolves one problem, it raises another. It is well-established that \"[a] corporation cannot represent itself and cannot appear\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . It must be represented by counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Alexian Bros. Med. Ctr. v.

In addition, this Court's Local Rules do not permit appointment of counsel to corporations in civil matters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Civ. R. 83.11(b)(3) (limiting appointment of counsel to\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants, a status denied to corporations). Accordingly, now that counsel has withdrawn, although Mr. Arlett may proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , LLC and LMT cannot. Defendants LLC and LMT must immediately seek new counsel-if counsel has not already been retained-and have new counsel appear in this matter within 30 days. If no counsel appears by such date, Plaintiff may seek appropriate relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The Court denies Plaintiff's motion to strike and denies Defendants' motion to dismiss and to compel arbitration. The Court grants Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment against Defendant LMT on the breach of contract count, but otherwise denies Plaintiff's motion. The Court also grants Defendants' counsel's motion to withdraw. The parties, including Defendant Mr. Arlett, if proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , must appear for a status hearing on\n   <strong>\n    January 31, 2018 at 11:00 AM\n   </strong>\n   in Courtroom 14.
