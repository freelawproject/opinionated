The appellate court summarized the facts of the murder as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   The State's evidence showed that [Mejia] went with Johnny Arce to a bar in order to help him fight some people. A fight resulted including several people, including [Mejia] and the victim, Marcos Torres. During the fight Marcos Torres was stabbed in the heart and killed. Minutes later [Mejia] told his sister, \"I cut him,\" and \"[H]e had a gun.\" \"It was\n   either my life or his.\" Afterwards he went to an apartment where he told John Gomez that he had \"stabbed some dude.\" [Mejia] showed Gomez how he had stabbed the victim; he reached back with his left hand and pulled the knife out of his left, rear pants pocket and stabbed forward. [Mejia] indicated that he had stabbed him in the middle of the chest. Lorenzo Dominguez was present when [Mejia] arrived at the apartment. He heard [Mejia] say, \"I got the mother f----. I stabbed him.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The medical examiner's testimony showed that Torres died from a stab wound to the heart. He testified that the knife used to kill Torres was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Mejia] testified that when the fight started Torres swung at him, and he pushed Torres back twice. Torres lifted up his shirt, revealing a gun. As Torres approached him and started pulling out the gun [Mejia] pulled out a knife and stabbed him. His testimony was that he did not mean to stab him. He admitted that he could have turned and run away from Torres without pulling the knife.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Mejia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%2034252057\">\n    2000 WL 34252057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At Mejia's trial for murder, Luna did not request, and the trial court did not give, any jury instructions regarding lesser included offense of manslaughter, which would have carried a maximum prison sentence of twenty years. Rather, he relied entirely on the argument that Mejia had acted in self-defense. At the charging conference for the guilt-innocence phase, when the court explicitly noted that the charge did not submit any lesser included offenses to the jury, Luna confirmed that he wanted to submit the charge without any such instructions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   THE COURT: Do you have any further requested instructions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   MR. LUNA: No further requested instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: This does not include submission of any lesser-anything on any lesser included offenses to the jury, based upon the testimony and the position-and the self-defense instruction. This is the Charge of the Court that you want to submit; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   MR. LUNA: That is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Reporter's Record [Doc. # 9-15], at 84-85. The jury rejected self-defense and returned a verdict of murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At the charging conference for the punishment phase of Mejia's trial, the drafted charge did not include a \"sudden passion\" instruction. When asked by the court, Luna declined the opportunity to submit any further instruction to the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   THE COURT: Ya'll have had a Charge of the Court as to Punishment earlier, so you've had an opportunity to read through it. If the State's ready, do you have any objections or further requested instructions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   MR. HARDY: No, your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   THE COURT: If the defendant's ready?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   MR. LUNA: Yes, we're ready.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   THE COURT: Do you have any objections or further requested instructions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   MR. LUNA: No, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   THE COURT: I'll have the clerk file stamp it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Reporter's Record [Doc. # 9-17], at 116. The sudden passion defense, if successful, would have reduced the maximum term of imprisonment to twenty years. The jury returned with a sentence of life imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After Mejia's conviction was affirmed on direct appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mejia filed a state habeas\n   petition claiming that Luna rendered ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to request jury instructions on manslaughter and sudden passion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Luna provided an affidavit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Writ 75,944-02 [Doc. # 9-23], at 39-42 (\"Luna Affidavit\"), stating that his exclusive theory of the case was self-defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   GROUND TWO: Trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request lesser included instructions on criminal negligent homicide, manslaughter, and sudden passion in support [of] the evidence presented during trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   RESPONSE:\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The strategy of the whole trial was self-defense.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   This was brought out in voir dire and in questioning of all the witnesses. The testimony of the whole trial centered around applicant's contention that the deceased had a gun. My recollection was that applicant's position was that he was not guilty of any thing [sic] because of his self defense strategy. That was why he plead[ed] not guilty and agreed to testify on his behalf on this contention of self-defense. There was no evidence of any provocation on behalf of the deceased. Applicant had gone to the confrontation with the knowledge of the purpose and had armed himself with the weapon, a knife.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Luna Affidavit, at 40 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The state habeas court rejected Mejia's claim. The habeas court's opinion read, in its entirety, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   On the 3rd day of December, 2012, the Trial Court determines as follows after having reviewed the pleadings and papers filed in this application, the Reporter's Record of the trial, after viewing State's Exhibit 6 (videotape statement of David Mejia) admitted at trial, and after using the Court's personal recollection:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [T]he affidavit of Applicant's trial attorney ALEX LUNA is credible;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Applicant's attorney provided effective assistance of counsel;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Applicant's ground 3 claim should alternatively be barred by the doctrine of laches if it is determined that ALEX LUNA's response in his affidavit is not specific enough.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The District Clerk is ORDERED to now forward the application and other filed documents to the Court of Criminal Appeals with the Trial Court's Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FFCL, at 87.
