ST. EVE, District Court Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 12, 2016, Plaintiff UIRC-GSA Holdings, Inc. (\"UIRC\") brought its Fourth Amended Complaint against Defendants William Blair &amp; Company (\"Blair\") and Michael Kalt, collectively, \"Defendants,\" alleging copyright infringement in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and professional negligence. Blair has since filed a third-party complaint against Rainier Realty Acquisitions GP (\"RRA\") and Rainer GSA Portfolio I (\"Rainier GSA\") (RRA and Rainier GSA collectively \"Rainier\" or \"Third-Party Defendants\") alleging that RRA and Rainier GSA each have a duty to indemnify Blair against UIRC's claims in this litigation and breach\n   of contract claims against both entities. RRA has moved to dismiss Count V (implied indemnity), and Rainier has collectively moved to dismiss Counts III (contractual indemnity against Rainier GSA), IV (breach of contract against Rainier GSA), and VII (contractual contribution against Rainier GSA) of Blair's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Blair was UIRC's investment banker in connection with its bond offering, the proceeds of which were used to acquire a portfolio of real estate properties. (R. 89, Fourth Am. Compl. \u00b6 6.) This case arises from Blair's alleged copyright infringement of UIRC's bond documents and use of those documents to solicit other clients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.) In considering this motion, the Court presumes familiarity with the background of this action as set forth in previous orders and does not recite a detailed background here. The Court will provide a brief factual background, particularly as it pertains to the new allegations in Blair's Amended Third-Party Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   RRA is a Texas real estate investment company that provides preferred equity and mortgage debt to quality commercial properties in growth markets throughout the United States, and specifically it is in the business of acquiring and operating GSA buildings, some of which are financed through the sale of GSA revenue bonds. (R. 148, Am. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.) Blair alleges that RRA has \"formed supervised or controlled the formation of at least 18 portfolio companies, each of which was formed to be the borrower for a particular bond offering,\" and typically these portfolio companies are called \"Rainier GSA Portfolio...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On or about February 5, 2015, Blair entered into an engagement agreement with RRA to render financial advisory and investment banking services (the \"Rainier Engagement Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Under the Rainier Engagement Agreement, Blair was tasked with assisting RRA with the issuance of GSA revenue bonds for the acquisition of a portfolio of properties leased to the GSA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Blair was required to assist in the preparation of any solicitation materials, the private placement memorandum used for the deal, and other offering materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the Agreement, RRA acknowledged that \"Blair is not and will not be construed as a fiduciary of [RRA] and will have no duties or liability to... [RRA] ... by virtue of this agreement, and the retention of Blair hereunder, all of which duties and liabilities are hereby expressly waived.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) RRA also agreed to rely on its own counsel and advisors for \"legal, accounting, tax, and similar advice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Blair alleges that RRA understood and agreed that it was solely responsible for the documents prepared in connection with its own GSA revenue bond offering and that Blair was not offering RRA legal advice under the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On or about January 30, 2015, Blair and RRA separately entered into an indemnity agreement (the \"Rainier Indemnity Agreement\"), which they incorporated by reference into the Rainier Engagement Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) In the Indemnity Agreement, RRA agreed to indemnify and hold harmless Blair \"from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (collectively, 'Losses') and reasonable expenses incurred by them (including all fees and expenses of Blair's...incurred at [RRA's] request or otherwise incurred and reasonably required in connection with the investigation of any pending or threatened claims or preparation for any pending or threatened litigation or other proceedings)...arising out of or relating to Blair's engagement under such letter agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) The Indemnity\n   Agreement also states that RRA \"will not, without the prior written consent of Blair, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder...unless such settlement...includes an unconditional release of Blair...from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, or proceeding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) The Indemnity Agreement also indemnifies \"Other Identified Parties\" including \"the respective members, principals...of Blair and its affiliates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) The Agreement also included a \"Contribution Clause\" providing that if the indemnification was unavailable to Blair, RRA \"shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by Blair...as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect no only the relative benefits received by [Blair and RRA] but also the relative fault of [Blair and RRA].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) In connection with Blair's engagement with RRA, Blair worked with RRA on deal documents governing the issuance of GSA revenue bonds on behalf of RRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Blair also represented UIRC on unrelated deals and worked with UIRC on placement memoranda relating to the creation and issuance of revenue bonds relating to different GSA properties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) UIRC filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Rainier GSA and served a subpoena on Blair seeking certain documents, and, after responding to the subpoena, Blair sent a letter to RRA's counsel notifying RRA of its costs and expenses incurred in relation to the subpoena and reserving the right to seek reimbursement pursuant to the Rainier Indemnity Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.) Blair did not receive a response from RRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) On October 11, 2016, UIRC settled with Rainier GSA, but Blair never received any notice from RRA of the settlement as the Indemnity Agreement required, nor did RRA request Blair's consent to settle the underlying action with UIRC or obtain an unconditional release from UIRC of Blair relating to any claims in this case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.) Blair claims, on information and belief, that RRA had no intention of abiding by its obligations to Blair under the Indemnity Agreement, and thus attempted to secretly settle with UIRC to remove itself from the litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Also on October 11, 2016, UIRC filed an amended complaint against Blair, relating to its work for RRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) On November 4, 2016, Blair's counsel sent RRA a renewed demand for indemnification and defense and notified RRA of its breach of the Indemnity Agreement, but on December 13, 2016, RRA declined Blair's request for indemnification. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.) Since the filing of the complaint against Blair, Blair has incurred significant legal costs and expenses defending itself against UIRC's claims, which arise from RRA's engagement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Alter Ego Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Blair alleges that, at some time following the execution of the Engagement Agreement, RRA formed Rainier GSA under the supervision and control of Robert Jones, president of RRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) RRA and Rainier GSA have the same business address-13760 Noel Road, Suite 800, Dallas, Texas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) Blair alleges that RRA formed Rainier GSA as a \"single, special-purpose and bankruptcy-remote entity to carry out the bond offering contemplated by [RRA's] agreements with Blair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Specifically, Blair alleges that RRA formed Rainier GSA with the sole purpose of issuing the GSA bonds described in RRA's agreements with Blair and owning the entities that acquired each separate commercial property as part of the offering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Blair claims that RRA formed Rainier GSA for the sole purpose\n   of owning each property-owning entity and issuing and securing all the bonds necessary to acquire the properties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Blair further alleges that RRA referred to itself as Rainier GSA's \"sponsor\" in this transaction and provided the acquisition debt and equity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Blair also alleges that Rainier GSA has no separate personality from RRA and is merely an \"alter ego\" of RRA for purposes of Blair's claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Blair claims that Rainier GSA exists solely as the issuer of the bond offering RRA and Blair prepared and as such, is a \"mere fa\u00e7ade\" of RRA's operations handling the bond offering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) According to Blair, RRA and Robert Jones, RRA's President, exclusively manage Rainier GSA for the sole purpose of issuing bonds RRA and Blair offered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) Rainier GSA does not file an annual franchise tax report, does not have functioning officers and directors, does not have formal shareholder or director meetings, and thus, Blair claims that it fails to observe corporate formalities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-43.) In addition, Blair alleges that adhering to the fiction of separation between RRA and Rainier GSA would promote injustice because it would allow RRA to argue that Rainier GSA's settlement with UIRC did not trigger any notice obligation for RRA thus leaving Blair without the benefit of its bargain in the Indemnity Agreement and allowing RRA to intentionally avoid its indemnification and notice obligations to Blair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 47.) Blair also alleges, on information and belief, that this fictional separation between the entities allowed Rainier GSA to enter into a settlement agreement with UIRC that released RRA from liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) According to Blair, Rainier GSA's managing members are all \"co-founders of Rainier Companies\" and Rainier GSA shares a business address with RRA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While the Court has issued several opinions in this litigation, the only opinion relevant to this motion is the Court's August 25, 2017 Opinion dismissing Blair's Third-Party Complaint without prejudice. (R. 142, August 25, 2017 Opinion.) In that Opinion, the Court dismissed Blair's contractual claims against Rainier GSA because only RRA and Blair were parties to the Engagement Agreement and the Agreement did not apply to RRA's subsidiaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   6-7.) The Court also refused to pierce RRA's corporate veil because Blair had not alleged sufficient facts, or any facts at all, to warrant a finding that Rainier GSA was Blair's alter ego. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8-10.) The Court also dismissed Blair's implied indemnity claim because the parties had already included an indemnity provision in the Engagement Agreement, because Blair failed to allege a qualitative difference between Blair and RRA's conduct, and because Blair failed to allege vicarious liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) permits a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Hill v.

Blair has alleged, for example, that RRA and Rainier GSA share a business location, that RRA members are the sole managers and directors of Rainier GSA, and that Rainier GSA fails to observe corporate formalities such as filing franchise tax reports, maintaining active directors, or holding formal shareholder meetings. (Am. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 21, 41-43, 48.) More importantly, similar to\n   <em>\n    Flentye\n   </em>\n   , 485 F.Supp.2d at 913, where the court refused to dismiss alter ego allegations because the plaintiffs had alleged that the defendant created a subsidiary \"for the sole purpose of holding title to local real estate\" through which it operated its holdings, here, Blair has alleged that RRA created Rainier GSA for sole purpose of issuing the GSA bonds at issue in this litigation. Specifically, Blair has alleged that Robert Jones, the president of RRA, created Rainier GSA as a \"single, special-purpose and bankruptcy-remote entity to carry out the bond offering contemplated by [RRA's] agreements with Blair.\" (Am. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6 22.) Essentially, Blair alleges RRA was Rainier GSA's \"sponsor\" for purposes of the Blair-RRA bond offering, and RRA provided the acquisition debt and equity to acquire the bonds used to buy the property Rainier GSA would ultimately own. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   23-24.) Viewing these allegations in the light most favorable to Blair, they sufficiently allege that Rainier GSA was a \"mere instrumentalit[y]\" of RRA that RRA used for the sole purpose of issuing the bonds and holding the property contemplated by RRA's agreement with Blair.\n   <em>\n    All Meat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049843\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/470/823/#p827\">\n    470 F.Supp.2d at 828\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Blair has also sufficiently alleged that adhering to the fiction of RRA and Rainier GSA's separate corporate existences would promote injustice. Specifically, Blair has alleged that while RRA created Rainier GSA for the sole purpose of assisting with the RRA-Blair bond offering and operated Rainier GSA as an integrated part of RRA's bond offering operation, RRA is now attempting to avoid its contractual responsibilities to Blair on the basis of the fiction of a corporate separation between RRA and Rainier GSA. (Am. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.) Blair alleges, more precisely, that RRA used the existence of Rainier GSA to settle its litigation with UIRC without triggering the notice obligations in the RRA-Blair Indemnity Agreement, thereby allowing RRA to skirt its contractual duties and leaving Blair without the benefit of its contract. (Am. Third-Party Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 47.) Blair also alleges that RRA used the fictional separation of the two entities to aid Rainier GSA's settlement negotiations\n   with UIRC in the original litigation and ensure that RRA avoided liability to either UIRC or Blair. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) These allegations are the type of compelling facts that suggest that adhering to the fiction of RRA and Rainier GSA's separate corporate existences would promote injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, viewing the allegations in Blair's favor, it has now sufficiently alleged that Rainier GSA is an alter ego of RRA and that adhering to Rainier GSA's fictional corporate existence would promote injustice. Here, Blair has alleged that RRA created Rainier GSA and operated it as an integrated entity with RRA for the sole purpose of issuing the bonds contemplated by the RRA-Blair Engagement Agreement. Allowing RRA to then use Rainier GSA, its alleged alter ego, to avoid the contractual obligations of RRA's agreement with Blair would promote the type of injustice that alter ego liability is intended to prevent.\n   <em>\n    VDF Futureceuticals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204506937\">\n    2013 WL 4506937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (finding adherence to fiction of separate entities would promote injustice where defendant would be able to avoid obligations under contract if corporate veil not pierced).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, the Court denies Third-Party Defendants' motion to dismiss Blair's contractual claims against Rainier GSA (Counts III, IV, and VII).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Ill. May 3, 1991) (dismissing third-party implied indemnity claim in part because plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege qualitative distinction between parties' conduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Accordingly, the Court dismisses Blair's implied indemnity claim with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Contribution Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Blair has moved to strike Third-Party Defendants' arguments in its Reply regarding Blair's contribution claims. In its Reply, Third-Party Defendants argued, in part, that the Court should dismiss Counts VI (contractual contribution against RRA) and VII (contractual contribution against Rainier GSA). (R. 164, Third-Party Defs.' Reply 14-15.) In its Motion to Dismiss, however, Third-Party Defendants only moved to dismiss Blair's contractual claims against Rainier GSA (Counts III, IV, and VII) and Blair's implied indemnity claim (Count V). Third-Party Defendants did not move to dismiss Count VI, the contractual contribution claim against RRA, and thus the Court strikes all Third-Party Defendants' arguments regarding the dismissal of that Count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As to Count VII, the contractual contribution claim against Rainier GSA, in their Motion to Dismiss, Third-Party Defendants' entire argument for dismissal was that Rainier GSA was not a party to the Blair-RRA agreements and could not be held liable as RRA's alter ego. (R. 155, Mot. to Dismiss 4-7.) Third-Party Defendants did not present any arguments regarding Blair's failure to allege the elements of a contribution claim in its Motion to Dismiss, and it may not present those arguments for the first time in their Reply brief.\n   <em>\n    Rives v. Whiteside Sch. Dist.
