Pursuit of Administrative Order\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to defendant, EPA's actions in entering into and implementing the Air Compliance Agreement constitute commencement and pursuit of an administrative order to enforce the requirement concerned, which here is the requirement to make emergency notices of releases of ammonia from Shellbank in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011004\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Air Compliance Agreement constitutes commencement and pursuit of such an administrative order in two respects set forth in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   i. Entry into Air Compliance Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   First, EPA's actions in entering into the Air Compliance Agreement constitute commencement\n   and pursuit of an administrative order to enforce the requirement of making emergency notices of releases from animal feeding operations, including Shellbank. As described in the January 31, 2005, Notice, EPA offered animal feeding operations, such as defendant, the opportunity to enter into the Air Compliance Agreement, the satisfaction of which \"will trigger the obligation of participating [animal feeding operations] to determine their emissions ... and\n   <em>\n    to make any requisite hazardous release notices under ... EPCRA\n   </em>\n   .\" (Jan. 31, 2005 Notice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204958\">\n    70 Fed. Reg. 4958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (DE 53-3) at 4) (emphasis added). Further, EPA stated: \"While EPA has the authority on a case-by-case basis to require [animal feeding operations] to monitor their emissions and to come into compliance with applicable Federal laws, ... EPA believes that the Air Compliance Agreement will be the quickest and most effective way to ...\n   <em>\n    bring all participating [animal feeding operations] into compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3) (emphasis added). In addition, EPA stated, \"The release and covenant not to sue will cover an [animal feeding operation's] liability\n   <em>\n    for failing to comply with certain provisions of ... EPCRA, ... up to the time the [animal feeding operation] reports its releases under ... EPCRA....\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4) (emphasis added). In this manner, EPA entered into the Air Compliance Agreement, including its associated final administrative order, to enforce the requirement concerned in this lawsuit, particularly the requirement to make emergency notifications under EPCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The text of the Air Compliance Agreement further confirms its nature and purpose as an order to enforce the emergency notification requirement. Indeed, it states prominently, \"[t]he purpose of this Agreement is\n   <em>\n    to ensure that [Participating Company] complies with ... applicable release notification provisions of ... EPCRA\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7) (emphasis added). It provides that the release and covenant not to sue contained therein resolves \"violations identified and quantified by applying the Emissions-Estimating Methodologies developed using data from the national air emissions monitoring study described herein.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204958\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Furthermore, it expressly provides for an interim continuing notification requirement for \"any Farm that confines more than 10 times the 'large Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation' threshold of an animal species.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). In this manner, the Air Compliance Agreement addresses immediate reporting requirements for certain large-scale farms and it also addresses, on a delayed schedule, reporting requirements for all other farms subject to its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   ii. Implementing Air Compliance Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Second, EPA's actions in implementing the terms of the Air Compliance Agreement constitute pursuit of that administrative order to enforce the requirement of making emergency notices of releases from animal feeding operations. The Air Compliance Agreement provides for an extended period of administrative action addressing the requirements for emergency notifications under EPCRA. EPA recognized in its January 31, 2005, Notice that \"as with any large and complex effort, this work must be conducted over a period of years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). EPA \"expect[ed] that the monitoring will begin in 2005 and continue for 2 years. Two years of monitoring is the minimum time needed.... Within 18 months after the conclusion of the nationwide emissions monitoring study, EPA expects that it will publish on its Web site, on a rolling basis as work is completed, the methodologies for estimating emissions.... (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204958\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). In the Air Compliance Agreement, EPA recognized that if it \"is unable to publish Emissions-Estimating Methodologies applicable to a particular\n   type of Emission Unit in Attachment A within 18 months of the conclusion of the monitoring period because of inadequate data, EPA will attempt to resolve such data problems as soon as possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). In this manner, where the Air Compliance Agreement provides for a period of administrative action for implementation of its terms, such administrative action constitutes pursuit of \"an administrative order ... to enforce the requirement concerned.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011046\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In addition, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to defendant, EPA is still pursuing the terms of the Air Compliance Agreement, including as applied to defendant in the Shellbank Agreement. As an initial matter, Shellbank Farm does not meet the size threshhold of confining \"more than 10 times the 'large Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation' threshold of an animal species.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Shellbank was not required by the Air Compliance Agreement to make a notification of ongoing air emissions of ammonia in excess of 100 pounds per 24 hours. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011046\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). After the Air Compliance Agreement was ratified in 2006, and after it had commenced the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study, EPA confirmed both that it did \"not expect farms\" participating the agreement \"to report [continuing releases] at this time,\" and that EPA was \"working on developing emission estimating methodologies,\" per the terms of the Air Compliance Agreement. (EPA, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, February 2009 (DE 57-5) at 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   EPA's pursuit of implementation of the Air Compliance Agreement has continued up through at least 2017: In January 2011, it announced that it had collected data to assist with developing emissions-estimating methodologies; in February 2012, it requested input from the Science Advisory Board, noting it had developed draft emissions-estimating methodologies; in April 2013, the Science Advisory Board provided comments and recommendations; in July 2013, EPA's acting administrator assured continued work to develop emissions-estimating methodologies; in August 2016, EPA reported that \"updated emissions-estimating methodologies for animal feeding operations are under development\"; in September 2017, EPA Office of Inspector General reported that EPA had \"corrective action pending,\" with a \"Planned Completion Date\" of September 30, 2018, for notifying \"Air Compliance Agreement participants\" that it cannot develop emission estimating methodologies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, for purposes\n   of the instant analysis of whether EPA is \"pursuing an administrative order,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011046\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), all of these activities confirm that EPA is doing so. The court leaves for further discussion later in this order, whether such activity constitutes \"diligen[ce].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011046\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In sum, based on the foregoing, EPA commenced and is pursuing an administrative order to enforce the emergency notification requirement of EPCRA that is the subject of plaintiffs' claim in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   iii. Plaintiffs' Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the Air Compliance Agreement does not trigger the EPCRA diligent pursuit exception because it does not enforce or address \"the same violations as those alleged in the complaint.\" (Pl's Reply (DE 60) at 5; Pl's Mem. (DE 51) at 21). This argument misses the mark, however, because the diligent pursuit exception does not require EPA to be pursuing \"the same violations as those alleged\" in a civil action, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), but rather requires EPA to be pursuing \"an administrative order ... to enforce\n   <em>\n    the requirement concerned\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011046\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (emphasis added).

The Air Compliance Agreement comprises pursuit of an administrative order to enforce that same \"requirement concerned,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011046\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), in that implementation of the Air Compliance Agreement will dictate whether and when defendant, or any other animal feeding operation, is required to submit an EPCRA notification, including followup emergency notification, for its emissions of ammonia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Specifically, under the Air Compliance Agreement, \"EPA's publication of the emissions estimating methodologies\n   <em>\n    will trigger the obligation\n   </em>\n   of participating [animal feeding operations] to determine their emissions ... and\n   <em>\n    to make any requisite hazardous release notices\n   </em>\n   under ...

In turn, a \"Qualifying Release[ ]\" is defined in the Air Compliance Agreement as \"a release that triggers\n   <em>\n    a reporting requirement under ... section\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    304 of EPCRA\n   </em>\n   ,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8) (emphasis added), which is not time-limited. Accordingly, the reporting requirements addressed by the Air Compliance Act constitute the same reporting requirements at issue in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Plaintiffs cite to the case\n   <em>\n    Group Against Smog &amp; Pollution, Inc. v.

First,\n   <em>\n    Group Against Smog\n   </em>\n   is not a case interpreting the diligent pursuit exception in EPCRA; indeed it does not even mention EPCRA. Rather, it interprets a \"diligent prosecut[ion]\" bar to citizens suits in the Clean Air Act, which turns on whether the government \"has commenced and is diligently\n   <em>\n    prosecuting a civil action\n   </em>\n   ... to require compliance\" with the emission standard or limitation as set forth in the Clean Air Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) ) (emphasis added). Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Group Against Smog\n   </em>\n   , this court is not determining here whether EPA has \"prosecut[ed] a civil action ... to require compliance\" with a particular statutory standard. Here, there is no statutory basis to require an identity of alleged \"violations\" in both a citizen suit and an civil action brought by the government, because the instant case involves an administrative order and not a civil action brought by the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Second, the Air Compliance Agreement presents a unique administrative circumstance, not reflected in the facts of\n   <em>\n    Group Against Smog\n   </em>\n   , where the EPA has pursued a certain type of administrative order expressly because it is unable to reliably identify thresholds, factors, or methods, for determining violations of the statutory requirements at issue in the citizen suit. Indeed, EPA recognized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   While EPA has the authority on a case-by-case basis to require [animal feeding operations] to monitor their emissions and to come into compliance with applicable Federal laws, that process has proven to be difficult and time consuming, partly due to the\n   <em>\n    uncertainty regarding emissions from [animal feeding operations]\n   </em>\n   , which was reiterated in [the 2003 National Academy of Sciences Report] .... Consequently, EPA believes that the Air Compliance Agreement will be the quickest and most effective way to address the\n   <em>\n    current uncertainty regarding emissions from [animal feeding operations]\n   </em>\n   and to bring all participating [animal feeding operations] into compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   ( (Jan. 31, 2005 Notice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204958\">\n    70 Fed.

There is no indication in the text of the EPCRA diligent pursuit exception that Congress intended to require the enforcing government agency to identify the same violations alleged in a citizen suit, where the enforcing government agency expressly has deferred the mechanism for determining violations until the conclusion of the administrative enforcement proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In this manner, the instant case is distinguishable, too, from other cases cited by plaintiffs where the courts rejected application of the diligent prosecution bar under\n   the Clean Water Act, for example where a state government agency had taken the \"current position that there is no methodology for assessing [state] narrative water quality standards.\"\n   <em>\n    OVEC v.

In those cases, in contrast to the instant case, the government enforcing agency was not progressing in accordance with a formal structure for determining compliance, like the Air Compliance Agreement, which sets forth a plan for developing methodologies. The position of the agency in\n   <em>\n    Elk Run\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    FOLA\n   </em>\n   , as characterized by the court in that case, would be more closely equivalent to EPA announcing, upon the conclusion of the Air Compliance Agreement, that it is\n   <em>\n    unable\n   </em>\n   to determine any emissions-estimating methodologies applicable to animal feeding operations. Under the Air Compliance Agreement, at that point, the releases in the Air Compliance Agreement cease and reporting obligations resume under EPCRA.

For this characterization, plaintiffs quote from the final order of the EPA Environmental Appeals Board ratifying the Air Compliance Agreement (Final Order, In re: Consent Agreements and Proposed Final Orders for Animal Feeding Operations (DE 15-3) at 9-10). Despite this characterization, however, the EPA Environmental Appeals Board ratified the Air Compliance Agreement, and determined that it constituted a valid settlement agreement that was \"consistent with the well-settled principle that EPA\n   <em>\n    retains discretion as to how to bring a facility into compliance\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25) (emphasis added). It stated further that EPA \"has broad discretion in choosing how best to bring a facility or group of facilities into compliance and [that it] further recognize[d] [EPA's] expertise in matters of\n   <em>\n    enforcement strategy\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26) (emphasis added). In other words, even though not characterized as having \"enforceable compliance aspects,\" it is characterized as a mechanism for bringing facilities into compliance and a valid enforcement strategy by EPA. In this respect, the Air Compliance Agreement meets the plain terms of the EPCRA diligent pursuit exception because it is an \"administrative order ... to enforce the requirement\" of EPCRA notifications for animal feeding operations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011046\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that EPA does not \"have the power to indefinitely immunize HANOR from EPCRA civil liability.\" (Pls' Mem (DE 51) at 22; Pls' Reply (DE 60) at 8). This argument is unavailing for two reasons. First, the Air Compliance Agreement does not indefinitely immunize defendant from EPCRA civil liability. Rather it defers defendant's obligation to follow EPCRA reporting requirements for ongoing emissions of ammonia, among other pollutants, until 120 days after EPA publishes emissions-estimating methodologies for animal feeding operations or until 120 days after EPA has determined that it cannot develop such emissions-estimating methodologies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 31, 2005 Notice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204958\">\n    70 Fed. Reg. 4958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (DE 53-3) at 9, 10). At that time, defendant must report \"all Qualifying Releases of ... Ammonia\" from its facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). As noted by EPA Environmental Appeals Board, the Air Compliance Agreement gives defendant a \"release and covenant not to sue for potential civil violations of specified requirements of [EPCRA] that\n   may have already occurred or that may occur\n   <em>\n    during the study period\n   </em>\n   .\" (Final Order, In re: Consent Agreements and Proposed Final Orders for Animal Feeding Operations (DE 15-3) at 5) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Second, the issue of whether EPA had the power to act as set forth the Air Compliance Agreement, regardless of how those actions are characterized, already was adjudicated and decided at the time of the ratification of the Air Compliance Agreement. In particular, EPA Environmental Appeals Board made \"finding[s] as to the sufficiency of\" the Air Compliance Agreement and concluded that it \"conform[s] to the general objectives of ... EPCRA for [it] seek[s] to\n   <em>\n    remedy violations of [this] statute\n   </em>\n   [.]\" (Final Order, In re: Consent Agreements and Proposed Final Orders for Animal Feeding Operations (DE 15-3) at 21, 25) (emphasis added). Moreover, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected, upon petition for review of the Air Compliance Agreement, the argument that \"the Agreement exceeds EPA's authority under [EPCRA],\" reasoning that the statute \"grant[s] EPA broad enforcement authority and discretion, authorizing the agency to choose among various methods to penalize violators and achieve compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Irritated Residents v. E.P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047721,3565167\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1027/\">\n    494 F.3d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1036 (D.C. Cir. 2007).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In summary, the Air Compliance Agreement reflects, in several respects, EPA's discretionary choice among multiple enforcement options to penalize violators and achieve compliance. First, it embodies EPA's choice to proceed with a project of nationwide scope, not limited solely to its application to defendant, or any other animal feeding operation \"on a case-by-case basis.\" (Jan. 31, 2005 Notice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204958\">\n    70 Fed. Reg. 4958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (DE 53-3) at 5). Second, it reflects EPA's judgment that only the largest animal feeding operations, as a condition for entry into the Air Compliance Agreement, expressly must make a written notification of ongoing air emissions of ammonia in excess of 100 pounds per 24 hours. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8). Finally, it embodies EPA's judgment that there is not a reasoned basis for requiring other animal feeding operations to make emergency notifications regarding ongoing ammonia emissions until EPA has determined whether it can publish emissions-estimating methodologies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   For all these reasons, defendant has demonstrated a genuine issue of fact regarding whether entering into and implementing the Air Compliance Agreement constitutes commencement and pursuit of an administrative order to enforce the pertinent EPCRA notification requirement in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011004\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11004\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   b. Diligence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As noted previously, section 11046(e) acts as a bar to a citizen suit where EPA is \"diligently pursuing an administrative order\" at the time of the commencement of the action. Having already addressed whether implementation of the Air Compliance Agreement constitutes pursuit of an administrative order to enforce the EPCRA notification requirement, the issue remains whether EPA was \"diligently pursuing\" that goal at the time of the commencement of this action. Viewing the\n   facts in the light most favorable to defendant, there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Prior to commencement of this action on August 1, 2015, EPA had announced in January 2011 that it had collected data as part of the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study, under the terms of the Air Compliance Agreement, and that it planned to use such data \"and all other available, relevant data to develop [emissions-estimating methodologies].\" (January 19, 2011, Call for Information,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%203060\">\n    76 Fed. Reg. 3060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (DE 53-5) at 3). It had provided a detailed report of draft emissions-estimating methodologies to the Science Advisory Board, in February 2012, and it had received detailed suggestions from that board in April 2013, for \"improv[ing] the agency's statistical approach for developing\" emissions-estimating methodologies. (DE 53-8 at 2-4). In July 2013, the acting administrator of EPA responded that EPA \"will carefully consider the [Science Advisory Board's] analysis and recommendations in developing emissions-estimating methodologies,\" noting that EPA was \"continu[ing] to respond to the 2003 [National Academy of Sciences Report] recommendations on how to account for air emissions from animal-feeding operations.\" Further, he stated, \"I assure you that we will work diligently in the coming months to develop appropriate emissions estimating methodologies.\" (DE 57-9 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In light of the scope of work contemplated under the Air Compliance Agreement, as further elaborated in EPA's 2012 report and the Science Advisory Board's 2013 report, it is reasonable to infer that EPA diligently was continuing to work towards developing emissions-estimating methodologies at the time of the commencement of this action on August 1, 2015. In particular, EPA commented in the 2012 report on factors influencing the determination of emissions-estimating methodologies for ammonia from swine lagoons, such as \"static variables (i.e., animal type, surface area, farm size) and ... continuous variables representing meteorological conditions (i.e., temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation).\" (DE 57-8 at 5-6). It is reasonable to infer the Science Advisory Board considerably augmented the complexity of this task by advising that \"EPA has developed statistical models based on combined data sets and predictor variables which have limited the ability of the models to predict emissions beyond the small number of farms in the dataset,\" and by recommending that \"EPA not apply the current versions of the statistical and modeling tools for estimating emissions beyond the farms in EPA's data set.\" (DE 53-8 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Given that an administrative agency's \"diligence is presumed,\"\n   <em>\n    Piney Run Preservation Association v. Carroll County, Md.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050272\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/453/#p459\">\n    523 F.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 (4th Cir. 2008), and given that the court must draw reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-movant, there is a genuine issue of fact as to whether EPA was diligently pursuing its goals set forth in the Air Compliance Agreement at the time of commencement of this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Plaintiffs argue, nonetheless, that EPA has not been diligent because EPA has not met \"deadlines\" set forth in the Air Compliance Agreement. (Pls' Mem (DE 51) at 29;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32, 36). The Air Compliance Agreement, however, does not set forth \"deadlines\" upon which success of the agreement is conditioned. In its notice regarding the Air Compliance Agreement, EPA stated that it expected monitoring to begin in 2005 and continue for two years, but it noted that \"[t]wo years of monitoring is the minimum time needed.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 31, 2005 Notice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204958\">\n    70 Fed. Reg. 4958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (DE 53-3) at 5). EPA also expected to\n   start publishing emissions-estimating methodologies within 18 months after completion of the monitoring study, but it noted \"[i]f EPA's Science Advisory Board determines that EPA is unable to publish Emissions-Estimating Methodologies applicable to a particular type of Emission Unit in Attachment A within 18 months of the conclusion of the monitoring period because of inadequate data, EPA will attempt to resolve such data problems as soon as possible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). As discussed above, EPA's Science Advisory Board in fact made precisely such determination, setting in motion a complex and difficult process of addressing inadequacies in its data and determining statistically based emissions-estimating methodologies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 53-8 at 2-4; DE 57-9 at 2). Accordingly, EPA's failure to meet timing expectations set forth in the Air Compliance Agreement does not compel a determination that it has not been acting diligently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Plaintiffs suggest that the Science Advisory Board's criticism of EPA's prior data collection tends to show a lack of diligence on the part of EPA. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to defendant, however, the interaction between the Science Advisory Board and EPA shows concerted effort to address the multifaceted problem of emissions-estimating methodologies. Indeed, drawing inferences in this manner, the Science Advisory Board criticism provides a rational justification for EPA's extended delay in developing emissions-estimating methodologies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Plaintiffs also suggest that a ten-year period or more of delay, during which time animal feeding operations are not required to report ongoing releases o ammonia, is simply too long as a matter of law to demonstrate diligence. In this respect, plaintiffs seek to draw comparison between this case and others in which courts have found that a ten-year period of agency delay is too long to demonstrate diligence. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Jones v. City of Lakeland, Tennessee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236700\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/518/#p522\">\n    224 F.3d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 522 (6th Cir. 2000), the court found an \"administrative enforcement action over a ten-year period was inadequate\" to address Clean Water Act violations by a city's discharge of raw sewage into a waterway, noting the state agency had \"extended and waived the compliance deadlines of three, possibly four, of its sweetheart consent orders with the City.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11236700\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/224/518/#p522\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs also seek comparison with\n   <em>\n    Piney Run\n   </em>\n   , in which the Fourth Circuit in context again of waterway discharges looked to whether an agency was proceeding under a \"detailed schedule of compliance\" and noting that the consent decree in that case required \"immediate compliance with [a] thermal limitation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050272\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/453/#p459\">\n    523 F.3d at 459, 461\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument seeking comparison to\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Piney Run\n   </em>\n   , however, does not take into account the unique circumstances and nationwide scope of the Air Compliance Agreement. This is not an instance as in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   where a single state or local agency has granted extension after extension to an individual polluter under the Clean Water Act. Nor is this an instance fitting into the standards articulated in\n   <em>\n    Piney Run\n   </em>\n   , where the court looked to whether a state agency was pursuing an individual polluter under a \"detailed schedule of compliance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6050272\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/523/453/#p459\">\n    523 F.3d at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted). Instead, the Air Compliance Agreement reflects widespread and longstanding recognition of challenges in estimating emissions for purposes of regulating or managing continuous release notifications by animal feeding operations. As noted previously, the National Academy of Sciences in 2003 recognized that \"[a]vailable estimates of emission factors, rates, and concentration ... provide\n   <em>\n    a poor basis for regulating or managing\n   </em>\n   air emissions from [animal feeding operations].\" (2003 National Academy of Sciences Report (DE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   57-2) at 5) (emphasis added). The Air Compliance Agreement itself expressly stated that determining compliance by animal feeding operations \"has proven to be difficult and time consuming, partly due to the uncertainty regarding emissions from [animal feeding operations].\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 31, 2005 Notice,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20Fed.%20Reg.%204958\">\n    70 Fed. Reg. 4958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (DE 53-3) at 5). And, the EPA Science Advisory Board reiterated the complexity of the task in its report to EPA in recommending that \"EPA not apply the current versions of the statistical and modeling tools for estimating emissions.\" (DE 53-8 at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In sum, EPA is not acting in isolation inexplicably dragging its feet as to a single polluter; rather it is working under a complex framework to address animal feeding operations on a national basis. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls' Statement of Facts \u00b6 4; Def's Statement of Facts \u00b6 4 (stating that EPA entered into Air Compliance Agreement with over 2,500 animal feeding operations) ). Plaintiffs' attempt to compare the instant case to others in much different circumstances is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Plaintiffs additionally suggest, in response to the court's order requesting further briefing upon receipt of the 2017 EPA Office of Inspector General Report, that certain passages in the report bear upon EPA's lack of diligence. This court also suggested as much in its November 3, 2017, order directing further briefing that the 2017 Office of Inspector General Report, where it stated that the report \"bears directly and comprehensively upon\" EPA's administrative activities, regarding which defendant has moved, in part, to obtain further discovery. (DE 70). Upon further consideration of the 2017 Office of Inspector General Report, the supplemental briefing ordered, and the applicable law, however, the court has determined that the significance of the 2017 Office of Inspector General Report to the instant analysis upon summary judgment is more limited than suggested by the court in its November 3, 2017, order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Generally, the 2017 Office of Inspector General Report is admissible as a public record, under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8), because it is a \"record or statement of a public office\" that sets forth \"factual findings from a legally authorized investigation.\" Fed. R. Evid. 803(8). This does not resolve, however, the admissibility of every statement contained in the 2017 Office of Inspector General Report, for the truth of the matter asserted, particularly where the report is referencing statements of others. Such statements may be hearsay within hearsay, for which an exception to the hearsay rule must be identified before they are admissible for the truth of the matter asserted. See Fed. R.

At the time the NAEMS protocol was developed, the EPA had more applicable expertise, but the key staff involved in the NAEMS protocol\n   development retired. Further, competing priorities resulted in the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation putting the EEM effort largely on hold. The EPA had dedicated few agency resources to develop EEMs since the SAB's 2013 final report. The few remaining agency staff who worked on the NAEMS and subsequent data analysis were reassigned to other work, and the EPA stopped funding the contract for NAEMS analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   (2017 EPA Office of Inspector General Report (DE 69-2) at 23) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (stating that the Office of Inspector General \"\n   <em>\n    interviewed EPA staff and managers\n   </em>\n   ... to gain an understanding of EPA actions to evaluate and address [animal feeding operations] air emissions,\"\n   <em>\n    as well as other outside entities and individuals\n   </em>\n   , to determine the \"status of the [national air emissions monitoring study].\" (emphasis added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Accordingly, while the 2017 EPA Office of Inspector General Report does itself serve as evidence of the Office of Inspector General's findings, conclusions, and recommendations made in 2017, the statements attributed to unspecified and unidentified \"EPA managers\" are not, without more, admissible for the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that EPA dedicated few agency resources to developing emissions-estimating methodologies post 2013). While compelling, other remaining more generalized conclusions contained in the 2017 EPA Office of Inspector General Report, pointing out or criticizing the extent of delay by EPA, are not determinative to the instant analysis, particularly where, as here, the court must view the underlying facts in the light most favorable to defendant. Therefore, summary judgment is not warranted on the issue of \"diligence\" based on the 2017 EPA Office of Inspector General Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In sum, plaintiffs have not demonstrated the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on the application of defendant's EPCRA diligent pursuit exception affirmative defense.

Order (DE 55-1) ). The referenced paragraph is one of eight items enumerated in plaintiffs' \"request for relief\" at the conclusion of the complaint, also set forth at the beginning of this order. Paragraph four, as noted, requests to have the court \"[o]rder Hanor to\n   <em>\n    immediately notify\n   </em>\n   the Edgecombe County Office of Emergency Services (the designated LEPC contact for Edgecombe County) and the North Carolina Department of Public Safety (the designated SERC contact for North Carolina) of the releases of reportable quantities of ammonia from Shellbank.\" (Compl. at p. 27) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Defendant's motion, in this part, to have the court enter summary judgment on plaintiffs' fourth enumerated request for relief is premature. Where the court has not determined liability in this matter, the court has not had occasion to consider yet an appropriate remedy in the event liability is found, particularly where the requested relief is injunctive in nature. The court reserves for another day the issue raised by the parties' briefs whether the scope of relief awarded is cabined by the limitation on plaintiffs' cause of action authorized under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In sum, defendant's partial motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part. The court grants in part summary judgment in favor of defendant on that part of plaintiffs' cause of action asserting a violation for failure by defendant to submit an initial immediate emergency notice under \u00a7 11004(b). The court denies in part summary judgment on that part of plaintiffs' request for relief contained at paragraph four on page 27 of the complaint. Accordingly, plaintiffs' cause of action asserting a violation for failure by defendant to submit a follow-up notification under \u00a7 11004(c), along with the entirety of plaintiffs' request for relief, remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   4. Case Scheduling\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The court lifts the stay of discovery and case deadlines imposed June 30, 2017, and directs the parties to file, within 14 days of the date of this order, a joint report proposing a plan for remainder of discovery in this case and new deadline(s) for dispositive motions. Thereupon, the court will enter such further order as is warranted regarding scheduling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the court orders as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   1. Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment (DE 50) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   2. Defendant's motion, in part, for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) (DE 55) is DENIED AS MOOT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   3. Defendant's motion, in part, for partial summary judgment (DE 55) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. The court GRANTS IN PART summary judgment in favor of defendant on that part of plaintiffs' cause of action asserting a violation for failure by defendant to submit an initial immediate emergency notice under \u00a7 11004(b). The court DENIES IN PART summary judgment on that part of plaintiffs' request for relief contained at paragraph four on page 27 of the complaint. Accordingly, plaintiffs' cause of action asserting a violation for failure by defendant to submit a follow-up notification under \u00a7 11004(c), along with the entirety of plaintiffs' request for relief, remains pending.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   4. The court DIRECTS the parties to file, within\n   <strong>\n    14 days\n   </strong>\n   of the date of this order, a joint report proposing a plan for remainder of discovery in this case and new deadline(s) for dispositive motions. Thereupon, the court will enter such further order as is warranted regarding scheduling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   SO ORDERED, this the 30th day of January, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    Page numbers provided in citations to documents in the record in this order specify the page number of the document filed on the docket in the court's electronic case filing (ECF) system, rather than the page number, if any, specified on the face of the document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Shellbank Farm has units containing 2744 \"sows,\" 3048 \"nursery pigs,\" and 4980 \"finishing pigs.\" (Shellbank Agreement (DE 15-1) at 46).

Reg.76948 (DE 53-10) at 5), which rule was since vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Waterkeeper Alliance v.

One statement by EPA in the 2008 Exemption Rule suggests that EPA still expected large concentrated animal feeding operations to continue to make EPCRA continuous release reports \"reflect[ing] good faith estimates from reporting entities.\" (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2076952\">\n     73 Fed.

This statement creates, at best, a genuine issue of fact as to EPA's expectations, given conflicting reporting requirements in the Air Compliance Agreement and EPA's contrary statement in its February 2009 publication summarizing the 2008 Exemption Rule.
