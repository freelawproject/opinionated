Having reviewed the parties' submissions, the relevant legal authority, and all other relevant material properly before the Court, the Court will DENY Defendants' Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On the night of May 23, 2013, a confrontation with tragic results occurred between police from the Cities of Fife and Lakewood\n   and Leonard Thomas at his home in Fife. The events that unfolded resulted in the lethal shooting of Thomas, who was unarmed, by a police sniper. Plaintiffs, which include Leonard's Estate as well as his parents and son, brought this civil rights action, which resulted in a substantial jury verdict in their favor. While the full scope of the evidence required a lengthy trial, the essential facts are summarized here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Shooting of Leonard Thomas\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Leonard Thomas lived with his four-year-old son, E.T, in a home in Fife owned by his parents, Fred and Annalesa Thomas. In the evening of May 23, 2013, Leonard called Annalesa, explained he was depressed over the death of a friend, and asked her to come take E.T. for the night. Annalesa agreed. She was concerned that Leonard, after a year of sobriety, had been drinking, and she was worried that Leonard would fall asleep and not be able to attend to E.T. that night. When Annalesa arrived sometime after 9:00 p.m., Leonard changed his mind and became upset as Annalesa prepared to leave with E.T. The argument between Leonard and Annalesa escalated when Annalesa slapped Leonard's face with an open hand. Annalesa called 911 at 10:18 p.m., and told the dispatcher that she needed the police. Leonard grabbed the phone from Annalesa, and told the dispatcher that his mother had hit him and that he needed help.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Fife Police Officers responded to the Thomas house and contacted Leonard via cell phone. During their initial 24 minute conversation, Leonard told the Fife officer that he was upset about the recent loss of a personal friend and had requested his mother come to pick up his son; that he had subsequently been assaulted by his mother and was bleeding from the face; that he had locked all the doors and would not be coming out of the house or allowing officers inside the house; and that the police were scaring his four-year-old son and should leave his property. Approximately an hour later, after Leonard continued to refuse to emerge from the house, the Fife police chief called for the Pierce County Metro SWAT Team to respond to the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The SWAT Team arrived at approximately 12:20 a.m. with two tank-like armored vehicles. The \"AT\" (\"armored transport\") was driven across the neighbor's yard, through a fence separating the neighbor's yard from the Thomas home, and parked just off the back patio of the Thomas residence. The \"Bearcat\" was parked on the street in front of the house. Two snipers, including Defendant Brian Markert, took up positions in front of the house. Defendant Mike Wiley was Team Leader of the SWAT Team's tactical side, while Defendant Mike Zaro, the Assistant Chief of Police for Lakewood, oversaw field operations. Officer Wiley informed the SWAT Team that they were \"responding to basically assault 4 DV [domestic violence]\" due to Leonard's grab of Annalesa's wrist when he snatched the phone during the initial 911 call. Wiley told the Team, \"Barricaded male suspect has his four year old son maybe pseudo hostage. The wife is outside. Made no threats towards the son.\" As negotiations with Leonard proceeded through the night, Leonard repeated that he did not have any weapons, and warned officers not to use flash-bang grenades to enter the house. No officer heard Leonard make any threats to harm himself, his child, or any officer. During the course of negotiations Leonard repeatedly asked the officers to stop harassing him and to leave him alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At approximate 1:08 a.m., Fred Thomas (Leonard's father) arrived at the police staging area a few blocks from the house in response to a call from Annalesa. Fred explained to the officers that he needed to\n   go to his house to speak to his son, but was told that the road was closed to traffic. Fred walked to the back of the property and climbed the six foot chain link fence surrounding the backyard. Officer Ryan Micenko, who was behind the house at the time, stopped Fred, ordered him to the ground, and placed him in handcuffs. Fred explained to the officers that he lived at the residence and that he was there to talk to his son. Defendant Jason Cannon, the entry team leader stationed at the back of the house, radioed Zaro to say, \"We've got the property owner and the father of the suspect detained. Where would you like [him]?\" Zaro asked, \"Other than him generally inserting himself onto the scene, does any of his activity warrant him going to jail?\" Cannon responded, \"I guess that depends on how cooperative he is with you guys but you have at least obstructing on him if you want to.\" Zaro said, \"That's what I need, thanks.\" Fred was then taken to jail where he was kept until the following morning, when he was released without being charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As negotiations with Leonard continued unsuccessfully, officers internally discussed the possibility that if Leonard let E.T. go, they could simply leave for the night and come back to arrest Leonard another time. Zaro agreed with this approach, and asked Fife Police Chief Blackburn \"if we get the son tonight, are you good with us leaving here?\" Chief Blackburn agreed that \"Yeah, if we have the son, then you can-we can walk away from this thing tonight and we'll get him at another time when it's not so volatile.\" Leonard initially resisted this proposal, but eventually responded, \"Okay, we'll do that.\" Zaro radioed his team, \"If, uh, the suspect comes out with the child and you can separate the child, let dad go back in.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Leonard brought E.T., who had been sleeping, out to the front porch, but insisted that E.T. leave with Annalesa, not with the police officers. The officers refused this request, and the stalemate continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Based on Leonard's continued demands to have Annalesa come up to the house, his continued refusal to release E.T. to the police, and the fact that he was now on the front porch with E.T., Chief Zaro radioed the entire SWAT Team, ordering them \"Do not let him back in the house with that kid.\" Despite this order, which was never communicated to Leonard, Leonard continued to go in and out of the house with E.T. While Annalesa was not allowed to go up to the house, officers escorted her to the Bearcat, where Leonard could see and hear her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At 2:00 a.m. a warrant was signed for the arrest of Leonard for domestic violence assault in the fourth degree, a misdemeanor. SWAT officers began working to set an explosive breaching charge on the back door of the house. At approximately 2:45 a.m., Leonard returned to the porch again with E.T., E.T.'s car seat, and an overnight bag. Leonard was in the doorway and E.T. was sitting on the steps of the porch when, with Wiley's encouragement, Zaro gave permission to breach the back door with the explosive charge. The explosion was designed to sever the hinges of the door and create a deafening bang that would overwhelm a subject's senses so that he freezes in place. Trial testimony also suggested that it was foreseeable that the charge would cause Leonard to reach for E.T. in fear. Indeed, that's what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   When the breaching charge detonated, Leonard ran to E.T., picked him up, and started retreating into the residence. While Leonard was holding E.T., Markert fired his rifle, striking Leonard just above the belt line on the right side of his abdomen. Leonard fell backward into the house. Wiley and Defendant Officer Nathan Vance ran toward the house through\n   the front yard, where they encountered Leonard's dog, Baxter. Vance shot the dog twice, and then Wiley fired additional shots, killing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Officers entering through the rear door encountered Leonard sitting on the floor, dying, clutching E.T.'s back against his chest. As the officers struggled to pry E.T. from Leonard's arms, one officer started punching Leonard in the face. Another officer recalled Leonard's last words, \"Don't hurt my boy.\" Later that morning, two detectives and a chaplain arrived at the jail where Fred was being held to inform him that his son was dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Jury Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The jury trial commenced on June 21, 2017 and lasted twelve days. After five days of deliberation, and the jury returned its verdict on July 14, 2017. The jury found Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment violations were committed by Defendants Zaro, Wiley, Markert, and the City of Lakewood due to the excessive force used against Leonard and the unreasonable method of seizing E.T. The jury further found that Zaro and Lakewood violated the Fourteenth Amendment rights of E.T., Fred, and Annalesa by illegally depriving them of their familial relationship with Leonard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The jury found Zaro, Wiley, and the City of Lakewood liable for Fourth Amendment violations related to the use of the explosive breach. The jury found Wiley, but not Vance, liable for Fourth Amendment violations related to the shooting of Leonard's dog. The jury found Zaro and Cannon, but not Micenko, liable for Fourth Amendment violations related to the arrest of Fred. And the jury found the City of Lakewood liable under state law claims for the false arrest of Fred, the outrage suffered by Annalesa and E.T., and the negligence in the investigation that separated E.T. from his father. The City of Fife was also found liable for the negligent investigation, but was found not liable for the false arrest of Fred. The jury awarded a total of $8,635,000 in compensatory damages. The jury also awarded a total of $6,500,000 in punitive damages against Zaro, Wiley, and Markert. Defendants subsequently filed four post-trial motions, which the Court will now address.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50 provides that the Court may direct the entry of judgment as a matter of law where \"the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue.\" A directed verdict must be entered where \"there is no substantial evidence to support the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Rutledge v.

Did any of the Defendants seize E.T. from his father Leonard Thomas in an unreasonable manner, or cause E.T. to be unreasonably seized?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (ECF 237 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The jury found Defendants Zaro, Wiley, Markert, and the City of Lakewood liable to E.T. and Leonard's Estate on this claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue that this verdict was improper because E.T. could not bring a Fourteenth Amendment claim for his seizure and the Estate could not bring a Fourth Amendment claim for E.T.'s seizure. This objection misreads the verdict form. The Fourth Amendment claim was brought by E.T. and the Fourteenth Amendment claim was brought by the Estate. Those claims were combined in this question because they concern the same injury-the seizure of E.T.-and they turn on the same legal test-whether a reasonable person in the position of Leonard Thomas would have felt free to leave the scene with E.T. or to withhold consent to the officers taking E.T., and whether the scope of the intrusion used to seize E.T. was reasonably necessary to alleviate the threat posed to him. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 220 at 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

But E.T. was not a hostage, and Markert and the other officers here were not attempting to separate him from a kidnapper.

As explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   -and as apparent from the verdict from-the Estate's claim on this question is pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment. Defendants further object that the Estate's Fourteenth Amendment claim was dismissed on summary judgment. In its summary judgment order, the Court said the Estate had abandoned its claim for deprivation of Leonard's familial relationship with E.T. (ECF 128 at 20 n.4.) The standard for the Fourteenth Amendment familial deprivation claim-whether excessive force shocked the conscience-is different from the standard for Fourteenth Amendment seizure of a child-whether the child was removed without reasonable cause. The Estate's familial deprivation claim did not go to the jury, pursuant to the summary judgment order, but the unreasonable seizure claim survived, and the jury's decision on that claim was supported by evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Estate's Excessive Force Claim Against Wiley (Verdict Question Two)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Question Two of the verdict form read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff the Estate of Leonard Thomas brings a Fourth Amendment constitutional claim for excessive force.

The jury reasonably concluded that Zaro recklessly disregarded these consequences, and that disregarding the consequences that an unarmed man might be shot and killed shocks the conscience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   A jury finding that Zaro's order not to let Leonard return inside his house with E.T. was deliberately indifferent to the likely consequence that Leonard would be shot and killed for doing so is sufficient to support liability on this claim, without reference to Zaro's order to breach the back door. But even if the Court agreed with Defendants that the sole support for this claim rests on the argument that Zaro's order to breach the back door provoked the shooting, a directed verdict for Defendants still would not be appropriate. Defendants contend that such a finding would necessarily be based on a \"provocation theory\" that was rejected by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Cty. of Los Angeles v. Mendez\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604325\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1539/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604325\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1539/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). This contention is mistaken, as explained above. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Mendez\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court said a reasonable use of force could not be deemed unconstitutional due to another distinct constitutional violation, here the jury found that Defendants' use of force-including Zaro's authorization of that force-was itself unreasonable, and was unconstitutional as such. There is no reason to believe the jury applied a \"provocation rule\" that they were never instructed on and that did not fit the facts or arguments presented to them at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Because liability was properly found against Zaro, the jury's verdict on this claim against Zaro's employer, the City of Lakewood, was appropriate as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable Search and Seizure: Explosive Breach (Verdict Question Four)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Question Four of the verdict form read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Plaintiffs the Estate of Leonard Thomas, E.T., Fred Thomas, and Annalesa Thomas bring a Fourth Amendment constitutional claim for unreasonable seizure of their house through use of the explosive breach.

Defendants argue that this award was improperly inflated because \"[c]learly, the jury was awarding damages for the shooting of Leonard Thomas that occurred after the breach.\" (ECF 282 at 13.) Defendants maintain this was impermissible (once more) because the jury improperly relied on the Ninth Circuit's \"provocation theory,\" and because these Plaintiffs were already compensated for the shooting of Leonard under other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Court disagrees.

Here, in contrast, the officers did have a valid warrant, but the jury found that the officers' entry was not executed in a reasonable manner. Even when a warrant is validly issued, the warrant may be \"unreasonably executed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dalia v.

Given the state of negotiations with Leonard-he was on the front porch with E.T., a car seat, and an overnight bag, requesting Annalesa come to escort E.T. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 264 at 185)-the jury found that the use of an explosive charge was inherently dangerous and unreasonably destructive. That finding was supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Because the jury found in favor of Plaintiffs on several of their claims, the verdict form provided space for the jury to award damages under Question Ten. (ECF 237 at 11.) For each Plaintiff, the verdict form listed each claim brought by that Plaintiff and a line for the jury to assign damages for that claim. Thus, for example, Question 10a, as completed by the jury, read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    10a. E.T.:\n   </strong>\n   For the claims you found in favor of E.T., what damages do you find for E.T. for each claim:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-115\">\u2022 Unreaonable seizure from his father (Question 1): $<em>500,000</em> \u2022 Deprivation of his familial relationship with Leonard (Question 3): $<em>2,750,000</em> \u2022 Unreasonable seizure of his house (Question 4): $<em>125,000</em> \u2022 Unreasonable seizure of his dog (Question 5): $<em>N/A</em> \u2022 Outrage (Question 8): $<em>125,000</em> \u2022 Negligent Investigation (Question 9): $<em>500,000</em> (ECF 237 at 11.)</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendants contend that the jury mistakenly included damages for the shooting of Leonard in their award for unreasonable seizure of the house. However, the verdict form clearly delineated these claims, so that when the jury came to the third line for damages related to the unreasonable seizure of the house,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the explosive breach, it had already awarded $3.25 million to E.T. for damages related to the shooting of Leonard. There is no reason to assume the jury believed that damages awarded for the explosive breach should include compensation to E.T. (or the other Plaintiffs) for a separate injury on which the jury had already ordered compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Moreover, the jury awarded substantially more on this claim to Annalesa ($500,000) than to E.T., Fred, or the Estate ($125,000) each. If the jury understood this claim to concern the shooting that followed the breach, this differentiation would make no sense because the jury did not find that the shooting caused substantially more harm to Annalesa than to the other Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 237 at 11-12 (awarding Leonard and E.T. greater damages than Annalesa on claims related to the shooting, and awarding Fred equal damages to Annalesa on claims related to the shooting).) Rather, it is more likely the jury concluded that Annalesa suffered greater emotional distress from the unreasonable seizure of the house because, unlike Leonard and\n   E.T., she owned the house, and unlike Fred, she was present when the explosive breach occurred. This greater emotional distress would properly produce a greater damages award. Thus, there is no reason to believe that the jury intended damages awarded for the explosive breach to compensate Plaintiffs for the shooting of Leonard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   At a hearing held regarding remittitur and qualified immunity on December 5, 2017, five months after the close of trial, Defendants for the first time offered an estimate of the value of the Thomas home to argue that the damages awarded for the explosive breach were excessive. The Court will not consider evidence that was not before the jury when it rendered its verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young ex rel. Lowman v. Olds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=168%20Fed.%20Appx.%20140\">\n    168 Fed.Appx. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140-41 (8th Cir. 2006). Moreover, despite receiving an opportunity to question the jury after the verdict was rendered regarding any inconsistencies or duplication, Defendants declined to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 295-1.) Because the evidence introduced at trial supported a finding that the explosive breach was unreasonable and that it was the source of destruction and mental anguish totaling the sums awarded by the jury, Defendants' claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendants additionally argue that Wiley's only involvement in the explosive breach was to relay the order from Zaro to the entry team at the back of the house, which they argue is insufficient to support liability. (ECF 282 at 14.) But the jury heard testimony from Zaro that \"Officer Wiley was asking repeatedly whether he could go ahead and breach.\" (ECF 263 at 198.) And in his post-incident interview, Wiley recalled his role in the breach:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   I'm like, 'All right, all right. Hey sir this is not working. I need to set a charge now.' ... I'm not getting anything, not getting anything like fuck it. 'Side 3, set that charge.' Um, then I got the hold.... And then finally it was just like, 'Hey screw this.' Um, I can't miss another opportunity where he separates from the kid, um. 'Hey [Cannon] set the charge.' [Zaro's] like, 'yeah, good with that.' ... 'Hey charge is set.' 'Hey sir, if I get an opportunity you know, I'm going to have [Cannon's] team go through Side 3, we're going to punch through Side 1.' ... So this time I get authorization to make the breach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   (Trial Ex. 41 at 35, 40, 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably determined that Wiley was a but-for cause of the explosive breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable Seizure of the Dog (Verdict Question Five)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Question Five of the verdict form read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Plaintiffs the Estate of Leonard Thomas and E.T. bring a Fourth Amendment claim for unreasonable seizure of their dog. Did any of the Defendants unreasonably seize the dog when they killed him, or cause an unreasonable seizure of the dog?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (ECF 237 at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The jury found Wiley liable to Leonard's Estate on this claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants argue this verdict is legally and logically inconsistent because the jury did not find liability against Vance even\n   though Vance also shot the dog Baxter. Defendants explain, \"the verdict form did not ask the jury whether Vance and Wiley acted unreasonably when they 'shot' Baxter, but whether they acted unreasonably when they 'killed' him. Consequently, the verdict would have to be either 'yes' or 'no' for both officers.\" (ECF 282 at 16 n.6.) On the contrary, the jury's verdict can be reconciled by the fact that Baxter was still alive after Vance shot it and before Wiley shot it. The jury could have found that Vance's use of force was reasonably calibrated to eliminate the threat from the dog, but that Wiley's subsequent decision to kill the dog was unreasonably gratuitous. Even if Defendants did not waive this claim by failing to ask the jury for clarification when given the opportunity, their argument fails on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Fred's Fourth Amendment Seizure Claim (Verdict Question Six)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Question Six of the verdict form read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   Plaintiff Fred Thomas brings a Fourth Amendment constitutional claim for unreasonable seizure of his person.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) First, Defendants challenge whether Zaro and Cannon participated in Fred's arrest. Evidence presented at trial revealed that Cannon, the entry team leader, was at the back of house where Fred was arrested. (ECF 263 at 175.) After Micenko stopped Fred, Cannon radioed Zaro and said, \"We've got the property owner and the father of the suspect detained. Where would you like [him]?\" Zaro asked, \"Other than him generally inserting himself onto the scene, does any of his activity warrant going to jail?\" Cannon responded, \"I guess that depends on how cooperative he is with you guys but you have at least obstructing on him if you want to.\" Zaro said, \"That's what I need, thanks.\" (Trial Ex. 1041 at 10-11.) Fred was then taken to jail, where he was kept until two detectives and a chaplain arrived to inform him that Leonard had died. (ECF 266 at 133-34, 159.) Based on this evidence, the jury reasonably concluded that Cannon and Zaro jointly made the decision to take Fred into custody for obstruction of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Next, Defendants argue that even if Cannon and Zaro were responsible for Fred's arrest, the arrest was supported by probable cause, and holding Cannon and Zaro liable would be inconsistent with the jury's finding that Micenko was not liable. Fred testified that after his wife called him to request that he leave work and come help with Leonard, Fred drove within a few blocks of the house, where police informed him that the roads were closed. (ECF 266 at 124-25.) Fred decided to walk around to the back of the house, climb the fence, and attempt to walk over to talk to Leonard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126.) Fred testified that as soon as he climbed over the fence, officers yelled at him to put his hands up and to get on the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128.) Fred further testified that he complied with the order and explained that he was Leonard's father and simply wanted to talk to his son in order to help de-escalate the conflict, and that he was worried his son would be killed. Nonetheless, he was arrested and escorted to jail. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 128-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Based on this evidence, the jury could have concluded that Micenko's initial seizure of Fred was justified in order to prevent any interference with the ongoing operation. However, the jury may also have reasonably concluded that Zaro's and Cannon's decision to transform that\n   initial, temporary investigative stop into a full custodial arrest was not supported by probable cause. \"The Fourth Amendment prohibits 'unreasonable searches and seizures' by the Government, and its protections extend to brief investigatory stops of persons or vehicles that fall short of traditional arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

During an investigatory stop, a police officer may briefly stop and detain an individual for investigation without a warrant if the officer reasonably suspects that the person is engaged or about to be engaged in criminal conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, the jury may have reasonably concluded that Micenko was not liable for briefly detaining Fred after Fred crossed the police perimeter, but that Zaro's and Cannon's decision to transform that brief detention into a custodial arrest lacked probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Alternatively, the jury may have recognized that when Zaro and Cannon made the decision to take Fred into custody, they had more information about Fred's legitimate intentions than Micenko possessed during the initial detention. By the time Zaro and Cannon decided to have Fred transported to jail, they knew that Fred was the property owner and father of Leonard. Fred had the opportunity to explain that he merely sought to help resolve the standoff with Leonard peacefully by talking to his son. Thus, the jury could have concluded that by the time Zaro and Cannon decided to formalize Fred's arrest, there was no longer a fair probability that Fred had willfully hindered, delayed, or obstructed law enforcement, and therefore there was no rational reason for his arrest. As the Ninth Circuit has held, probable cause for obstruction is not present where an individual complies with a police order slowly or fails to comply for only a few seconds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mackinney v.

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Fred, he did no worse than comply with the officers' orders slowly. Because his actions did not supply probable cause for a custodial arrest, and the evidence supports a finding that Fred's custodial arrest was ordered by Zaro and Cannon, liability on this claim against those two Defendants was not inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   H.\n   <em>\n    State Law False Arrest (Verdict Question Seven)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Question Seven of the verdict form read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiff Fred Thomas brings a claim under Washington state law for false arrest.

The cases cited by Defendants recognize the emotional distress inherent in the experience of a close family member's death.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Grimsby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=530%20P.2d%20291\">\n    530 P.2d at 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . E.T. was being held in his father's arms when Leonard was shot and could be heard crying \"Daddy, Daddy!\" (ECF 264 at 186.) Annalesa was on the street in front of the house when she heard an explosion and gunfire, and said, \"Oh my God, they've shot my son.\" (ECF 267 at 158-59.) An officer had to drag her down the street away from the scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 159.) Defendants consistently represent the facts in the light most favorable to themselves and consistently fail to recognize the scope of Plaintiffs' loss, and the traumatic nature of the way in which the loss took place. The jury resoundingly found otherwise. Its finding stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the award for outrage is duplicative of the recovery E.T. and Annalesa won for their Fourteenth Amendment deprivation of familial relationship claims. In fact, however, these claims represent distinct injuries. The Fourteenth Amendment claim represents the permanent loss of E.T.'s father and Annalesa's son; the outrage claim represents the emotional trauma of being present when Leonard was killed. Each claim exists independently of the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   J.\n   <em>\n    Negligent Child Abuse Investigation (Verdict Question Nine)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Question Nine of the verdict form reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiff E.T. brings a claim against the Cities of Fife and Lakewood under Washington state law for negligence in the investigation which separated him from his father. Did a negligent investigation by employees of the Cities of Fife or Lakewood cause the wrongful permanent\n   removal of E.T. from his father Leonard Thomas?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   (ECF 237 at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The jury found the Cities of Fife and Lakewood liable to E.T. on this claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The relevant statute provides that \"A law enforcement officer may take, or cause to be taken, a child into custody without a court order if there is probable cause to believe that the child is abused or neglected and that the child would be injured or could not be taken into custody if it were necessary to first obtain a court order.\" RCW 26.44.050. The Supreme Court of Washington has recognized that this statutory duty implies a cause of action for children and parents for negligent investigation where authorities remove a child from a nonabusive home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.W. v. Dep't of Soc. &amp; Health Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292551\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/149/589/\">\n    149 Wash.2d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20P.3d%20954\">\n    70 P.3d 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 957 (2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Defendants argue that the statute cannot be implicated because Defendants were executing a valid warrant for Leonard's arrest, and Defendants did not take E.T. \"into custody\" due to the fact that E.T. was turned over to his family. However, trial testimony indicated that Defendants decided not to arrest Leonard the night of the incident because the mission of their operation became \"get[ting] custody of [E.T.].\" (ECF 263 at 82; ECF 264 at 156.) The jury could reasonably have concluded that the force used by Defendants was intended to remove E.T. from the custody of Leonard and bring him into the custody of law enforcement. The jury could have further concluded that Defendants failed to exercise reasonable care in their investigation of the need to remove E.T. from Leonard's custody, which caused E.T. to be removed from a non-abusive home by force. The fact that Defendants returned E.T. to his family after they secured custody of him does not excuse the manner in which E.T. was removed from his father's custody. Defendants also argue that they were improperly denied the opportunity to argue that Leonard was a superseding cause of any harm suffered by E.T. However, the jury was instructed in the context of the negligent investigation instructions on the principle of a superseding cause. (ECF 220 at 44.) The fact that the jury found liability despite this instruction indicates that it determined Defendants to be the proximate cause of the damages found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   K.\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages (Verdict Question Eleven)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Question Eleven of the verdict form asked whether punitive damages should be assessed against Zaro, Wiley, and/or Markert. (ECF 237 at 13.) Defendants briefly argue there was no evidence that they engaged in the type of conduct that would properly allow the issue of punitive damages to be placed before the jury. To the contrary, once the jury found that Defendants' actions were unreasonable and violated Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, it was reasonable and appropriate for the jury to consider the issue of punitive damages. The jury's conclusion that the Defendants' escalation and use of force resulting in the death of Leoanard exhibited malice, recklessness, or callous indifference to Plaintiffs' rights was a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence presented to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     DEFENDANTS' MOTION FOR REMITTITUR\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Defendants move for remittitur of the compensatory and punitive damages awarded against them.

The jury's findings should be discounted, Defendants' counsel repeated to the Court during the December 5, 2017 hearing on qualified immunity and remittitur, because \"what the jury found here is that they weren't going to go back to their individual communities and tell the people that they associate with, we found in favor of white cops that shot an unarmed black man.\" The Court could not more strongly reject Defendants' argument. Without any evidence-without any factual foundation whatsoever-Defendants have chosen to malign one of this country's most sacred civic institutions, the impartially selected petit jury. Eight individuals interrupted their lives for three and a half weeks of solemn attention to this case. These eight\n   individuals swore to try the matter at issue according to the evidence and the instructions of this Court. They listened, they watched, and for five days they deliberated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The suggestion that this jury flouted its charge and colluded to hold government officials liable merely to advance the jurors' individual reputations is not simply frivolous; it is insulting to our constitutional order. And the notion that the American justice system can be characterized by an illegitimate solicitude for black victims of alleged police misconduct is so painfully ahistorical that one wonders whether Defendants advance this argument seriously. Apparently, Defendants would have the Court declare a mistrial at this late stage on the basis of juror prejudice notwithstanding the fact that Defendants successfully moved to preclude the venire from viewing a video on unconscious bias (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 146, 163); notwithstanding the fact that Defendants only used two of their three peremptory challenges (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 168); notwithstanding the fact that Defendants represented to the Court that they accepted the jury as constituted (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 261 at 169); notwithstanding the fact that Defendants never requested a continuance or change of venue; notwithstanding the fact, should it even matter, that none of the jurors were African American; and notwithstanding the fact that all available evidence suggests each juror conducted himself or herself with integrity and impartiality. The Court declines Defendants' request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Perhaps Defendants intend to argue that the damages awarded in this case were inflated because of passions and prejudices that clouded the jury's logical reasoning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   If Defendants are, in fact, concerned that the jury's response to the facts of this case may have been colored by emotion, they fail to show that those emotions were somehow inappropriate. This jury was empaneled to hear a case about a misuse of police power that left a young man dead, a child fatherless, two parents devastated with grief. The law is not so cold and callous as to forbid an emotional reckoning with this suffering. The jury need not have-and could not have-avoided the manner and magnitude of the Thomas family's loss. Indeed, the jury was instructed to access its collective emotional register to consider whether the officials' conduct here \"shocks the conscience.\" (ECF 220 at 25) It found in the affirmative, and rationally calculated that the sound and fury unleashed by Defendants in May 2013 signified something very specific: $15,135,000 in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Compensatory Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Defendants move for remittitur on every claim for which the jury awarded damages.

Plaintiffs, however, submitted evidence that E.T. does appear to remember the relevant events. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 266 at 12.) Defendants seized E.T. from his father by shooting Leonard while he was holding E.T., and then pulling E.T. from Leonard's arms while he lie dying.

Defendants, however, ignore substantial evidence of Leonard's devotion and care for E.T. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 265 at 182-93; ECF 266 at 66-68, 72-75, 93, 119-21, 137-38, 148-54; ECF 267 at 37-39, 172-77.) Leonard was described by those who knew him as a father who loved his child and lived for his child, serving as E.T.'s primary caregiver and custodian. When Defendants ended Leonard's life they also severed one of the most important relationships in E.T.'s life. The jury's verdict will stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable seizure of his house.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Defendants request that the $125,000 awarded to E.T. for the unreasonable seizure of his house be reduced to $1 because E.T. did not remember the explosive breach and was not injured by it. Defendants ignore E.T.'s right not to have the home where he lived seized in an unconstitutional manner. An unreasonable violation of the personal home is not simply a nominal harm. The jury heard testimony that E.T., who rarely cried, sobbed when reminded of his old home and wanted to return even though he knew his father was no longer there. (ECF 267 at 177-78.) The damages awarded by the jury for the unreasonable seizure of his home will not be adjusted by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Outrage.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Defendants request that the $125,000 awarded to E.T. for outrage be reduced to $1 because the damages are duplicative of those awarded on his civil rights causes of action. Outrage, however, recognizes damages for personal presence during the injury of an immediate family member,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid v.

E.T. was present in the worst way when his father was killed-embraced by Leonard when the bullet hit, and pried from Leonard's arms as his father bled to death. Defendants further argue, \"This is an example of the jury seeing a dollar-sign with a blank next to it and feeling obligated to fill in a number.\" (ECF 284 at 18.) This contention, however, is impossible to square with the jury's decision not to award any damages to Fred for excessive force during his arrest despite finding Zaro and Cannon liable on that claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 237 at 12.) The verdict reveals that the jury only awarded damages where it deemed an award to be appropriate. Given E.T.'s physical presence when his father was killed, the Court will not disturb the amount of the jury's verdict on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Negligent investigation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Defendants request that the $500,000 awarded to E.T. for negligence in the investigation that precipitated the entire episode and separated him from his father be reduced to $1 because the award was duplicative. Moreover, this was the only claim on which the jury found liability against the City of Fife, which again suggests that the jury was considering independent actions or consequences unique to each claim. Defendants rejected Plaintiffs' proposed verdict form, which carefully avoided any possibility of duplication (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   208), and declined to raise any inconsistencies in the completed verdict form-despite receiving the opportunity to do so-before the jury was dismissed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 295-1). Defendants have otherwise failed to carry their burden of demonstrating duplication, and accordingly the jury's verdict will not be disturbed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Jury's Awards to the Estate of Leonard Thomas.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable seizure of E.T.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Defendants request that the $750,000 awarded to the Estate for the unreasonable seizure of E.T. be reduced to $50,000 because Leonard could have expected that he was not going to be allowed to keep E.T. that night. Defendants ignore that Plaintiff's claim was not simply that E.T. was seized, but that E.T. was seized in a horrific manner. Police seized E.T. from Leonard by shooting Leonard in the stomach and then punching him in the face as they forcibly pulled his son from his arms. The anguish and distress that Leonard experienced due to this separation supports the jury's full award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Excessive force.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Defendants request that the $1,000,000 awarded to the Estate for the excessive force used against Leonard be reduced to $500,000 because Leonard was rendered unconscious within minutes of the shooting. Notwithstanding Defendants' unseemly efforts to diminish the physical pain and anguish suffered by a dying man, Defendants also ignore the fact that the jury was instructed to consider in its award of any damages, \"The loss of enjoyment of life experienced and that with reasonable probability will be experienced in the future,\" and \"Deprivation of life.\" (ECF 220 at 46.) These categories go beyond the agony that Leonard experienced in the final moments of his life to encompass the total sum of his loss. The Court will not disturb the jury's award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable seizure of his house.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Defendants request that the $125,000 awarded to the Estate for the unreasonable seizure of Leonard's house be reduced to $5,000 because it could come as no surprise that his home would become occupied by the police given the circumstances. As with their arguments against the Estate's award for unreasonable seizure of E.T., Defendants ignore the unconstitutional manner in which the seizure of the house occurred. Even though Defendants had a warrant to enter Leonard's home, the Constitution nonetheless applied to their method of entry. The method Defendants chose-an explosive breach ignited when Leonard was unarmed and negotiating the surrender of E.T. to Annalesa-was a dangerous, escalatory, destructive intrusion. The damages awarded fairly reflect the jury's view of the magnitude of that violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable seizure of his dog.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Defendants request that the $10,000 awarded to the Estate for the unreasonable killing of Leonard's dog Baxter be reduced to $1 because the dog was in poor health and may not have survived the first volley of shots fired by Nathan Vance, who was found not liable. Dogs do not lose all of their value, however, when they become ill, and Defendants cannot point to unrefuted evidence in the record that this dog would not have survived but for Wiley's gratuitous gunshots. Leonard's emotional attachment to Baxter was apparent from the manner in which he mourned the dog's illness, and that loss supports an award of $10,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Jury's Awards to Annalesa Thomas.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Deprivation of familial relationship with Leonard.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Defendants request that the $750,000 awarded to Annalesa for the deprivation of her familial relationship with Leonard be\n   reduced to $250,000 because Annalesa had a troubled relationship with Leonard and was a domestic violence victim of Leonard on the night he was killed. The domestic violence in question involved Leonard grabbing Annalesa's wrist during the scuffle over a phone. As an example of Annalesa's troubled relationship with Leonard, Defendants point out that \"She wrote a letter to a court in one of Leonard's criminal cases, begging for something short of a jail sentence because Leonard was an end-stage alcoholic who could die during alcohol withdrawals.\" (ECF 284 at 21.) A mother's begging the court for leniency on behalf of her son, however, seems to be more an example of parental love for her child than an example of antagonism or estrangement. That love was well documented during trial, and the jury witnessed firsthand the grief that Annalesa continues to endure. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF 267 at 141-42.) The jury's award was an appropriate calculation of the damages suffered by a mother's loss of her child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable seizure of her house.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Defendants request that the $500,000 awarded to Annalesa for the unreasonable seizure of her house be reduced to $5,000 because the evidence does not support the jury's decision to award Annalesa a greater sum on this claim than was awarded to the other Plaintiffs. The jury's decision to award a greater sum to Annalesa than to the other Plaintiffs may be explained by the fact that unlike Leonard and E.T., Annalesa owned title to the house. And unlike Fred, she was present when the explosive breach was detonated. The jury could reasonably have concluded that these variables resulted in greater damages to Annalesa. The fact that Annalesa summoned the police to help deescalate a minor conflict with her son was not a license for an unconstitutional entry that damaged her house and exacerbated the standoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Outrage.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Defendants request that the $125,000 awarded to Annalesa for outrage be reduced to $1 because she did not see Markert's bullet strike Leonard. Defendants provide no citation, however, for a requirement that Annalesa physically witness the shooting. Annalesa was present at the scene, heard the explosion and gunfire that killed her child, and exclaimed, \"Oh my God, they've shot my son.\" (ECF 267 at 158-59.) This is precisely the type of emotional trauma for which outrage damages are intended to compensate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grimsby v.

On the contrary, the jury heard extensive testimony about the enduring, loving, father-son bond between Fred and Leonard. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF 266 at 112-13, 139-41; ECF 267 at 38-39, 170-71.) The jury was entitled to credit this testimony and award Fred $750,000 for the loss of his son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Unreasonable seizure of his house.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Defendants ask that the $125,000 awarded to Fred for the unreasonable seizure of his house be reduced to $1 because Fred did not suffer any harm as a result of his house being seized. The jury found that the police caused unreasonable destruction to a home Fred owned, and that finding is supported by the evidence. The violation of residential property is not a trivial matter. The Court cannot say that the jury's award was \"grossly excessive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    False arrest.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Defendants ask that the $500,000 awarded to Fred for false arrest be reduced to $50,000 because the jury \"essentially awarded Fred damages for the lost opportunity to bring the standoff to a peaceful resolution.\" (ECF 284 at 23.) Defendants have not provided any citation, however, for why the jury was not permitted to consider the circumstances of the arrest and the emotional toll that Fred endured during his wrongful confinement. The jury found that Zaro and Cannon ordered Fred to be removed from the scene even though Fred had explained that he was the property owner and simply wanted to speak with his son. Regardless of whether Fred could have successfully contributed to resolving the standoff had he been permitted to remain, the consequences of removing him were severe. He wrongfully spent the night in a cell, unable to speak to his wife or son during this critical moment in their lives. He testified, \"I sat in that cage all night long, knowing my son was dead.\" (ECF 266 at 134.) The following morning two officers and a chaplain arrived to inform Fred that Leonard had indeed been killed. When police returned Fred's cellphone he saw a missed call and voicemail from Leonard where, Fred testified, \"He begs me, 'Please help me, Dad. Please help me, Dad,' and I never heard it till the next day.\" (ECF 266 at 168.) The jury had an opportunity to observe Fred testify and view his still-palpable grief. Its award for the false arrest of Fred is supported by the evidence presented to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Punitive Damages\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   The jury imposed punitive damages against Zaro in the amount of $3 million, against Markert in the amount of $2 million, and against Wiley in the amount of $1.5 million. Defendants argue that the punitive damages award was unreasonable and violated the Constitution's Due Process Clause. The Court assesses reasonableness through analysis of the \"\n   <em>\n    Hammond\n   </em>\n   factors\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   (a) whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the harm likely to result from the defendant's conduct as well as the harm that actually occurred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   (b) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, duration of that conduct, the defendant's awareness, any concealment, and the existence and frequency of similar past conduct;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-228\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-229\">\n   (d) the \"financial position\" of the defendant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-230\">\n   (e) all the costs of litigation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   (f) the imposition of criminal sanctions on the defendant for its conduct, these to be taken in mitigation; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   (g) the existence of other civil awards against the defendant for the same conduct, these also to be taken in mitigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

The Court may also look to \"other general elements of reasonableness to determine whether a punitive damage award should be upheld.

The harm caused and reprehensibility exhibited by the Defendants warrants significant condemnation. The Defendants have not been subject to any other civil or criminal sanction, and they have not borne the costs\n   of litigation. Indeed, this jury verdict is the only form of accountability Defendants face for their conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The sole factor that might raise a question about the amount of the award is the Defendants' financial position. Defendants argue that the punitive damages amount to \"the financial equivalent of a death sentence\" because they failed to \"take into account the financial realities of being a career police officer.\" (ECF 284 at 6.) There are two problems with this argument. First, \"There is no constitutional prohibition of awards in excess of a party's net worth.\"\n   <em>\n    Dawe v. Corr.

While this factor may weigh in Defendants' favor, it is not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Second, Defendants may not argue that the jury unreasonably failed to consider the Defendants' financial position when Defendants made the strategic choice not to present evidence of their finances to the jury.

The jury obviously found that the type of harm and reprehensible conduct revealed at trial were unusually severe, even for a wrongful death case. At every step of the evening after Annalesa and Thomas first asked the police for help resolving where E.T. should spend the night, Defendants escalated the probability that someone would die. They responded to a minor domestic dispute with a full SWAT Team including two armored trucks and two snipers. When Leonard brought E.T. onto the porch in preparation to hand him off, Zaro ordered his team-including the snipers-not to let Leonard back inside with his son. Wiley orchestrated an explosive breach that destabilized any hope for a peaceful resolution. Markert shot and killed an unarmed man who was holding his son in his arms. Unlike civilians, police officers are trained to respond to tense conflicts with equipoise and empathy. Instead, taking the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict, these three defendants exhibited conduct that was reckless and destined to cause harm. The Supreme Court has recognized that conduct causing physical harm is more reprehensible than conduct causing merely economic harm, and conduct that evinces indifference or reckless disregard for the health or safety of others is more likely to be reprehensible than a mere accident.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/#p575\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/#p575\">\n    at 575-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745877\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/559/#p575\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(ECF 295 at 96-97.) This spreadsheet suffers an obvious deficiency: it includes all cases where the jury awarded punitive damages, for any claim. That a jury assessed $5,000 in a Fair Housing Act action (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fountila v.

They argue that the officers were told that Leonard had a pistol and that he had hung his son out of a second-story window, that the officers knew Leonard was agitated, and that the officers knew that Leonard never released E.T. during the course of the four and a half hour standoff. Defendants would have the Court focus on these facts in isolation, without reference to the evidence submitted by Plaintiffs, to find that Defendants' use of force was constitutional. But even if the Court were to give credence to Defendants' novel form of \"deference\" to the jury's findings, they would not prevail. That an agitated man may have a pistol, and may have held his son dangerously hours earlier, does not supply constitutional authorization for his killing. The shooting of Leonard could only be justified if Leonard posed an immediate threat to the safety of officers or to others. This disputed fact required a jury trial, and the jury supplied a unanimous answer: No he did not. To the extent Defendants have challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the liability findings (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 282), the Court has rejected these arguments in Part III above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Clearly Established Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   The final question is whether these constitutional violations found were \"clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    al-Kidd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    563 U.S. 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 1149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). \"A Government official's conduct violates clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct, '[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear' that every 'reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924024,12459540\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/563/731/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Creighton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28199\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/635/#p640\">\n    483 U.S. 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28199\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/635/#p640\">\n    107 S.Ct. 3034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28199\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/635/#p640\">\n    97 L.Ed.2d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) ).

The Government's interest in the use of the explosive breach was not strong because-unlike in\n   <em>\n    Boyd\n   </em>\n   -the SWAT Team members were under no conceivable threat of danger. There was no indication that Leonard was armed or threatening anyone's safety when the breach was requested, authorized, and executed. Additionally, Defendants devoted insufficient consideration to alternatives-most obviously, continuing peaceful negotiations with Leonard, who had cooperated by bringing E.T. onto the porch with a car seat and overnight bag, and who had indicated his willingness to release E.T. to Annalesa. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 264 at 185; ECF 269 at 95-96; ECF 267 at 151-52.) As expert testimony revealed at trial, \"[at] no time in this incident would that explosive breach on Side 3 have been appropriate.... There were no threats, there were no issues at all, that necessitated the use of explosives at any time during this incident.\" (ECF 165 at 17-18.) The use of the explosive breach was \"an emergency assault. There was never an emergency that required them ever to make entry into this house. Never. Because negotiations hadn't failed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Zaro and Wiley violated the Fourth Amendment when they caused an explosive breach to be used on the backdoor of a suspect's house when the suspect was unarmed and negotiating peacefully with officers, and when Zaro's order to snipers not to let Leonard back into the house with E.T. remained outstanding. This violation was clearly established.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Shooting of the dog.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Defendants argue that Wiley's decision to shoot Baxter after Vance had already shot the dog twice was justified because the dog remained a threat. Baxter's menacing nature was a disputed fact at trial. Vance testified that as he and Wiley stormed the house after the explosive breach, he shot Leonard's dog twice, and shortly thereafter Wiley fired additional shots killing the dog. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 269 at 208-09.) The jury found that Vance's decision to shoot Baxter was reasonable, but that Wiley's decision to shoot the dog was not. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 237 at 6; ECF 220 at 26.) The only fair inference from this verdict is that the jury determined that Baxter could not reasonably have been viewed as dangerous after he was shot twice by Vance. The Court has no reason to disturb that finding.

Defendants complain that the Court's decision to exclude this evidence left the jury with the misimpression that Leonard was not a threat to E.T. or the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   To the extent Defendants desired to introduce this evidence in order to justify Zaro's command not to let Leonard back into the house or to justify Markert's decision to fire the lethal shot, they ignore the Fourth Amendment rule that the reasonableness of an officer's conduct is determined based on the information available to the officer at the time of the conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Police did not discover these weapons until after the house was breached and Leonard was shot, and therefore the existence of the weapons cannot retroactively justify those decisions. Besides, absent any other supporting evidence, the existence of a knife and unloaded mini-crossbow inside a home is not probative of any intent Leonard may have harbored to harm E.T. Leonard certainly could not have threatened E.T. or the police with the weapons during the moments between the explosive breach and Markert's shot because, as Plaintiff's proved and Defendants do not contest, Leonard did not have access to any weapons during this period. The Court balanced the danger of unfair prejudice to Plaintiffs from the introduction of this evidence as required by Federal Rule of Evidence 403, and concluded that this danger substantially outweighed any probative value related to liability or damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Duplicative Case Presentations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   The separate counsel representing the Estate of Leonard Thomas and the Individual Plaintiffs (Fred, Annalesa, and E.T.) were permitted to divide their time at trial as they pleased, so long as their aggregate amount of time did not exceed the amount time that was allotted to Defendants' counsel. Defendants argue that they were nonetheless prejudiced by this arrangement because questions asked of a witness by the Estate's counsel were occasionally repeated to the same witness by counsel for the Individual Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   Even if Defendants could show that this sporadic repetition was prejudicial-which they cannot-Defendants waived this argument by failing to object during trial. \"A party challenging the admission of evidence must timely object and state the specific grounds for his objection.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants now argue that raising the objection that a question had been asked and answered would have been \"futile (at best) and signaled to the jurors Defendants were hiding something (at worst).\" (ECF 283 at 13.) Defendants are free to choose their own trial strategy and devise their own predictions about how jurors will respond to their behavior, but raising an objection would not have been futile in at least one regard: the objection would have preserved this issue for appeal. By failing to do so, Defendants forfeited their opportunity to ask the Court and opposing counsel to take any corrective measures that may have been necessary. If Defendants had raised an objection, the Court would have had an opportunity, outside the presence of the jury, to caution Plaintiffs' counsel against repetitive questioning. In any event, the Court allocated trial time in a fair manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Race-Based Arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court erred by permitting Plaintiffs \"to discuss 'racial factors' allegedly influencing Defendants' decision-making on the night in question.\" (ECF 283 at 14.) Defendants contend that the \"most egregious display of Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   exploitation\" of racial factors occurred when Plaintiffs' counsel told the jury during closing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-320\">\n   Because you need to know who he was so that you do think and you do understand that Leonard's background and his life mattered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-322\">\n   These lives do matter, and these SWAT teams and police officers need to know that you don't use deadly force when it's not justified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   (ECF 283 at 15 (quoting ECF 272 at 179-80 &amp; 183).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   In other words, Defendants suggest that a new trial is required because attorneys in a wrongful death case suggested to a jury that the decedent's life mattered. Viewed in context, these statements represented Plaintiffs' legitimate effort to refute what they perceived as Defendants' attempt to diminish the worth of Leonard's life by highlighting negative aspects of his background. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 272 at 178.) That effort, and Plaintiffs' rare references to Leonard's race during trial, were appropriate in light of the facts of this case. There is simply nothing in the record to support the argument that Plaintiffs prejudiced the jury with racial arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Excluding Reference to the Josh Powell Incident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Defendants next argue that the Court erred by granting Plaintiffs' motion in limine to exclude testimony about Josh Powell, a man who brutally killed himself and his children in his residence in Tacoma, Washington in February 2012. (ECF 283 at 15.) Defendants contend that Zaro and other officers would have testified that the Powell incident was fresh in their minds as they gauged the appropriateness of their response to the Leonard Thomas standoff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)

However, even relevant evidence may be excluded \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of ... unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, [or] misleading the jury.\" Fed. R. Evid. 403. The Court determined that testimony regarding the Josh Powell incident risked significant unfair prejudice to Plaintiffs because the jury might have been tempted to conflate two episodes that were quite distinct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   The details of the Powell incident received substantial media coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Josh Powell was already suspected of killing his wife on the night of the murder-suicide, and had been denied custody of his two sons pending a psychosexual evaluation related to a voyeurism and child pornography investigation. After donating his boys' toys to Goodwill and emailing his attorney, \"I'm sorry, goodbye,\" Powell executed his deadly plan.

He pulled the children inside and locked the door. By the time the contract caseworker reached the door, she smelled gasoline and started pounding on the door and windows. An explosion ripped through the house. Three minutes later, when firefighters arrived on the scene, the residence was fully engulfed in flames. An autopsy revealed the father also actually tried to chop his sons with a hatchet before setting the fire.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   When police responded to the Thomas residence, in contrast, Leonard had full custody of his son and was not suspected of anything approaching murder. Moreover, Defendants had the benefit of a four hour standoff to learn that Leonard was unarmed and only wanted the police to leave him alone for the night. While officers may always prepare for the worst when they respond to a disturbance, they are nonetheless obligated to tailor their actions and orders to the facts actually presented before them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bond v.

Just as Plaintiffs would not have been permitted to introduce the bloody details of police shootings in Ferguson, Missouri and beyond, Defendants could not present their own grisly account from Tacoma. This case was tried based on the facts that occurred in Fife, Washington on the night of May 23, 2013. Defendants explained to the jury their version and interpretation of those facts, which included extensive testimony about their fear that Leonard was a threat to E.T. Nonetheless, Defendants were found liable for acting unreasonably, and the punitive damages reflected the jury's fair determination that Defendants' response to those facts was malicious, oppressive, or in reckless disregard of Plaintiffs' rights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 220 at 47.) The Court's decision to exclude reference to the Powell murders was necessary to ensure that the facts of\n   <em>\n    this case\n   </em>\n   were not obscured by other sensational accounts that may have resulted in unfair prejudice to the parties or confused or misled the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Excluding the 3D Animations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court erred by excluding animations prepared by Defendants showing the final moments leading up to Markert's shooting of Leonard Thomas.

Any inaccuracy in Plaintiffs' animation, which was subject to scrutiny before the jury (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 168 at 29-37), did not create a risk of unfair prejudice comparable to Defendants' animation, which purported to show the broader scene as it unfolded before Markert fired his rifle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Discussion of Markert's Legal Representation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court erred by permitting Plaintiffs to reference Markert's decision to retain counsel in the context of arguing to the jury that Markert's written account of the shooting was \"a parody of an over-lawyered statement where every possible justification is thrown in and repeated page after page.\" (ECF 272 at 87.) Plaintiffs stated to the jury several times their belief that Markert's statement was a post-hoc rationalization designed to avoid legal accountability rather than a frank recollection of the events at issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 270 at 82, 88; ECF 272 at 40.) Defendants contend this was impermissible because \"[c]ommenting on a criminal suspect's decision to retain counsel is prohibited.\" (ECF 283 at 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kallin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414283\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/50/689/#p693\">\n    50 F.3d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693 (9th Cir. 1995).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   First, Defendants ignore the obvious: the constitutional concerns discussed by\n   <em>\n    Kallin\n   </em>\n   are not implicated because this was not a criminal trial. Second, Plaintiffs did not argue, or even suggest, that Markert should be found liable due to the fact that he retained counsel. That is, Plaintiffs did not introduce this fact for the truth of the matter. Rather, they argued that Markert's legalistic defense was designed to obscure the truth. Third, any prejudice suffered by Defendants is negated by the fact that Defendants themselves sought to undermine Fred Thomas's credibility on account of his decision to retain an attorney shortly after Leonard's death. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 167 at 11, ECF 172 at 145.) Plaintiffs' occasional references to Markert's attorney do not require a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Answering Jury's Question Regarding Cannon's Employment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   During deliberations, the jury asked, \"Is Jason Cannon (@ time of incident) a Lakewood officer? Is there an org chart in evidence of all SWAT officers at the time of incident with the roles they played? Is there a chart that shows all the officers and their department affiliation?\" (ECF 233 at 4.) Over Defendants' objection, the Court answered: \"Jason Cannon is a Lakewood police officer. For any further information, you must rely on your collective memory, notes, and the exhibits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The jury subsequently found Cannon liable for arresting Fred without probable cause, found the City of Lakewood liable for false arrest, and ordered zero damages against Cannon and $500,000 in damages against the City of Lakewood on the claims. (ECF 237 at 7, 8, 12.) Defendants argue that the jury \"would not have found Jason Cannon and the City of Lakewood liable for $500,000 in false arrest damages had the Court not provided that substantive answer to its question.\" (ECF 283 at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   A district court's response to a question from the jury is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instructions to the jury are reviewed for whether they were \"misleading\n   or confusing, inadequately guided the jury's deliberations, or improperly intruded on the fact-finding process.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

None of these errors were present in the Court's answer to the jury's question because the answer was a simple admitted fact from the record. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 213 \u00b6 2.3; ECF 263 at 145 (During direct examination of Zaro, \"Q: Officer Cannon as well is another defendant here with the City of Lakewood?; A: Yes.\").)

First, Defendants maintain it was inconsistent for the jury to find Wiley but not Vance liable for violating Plaintiffs' rights by killing Leonard's dog. Second, Defendants argue it was inconsistent for the jury to find Cannon but not Micenko liable for arresting Fred Thomas without probable cause.
