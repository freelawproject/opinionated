Stucco was initially capitalized with Schuster's personal funds. Schuster Decl. \u00b6 50, Ex. X; Marina Decl. \u00b6 18. Stucco employed several former ANSE employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Manuel D. Perez dated November 27, 2017 (\"Perez Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 2-23; Crowell Decl.

Schuster Decl. \u00b6 56; Declaration of Evan L. Thompson dated November 27, 2017 (\"Thompson Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 3. During that proceeding, National Union sought discovery against ANSE and Stucco, including taking a deposition of Schuster. Thompson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-8. On June 10, 2015, National Union filed a Protective Motion to Lift the Bankruptcy Stay and Allow Pursuit of Claim Against Stucco Systems (the \"Lift Motion\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Several hearings were held before the Bankruptcy Court, during which the ANSE bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but without judicial resolution on National Union's Lift Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On September 1, 2016, the United States Trustee (\"U.S. Trustee\") brought an adversary proceeding complaint against Stucco, Schuster, and Marina, which alleged that Stucco was a successor-in-interest to ANSE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.

On June 20, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the proposed settlement agreement, during which the Bankruptcy Court stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that it was \"not going to make a finding ... to determine whether those claims-what the fight is between those parties [National Union and Stucco]\" and was \"making no determination\" as to \"any claims held by third parties against other non-debtor entities, including the settling parties.\" Crowell Decl.

On August 23, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Trustee's Application to Compromise Claims of the Estate and to Execute Settlement Agreement and Release.

Although a non-signatory, Petitioner contends that Stucco is subject to the Payment Agreement's terms because Stucco is a successor-in-interest to ANSE, a signatory, and the parties' dispute falls squarely under the terms of the Payment Agreements. Petitioner argues that under the agreements' delegation clause, all questions of arbitrability, which would include whether Stucco is a successor-in-interest to ANSE, need to be determined by arbitrators. Respondent argues that the issue of successor liability was determined by the Bankruptcy Court in Stucco's favor, estopping Petitioner's argument here and, even if not, that Stucco is a distinct corporate entity from ANSE and not bound by the Payment Agreements.

For example, it is factually disputed whether the acquisitions Stucco made from ANSE were for adequate consideration. There are contested facts as to the degree that Stucco provided the same types of services as ANSE over the same area and from the same location. Whether ANSE and Stucco had similar or identical management is also a fact needed to be found. An evidentiary hearing, which was requested by the parties at oral argument and the Court agrees would be beneficial, is necessary to make these findings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    A/S Custodia v.
