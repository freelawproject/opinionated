Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this case involving alleged violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), Defendant Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (Ocwen), moves to dismiss Plaintiff Israel Aquilar's amended complaint or, in the alternative, to stay the proceedings pending a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in\n   <em>\n    ACA International v. FCC\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-1211 (D.C. Cir.). (Dkts. 8, 25.) For the reasons addressed below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Ocwen's motion to dismiss and denies Ocwen's motion to stay the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Aquilar alleges in his amended complaint that, beginning on April 13, 2012, and continuing at least through December 15, 2015, Ocwen made more than 1,000 unsolicited calls to Aquilar's cellular telephone to collect a consumer debt Aquilar allegedly owed. Aquilar claims that Ocwen placed these calls using an automatic telephone dialing system (ATDS) \"and/or using an artificial or prerecorded voice,\" in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Aquilar alleges that he \"clearly revoked any type of prior express consent\" that he had given Ocwen, \"if prior express consent ever existed to begin with.\" But the calls allegedly continued despite this revocation of consent. Aquilar commenced this lawsuit against Ocwen on May 9, 2017, seeking statutory damages, actual damages, and injunctive relief for negligent violations of the TCPA (Count I), for \"knowing and/or willful violations\" of the TCPA (Count II), and for common-law negligence (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ocwen now moves to dismiss Aquilar's amended complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Alternatively, Ocwen seeks to stay the proceedings pending a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in\n   <em>\n    ACA International v. FCC\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-1211 (D.C. Cir.). The petitioners in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   have challenged the validity of a July 2015 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Order (2015 FCC Order) in which the FCC interpreted the definition of the statutory term \"automatic telephone dialing system,\" a term that is at issue here.

Under the FCC's definition of capacity, both devices that already are configured for storing, generating, and calling random numbers and devices that\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be configured to do so in the future are automatic telephone dialing systems.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20FCC%20Rcd%207961\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The petitioners in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   argued that, contrary to the 2015 FCC Order, an automatic telephone dialing system \"must be able to do more than dial numbers from a prepared list.\" Joint Brief for Petitioners at 32,\n   <em>\n    ACA Int'l v.

A definition that includes merely dialing numbers \"from a database of numbers,\" the petitioners argued, does not comport with the statutory definition of an automatic telephone dialing system because a definition that includes merely dialing numbers from a database \"erases the phrase 'using a random or sequential number generator' \" from the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Ocwen argues that the D.C. Circuit's resolution of this issue will have a material effect on this case because Aquilar's claims depend on whether Ocwen's calls were placed with an automatic telephone dialing system, and the D.C. Circuit might \"overturn or at least narrow the FCC's definition of an 'autodialer.' \" But Ocwen does not explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   a change in the definition of \"automatic telephone dialing system\" will affect the viability of Aquilar's claims.

Cal. Sept. 15, 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Pendleton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204012043\">\n    2017 WL 4012043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Having carefully considered the parties' arguments, the Court concludes that the circumstances of this case do not warrant a stay. First, there is no indication of when the D.C. Circuit will issue its decision. As such, the duration of any stay would be unknown. \"The passage of time has made even less persuasive the argument that a final ruling in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   , which was argued more than a year ago, is 'imminent.' \"\n   <em>\n    Franklin v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-02702,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204922380\">\n    2017 WL 4922380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 31, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, the parties will be required to engage in discovery regardless of the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   because Aquilar's claims also involve allegations unaffected by that case, specifically the use of artificial- or prerecorded-voice calls. Moreover, as addressed above, Ocwen has not explained how a new definition of \"automatic telephone dialing system\" will affect the viability of Aquilar's claims. As such, Ocwen has not established that a stay will conserve the resources of the parties or the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Third, Aquilar has identified specific hardship that would result from a stay. Telephone companies do not retain records indefinitely, and Aquilar maintains that he would be unduly prejudiced by a stay because records vital to his case might be destroyed. Conversely, Ocwen has not established that it will suffer any specific hardship or inequity if a stay is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, Ocwen has not carried its burden of establishing the necessity of a stay pending the resolution of\n   <em>\n    ACA International\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis and all the files, records and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   1.

Because Aquilar's TCPA claims survive Ocwen's Rule 12(b)(6) statute-of-limitations argument, the Court need not consider the applicability of the\n    <em>\n     American Pipe\n    </em>\n    doctrine to resolve the pending motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Although the Eighth Circuit has not directly ruled on this issue, it acknowledged-before the 2015 FCC Order issued-that \"other circuit courts have concluded that prior consent to call one's cell phone may be revoked under the TCPA.\"\n    <em>\n     Brenner v.
