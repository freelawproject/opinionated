(\"ORI\") had breached an implied contract that, in LuxSoma's estimation, granted it exclusive rights to distribute ORI merchandise in the United States. LuxSoma further alleged that this breach was induced by Defendants Leg Resource, Inc. (\"Leg\") and its President, Wayne Lederman (\"Lederman\" and, together with Leg, the \"Leg Defendants\"), who signed an Exclusive\n   Distributorship Agreement with ORI in June 2012. LuxSoma asserted claims for breach of contract; interference with prospective economic advantage; false advertising in violation of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and unfair competition. Only the Leg Defendants were served; they now move for summary judgment and, in the alternative, to preclude the testimony of LuxSoma's expert, James Dooley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Leg Defendants advance three principal arguments in favor of summary judgment: (i) there was no contract between ORI and LuxSoma; (ii) even if such a contract existed, the Leg Defendants lacked knowledge of it; and (iii) neither Leg nor Lederman made any actionable misstatements. The Court agrees. On this record, no reasonable juror could find that the Leg Defendants knew that LuxSoma had\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   business relationship with ORI, let alone an exclusive distributorship, and no reasonable juror could find that Leg or Lederman made any material misstatements in discussing Leg's business relationship with ORI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. LuxSoma Solicits a Business Relationship with ORI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Violetta Lozovyy and her husband, Joseph Lozovyy, established LuxSoma in 2011 with a clear vision: to sell ORI legwear to American consumers. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 7, 18). In May 2011, Mrs. Lozovyy, LuxSoma's Vice President of Sales, informed ORI that she wished to sell ORI merchandise in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8). ORI invited her to visit the company in Italy, but warned her that \"we have very strict conditions with whom we do business. If you can satisfy those conditions, we can discuss further.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9). Additionally, ORI indicated that LuxSoma would have to purchase \u20ac20,000 of merchandise in order to \"start any negotiation or conversation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mrs. Lozovyy visited ORI in early June 2011. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 11). She met with Leonardo Costantini, who had been hired as ORI's Export Sales Manager the prior month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22, 23). Costantini-as he\n   takes pains to stress-was \"not a manager\" but \"a simple employee.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). Mrs. Lozovyy and Costantini met for \"three or four hours,\" and Giovana Mira, ORI's co-owner, briefly joined them. (Costantini Dep. 35:2-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Italy trip bore fruit: On June 20, 2011, LuxSoma signed a Non-Exclusive and Temporary Trademark License Contract with ORI. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 30). The contract permitted LuxSoma \"to promote and market ORI products ... in the territory of the U.S.A.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). It granted LuxSoma a \"non-exclusive\" trademark license, set to automatically expire on October 31, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 35). This trademark license-the only written contract between ORI and LuxSoma-was never renewed. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After ORI granted LuxSoma a non-exclusive trademark license, Costantini sent LuxSoma promotional materials to help LuxSoma market ORI merchandise in the United States. One such document described LuxSoma as ORI's \"exclusive distributor.\" It stated: \"Thanks to LuxSoma, LLC, as a partner of ORI Industria S.p.A., and an exclusive distributor, ORI brand is now in the USA.\" (Dkt. # 101-36). That was the only document LuxSoma ever received that referred to it as ORI's exclusive distributor. (J. Lozovyy Dep. 130:4-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2. LuxSoma's Exchanges with ORI Regarding Exclusivity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As it happened, this reference to LuxSoma as an \"exclusive distributor\" appears to have been more aspirational than actual. Eventually, LuxSoma discussed with ORI the possibility of becoming its exclusive distributor in the United States. ORI responded that, to become ORI's sole distributor, LuxSoma would first have to prove itself by purchasing large quantities of merchandise. As Mrs. Lozovyy explained: \"[ORI] said we don't provide anything in writing. Immediately once you establish yourself and deliver [\u20ac]500,000 ... we can re-discuss that possibility.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 11). She further stated: \"[T]o have [exclusivity] set in stone in the writing for years to come, at some point they said you know, if you give me [\u20ac]500,000 ... on the table, we will consider [it].\" (V. Lozovyy Dep. at 186:9-13). Mr. Lozovyy had a similar understanding: \"When we asked Giovana [Mira] about the exclusive rights, we asked what would it take. She said 'Volume. Give us volume, we give you exclusive rights.' \" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 15). He recalled that Mira then stated, \"if you buy from us on[e] quarter of [a] million, \u20ac250,000 ... I will give you exclusive rights right now.\" (Def. 56.1 Reply \u00b6 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   LuxSoma assumed that any exclusivity deal would be in writing. (V. Lozovyy Dep. 70:25-71:4). There was in fact no written deal. LuxSoma acknowledges that it never negotiated with ORI for exclusive rights to sell ORI merchandise (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 18), nor did it have a plan to pursue any such discussions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12). ORI, for its part, never provided LuxSoma with a specific timeframe within which ORI might grant LuxSoma exclusivity. (V. Lozovyy Dep. 64:15-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    3. LuxSoma's Efforts to Sell ORI Merchandise\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In July 2011, LuxSoma made an initial purchase of \u20ac20,000 of ORI merchandise. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 15). LuxSoma then sought to sell the merchandise. It opened kiosks in malls in Dallas, Texas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36). It hoped that, by selling to individual customers, it might \"familiarize the public with the ... new brand.\" (V. Lozovyy Dep. 73:15-22). These efforts did not bear fruit: From August to November 2011, LuxSoma sold a mere 500 to 1,000 units of hosiery to individual consumers. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   LuxSoma also tried to sell ORI merchandise to retail buyers. In August 2011, Mrs. Lozovyy contacted Neiman Marcus. (Def. 56.1 \u00b644). She sent Neiman Marcus samples of ORI merchandise and repeatedly tried to convince Neiman Marcus to carry ORI products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46). However, Neiman Marcus never placed an order. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47). Nor did Nordstrom (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50), Dillard's (V. Lozovyy Dep. 114:21-23), or any other department store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After selling just 500 to 1,000 units of hosiery at the kiosks and failing to secure any orders from department stores, LuxSoma next targeted online vendors. Over time, LuxSoma managed to sell a modest quantity of ORI merchandise online. It claims to have received purchase orders from HerRoom.com starting in late June 2012. (V. Lozovyy Dep. 121:5-20). From October 2012 until October 2015, LuxSoma sold merchandise to Zulily. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 53). LuxSoma also sold to an online retailer called Ideally, which made its first purchase in September 2013. (V. Lozovyy Dep. 126:9-15). Finally, sometime in the Summer of 2012, LuxSoma sold ORI products to Brands Exclusive, an online vendor in Australia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127:9-128:6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    4. ORI's Disappointment with LuxSoma's Results\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   LuxSoma sent ORI periodic updates. ORI knew of LuxSoma's modest sales at the Dallas kiosks and of its inability to secure any orders from department stores. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 56-58). By February 2012, ORI was concerned: LuxSoma's last sale had occurred in September 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57). And there was little reason to believe that business would suddenly pick up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   LuxSoma's messages to ORI did little to inspire confidence. On February 17, 2012, Mrs. Lozovyy emailed Costantini to advise that \"we have sold very little of [the] ORI product that we ... brought to the US last summer. We have given away almost half now just to bring a little awareness to the US about ORI.\" (Dkt. # 101-16 at 9). She estimated that LuxSoma would need \"at least 2-5 years to see something solid com[e] out of [its efforts to sell] ORI in the USA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On February 24, 2012, Mrs. Lozovyy wrote, \"we have not generated ANY profit from the previous 2 shipments.\" (Dkt. # 101-7 at 18). In consequence, she advised, \"the request to deliver the payment for [the Spring/Summer] collection is NOT feasible.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   One day later, on February 25, 2012, Mrs. Lozovyy told ORI that the \"sale[ ] of ORI product by LuxSoma has been frozen 'indefinitely' (so far we have sold a little more than 500 pairs total from 9,000 pairs that we had in our inventory).\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 64). On February 27, 2012, she said that\n   \"[w]ithout the name of [a] [b]ig [d]epartment store, ORI will not sell,\" and \"future investments [would] not [be] cost effective.\" (Dkt. # 101-7 at 19). On February 29, 2012, she wrote: \"I am already $60,000 in trouble and considering this to be a total loss!! Investing more into ORI ... will make my situation even wor[se], so I have more to [lose] and nothing to gain!\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Indicative of its financial distress, LuxSoma never paid in full for an order of Spring/Summer 2012 merchandise. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 69). Thus, in ORI's view, as of June 2012, \"the U.S. market was still open\" \"because [LuxSoma's] sales ... were so small.\" (Costantini Dep. 90:2-5). Costantini explained that \"[t]he sales in the U.S. were so small there was no[t] really a presence of the product[;] ... if I have a virgin market, I can go to anybody, anyone, to try to promote new products.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90:12-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Leg's Exclusive Distributorship Agreement with ORI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ORI sought a viable partner for the U.S. market. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 88). Lederman, Leg's President, first heard of ORI in February 2012, when a friend told Lederman that ORI had contacted him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 87). Lederman met with Giovana Mira and Marco Mira on April 16, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 94). He assumed that ORI had never sold its merchandise in the United States because \"[t]he way they were pursuing [a partnership with Leg] was as if they hadn't.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 107). Mr. and Mrs. Mira never told Lederman that they had previously dealt with LuxSoma. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During discussions with ORI, Leg insisted on exclusivity. (Lederman Dep. 28:11-25). According to Lederman, Leg would \"never\" have worked with ORI \"unless it was exclusive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28:24-29:8). Exclusivity \"was the criteri[on] with which [Leg] decided to move forward.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). ORI acceded to Leg's demand, and on June 21, 2012, they executed a written Exclusive Distributorship Agreement according to which ORI appointed Leg as an \"exclusive distributor for [ORI's] [p]roducts.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 115, 118). The agreement, valid through December 31, 2015, would automatically extend unless terminated by either party. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 116). It stipulated that ORI may not \"sell [its p]roducts to any other person or entity [in North America] without [Leg's] previous written consent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 10, 2012, Leg and ORI sent an announcement to buyers and retailers stating that ORI would be introduced to the United States for the first in August 2012, and that Leg was ORI's exclusive distributor for North America. (SAC \u00b6 30). They also placed an advertisement in the July 23, 2012 edition of\n   <em>\n    Women's Wear Daily\n   </em>\n   stating that ORI \"is gearing up for a journey to North America,\" with the ORI products to be distributed starting in August 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    6. The Leg Defendants' Ignorance of ORI's Prior Dealings with LuxSoma\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After ORI and Leg agreed to collaborate, Leg held itself out as ORI's exclusive distributor in North America. It did so to gauge buyer interest and to get buyers' feedback. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 110). It reached out to buyers from numerous department stores and online retailers; none of these buyers told Defendants that LuxSoma had previously tried to sell them ORI products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 108).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Leg first learned of LuxSoma's existence in July 2012. As Lederman explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Sometime in early July I was ... told by the owner of ORI that ... they had a relationship with a[ ] woman in Texas [i.e., Mrs. Lozovyy], and this woman had\n   purchased some product from them ... with the intention of selling it, and hadn't been successful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Lederman Dep. 41:8-19). He further stated that, \"[a]ccording to ORI, [LuxSoma] had no arrangement [to be ORI's exclusive dealer].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45:16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In an email dated August 1, 2015, Lederman wrote that he first learned of LuxSoma on July 6, 2012. (Dkt. # 101-30 at 50). That day, Giovana Mira gave Lederman LuxSoma's contact information, on the theory \"that maybe it would be a good idea ... t[o] explore the possibility of reaching out and trying to collaborate with this woman with the idea that maybe [she could] help the effort. So, that's what I did.\" (Lederman Dep. 41:8-19). On July 13, 2012, Mrs. Lozovyy met with Lederman to discuss the possibility of collaborating to sell ORI merchandise. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 144). Though Mrs. Lozovyy would later note that it \"was a pleasure and relief to meet [Lederman]\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), the companies ultimately were unable to agree on terms for collaboration. There is no evidence that Mrs. Lozovyy told Lederman that LuxSoma was ORI's exclusive distributor or that she believed that the Leg Defendants were inducing a breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   LuxSoma filed this action on June 29, 2015. (Dkt. # 2). It filed an Amended Complaint on August 13, 2015, adding ORI as a defendant, (Dkt. # 16), and a Second Amended Complaint on October 22, 2015, withdrawing a civil RICO claim (Dkt. # 27). According to the docket in this case, ORI has yet to be served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On April 7, 2017, the Leg Defendants moved for summary judgment (Dkt. # 100); they also moved to preclude LuxSoma's expert testimony (Dkt. # 105). On May 18, 2017, LuxSoma filed a six-page brief in opposition to the motion for summary judgment (Dkt. # 122), and a two-page brief in opposition to the motion to preclude expert testimony (Dkt. # 124). On June 5, 2017, the Leg Defendants filed their reply briefs. (Dkt. # 127, 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In particular, the meeting in March or April of 2012 between Leg and ORI representatives, during which they discussed their terms of engagement (including Leg's exclusive distribution rights), took place in New York.

Mrs. Lozovyy professed a vague recollection that Costantini once said: \"he's not sure, but he believes [that] as early as February [2012] Leg Resource knew about our relationship.\" (V. Lozovyy Dep. 208:23-25). When pressed, however, she admitted that Costantini \"didn't give me any details\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 209:5), and that she had no other reason to believe that Leg knew of LuxSoma's relationship with ORI (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 209:19-24). Costantini, for his part, has never stated that the Leg Defendants had any knowledge of ORI's dealings with LuxSoma before July 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On the other hand, there is compelling evidence that the Leg Defendants did not learn of LuxSoma's existence-much less about its purported contract with ORI-before July 2012. Lederman testified that nobody at Leg was made aware of LuxSoma's existence until early July 2012. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 107, 108, 133). None of the prospective buyers at the department stores and online retailers informed the Leg Defendants that LuxSoma had previously tried to sell them ORI merchandise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In an email dated August 1, 2015, Lederman stated that he first learned of Mrs. Lozovyy on or about July 6, 2012 (Dkt. # 101-30 at 50), when Giovana Mira, ORI's co-owner, mentioned that ORI had previously worked with LuxSoma (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 134).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Bereft of evidence, LuxSoma resorts to rumination, observing that \"it is hard to believe that [Lederman] did not ask ... whether ORI's products had ever been sold before in the U.S.\" (Pl. Opp. 2). Yet LuxSoma fails to provide any legal or evidentiary basis for this statement. Instead, it asks this Court merely to presume that the Leg Defendants had knowledge of LuxSoma's dealings with ORI. That, this Court cannot-and will not-do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   LuxSoma's next assertion-that Leg must have been aware of LuxSoma because of the latter's \"sophisticated web site\"-fares no better. (Pl. Opp. 2). LuxSoma appears to argue that, because they were competitors, Leg must have known of LuxSoma. But that is belied by LuxSoma's own admission that it had not heard of Leg until the summer of 2012. (V. Lozovyy Dep. 157:22-158:7). If LuxSoma had no\n   knowledge of Leg, it is reasonable-and, indeed, likely, given that Leg was the larger, more established company-that Leg had never heard of LuxSoma. That is particularly true given that, by June 2012, LuxSoma had only sold ORI merchandise in small quantities at kiosks in Dallas, Texas. On the record before it, the Court finds that no reasonable juror could conclude that Leg or Lederman was aware of any dealings between LuxSoma and ORI before July 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Without such knowledge, LuxSoma's first claim-that the Leg Defendants induced a breach of contract-fails as a matter of law. Law and logic dictate that a party with no knowledge of a contract cannot be held liable for inducing its breach.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Kronos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4429418\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/81/90/#p94\">\n    81 N.Y.2d at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20N.Y.S.2d%20931\">\n    595 N.Y.S.2d 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=612%20N.E.2d%20289\">\n    612 N.E.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is only \"when there is knowledge of a contract, and a competitor takes an active part in persuading a party to the contract to breach it by offering better terms or other incentives [that] there is an unjustifiable interference with the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    White Plains Coat &amp; Apron Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cintas Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674519\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/460/281/#p285\">\n    460 F.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). No reasonable juror could find that Defendants knew of any contract or of any business dealings between LuxSoma and ORI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court pauses to note that another of Defendants' arguments-that, as of June 2012, there was no contract between LuxSoma and ORI-has considerable traction. The record strongly suggests that, by the spring of 2012, LuxSoma had failed to sell enough legwear to maintain its relationship with ORI, much less acquire an exclusive distributorship. Costantini testified that, to the extent there was an exclusive arrangement between ORI and LuxSoma, it was conditioned on LuxSoma's purchases of ORI merchandise. When asked what would happen if LuxSoma did not purchase sufficient product, Costantini stated that ORI would, in all likelihood, \"end the relationship.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 55). He further testified that if LuxSoma failed to pay in full for an order of Spring/Summer 2012 merchandise, \"the relationship was going to be ended, closed.\" (Costantini Dep. 71:12-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   LuxSoma never did pay in full for any such order. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 69). Accordingly, by February 25, 2012, \"the relationship with [LuxSoma] had already deteriorated\" and \"[t]he ORI company was upset with [LuxSoma]\" because \"there were no sales ... [and] no invoices.\" (Costantini Dep. 68:2-9). As Costantini further explained, \"The point was to have patience to get the results, but there was not this kind of patience and there were no sales.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74:9-12). Nothing in the record suggests that, as of June 2012, LuxSoma continued to be (if it had ever been) ORI's exclusive distributor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   LuxSoma's reaction to the news of ORI's partnership with Leg in June 2012 further supports the view that LuxSoma was not ORI's exclusive distributor. Upon learning that Leg was holding itself out as ORI's exclusive distributor, LuxSoma did not notify Leg or any potential customers that, in fact, LuxSoma was ORI's exclusive distributor. (V. Lozovyy Dep. 139:3-8). Instead, it called ORI and spoke with Costantini, who confirmed that Leg was now selling ORI products. As Mrs. Lozovyy recalled, \"he said yes, there is somebody else, but it's nothing\" and encouraged her to \"continue your itinerary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 139:9-140:25). LuxSoma never asked ORI to stop selling merchandise to Leg, or for Leg not to announce its partnership with ORI. Such passivity belies LuxSoma's claim that it had exclusive rights to sell ORI merchandise. Yet even if LuxSoma had an exclusive distributorship with ORI-a claim that this Court regards with deep skepticism-LuxSoma's inducement claim\n   still fails because, as mentioned above, no reasonable juror could find that Defendants had knowledge of any such contract. Summary judgment is therefore appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

As to the first period, LuxSoma's claim fails because, as this Court already found, no reasonable juror could find that the Leg Defendants knew of any dealings between LuxSoma and ORI. The Second Circuit has explained that a tortious interference claim can only succeed if the plaintiff proves,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"defendant knew of th[e] relationship and intentionally interfered with it.\"\n   <em>\n    Noonan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050027\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/350/6/#p17\">\n    350 F.3d at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Nor can they be held liable for interfering with LuxSoma's relationship with ORI, whatever it was, after July 2012. By July 2012, the Leg Defendants had signed an Exclusive Distributorship Agreement with ORI. To the extent they thereafter sought to prevent LuxSoma from purchasing merchandise directly from ORI, the Leg Defendants were merely acting to enforce their contractual rights. It is well established that \"economic interest is a defense to an action for tortious interference with a contract unless there is a showing of malice or illegality.\"\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Churchill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8595749\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/744/#p750\">\n    87 N.Y.2d 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 750,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8595749\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/744/#p750\">\n    642 N.Y.S.2d 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8595749\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/87/744/#p750\">\n    665 N.E.2d 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Leg Defendants did not act maliciously or illegally. In fact, they negotiated in good faith with LuxSoma to see if the two companies might collaborate to promote ORI's brand, or in the alternative, if Leg could help LuxSoma sell its remaining ORI inventory. Far from engaging in malicious or illegal behavior, the Leg Defendants proved themselves to be reasonable economic actors that sought to prevent another from infringing on their exclusive distributorship. For this reason, LuxSoma's tortious interference claim against them fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

(SAC \u00b6 30). LuxSoma further alleges that the Leg Defendants repeated those misstatements in an advertisement placed in the July 23, 2012 edition of\n   <em>\n    Women's Wear Daily\n   </em>\n   , which stated that ORI was \"gearing up for a journey to North America\" and that Leg was ORI's exclusive distributor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). LuxSoma claims that these statements were actionably false because LuxSoma was ORI's exclusive distributor and had previously sold ORI merchandise at kiosks in Dallas, Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court disagrees. To begin with, the Leg Defendants' statement that they were introducing ORI to the United States was not misleading because it could not have deceived a substantial portion of its intended audience. When the statement was made, LuxSoma's sales were minimal and geographically confined to Dallas, Texas. As ORI stated, \"the U.S. market was still open\" \"because [LuxSoma's] sales were so small,\" and \"[t]he sales in the U.S. were so small there was no[t] really a presence of the product.\" (Costantini Dep. 90:2-17). Even in LuxSoma's telling of events, it had sold a paltry 500 to 1,000 pairs of ORI legwear in Dallas, Texas. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 42). Those sales are far too small and much too geographically concentrated to raise a triable dispute that Defendants' statement could have misled \"a substantial portion of the intended audience.\"\n   <em>\n    Merck Eprova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324990\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/920/404/#p416\">\n    920 F.Supp.2d at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Leg's second statement-that it was ORI's exclusive distributor-was objectively true. As the record makes abundantly clear, Leg signed an Exclusive Distributorship Agreement with ORI in late June 2012. Therefore, by the time the alleged misstatements were made on July 10 and July 23, 2012, Leg had in fact become ORI's exclusive distributor. The statement is accurate on its face, and no reasonable juror could find otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   LuxSoma's unfair competition claim fails for the same reasons. Under New York law, the elements of unfair competition \"closely parallel the elements of\n   unfair competition under the Lanham Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Medisim Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    BestMed LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290201\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/910/591/#p606\">\n    910 F.Supp.2d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). A claim sounding in unfair competition \"is identical to a Lanham Act claim, save for the additional requirement that plaintiff show defendant's bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Heptagon Creations, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Core Group Marketing LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 11 Civ. 1794 (LTS) (AJP),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206600267\">\n    2011 WL 6600267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2011). Because this Court has already found that LuxSoma's Lanham Act claim fails as a matter of law, and because LuxSoma has not provided any evidence of bad faith, LuxSoma's unfair competition claim cannot succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the reasons mentioned above, the motion for summary judgment of Defendants Leg Resource, Inc. and Wayne Lederman is GRANTED.

(Costantini Dep. 36:20-37:5). But Costantini also made clear that LuxSoma would have had to prove itself before ORI would deal with it exclusively. He explained that \"it is typical Italian not to give contracts from the beginning, but it's like a test, test-something, for the distribution.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 99:12-16). He further averred that ORI would have ended the relationship if LuxSoma failed to purchase a sufficient quantity of merchandise. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 46:5-16).\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n    According to Costantini, by February 2012, the relationship between ORI and LuxSoma had deteriorated because there were no sales. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 72, 73). The Court notes that a late-produced email from LuxSoma, the provenance and authenticity of which Defendants reasonably contest, suggests that on January 27, 2012, Costantini may have written to LuxSoma stating that it would be ORI's sole distributor. (Dkt. # 56-1). Even if the Court presumes the email to be authentic, Costantini's testimony, viewed in its totality, suggests that as of February 25, 2012, ORI's relationship with LuxSoma had deteriorated, and any exclusive right that LuxSoma might previously have enjoyed had been severely jeopardized.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
