Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, ECF No. 20. After a foreclosure action was initiated against Proctor in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, Case No. CAEF15-00209 (the \"Foreclosure Action\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31, resulting in the sale of the Property and a state court Order of Judgment awarding possession of the Property to Defendant Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\"), Proctor filed suit in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1. In addition to Fannie Mae, Defendants include Wells Fargo,\n   N.A. (\"Wells Fargo,\" and together with Fannie Mae, the \"Lenders\"); the \"Substitute Trustees\" who initiated the Foreclosure Action (Howard N. Bierman, Joshua Coleman, Nicholas Derdock, Jacob Geesing, Richard R. Goldsmith, Jr., Elizabeth C. Jones, Jason Kutcher, Pratima Lele, Ludeen McCarthy-Green, and Carrie M. Ward); and Prince George's County Sheriff Melvin High. Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently pending are Sheriff High's Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 26, which the parties fully briefed, ECF Nos. 26-1, 28, 29; the Lenders' Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 31, which the parties fully briefed, ECF Nos. 31-1, 39, 43; and the Substitute Trustees' Motion to Dismiss (adopting the Lenders' arguments), ECF No. 40, which the parties fully briefed, ECF Nos. 46, 47. A hearing is not necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Loc. R. 105.6. Because\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   bars Proctor's claims against the Lenders and the Substitute Trustees, I will dismiss the claims against them without reaching the alternative grounds Defendants raise for dismissal. Proctor also fails to state a claim against Sheriff High in his official or individual capacity.

(\"Wachovia\"). Thereafter (presumably because Proctor fell behind on her mortgage payments, although none of the parties state the reason for the Foreclosure Action or whether Proctor was current on her mortgage payments), Wells Fargo-\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   Wachovia-appointed the Substitute Trustees pursuant to the Deed of Trust to initiate foreclosure proceedings. Am. Compl. \u00b6 26. Proctor claims that Wells Fargo was not the proper holder of the Deed of Trust and therefore lacked the authority to foreclose on her Property through the Substitute Trustees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Yet, Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia in 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wachovia's Institution History, Nat'l Info.
