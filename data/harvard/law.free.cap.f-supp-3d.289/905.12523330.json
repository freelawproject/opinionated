The parties stipulated to the dismissal of certain of those claims during the course of summary judgment briefing, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 85\n   </em>\n   ], and the Court erroneously considered those arguments, but should not have ruled on them.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Hon. Jane Magnus-Stinson, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is the latest in a series of challenges to various statutory provisions that were enacted as part of House Enrolled Act 1337. This Act codified a number of abortion-related provisions, some civil and some criminal. In this action, Plaintiffs the Trustees of Indiana University, Fred Cate, Dr. Bruce Lamb, and Dr. Debomoy Lahiri (collectively \"\n   <em>\n    IU\n   </em>\n   \") challenge a provision that criminalizes the acquisition, receipt, sale, and transfer of aborted fetal tissue. IU moves for summary judgment, arguing that the provision violates the United States Constitution, based on five different constitutional challenges. Defendants, the prosecutors of Marion and Monroe counties, cross-move for summary judgment, contending that the statute does not offend the Constitution. Also pending before the Court is Defendants' Motion for Oral Argument regarding the cross-motions for summary judgment. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 80\n   </em>\n   .] For the reasons described below, the Court concludes that the provision violates the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. It therefore grants in part IU's Motion for Summary Judgment. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77\n   </em>\n   .] Having concluded that the Court can resolve the summary judgment motions based on the parties' briefing, the Court denies Defendants' Motion for Oral Argument.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-2 at 2\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Debomoy Lahiri is a tenured professor in the IU School of Medicine's Department of Psychiatry, a member of the Stark Institute, and an executive committee member of the Center. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 1\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 25\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-1 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] Dr. Lahiri conducts research on brain disorders, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] He is the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Current Alzheimer's Research, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 3\n   </em>\n   ], and he has authored or contributed to over 300 publications, [\n   <em>\n    Filing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    No. 77-5 at 2\n   </em>\n   ]. Dr. Lahiri began using fetal tissue in his research on or about July 14, 2011. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 6\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 2-3\n   </em>\n   .] He uses fetal tissue because it contains all of the components of the fetal brain, such as neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and blood vessels, and because healthy fetal brain tissue serves as a \"control\" to understand how a diseased brain differs from a healthy one. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 17\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 11\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 8\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   IU obtains fetal tissue for Dr. Lahiri's research from the Birth Defects Research Lab (\"\n   <em>\n    BDRL\n   </em>\n   \") at the University of Washington, and it has received approximately 25 shipments of fetal tissue from BDRL. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 4\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 14\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 4\n   </em>\n   .] IU pays BDRL $200 per shipment to cover the shipping and handling costs associated with obtaining the tissue; there are no additional costs. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 15\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 79-2 at 17\n   </em>\n   .] BDRL does not provide intact organs-instead, it sends tissue from organs, such as brains, livers, and kidneys. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 3\n   </em>\n   .] The amount of tissue per shipment that IU receives is small enough to be contained within roughly two teaspoons of liquid media. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 15\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After receiving a shipment of tissue from BDRL, Dr. Lahiri cuts the tissue into very small pieces. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 5\n   </em>\n   .] To that tissue, he adds an enzyme that dissociates, or breaks apart, the tissue's cells. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 5\n   </em>\n   .] He then places that mixture into a centrifuge, in order to separate the cells from \"debris.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 5-6\n   </em>\n   .] Debris includes cells that did not successfully dissociate, as well materials such as cell membranes and tissue walls. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 5-6\n   </em>\n   .] The debris is discarded, and the remaining cells are classified and their viability determined. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] The viable cells of the desired types are plated in dishes containing different types of media, where they grow and divide for days or weeks. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] Dr. Lahiri then performs his research using those cells. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-6 at 7\n   </em>\n   .] Dr. Lahiri stores the molecules derived from his cultures in a freezer for reuse. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-5 at 18\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Researchers at IU also perform research using \"cell lines\" that have been derived from fetal tissue. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-2 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] When cells are plated, they may continue to grow and divide over a period of time. Cells multiply by division, and when a cell divides, it gives rise to two \"daughter\" cells. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 7\n   </em>\n   .] Those cells continue to grow and divide in the plates in which they have been placed, until they become \"confluent,\" or evenly coat the surface of the dish such that no more cells can grow. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] At that point, the cells are transferred to a bigger dish or multiple dishes (or half of the cells are discarded) in order to create more room for the cells to continue to divide. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] This transfer process is referred to as a \"passage,\" and researchers track the number of passages that a group of cells has undergone. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 6\n   </em>\n   .] In each passage, some cells will fail to divide, and will proceed intact to the next passage. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 22\n   </em>\n   .] Cell lines within the early series of passages are commonly referred to as \"primary cell lines.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 6\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Some cells continue to divide after multiple passages, and if they are continuously cultivated, those cells eventually become known as \"established\" or \"immortalized\" cell lines, which can \"be passaged more or less indefinitely.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 5-6\n   </em>\n   .] Established cell lines can be purchased from commercial sources or acquired from not-for-profit cell line banks, and they are used for a variety of purposes and passed from lab to lab. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 5\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-7 at 4\n   </em>\n   .] A cell line known as\n   HEK 293 is an example of such a commercially available, established cell line, and is used by researchers at IU. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 5\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-1 at 15\n   </em>\n   .] HEK 293 originated in 1972, and the owner of that cell line represents that it was derived from an aborted fetus. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-1 at 5-6\n   </em>\n   .] It is used for a variety of research purposes, and is one of the most widely used cell lines in the world. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-1 at 6\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-1 at 15\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Researchers at IU also extract, use, and store components of cells-known as biologics or biologicals-such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-3 at 8-9\n   </em>\n   .] Many of those materials are stored indefinitely in freezers on IU's campuses.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). Affidavits or declarations must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on matters stated. Fed. R. Civ.

But the interpretation of a statute is a question of law that is appropriately in front of the Court to decide.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Defendants contend that the \"undisputed evidence is that the smallest distinguishable part of a fetus is a cell,\" presumably implying, though not explicitly stating, that the statutory term \"any other part\" applies only to materials that are cells, or of a size larger than cells. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 18\n   </em>\n   .] IU, however, has asserted with evidentiary support that the term \"part of\" does not have a discernable meaning from a scientific perspective, and that a person of ordinary intelligence could not determine what materials are considered \"any other part\" of a fetus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Among other relevant points that are discussed further below, IU submitted the following testimony, for example, given by Dr. Larry Goldstein:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Q\n   </strong>\n   : So 'part of' you find vague?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   : Yeah, I mean, I think that's a difficult-again, it's not a scientific term that has any meaning...\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77-8 at 29-30\n   </em>\n   .] And it submitted the following testimony given by Dr. Lamb:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Q\n   </strong>\n   : And the discussion that the statute is prompting all of us to have with these words 'part of' in it, is that a designation that science uses?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n   : No. 'Part of' is not a very precise scientific term. ...It's certainly not a scientific designation.

The subsection in which this term appears reads as follows: \"[a]s used in this section, 'fetal tissue' includes tissue, organs, or any other part of an aborted fetus.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-46-5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5(b). The statute itself does not define the term \"any other part.\" The Court begins, then, by assessing the plain text of the statute, as suggested by Defendants. In defining the term fetal tissue, the statute lists a series\n   of covered materials: tissue, organs, and \"any other part.\" The statute's listing of tissue and organs indicates that materials beyond an intact fetus are covered by the statute-if they weren't, specifically listing tissue and organs would be unnecessary. Therefore, the statute applies to tissues and organs, whether or not they are situated within an intact fetus. The same, then, is true of the catch-all final item in the series-the \"any other part\" term. This means that \"any other part\" must include (1) materials that are not either tissues or organs, and that (2) may exist outside of an intact fetus. This is the entirety of plain-text meaning the Court can discern from the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   IU argues that this definition is not sufficient to put individuals on notice as to what behavior is prohibited. It points to a variety of materials that it uses in its research activities as examples of the types of materials that the statutory language could encompass, but does not define, such as: placentas, umbilical cords, cells, cell lines, and biologicals derived from cells, including RNA, DNA, and proteins. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 42\n   </em>\n   .] IU also argues that Defendants' own representations regarding what materials are encompassed by the term \"any other part\" illustrate the problematic vagueness of the statutory provision. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 47-50\n   </em>\n   .] IU argues that Defendants' representations are both facially vague and inconsistent with one another. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 47-50\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For example, in their Statement of Defenses, Defendants made the following representations about the \"conduct engaged in by Plaintiffs which is not prohibited by the Statute\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   1. The Language \"any other part of an aborted fetus\" in Section 1.5(b) of the Statute does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (a) placental or umbilical cord blood tissue or cells, or biological material obtained from such blood, tissue or cells;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (b) fetal cell lines including but not limited to HEK293 (or biological material obtained from such cell lines) derived from the cells of an aborted fetus, but which do not contain cells which were originally part of an aborted fetus;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (c) fetal cells (or biological material obtained from such cells) which were derived from aborted fetal cells, but are not cells which were originally part of an aborted fetus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 75 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] As to that representation's clarity, as IU points out, this proposed definition of \"any other part\" twice includes the term \"part of.\" This definition is circular, at best, and does little to clarify the types of materials that are encompassed within the term's reach. Defendants respond that this does not constitute an attempt at defining the statutory term, but instead \"[t]hat statement was merely an attempt to narrow the issues\n   <em>\n    in this case\n   </em>\n   by addressing Plaintiffs' conduct that is not at issue in this lawsuit.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 45\n   </em>\n   .] However, this statement unequivocally indicates that certain conduct is \"not prohibited by the Statute,\" and that \"[t]he language 'any other part of an aborted fetus' in Section 1.5(b) of the Statute does not apply to\" certain materials. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 75 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] It is difficult to read Defendants' statement as anything other than a general statement of the law. At a minimum, it identifies what Defendants consider to be a likely or plausible reading of the statutory term.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   And in their briefing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, Defendants suggest several different definitions of the term \"any other part.\" At one point, they argue that \"[o]nce the cells separate from the fetal tissue, grow, divide into new cells, and are moved from the 'first dish' to the 'second dish,' they can no longer be considered 'part' of the aborted fetus because, as a practical matter, it is impossible to prove that the subculture contains 'part' of a fetus.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 48\n   </em>\n   .] In other words, cell cultures that have undergone their first passage, and/or primary cell lines, cannot be considered \"part of\" a fetus. Immediately after proffering this definition, however, Defendants suggest that after cells are dissociated-a step even before the first passage in the cell culture process-the material may be sufficiently \"different\" from fetal tissue to avoid falling within the scope of the term \"any other part.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 48\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With those two definitions, Defendants attempt to draw a line somewhere within the cell culturing process: before a certain point, materials are encompassed within the term \"any other part,\" and after that point, they are not. Defendants' arguments illustrate the vagueness of the statute in two ways. First, none of Defendants' proposed definitions (including that materials larger than a cell are not covered) are evident from the text of the statute, or from any other legislative source identified by Defendants. It seems unlikely that a person of ordinary intelligence could divine the line being drawn by Defendants as to what is included within the term, particularly when it involves some knowledge of the particulars of the scientific methods used in cell culturing. Second, that line is a moving target within Defendants' own representations. Given that Defendants have not been able to furnish a consistent definition of the term, it is hardly plausible that a person of ordinary intelligence would be able to discern what conduct is prohibited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The question before this Court is what conduct the statute criminalizes. As both the plain text and Defendants' shifting statutory descriptions illustrate, the statute itself simply does not define with sufficient clarity what materials fall within the definition of the term \"any other part.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Acquires, Receives, or Transfers\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Subsection (d) of the statute specifies that \"[a] person who intentionally acquires, receives, sells, or transfers fetal tissue commits unlawful transfer of fetal tissue, a Level 5 felony.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind.

IU argues that the term \"transfer\" is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to provide adequate notice as to what activity is prohibited. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 42\n   </em>\n   .] IU points to a variety of its typical research practices that it argues may or may not be included within the term \"transfer,\" such as collaborations with other researchers, both internally and externally to IU, providing samples to the NIH when required under the terms of an applicable grant, and moving materials among different facilities. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 47\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants respond that the term \"transfer\" is not vague, because its meaning is readily ascertainable. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 25-26\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants argue that the terms \"acquire,\" \"sell,\" and \"receive\"-which precede \"transfer\" within the statute-all \"involve transfer of possession or ownership.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 26\n   </em>\n   .] Therefore, Defendants contend, the statutory meaning of \"transfer\" is a \"change of possession or ownership.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 47\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court need not delve into the question of whether the term \"transfer\" clearly means a \"change of possession or ownership,\" as argued by Defendants. Even if it does, that definition would do little to clarify what activities are prohibited by the statute, given a plain-meaning reading of the term \"possession\".\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Oxford English Dictionary, available at www.oed.com, (possession is \"the action or fact of holding something (material or immaterial) as one's own or in one's control\"); Merriam-Webster, available at www.merriam-webster.com, (possession is \"the act of having or taking control\"); Black's Law Dictionary 1006 (9th ed. 2009) (possession is \"[t]he fact of having or holding property in one's power; the exercise of dominion over property\"). For example, does it constitute a change of possession for one IU employee to place a vial of fetal tissue into the hands or onto the work station of another employee? By a commonsense reading of the word \"possession,\" it would appear so: possession would pass from the first individual to the second, even if IU \"owned\" the fetal tissue throughout that transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Yet, in their Statement of Defenses, Defendants stated that the following conduct \"is not prohibited by the Statute\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   2. The word \"transfer\" in Section 1.5(b) of the Statute does not apply to physical movement of cells or biological materials received, generated or stored at Indiana University before the enactment of the Statute provided that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (a) the physical movement is within or among laboratories, buildings or physical facilities of Indiana University by any faculty member, employee, representative or agent of Indiana University;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (b) the physical movement is the result of a faculty member, employee, representative or agent of Indiana University permanently removing such materials from Indiana University's buildings or physical facilities; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (c) the physical movement is at the request of the National Institute of Health (\"NIH\") or pursuant to the terms or conditions of any NIH grant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 75 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] And in their briefing here, Defendants state in a footnote that \"[m]ovement of IU's fetal tissue by IU's employees and agents does not result in a change in ownership or possession of fetal tissue.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 16\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants' proposed readings of the statute are not clear from the text itself, and they require that the Court overlook a commonsense use of the term \"possession\"-a word that Defendants themselves graft onto the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As a final illustration of the statute's lack of precision, the Court notes another statutory provision that was amended in the same enactment, as part of HEA 1337, also relating to the treatment of aborted fetal tissue. Chapter 3 of Indiana Code Section 16-34 is entitled \"Treatment of Aborted Remains.\" A subsection of that Chapter,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016-34-3-2\">\n    Ind.

No other constraints are placed upon the woman's disposition of that fetal tissue after she receives it, raising obvious questions as to how the instant statute's prohibitions would apply to the handling of that tissue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the Court notes another way in which an individual may lawfully come to \"possess\" aborted fetal tissue-as the result of a medical abortion, in which an abortion-inducing drug is legally dispensed to a patient, and the abortion occurs outside of a health care facility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016-34-2-1\">\n    Ind.

By Defendants' own statutory reading, an individual disposing of that tissue would \"transfer\" it, in that the transferor would relinquish her possession of the tissue. In other words, by Defendants' own proposed readings, the statute appears to potentially criminalize behavior which is explicitly permitted by another statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court concludes that a person of ordinary intelligence could not determine what constitutes a \"transfer\" of fetal tissue. Reading this statute in conjunction with other relevant provisions compounds the statute's vagueness, and Defendants' representations as to the statutory meaning do the same. For the same reasons, the Court must also conclude that the statutory terms \"acquire\" and \"receive\" are equally vague. Those terms are likewise not defined by the statute, and encompass the same sprawling universe of conduct as \"transfer.\" Therefore, the Court concludes that the terms \"transfer,\" \"acquire,\" and \"receive\" as used in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind.

Risk of Arbitrary and Discriminatory Enforcement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   A statute found deficient on the basis of one aspect in the void-for-vagueness analysis violates the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The Court, however, proceeds to analyze the statute with regard to the second aspect as well: whether the statute encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. IU argues that the same provisions are void for vagueness because the statute \"subjects them to the shifting whims of elected prosecutors who may interpret the Statute one way yesterday and then abandon that construction today.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 45\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants respond that the statute's scienter requirement assures that the statute will not be subject to arbitrary enforcement. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 18\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As the Court discussed above, the statute's failure to define key terms, such as \"any other part,\" requires an enforcer-such as a prosecutor-to develop his own definition. The definitions proposed by Defendants here illustrate to the Court that the statute allows for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Defendants, for example, propose that, as applied to IU, the term \"any other part\" excludes (1) fetal cell lines derived from the cells of an aborted fetus, but which \"do not contain cells which were originally part of an aborted fetus\"; and (2) fetal cells or biological material obtained from such cells, but that are not cells which were \"originally part of an aborted fetus.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 75 at 2\n   </em>\n   .] These definitions are circular, as they include the very term \"part of\" that they propose to define, leaving Defendants able to define the prohibited conduct in differing manners as applied to different individuals. Moreover, by Defendants' own representations here, these definitions were developed based upon, and are limited only by, Defendants' own disputed \"scientific\n   evidence.\" [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 17-18\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Defendants argue, however, that because the statute criminalizes only the intentional acquisition, receipt, transfer, or sale of fetal tissue, it does not encourage arbitrary enforcement. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 25\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants contend that (1) \"as a practical matter, proving beyond a reasonable doubt that nucleic acids or molecules were part of an aborted fetus and are intentionally being transferred would be a herculean feat,\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 18\n   </em>\n   ]; and (2) \"a person who is intentionally acquiring, receiving, or selling something that the person\n   <em>\n    does not know is fetal tissue\n   </em>\n   does not violate the statute,\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 25\n   </em>\n   ]. Regarding Defendants' first argument, the fact that an element of the statute might be \"difficult to prove\" does not lessen the risk of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. The void-for-vagueness inquiry focuses not on the likelihood of\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   , but whether an individual can discern what conduct is prohibited, and tailor his conduct so as to stay within the confines of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Second, the statute's\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement does little to lessen the risk of arbitrary enforcement. While Defendants assume that the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement applies both to the activities involved and whether the material at issue constitutes fetal tissue, the statute is not clear. It states that \"[a] person who intentionally acquires, receives, sells, or transfers fetal tissue commits unlawful transfer of fetal tissue, a Level 5 felony.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-46-5-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .5(d). The word \"intentionally\" precedes the verbs, and the statute does not state that the verbs apply only to a substance that an individual\n   <em>\n    knows\n   </em>\n   to be fetal tissue. Moreover, the statute attempts to define \"fetal tissue,\" and Defendants argue that the term indeed has an enforceable definition. Therefore, by Defendants' own contentions, an individual's\n   <em>\n    belief\n   </em>\n   about the substance he is transferring-his subjective assessment of whether it constitutes fetal tissue or not-is irrelevant. In other words, a substance either is or is not fetal tissue. The same is true of the term transfer, which Defendants argue has a clear statutory meaning. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 26\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Following Defendants' arguments to their logical conclusion illustrates why the statute's\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement does not render it sufficiently definite. Defendants themselves point out that BDRL cannot confirm with certainty that the shipments of fetal tissue that IU has received were taken from fetuses that were aborted, as opposed to miscarried. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 15-16\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants argue that \"awareness of a high probability that the thing being obtained or conveyed is part of an aborted fetus is not sufficient\" to satisfy the statutory requirement of acting \"intentionally.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 18\n   </em>\n   .] Therefore, by their own argument, Defendants should agree that\n   <em>\n    none\n   </em>\n   of IU's conduct falls within the purview of the statute-IU cannot be said to \"intentionally\" acquire fetal tissue, even from BDRL. Defendants maintain, however, that IU's receipt/acquisition of shipments of tissue from BDRL violate the statute. [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 46\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants' own strained and confusing argument demonstrates the problematic enforcement potential of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Court concludes that the statute as written allows for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, and therefore fails the second aspect of the void-for-vagueness inquiry, in addition the failing the first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    4. Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In their Reply briefing, Defendants for the first time raise the argument that IU lacks standing to challenge certain portions of the statute, because the issues raised are not ripe for the Court's review. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 16\n   </em>\n   .] Specifically, Defendants\n   appear to argue that two issues are unripe: (1) \"whether the statute prohibits the mere physical movement of aborted fetal tissue from place to place without a change in possession or ownership,\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 16\n   </em>\n   ]; and (2) whether the term \"any other part...could be defined to include infinitesimally small subdivisions of matter that was included in a fetus,\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 17\n   </em>\n   ]. In both instances, Defendants argue that IU has not been threatened with prosecution on those particular bases, so IU lacks standing to bring a challenge.

Defendants have cited no authority to support the assertion that once a plaintiff has demonstrated standing to challenge a statute, it may only challenge that statute under certain theories of liability or possible enforcement strategies. The Court concludes that IU has demonstrated that the issue of the statute's vagueness is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-46-5-1\">\n    Ind.

The grant of authority to Congress to regulate commerce among the states, and the related limitation on the states' authority to impede that regulation or to stem the flow of interstate activity, are in some sense two sides of the same coin. They are, at a minimum, intertwined in both provenance and scope. As the Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   During the first years of our history as an independent confederation, the National Government lacked the power to regulate commerce among the States. Because each State was free to adopt measures fostering its own local interests without regard to possible prejudice to nonresidents, what Justice Johnson characterized as a conflict of commercial regulations, destructive to the harmony of the States, ensued. In his view, this was the immediate cause that led to the forming of a constitutional convention. If there was any one object riding over every other in the adoption of the constitution, it was to keep the commercial intercourse among the States free from all invidious and partial restraints.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   We have subsequently endorsed Justice Johnson's appraisal of the central importance of federal control over interstate and foreign commerce and, more narrowly, his conclusion that the Commerce Clause had not only granted Congress express authority to override restrictive and conflicting commercial regulations adopted by the States, but that it also had immediately effected a curtailment of state power. In short, the Commerce Clause even without implementing legislation by Congress is a limitation upon the power of the States. Our decisions on this point reflect, upon fullest consideration, the course of adjudication unbroken through the Nation's history.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v.

IU argues that the activities at issue here fall within the categories of activities identified by the Supreme Court, for a multitude of reasons, and therefore constitute interstate commerce.

The Court concluded that the conduct addressed by the CSRA fell within the second category of permissible regulations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \"[i]t regulates the nonpayment of interstate child support obligations.

There is no \"market\" for child support payments, in the sense defined by Defendants-a place \"where supply and demand affect the price of a commodity or a place where things are bought and sold.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 25\n   </em>\n   .] Child support payments are not fungible commodities, given in exchange for valuable consideration. The payment or nonpayment of child support is also not trade, in the narrow sense proposed by Defendants. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the transfer of funds in that context constituted a \"thing\" in interstate commerce. The Court concludes the same here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rutherford v. Am. Med. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2069336\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/379/641/#p644\">\n    379 F.2d 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644 (7th Cir. 1967) (\"...regulation under the Commerce Clause is not limited to articles or activities for which there is a transfer for value.\") (citations omitted). As IU highlights, the activity at issue here involves exchanges by hospitals, laboratories, researchers, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and others through interstate channels. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 23\n   </em>\n   .] The individuals and entities involved in these exchanges are engaged in interstate commerce generally, and in IU's case, the fetal tissue is used in research funded by multi-million dollar grants. The Seventh Circuit's and Supreme Court's prior conclusions regarding interstate commerce convince this Court that this is the type of activity encompassed within the Commerce Clause's reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Finally, in support of their argument that the transfer of fetal tissue does not constitute \"commerce,\" Defendants point to a federal statute regarding the use of fetal tissue. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 23\n   </em>\n   .] That statute mandates that \"[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 289g-2(a). Defendants interpret this statute as a statement by Congress that the exchange of fetal tissue without consideration does not constitute commerce, and therefore that it is outside of Congress' power to regulate. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 90 at 23\n   </em>\n   .] The Court does not so read the statute. In fact, the Court reads that statute to illustrate the opposite: it appears that Congress assumed that fetal tissue could be an article of commerce. The statute therefore specifies that\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the transfer affects interstate commerce,\n   <em>\n    then\n   </em>\n   a person may not receive valuable consideration for it. The fetal tissue shipments from BDRL to IU are consistent with this statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that, at least with regard to the fetal tissue shipments received by IU from BDRL, those transactions constitute interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    2. Level of Scrutiny\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   IU first argues that the challenged law constitutes a \"direct regulation\" on interstate commerce that is\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 24\n   </em>\n   .] In making this argument, IU hearkens back to an earlier era of dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence. As described by the Seventh Circuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   For many years, dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence drew a distinction between States' direct and indirect regulation of interstate commerce. Direct interference with interstate commerce was invalid as a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause, but legislation having indirect effects remained permissible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Di Santo v.

The Supreme Court then began to rely more on a balancing test that weighs the regulating state's interests against the burdens on interstate commerce (at least when the state does not actually discriminate against interstate commerce).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Southern Pacific Co. v.

The Seventh Circuit has repeatedly concluded that state and local laws, for the purposes of a dormant Commerce Clause analysis, may be put into one of three categories: (1) \"laws that explicitly discriminate against interstate commerce,\" which are treated as \"all but\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional\"; (2) \"laws that appear to be neutral among states but that bear more heavily on interstate commerce than on local commerce\"; and (3) \"laws that affect commerce without any reallocation among jurisdictions-that do not give local firms any competitive advantage over those located elsewhere.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Paint\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415333\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/1124/#p1131\">\n    45 F.3d at 1131-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Facially Discriminatory\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Therefore, the question of whether the statute regulates commerce \"directly\" is not the critical one. Instead, the Court begins by evaluating whether the statute discriminates against interstate commerce. IU argues that the challenged statute facially discriminates against interstate commerce, falling within the first analytical category, and is therefore\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional. [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 24\n   </em>\n   .] IU contends that the statute \"builds a wall around Indiana and prohibits tissue from an aborted fetus from entering or exiting the state.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 24\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants disagree, arguing that the statute does not facially discriminate against out-of-state interests, because \"everyone in Indiana is equally prohibited from acquiring receiving, selling, or transferring aborted fetal tissue, regardless of the source.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 30\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants point out that \"[n]othing in the Statute prohibits a person from entering or exiting Indiana with aborted fetal tissue.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 31\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Court agrees that the statute does not on its face discriminate against out-of-state interests. By its terms, the statute prohibits the transfer, acquisition, receipt, and sale of fetal tissue, without reference to whether the source of the\n   tissue or the transferor is located outside the state of Indiana. And contrary to IU's assertion, the statute does not impose an outright ban on fetal tissue entering the state: it specifically prohibits only the transfer, receipt, acquisition, or sale of fetal tissue. IU points out that a statutory loophole that large would be \"illogical,\" arguing that \"[s]urely Defendants cannot mean that IU Plaintiffs may retrieve the fetal tissue samples on the other side of the State's border, drive them back to Marion and Monroe Counties, and conduct research with them without offending the statute.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 84 at 26\n   </em>\n   .] But that appears to be precisely what the statute permits. Because the statute does not facially discriminate against interstate commerce, the Court concludes that it does not fall within the first analytical category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Discriminatory Effect\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In the second category are laws that are facially non-discriminatory, but that have a discriminatory effect on interstate commerce.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Park Pet Shop, Inc. v.

Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/#p578\">\n    539 U.S. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/#p578\">\n    123 S.Ct. 2472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8898517\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/539/558/#p578\">\n    156 L.Ed.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), that \"the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 35\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants respond that both parties agree that there is no scientific consensus as to whether the use of aborted fetal tissue is ethical, and that the Indiana legislature is \"entitled to legislate based on its own view as to which side is correct.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 81 at 41\n   </em>\n   .]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The Court cannot read the Supreme Court's statement in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   as broadly as IU suggests. Nothing in IU's briefing has convinced the Court that the legislature would be constitutionally barred from making the policy determination that research on aborted fetal tissue is unethical, even if that determination were made solely on the basis that the tissue was available as the result of an abortion. Such a policy determination has no bearing on a\n   woman's access to abortion, and therefore the long line of cases detailing the constitutional limits on abortion legislation do not directly apply here. Legislatures do indeed make policy decisions based on ethical and moral determinations, despite the Supreme Court's broad pronouncement in\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   . For example, Indiana criminalizes various forms of obscene and pornographic materials and performances-undoubtedly the result of the legislature's ethical determinations as to the value of those materials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-49\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Obscenity and Pornography). If the legislature's intent were to ensure ethical research using human tissue, and it determined that the use of aborted fetal tissue was unethical, this statute would be rationally related to that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Of course, the Court must agree with IU that if this were indeed the legislature's goal, this statute was neither the most direct nor the least restrictive means to accomplish it: it does not mention research at all, instead only regulating the movement of the fetal tissue encompassed by the statute. But the rational basis inquiry does not require that a statute be the wisest, fairest, most logical, or least restrictive means to any end.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11451845\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/207/419/#p424\">\n    207 F.3d at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And this statute clears that low threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Therefore, the Court grants Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 79\n   </em>\n   ], and denies IU's Motion for Summary Judgment, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77\n   </em>\n   ], as to this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

[\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 47\n   </em>\n   .] IU contends that the statute prohibits and criminalizes its research using fetal tissue, and renders it unable to \"effectively teach [its] students about fetal tissue research if [it] is unable to accompany that instruction with hands-on application.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 48\n   </em>\n   .] Defendants respond that the statute does not itself prohibit any expressive activities, and that any burdens on IU are too remote and attenuated to constitute a violation of the First Amendment.

Though more than a few years have passed since that observation, it remains true today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   IU argues that \"[t]he statute prevents IU Plaintiffs from actively participating in research and scholarship using fetal tissue.\" [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 78 at 48\n   </em>\n   .] IU essentially\n   argues that the statute runs afoul of the First Amendment through the following chain: IU may not conduct research on aborted fetal tissue (because, among other issues, it cannot refresh its supply of fetal tissue, and the statute prohibits internal transfers within the university, which would naturally occur during the course of research). Therefore, IU is left unable to teach its students about the specific process of performing experimentation on aborted fetal tissue, cannot teach its students about the results of experimentation that it was unable to conduct, and cannot publish that research. In other words, it cannot disseminate information that it does not have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Assuming for the moment that the statute prohibits IU from conducting research on aborted fetal tissue, that prohibition applies to specific conduct: performing research. In its briefing here, IU has not established that research is itself expressive conduct to which the First Amendment applies. Instead, IU argues that the consequence of that prohibition-depriving it of information it would otherwise have to convey-is offensive to the First Amendment. The Court is sensitive to the argument that the prohibition of a specific type of research could be seen to cast \"a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.\"\n   <em>\n    Keen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514415\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/252/#p257\">\n    970 F.2d at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, on the other hand, Defendants' point is well-taken that almost any criminal statute could be seen as prohibiting a certain variety of research in which a person could want to engage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The parties devote limited attention to the First Amendment challenge-not surprising, given that it is the last of five separate constitutional arguments, which span hundreds of pages of briefing, and hundreds more in exhibits. IU has not presented an analogous scenario that would support the Court's adoption of its view of First Amendment freedoms in the academic context-that is, that the First Amendment prevents states from enacting statutes prohibiting conduct in which the University would like to engage, and then teach about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Therefore, the Court grants Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 79\n   </em>\n   ], and denies IU's Motion for Summary Judgment, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77\n   </em>\n   ], as to this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   For the reasons described above, the Court resolves the cross-motions for summary judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   \u2022 The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   IU's Motion for Summary Judgment, [\n   <em>\n    Filing No. 77\n   </em>\n   ], as to IU's Due Process Clause claim, to the extent that the Court determines that the text indicated by strikethrough below is unconstitutionally vague, and Defendants are permanently enjoined from enforcing those portions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   (a) As used in this section, 'aborted' means the termination of human pregnancy with an intention other than to produce a live birth or to remove a dead fetus.
