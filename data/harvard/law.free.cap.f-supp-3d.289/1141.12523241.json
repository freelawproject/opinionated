INTRODUCTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant Ohana Control Systems, Inc., contracted with the State of Hawaii Department\n   of Education (\"DOE\" or \"State\") to install fire safety equipment in four public schools. To protect against Ohana's possible failure to complete the work, the State required Ohana to obtain construction performance bonds. Plaintiff Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company provided the bonds, requiring Ohana and its principals, Defendants Amir Borochov and Linda Kinjo, to execute a General Indemnity Agreement. Under the General Indemnity Agreement, Ohana, Borochov, and Kinjo agreed to indemnify Philadelphia for claims made against the bonds and to post collateral in an amount sufficient to secure any claims made against the bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Philadelphia's Complaint alleges that the State made claims under the construction performance bonds, and that Defendants have breached their obligations under the General Indemnity Agreement. Defendants have filed a Counterclaim, which Philadelphia seeks to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court grants Philadelphia's motion to dismiss the Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

There is no dispute that Hawaii law required Ohana to obtain performance bonds to secure performance of the DOE fire safety equipment contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 103D-324 ; ECF 19, PageID # 170; ECF No. 27, PageID # 216. Philadelphia, a Pennsylvania corporation, agreed to issue the requisite bonds on behalf of Ohana.

According to the Counterclaim, Defendants have filed a lawsuit in Hawaii state court against the DOE and State of Hawaii.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16 at PageID # 139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Counterclaim alleges that the DOE acted improperly by, among other things, falsely alleging that Ohana failed to meet its obligations under the fire safety equipment contracts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # s 137-38 (Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 36, 50).

Instead, the Counterclaim simply alleges that Philadelphia had a duty to investigate DOE claims made on the performance bonds before bringing suit against Defendants, without mentioning the basis of any such purported duty. ECF No. 16 \u00b6\u00b6 131-32, PageID # 151.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court has examined the performance bonds and the General Indemnity Agreement and found no provision imposing a duty to investigate on Philadelphia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1-2, PageID # 34; ECF 1-3, PageID # 38; ECF 1-4, PageID # 42; ECF 1-5, PageID # 46. Only the definition of \"loss\" in the General Indemnity Agreement refers to \"investigating,\" stating that \"Loss includes but is not limited to ... (ii) all costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating, paying or litigating any claim, and/or enforcing this Agreement, including but not limited to legal fees and expenses, professional and consulting fees, technical and expert witness fees and expenses.\" ECF 1-1, PageID # 20. This definition therefore defines \"loss\" as including costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating a claim on the performance bond. It does not, however, require any such investigation. In fact, the notion that Philadelphia had a duty to investigate conflicts with a separate provision in the General Indemnity Agreement, which states that Philadelphia's decision to pay a claim on a bond-and thereby to obligate Defendants to repay Philadelphia-lies in Philadelphia's \"sole discretion\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Surety shall have the exclusive right, in its sole discretion, to decide and determine whether any claim, liability, suit or judgment made or brought against Surety on any Bond shall or shall not be paid, compromised, resisted, defended, tried or appealed, on the basis of Surety's belief that it is or could be liable or because the Surety deems it necessary or expedient to do so, and Surety's decision thereon shall be final and binding upon the Indemnitors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263879\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/haw/77/358/#p361\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   At the hearing on the motion, Defendants indicated that their breach of contract claim was based on the provision in the performance bonds stating, \"If the Principal shall promptly and faithfully perform, and fully complete the Contract in strict accordance with the terms of the contract as said Contract may be modified or amended from time to time; then this obligation shall be void; otherwise to remain in full force and effect.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1-2, PageID # 34. Defendants claimed at the hearing that Philadelphia breached the General Indemnity Agreement by attempting to assert rights under it after the performance bonds that it secured became void. Even if the Counterclaim could be supplemented by statements of counsel, which it cannot, Defendants fail to state a viable claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   There is no contractual provision in the General Indemnity Agreement providing for such a cause of action. For example, the General Indemnity Agreement does not say that Philadelphia will not file a lawsuit seeking indemnification for losses allegedly incurred when Defendants believe that they have complied with their obligations under the underlying construction contracts. Philadelphia does not breach the General Indemnity Agreement by attempting to assert rights under it. If Defendants believe that they complied with their obligations under the construction contracts such that the performance bond is now void, that is a defense to Philadelphia's claim under the General Indemnity Agreement that Defendants should indemnify Philadelphia for losses (or post collateral to secure such potential losses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   An analogy highlights Defendants' failure to state a breach of contract claim. Suppose A agrees to sell B a car for $10,000. A delivers the car to B, who pays A $10,000. If B sues A, asserting that the car was defective in some respect, A cannot maintain a counterclaim against B that asserts that the very filing of a suit by B was a breach of contract given A's complete performance under the contract. B's assertion of rights in court under the contract is not a breach of the contract, as there is no provision in the contract prohibiting B from asserting a claim that A has not fully performed A's obligations under the contract. Instead, A has a defense of full performance to B's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants have plainly failed to satisfy their pleading obligations with respect to a breach of contract claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a claimant must plead \"factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged\").

It is not clear from the allegations of the Counterclaim why it would be unjust for Philadelphia to keep the bond premiums when Philadelphia is allegedly being asked to satisfy or pay for Ohana's unfulfilled construction obligations. If Defendants are contending that Philadelphia provided a construction performance bond but did not perform its obligations such that keeping the premiums paid would be unjust, Defendants must allege facts supporting such a contention. If, on the other hand, Defendants are claiming that they satisfied their construction obligations such that the performance\n   bonds became void, Defendants must explain how it would be unjust for Philadelphia to keep the bond premiums. Because they did not so allege facts, Count V of the Counterclaim is dismissed with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Count VI (Breach of Duty to Investigate and Defend).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Count VI of the Counterclaim asserts that \"Philadelphia failed to properly and adequately defend and investigate Defendants['] position\" that they are not in default on the DOE fire safety equipment contracts, and that Philadelphia is thereby \"in violation of its obligations\" under the General Indemnity Agreement and bond agreements. ECF No. 16 \u00b6 149, PageID # 154. The court dismisses this claim with leave to amend for the same reason that it dismissed Count II. The court is unable to discern from the allegations in the Counterclaim what facts the claim is based on. Instead, it appears that this claim is simply an attempt to restate the breach of contract claim asserted in Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Count VII (Declaratory Relief).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Count VII asserts that \"Defendants are entitled to a declaratory judgment that they have been released and discharged, pro tanto, and/or are not Indemnitors under the [General Indemnity Agreement] or other law, and/or are not obligated to indemnify Philadelphia against any liability, loss, or expense arising under the Bonds or other law.\" ECF No. 16 \u00b6 154, PageID # 155.
