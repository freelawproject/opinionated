COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Richard Figueroa climbed the ranks of the Foreign Service for 23 years. But in 2009, after he did not receive one of a limited number of competitively-awarded promotions to the next level, Figueroa was forced into mandatory retirement and filed suit, alleging that the State Department denied him the promotion because he is Hispanic. Proceeding pro se, he advances claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for both disparate treatment and disparate impact. For supporting evidence, Figueroa does not point to any intentional discrimination against him personally. He relies instead on the historical lack of diversity among Foreign Service Officers and the purported unconscious bias of the State Department promotion board that judged him less qualified than other candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   With discovery complete, both parties have moved for summary judgment. Finding that Figueroa has presented insufficient evidence to rebut the Department's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for denying him the promotion-that Figueroa was not ranked highly enough in the Department's competitive selection process-and that the statistics Figueroa offers on Hispanic promotion rates do not establish a prima facie case of disparate impact, the Court will grant the Department's motion and deny Figueroa's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

It has provided affidavits from members of the 2008 selection boards stating that they reviewed each employee's personnel file in accordance with the criteria set forth in the precepts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report of Investigation, at 89-90 (Declaration of selection board member Susan Alexander);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788918\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/28/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788918\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/28/#p35\">\n    at 94-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Declaration of selection board member Christopher Murray);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788918\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/28/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788918\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/28/#p35\">\n    at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Declaration of selection board member Marian Williams);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788918\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/28/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788918\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/28/#p35\">\n    at 109-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Declaration of selection board member David Donahue);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788918\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/28/#p35\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788918\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/847/28/#p35\">\n    at 114-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Declaration of selection board member Geeta Pasi).

For one, the fact that the reviewers do not remember Figueroa's application is not enough to discredit their sworn testimony that they reviewed each of the applications under the precepts; failing to remember a particular application is\n   not inconsistent with having actually reviewed it. Nor is it particularly surprising that the reviewers might not remember Figueroa in particular given that they reviewed over 400 applications.

Cir. 2017) (citation omitted). Figueroa points to no such evidence here. And the affidavits are not so wholly conclusory as to be disregarded, either: the affiants offer specific facts concerning the review process they undertook-a subject within their personal experience and competence to testify about-not just legal conclusions or generalities. For these reasons, the affidavits are properly considered for purposes of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Figueroa next argues that the Department's rationale is inadequate because it has provided \"shifting\" reasoning for his non-promotion. But the Department's rationale has been consistent throughout this litigation: it did not promote Figueroa because he was not ranked highly enough by the selection boards following the criteria and process laid out in the precepts. According to the Final Agency Decision, the Department's proffered reason was that it \"applied the same criteria to consideration of [Figueroa's] promotion candidacy that it applied to all others.\" Def.'s Reply Ex. 1, at 14. Similarly, the decision by the EEOC states that the Department \"articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions,\" namely that \"it applied the same criteria to consideration of [Figueroa's] promotion candidacy that it applied to all others\" and Figueroa was not recommended for promotion. Compl. Ex. 2, at 2. And before this Court, the Department maintains this explanation for why Figueroa was not promoted. Def.'s MSJ at 9. Thus, the Department's story has been consistent throughout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Figueroa contends that the Department's explanation is not sufficiently \"clear and reasonably specific\" to constitute a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, as required by the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p258\">\n    450 U.S. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 258,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p258\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p258\">\n    67 L.Ed.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981).

This requirement \"arises both from the necessity of rebutting the inference of discrimination arising from the prima facie case and from the requirement that the plaintiff be afforded 'a full and fair opportunity' to demonstrate pretext.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oates v.

Cir. 1987). As explained by the First Circuit decision that\n   <em>\n    Burdine\n   </em>\n   cited approvingly, \"a plaintiff cannot be expected to disprove a defendant's reasons unless they have been articulated with some specificity.\"\n   <em>\n    Loeb v.

When an employer presents a \"bald and amorphous\" reason-such as that the employee was not \"sufficiently suited\" for a position-\"neither [the Court] nor [the plaintiff] can identify the kind of evidence needed to demonstrate that such a rank generalization is or is not pretextual.\"\n   <em>\n    Patrick v. Ridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9166450\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/311/#p317\">\n    394 F.3d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317 (5th Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The rationale that the Department has presented here meets this specificity requirement. While Figueroa contends that the reason is just a vague \"not qualified enough\" excuse, that is not an accurate characterization of the Department's position. The Department explains that the reviewing boards followed the process outlined in the precepts and did not rank Figueroa's application highly enough. The process followed by the selection boards is outlined in detail in the precepts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report of Investigation at 117-97 (precepts documents). This level of detail extends to the criteria used by the selection boards in evaluating employees eligible for promotion: the precepts list six core criteria, with specific skills detailed for each criteria along with descriptions of what the mastery of those skills at the low-, mid-, and senior-level looks like.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-26. And these same six core precepts are used in the annual employee reviews that the selection board received and used to evaluate employees for promotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 205, 210, 216 (Figueroa's evaluations). Thus, the Department's proffered reason is fairly characterized as saying that Figueroa was not ranked highly enough compared to other eligible employees based on an evaluation under the six precepts (including the specific descriptions for each precept).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Department's reason here is thus specific enough because a plaintiff-and the Court-can clearly see what type of evidence would be needed to demonstrate that the reason is pretext. Namely, a plaintiff could bring forth evidence that, given the articulation of the six precepts the Department has laid out, she clearly meets those requirements based on her prior experience. And the plaintiff can compare her prior experience and achievements to those employees who were eventually promoted using the Department's precepts and their fleshed out descriptions as a guide. Since the same six precepts are used to evaluate employees annually, the employee can easily find a discussion of how she meets-or how those selected do not meet-these six criteria in her annual evaluations and can use these reviews as a basis for a comparison. Indeed, this is precisely what Figueroa contends-he argues in his opposition that his annual reviews and achievements show he is well qualified under the precepts' criteria. Pl.'s MSJ at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The cases that Figueroa cites in support of his argument demonstrate why the Department's reason is sufficiently concrete here. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Patrick\n   </em>\n   , the employer asserted that the plaintiff \"was not 'sufficiently suited' \" for the position, but \"gave no explanation of what this means.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9166450\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/311/#p317\">\n    394 F.3d at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The interviewers who analyzed the applicants were simply told to rate the six finalists for the position based on \"each candidate's strengths,\" \"how each responded to a uniform set of questions,\" and \"how the panel members believed that each would fit into the work group.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9166450\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/311/#p317\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9166450\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/311/#p317\">\n    at 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And in\n   <em>\n    Alvarado v.

There is no indication that the reviewers in\n   <em>\n    Alvarado\n   </em>\n   were given any criteria on which to base their determination of whether an employee was \"qualified.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In each of these cases, the employer asserted that the plaintiff was not the \"most qualified\" without providing any indication of\n   <em>\n    what qualifications\n   </em>\n   it was looking for. In other words, the employer never provided any guidance as to what a \"most qualified\" or \"most suited\" candidate would look like. Without a sense of the particular criteria that the plaintiff failed to meet, a plaintiff cannot attempt to show pretext by demonstrating how she does, in fact, measure up to or even exceed the employee selected over her. Moreover, without an articulation of what qualifications matter, a Court cannot be certain whether the plaintiff was deemed less qualified because she failed to meet some specific criteria or because of her gender or race.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvarado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507114\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/605/\">\n    492 F.3d at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But here, because the Department has provided the specific criteria used to evaluate employees-the six precepts-Figueroa can challenge the assertion that he failed to measure up to these specific criteria and the Court can assess whether the Department's proffered explanation may be pretext. Accordingly, the Department has presented a sufficiently clear and reasonably specific legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Figueroa's non-promotion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Nor does the fact that Figueroa was ranked for promotion in 2004 and 2005 indicate he was significantly better than those promoted in 2008. Given that the candidates are re-evaluated on an annual basis, it is entirely plausible that Figueroa was ranked more highly against the talent pool in 2004 and 2005 than he was against a completely different pool in 2008. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that the quality of applicants in 2004 and 2005 was equal to or greater than in 2008, a necessary first step to raise an inference that Figueroa was better qualified than those selected for promotion in 2008.

When a party destroys relevant evidence that it has an obligation to maintain, the opposing party may be entitled to a negative inference.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Grosdidier v.

Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As an initial matter, Figueroa points to no evidence that any notes to be destroyed ever existed in the first place. None of the declarations filed by the selection board members discuss keeping or making notes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report of Investigation at 88-116. The simple fact that the Department's policy was for selection board members to discard their notes says nothing about whether such notes were kept to begin with.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   And what evidence there is in the record tends to suggest that notes may never have existed in the first place. One of the board members in fact stated that \"[t]he Board members did not keep any records\" and \"were told we may not do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114 (Declaration of selection board member Geeta Pasi). Similarly, Claire Pierangelo-a Department of State employee who served on selection boards in other years-testified that when she served on selection boards, she did not take notes on applications that were mid-ranked, but rather \"only took notes on those that [she] moved either to the low ranking or to the promotable piles.\" Def.'s Reply Ex. 2, at 115:10-22. She further testified that \"in general what most board members do is they make a marking that consists of a P for promote, L for low rank, or M for mid rank. So the extent of any ... notes from most board members would be a simple indication of which pile they think [an employee] should belong in.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:7-12. Pierangelo's testimony further suggests that there would be few, if any, notes to be found. Thus, Figueroa fails to provide sufficient evidence for the Court to conclude that there even\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   any substantive notes to begin with. Without that, it is hard for the Court to conclude that the Department in fact destroyed the relevant notes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Even assuming that there were notes and those notes were destroyed, a spoliation inference requires that the Department destroyed the notes in violation of an obligation to retain them.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zhi Chen v.

The Department argues that no such obligation existed at the time any notes were destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As an initial matter, the Department was not involved in litigation with Figueroa or reasonably on notice of prospective litigation at the time any notes were destroyed. The reviewing boards concluded their review and transmitted the results by July 8, 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply Ex. C, at DOS000696 (cable transmitting the results of the boards' review). Figueroa filed his complaint with the Department's Civil Rights Office-which would have placed the Department on notice of possible litigation-in October 2008, several months later. Thus, the ordinary obligation to retain potentially relevant evidence during the pendency or in reasonable anticipation of litigation was absent in July 2008 when the notes, if they existed, might have been destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Figueroa contends that the destruction of the notes nonetheless violated an obligation to retain them, pointing first to a regulation by the Office of Personnel Management,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20335.103\">\n    5 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5), which requires federal agencies to \"maintain a temporary record of each promotion\" for at least two years. But this regulation is part of those that govern the process of promotion within the\n   <em>\n    civil\n   </em>\n   service.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20335.103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 335.103(a) (section applies to promotions made under authority of section 335.102);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20335.103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 335.102 (discussing agency authority to promote career, civil service employees). Figueroa was a member of the\n   <em>\n    Foreign\n   </em>\n   Service, not the civil service. Promotion within the Foreign Service falls under an entirely different statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203905\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4002. Thus, in contrast to\n   <em>\n    Talavera\n   </em>\n   - where the federal agency in fact admitted it was governed by this regulation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200146,3556098\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/303/\">\n    638 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   312 -the Department's procedure does not violate the Office of Personnel Management's record-retention regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Figueroa also contends that the destruction would have violated an EEOC regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201602.14\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1602.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which requires that an \"employer\" retain any \"personnel or employment record[s]\" for at least one year. As Figueroa correctly notes, the D.C. Circuit applied this regulation to the defendant federal agencies in\n   <em>\n    Talavera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Grosdidier\n   </em>\n   . The Department-unlike the federal agencies in\n   <em>\n    Talavera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Grosdidier\n   </em>\n   -argues that this regulation is inapplicable because under the statutory text of Title VII, the government is not an \"employer\" and so any recordkeeping obligations for \"employers\" would not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(b) (\"The term 'employer' ... does not include the United States ...\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201602.14\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2000e-8(c) (requiring \"[e]very employer ... subject to\" Title VII to make, keep, and preserve relevant records pursuant to EEOC regulations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Neither the D.C. Circuit nor any other court in this District appears to have squarely addressed this latter argument. The Court need not resolve it either. Even if the Court agreed that (1) there were notes that were destroyed and (2) that destruction was contrary to an obligation to retain the records, any negative inference to be drawn from the destroyed notes is still insufficient for Figueroa to meet his burden. After all, \"even if a factfinder could reasonably infer that the destroyed notes contained information that might be favorable to [Figueroa], favorable evidence\n   is not in all instances equivalent to evidence that would permit [him] to survive summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Grosdidier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547129,3662782\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/19/\">\n    709 F.3d at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given Pierangelo's testimony that the notes were unlikely to reveal much more than whether the panelists thought Figueroa ought to be ranked high, mid, or low-and the final listing of eligible employees signed by each board member already conclusively shows that Figueroa was ultimately mid-ranked by the boards,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply Ex.

Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Ultimately, the Department has presented a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Figueroa's non-promotion: he was not ranked highly enough by the selection board to be promoted. The question is then whether Figueroa has presented sufficient evidence by which a jury could find that this reason is pretext.

Yet Figueroa provides no analysis of these statistics, instead relying on the bare promotion figures without any indication of the statistical significance of any demonstrated discrepancies reflected in them. This approach differs from most cases, where the plaintiff presents expert testimony or other evidence explaining the statistical significance of the numerical data provided,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11662936,3669560\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/180/329/\">\n    180 F.3d at 339-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referencing plaintiff's evidence that disparities in pay data exceeded 1.96 standard deviations under a two-tailed test of statistical significance).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Figueroa's statistics certainly show that fewer Hispanic employees were promoted-indeed, none in 2006, 2007, and 2008-than white applicants or, at times, other minority applicants.

In light of the smaller number of eligible Hispanic employees compared to eligible white employees, Figueroa must show that the promotion process\n   has a\n   <em>\n    disproportionate\n   </em>\n   impact on Hispanic applicants.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Aliotta v.

For one, the rates of promotion for Hispanic employees fluctuated during the five-year period from 2004 through 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Hispanics had the highest promotion rate in 2005 and the second-highest in 2004, exceeding the promotion rates of white employees both years.

The fact that Hispanics are not\n   <em>\n    consistently\n   </em>\n   promoted at a lower rate than other groups of employees-absent any change during the relevant time period-cuts against the conclusion that they are disproportionately affected by the particular method of promotion decision-making that the Department employs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valentino v.

Cir. 1988) (\"There is always some possibility that a statistical discrepancy is due to chance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Given this fact, plaintiffs in disparate impact cases typically provide some statistical analysis of their data to discount the likelihood that the disparities shown are the consequence of random variation rather than unlawful animus.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hill v. Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11545858\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/183/586/#p591\">\n    183 F.3d 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591 (7th Cir. 1999) (\"Fairly simple statistical inquiries can reveal the probability that a circumstance less whole than chance [is] to blame.\");\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519625,4329911\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/815/84/\">\n    815 F.2d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A statistical analysis of a disparity in selection rates can reveal the\n   <em>\n    probability\n   </em>\n   that the disparity is merely a random deviation from perfectly equal selection rates.\"). Figueroa provides no such analysis here. As a result, the Court has no basis on which to assess whether any disparity in Hispanic promotion rates may be caused by the challenged processes rather than the randomness of chance, the overall small number of Hispanic applicants, or some other factor. Without such evidence of a causal link-or even an indication of a disproportionate impact on Hispanic applicants-Figueroa fails to meet his burden to make a prima facie case of disparate impact. Summary judgment in favor of the Department is thus appropriate on Figueroa's disparate impact claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nothing in this opinion is intended to minimize the importance of ensuring diversity in the ranks of the Foreign Service or to assess the State Department's efforts to rectify its past deficiencies in achieving it. Nor is this ruling intended to call into question Mr. Figueroa's notable accomplishments and qualifications. Rather, based on the evidence presented, the Court simply concludes that Figueroa has failed to meet his burden to survive summary judgment on either a disparate treatment\n   or disparate impact claim of racial discrimination. For this reason alone, the Department is entitled to summary judgment on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court will, accordingly, grant the Department's Motion for Summary Judgment and deny Figueroa's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. A separate Order will accompany this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Figueroa also filed a class complaint, which was dismissed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Report of Investigation at 52. This claim is not at issue here because Figueroa has never sought to certify this case as a class action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Relying on\n    <em>\n     Alvarado\n    </em>\n    , Figueroa also argues that the employer must provide specific reasons why\n    <em>\n     he\n    </em>\n    was less qualified in order to proffer a sufficiently clear and reasonably specific reason.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s MSJ at 19 (citing\n    <em>\n     Alvarado\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507114\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/605/\">\n     492 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    617-18 ). Put another way, Figueroa appears to contend that an employer must say that the employee was less qualified for a specific reason for that employer to meet its burden. But he points to no case law from the D.C. Circuit imposing such a requirement. Nor is it apparent that\n    <em>\n     Alvarado\n    </em>\n    even imposes such a burden. Rather,\n    <em>\n     Alvarado\n    </em>\n    requires the defendant to provide a\n    <em>\n     specific basis\n    </em>\n    for its subjective determination that the plaintiff was less qualified. Pointing to detailed criteria used to evaluate employees for promotion decisions-as the Department does here-is certainly providing a\n    <em>\n     basis\n    </em>\n    for the conclusion that Figueroa was less qualified.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Alvarado\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3507114\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/605/\">\n     492 F.3d at 617\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that the employer \"offered neither an explanation nor evidence of how or why the interviewers arrived at th[e] scores\" assigned to the applicants). In any event, requiring such a particularized, individualized reason would impose a significant burden on large employers, like the Department, that review hundreds of eligible employees when making promotion decisions. Since the Department's reason serves the purposes of the \"clear and reasonably specific\" requirement-allowing a plaintiff a fair chance to show pretext-the Court is not inclined to obligate the Department to provide an employee-specific reason, even if it might have been helpful for it to have done so in this situation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In contrast, in the cases that Figueroa cites, there was clear evidence that notes\n    <em>\n     were taken\n    </em>\n    and then destroyed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Grosdidier\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3547129,3662782\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/709/19/\">\n     709 F.3d at 22\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Although all of the panelists took notes during the interviews, only Butts preserved her notes.\");\n    <em>\n     Talavera\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200146,3556098\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/303/\">\n     638 F.3d at 312\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"Streufert admits to knowing or negligent destruction of his interview notes insofar as the destruction was not accidental.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Figueroa appears to challenge a number of purported personnel practices, including the \"fresh look\" the selection boards take each year and the Department's failure to give Hispanics leadership positions that would facilitate their promotion. The Department argues that Figueroa did not raise some of these challenged practices in his administrative complaint and thus cannot raise them here. The Court need not resolve this dispute, since it finds that Figueroa fails to meet his burden regardless of which practice is considered.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    While Figueroa focuses on the results from 2006-2008, he provides no reason why the Court should ignore the results in 2004 and 2005 given that they are the result of the same process of reviewing and making promotion determinations as in the later years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    While the statistics show the promotion rates of Native American employees as well, only one or two such eligible employees are reported for every year. As such, it is hard to draw any real comparison between any fluctuations in the promotion rates of Native American employees and those of other employees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Asian employees had a 23.73% promotion rate through that time period, and ultimately Native American employees had a 14.29% promotion rate (1 out of 7). See Def.'s MSJ Ex. F, at DOS001043.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    As an added wrinkle, given the nature of the promotion process, it is likely the case that the total number of eligible employees reflected in these statistics (1333 over the five years) does not represent the total number of\n    <em>\n     distinct\n    </em>\n    employees considered for promotion during this time period. Employees, after all, could be reconsidered multiple years. Figueroa provides no statistics on the\n    <em>\n     distinct\n    </em>\n    number of Hispanic (or other) employees eligible over the five year period compared to the total number promoted, nor any analysis of how this dynamic might impact the significance of any numerical differences in annual promotion rates. The Court has calculated promotion rates using the total number of eligible employees listed in the statistics provided by the parties since that is all it has.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
