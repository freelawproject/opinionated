Van Maren, Kristi Hoffine, Jerry Abbott, and Joe Hornback. Plaintiffs are pursuing a variety of state and federal claims all related to defendants' alleged installation of a secret video camera in Rob Marriott's classroom. This matter is currently before the court on defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 8). Defendants argue plaintiffs have failed to state a claim because they had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a public school classroom, and that defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. For the reasons stated below, the court grants defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are summarized from those set forth in plaintiffs' complaint. Plaintiff Rob Marriott was employed by USD 204 as a science teacher and track and cross country coach at Bonner Springs High School from 2007-2015. During his tenure at Bonner Springs High School, defendant Robert Van Maren was superintendent of USD 204, defendant Kristi Hoffine was employed as the Directory of Secondary Instruction, and defendants\n   Jerry Abbott and Joe Hornback both, at separate times during Rob Marriott's tenure, served as principal of Bonner Springs High School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rob Marriott resigned from Bonner Springs High School in 2015 and accepted a position at Leavenworth High School. In early 2016, Rob Marriott learned that in 2009, USD 204 IT staff had installed a camera in his science classroom and that Bonner Springs administrators had been secretly taping him throughout his tenure at Bonner Springs High School. Rob Marriott alleges that the camera was secretly installed at the direction of defendant Van Maren and defendant Hoffine because Van Maren's son and Hoffine's daughter were students in his classroom during the 2008-2009 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rob Marriott is married to plaintiff Dawn Marriott and they have a son, B.M. Throughout Rob Marriott's employment at Bonner Springs High School, he, Dawn Marriott and B.M. used the classroom to change their clothes for after-school activities. Rob Marriott alleges that whenever he or his family used his classroom to change, he would always lock and secure the door to ensure privacy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Upon discovery of the alleged secret camera, plaintiffs filed this suit in Wyandotte County District Court asserting the following causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1) Intrusion Upon Seclusion Invasion of Privacy\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2) Negligence\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3) Negligent Supervision of Employees (Defendant USD 204)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   4) Negligent Supervision of a Child\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   5) Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   6) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   7) Section 1983 Deprivation of Constitutional Rights Privacy Violation\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants removed the case to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and now move to dismiss all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Indeed, courts have found that video surveillance is an \"extraordinarily intrusive method of searching,\" and that video surveillance in places of \"heightened privacy\" violates an individual's constitutional rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Establishing that video surveillance has violated an individual's constitutional rights, however, requires that a party show they had a \"reasonable\" or \"legitimate\" expectation of privacy.

In response to defendants' motion to dismiss, plaintiffs claim that while they were in the locked classroom they had an expectation of privacy because the classroom was \"for his exclusive use and other school personnel did not have access.\" (Doc. 15, at 7.) Yet plaintiffs did not plead any facts in their complaint to establish that Rob Marriott had exclusive use of his public classroom, or that the school district had explicitly provided the classroom for his private use. Instead, as defendants point out, Rob Marriott's classroom was not the same as his own personal office-it was a classroom in a public school, open to students, administrators, other staff, custodial staff, and sometimes other members of the public.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plock v.

Ill. 2007) (noting \"[a] classroom in a public school is not the private property of any teacher. A classroom is a public space in which government employees communicate with members of the public.\"). Plaintiffs do not complain about defendants' general placement of the camera in the classroom, as, presumably, they recognize there is no expectation of privacy while a teacher is performing his public school teaching duties. Plaintiffs' only complaint is that the video camera placed in the public classroom also recorded them undressing when they assumed they had secured their privacy by locking the classroom door. Plaintiffs cannot reasonably expect that simply locking a door would transform a public school classroom into a secured area suitable for undressing. This, the court finds, is not a subjective expectation of privacy that society would be willing to recognize as reasonable. The cases cited by plaintiffs supporting their argument are all easily distinguishable as they recognize a right to privacy from video surveillance in areas reserved traditionally for changing clothes-restrooms and locker rooms.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brannum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641399\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/516/489/#p498\">\n    516 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   498 ;\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Yet, as noted above, defendants allegedly placed a video camera in a public school classroom-not in an area designated for undressing. Plaintiffs have not cited any authority that would clearly establish a right to not be video recorded in a public school classroom. For these reasons, the court finds defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiffs' \u00a7 1983 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    b. State Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs bring six different state law torts against defendants, all related to the alleged video recording. Federal district courts have supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims that are part of the \"same case or controversy\" as federal claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). \"[W]hen a district court dismisses the federal claims, leaving only the supplemental state claims, the most common response has been to dismiss the state claim or claims without prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Botefuhr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11414696\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/309/1263/#p1273\">\n    309 F.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1273 (10th Cir. 2002) (quotation marks, alterations, and citation omitted). Whether to assert supplemental jurisdiction is within the court's discretion.\n   <em>\n    Brinkman v. State Dept. of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7849977\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/863/1479/#p1488\">\n    863 F.Supp. 1479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1488 (D. Kan. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because plaintiffs' federal claim has been dismissed, the court finds it has no supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claims. These claims are therefore dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 8) is\n   granted. The federal claims are dismissed with prejudice and the state claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case is closed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
