(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment (\"Indictment\"), ECF No. 44.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The federal counts in the superseding indictment relate to the government's allegation that Hillie surreptitiously video-recorded his live-in girlfriend's underage daughter as she removed her clothes, applied creams and lotions to her naked body, bathed, used the toilet, washed and groomed herself, and performed other intimate activities in what she thought was the privacy of her own bedroom and bathroom. In his motion to dismiss, Hillie argues that \"[n]one of the videos ... capture[s] [the victim] engaging in any\n   conduct that could remotely be considered lascivious\" (Def.'s Second Mot. to Dismiss Counts 1-7 of the Indictment (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 50, at 4), and thus, the \"visual depictions in each of these counts do not constitute child pornography as a matter of law\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hillie further maintains that the government has indicted him \"based largely on a flawed interpretation of what constitutes child pornography,\" because there is, in fact, \"absolutely no evidence to suggest that Mr. Hillie attempted to produce child pornography.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Not surprisingly, the government disagrees with Hillie's contentions, and argues that this Court should uphold the various child pornography charges that have been brought against Hillie in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Counts 1-7 of the Indictment (\"Gov't's Opp'n\"), ECF No. 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court heard the parties' arguments on Hillie's motion to dismiss the child pornography charges during a motion hearing that the Court held on August 3, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Aug. 3, 2017 Hr'g Tr.

(\"Sept. 21 Tr.\") ). The instant Memorandum Opinion explains the reasons for that ruling. In short, this Court has considered the parties' arguments, and evaluated the facts presented here in light of the widely accepted factors for determining whether a charged visual depiction constitutes child pornography in the form of a \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\" of a minor,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A)(v), that were first set out in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court has concluded that a reasonable jury could easily find that the videos charged in the superseding indictment either depict a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct or demonstrate Hillie's attempts to capture depictions of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Therefore, this Court agrees with the government that the crimes of production and possession of child pornography (which require that a minor engage in \"sexually explicit conduct[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 2252(a)(4)(B) ) can reasonably be construed to pertain to the conduct the government has charged here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In each video, Hillie carefully angles and repositions the recording device, and in more than one video he succeeds in capturing several extended images of J.A.A.'s exposed genitals. A reasonable jury could therefore find that Hillie positioned the camera \"in an attempt to tighten [its] focus ... on the area where the [victim's] genitals would be if [she] were to face the camera, and thereby determine that the first\n   <em>\n    Dost\n   </em>\n   factor was satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201464\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/639/433/#p439\">\n    639 F.3d at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The second factor is \"whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Dost\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3868154\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/636/828/\">\n    636 F.Supp. at 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Hillie has asked this Court to remove Counts 1-7 from the jury, and thereby preclude any determination that the charged videos depict a minor engaged in sexually explicit or lascivious conduct. \"It appears that the removal of the question of whether a video depicts a child engaging in 'lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area' from the hands of the jury through a pretrial motion is without precedent.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4126635\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/831/804/#p811\">\n    831 F.Supp.2d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in the instant case, this Court is not persuaded that it should be the first to buck this trend. Based on the allegations in the government's indictment and this Court's own assessment of the videos in question, a reasonable jury could find that Hillie successfully captured and possessed images of a \"lascivious exhibition\" of J.A.A.'s \"genitals or pubic area[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202256\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A)(v), or attempted to capture such images, when he surreptitiously recorded nude videos of J.A.A. in her bedroom and bathroom while she engaged in private, intimate activities.
