This case now comes before the Court on Defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of venue or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2014, Ms. Nabong was living and working in the Philippines when Ms. Paddayuman contacted her about potential employment in the United States. According to the Complaint, Ms. Paddayuman offered to employ Ms. Nabong in the United States as an \"in-home caregiver of [Ms. Paddayuman's] two grandchildren,\" emphasizing \"that Ms. Nabong's responsibilities would be limited to childcare and would not involve cleaning, laundry, or other housework.\" Compl. \u00b6 16. Enticed by the offer, Ms. Nabong expressed interest in the position. Compl. \u00b6 16. Then, a short time later, Ms. Paddayuman informed Ms. Nabong that she had been hired for the job. Compl. \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Paddayuman told Ms. Nabong that \"she [Ms. Paddayuman] would handle most of the paperwork associated with Ms. Nabong's admission to the United States.\" Compl. \u00b6 17. Defendants then proceeded to secure a G-5 visa for Ms. Nabong, which allows a foreign national to enter the United States as a domestic or personal employee of a foreign employee of an international organization working in the United States under a G-4 visa.

Although Ms. Nabong was consistently told that she would be working for Ms. Paddayuman, throughout the visa paperwork process, Ms. Paddayuman instructed Ms. Nabong to identify Ms. Sy, a World Bank Group employee with a G-4 visa, as her employer both \"on the visa\" and \"during [an] interview with United States embassy officials.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. Ms. Paddayuman also provided Ms. Nabong with an employment contract prepared on a World Bank template that identified Ms. Sy as Ms. Nabong's prospective employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 22; Compl. Ex. 3, ECF No. 1-3. According to the Complaint, \"the preparation of Plaintiffs' immigration and employment documents, application for and processing of Plaintiffs' G-5 visa, and [Ms.] Paddayuman's communications with [Ms. Nabong] regarding her employment and move to the United States occurred at the International Finance Corporation, a member organization of the World Bank Group, in Washington, D.C.\" Compl. \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 21, 2014, Ms. Nabong received a G-5 visa and, one month later, arrived in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 23. Ms. Nabong then went to live with and work for Ms. Paddayuman at Ms. Paddayuman's home in Burke, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Ms. Nabong alleges, however, that over the course of her employment, Ms. Paddayuman held Ms. Nabong captive through coercion and intimidation and forced her to work long hours performing housework beyond which she had originally agreed under inhumane conditions and without adequate pay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-47. This treatment persisted for more than a month when, on May 6, 2014, a special agent from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed Ms. Nabong from the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 6, 2017, Ms. Nabong commenced this suit against both Ms. Paddayuman and Ms. Sy asserting several claims under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (\"TVPRA\"), the Fair Labor Standards Act, Virginia labor laws, and common law claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of contract, and unjust enrichment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55-119.

The Court is persuaded that there does exist a common nucleus of operative fact: namely, Ms. Nabong's alleged mistreatment at the hands of Ms. Paddayuman. Indeed, for each and every claim identified in the complaint-including the claims that are properly venued here under \u00a7 1391(b) -Ms. Nabong will be required to demonstrate that she suffered maltreatment in some form or another. Consequently, all of Ms. Nabong's claims are likely to involve common issues of proof and many of the same witnesses. Considerations of judicial economy and convenience therefore weigh in favor of trying all of Ms. Nabong's claims together in a single action. Accordingly, the Court finds that exercising its discretion in applying the pendent venue doctrine to Ms.\n   Nabong's remaining claims is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elemary\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610281\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/533/144/#p150\">\n    533 F.Supp.2d at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2008) (applying pendent venue doctrine when plaintiff's claims \"will likely entail common issues of proof\");\n   <em>\n    Laffey v.

Thus, venue is proper in the District of Columbia for each of Ms. Nabong's claims under 28 U.S.C. 1391(b)(2) and the pendent venue doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kazenercom TOO v.
