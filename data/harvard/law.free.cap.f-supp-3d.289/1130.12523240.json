RUIA creates a national unemployment insurance program for railroad workers and \"remove[s] [them] from the coverage of [state] unemployment insurance acts\" by preempting state laws that offer similar programs for those workers. H.R. Rep. No. 75-2668, at 1, 2;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Congress added RUIA's sickness provision after acknowledging sickness also causes unemployment; a type of unemployment RUIA originally overlooked.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 79-1710, at 5\n   (1946);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20351\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(2). Because the goal was a national short-term railroad worker disability insurance program, Congress expressly preempted state laws that already provided such benefits. This backdrop is crucial because it demonstrates RUIA is not a stand-alone sickness benefit statute; it is an unemployment benefits statute with a sickness provision. The purpose of the preemption clause therefore was not to supersede all state laws that compensate railroad employees for taking a day off for any tangentially health-related reason, but rather to create a uniform standard for sickness benefits that displaces similar state laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants direct the court to the Report of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on RUIA's 1946 Amendment, which indicates RUIA's preemptive scope was limited to \"similar\" state sickness benefits. That report states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [S]ection 13(b) of the present unemployment insurance law preempts to the Federal Government the field of railroad unemployment insurance so as to exclude State unemployment compensation laws from the field and thus to protect employers from duplicate liability. The amendments made by this section of the bill extend that preemption to the sickness benefits provided by the bill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Suppl. S. Rep. No. 79-1710, at 26 (1946). The report explains preemption was limited to the type of sickness benefits \"provided by this section of the bill,\" meaning benefits that compensate railroad employees when they are physically incapable of working because of their own injury or sickness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The goal of preemption was \"to protect employers from duplicate liability,\" which signals the intent to displace laws that would otherwise provide railroad employees the same or similar benefit a second time. Congress did not intend for section 13(b) to preempt \"all state sickness benefits\"; just those similar to RUIA's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The meaning of \"sickness benefit\" as used in RUIA therefore delineates the scope of preemption here. While RUIA does not explicitly define \"sickness benefits,\"\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20351\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the definitions it does provide inform the meaning of the term. RUIA defines a \"day of sickness\" as \"a calendar day on which because of any physical, mental, psychological, or nervous injury, illness, sickness, [ ] disease\" or because of \"pregnancy, miscarriage, or the birth of a child,\" a covered employee \"is not able to work\" and does not receive or accrue \"remuneration.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20351\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k). RUIA defines \"benefits\" as \"money payments payable to an employee as provided in this chapter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 351(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(1). \"Sickness benefits\" under RUIA thus means wage-replacement payments for covered employees who are unable to work because they are injured, ill, sick, or have an issue related to pregnancy or child birth. If a state law offers what RUIA defines as a \"sickness benefit,\" then RUIA preempts it. The state law benefits need not be identical or duplicative of RUIA to trigger preemption, they need only meet RUIA's general definition as here derived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The California Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Having defined the scope of RUIA preemption in this way, the court assesses which California Act provisions, if any, it reaches.

Brock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131466\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/678/#p686\">\n    480 U.S. 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 686,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131466\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/678/#p686\">\n    107 S.Ct. 1476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1131466\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/480/678/#p686\">\n    94 L.Ed.2d 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987) (finding silence as to severability \"is just that-silence-and does not raise a presumption against severability\") (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Rather, the analysis turns on the interplay and interdependence of the Act's preempted and non-preempted provisions. One provision within the California Act lists the circumstances that trigger an employee's paid sick leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20246.5\">\n    Cal. Lab Code \u00a7 246.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"(1) Diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, an employee or an employee's family member. (2) For an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking....\"). The remaining sections define relevant terms and detail how paid sick leave accrues. As explained\n   above, RUIA preempts the provision that provides for payment of railroad employees for missed work because of their own sickness, illness, childbirth or pregnancy-related reason. RUIA does not preempt the provision that provides for payment of railroad employees for missed work to care for family members or to seek protection from domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. Thus, if the court severed the preempted portion, section 246.5(a) would read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (a) Upon the oral or written request of an employee, an employer shall provide paid sick days for the following purposes:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (1) Diagnosis, care, or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for\n   <s>\n    , an employee or\n   </s>\n   an employee's family member.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (2) For an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the purposes described in subdivision (c) of Section 230 and subdivision (a) of Section 230.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Removing these three words neither changes the meaning nor the function of the remainder of this provision or the statute at large. Thus, the provision remains grammatically and functionally intact, as applied to railroad employees.\n   <em>\n    Vivid Entm't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341366\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/566/#p574\">\n    774 F.3d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Also, in passing the California Act, the Legislature referenced specific rationales and economic benefits associated only with these remaining provisions, which demonstrates volitional separability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2014 Cal. Stat. c. 317 (A.B. 1522), \u00a7\u00a7 1(i), 2 (explaining intent to give employees time to address \"the health needs of their families\" and their \"significant elder care responsibilities.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2 (declaring the goal of \"[p]rovid[ing] economic security to employees in California who take time off from work for reasons related to domestic violence or sexual assault.\"). The Legislature drew further connections between domestic violence and workplace productivity, finding that \"[a]ffording survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault paid sick days is vital to their independence and recovery,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341366\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/566/#p574\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(o). The Legislature also found \"[d]omestic violence ... has a devastating effect on families, communities, and the workplace,\" and \"impacts productivity, effectiveness, absenteeism, and employee turnover in the workplace,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341366\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/566/#p574\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1(m), and that \"[s]urvivors of domestic violence and sexual assault may be vulnerable at work while trying to end an abusive relationship because the workplace may be the only place where the perpetrator knows to contact the victim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341366\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/566/#p574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1(n). And, finally, the Legislature relied on studies showing \"up to one-half of domestic violence victims experience job loss. Forty percent reported on-the-job harassment [and] [n]early 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the assaults.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341366\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/566/#p574\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1(n). These references, studies and correlations indicate the Legislature would opt for severability over total invalidation. The provisions as they remain are volitionally intact.\n   <em>\n    Vivid Entm't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341366\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/566/#p574\">\n    774 F.3d at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, the court severs the three words in section 246.5(a)(1) -\"an employee or\"-that allow railroad employees to use paid sick leave on days they cannot work because of their own sickness, injury or pregnancy/childbirth reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court GRANTS in PART and DENIES in PART each motion for partial summary judgment. The court finds RUIA preempts the California Act to the extent the latter allows railroad employees to use paid sick days when they cannot work because of their own illness or injury. RUIA does not preempt the Act to the extent it allows these employees to use\n   paid sick leave on days they miss work based on their family members' illnesses or based on reasons related to domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This resolves ECF Nos. 49, 51, 53.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    The three MESTL provisions covered by the First Circuit's remand for further preemption and severance analyses, are virtually identical to the California Act provisions at issue here.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 149, \u00a7 148C(c)(1) (paid leave to \"care for the employee's child, spouse, parent, or parent of a spouse, who is suffering from a physical or mental illness, injury, or medical condition that requires home care, professional medical diagnosis or care, or preventative medical care\"); (c)(3) (paid leave to \"attend the employee's routine medical appointment or a routine medical appointment for the employee's child, spouse, parent, or parent of spouse\"); (c)(4) (paid leave to \"address the psychological, physical or legal effects of domestic violence....\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Railroad Retirement Board regulations confirm that RUIA sickness benefits attach only when an absence is because of an employee's own condition or a family member's needs related to sickness.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20335.1\">\n     20 CFR \u00a7 335.1\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) and (c). For example, the RRB's explanatory booklet on \"Railroad Unemployment and Sickness Benefits\" states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n    To be eligible for sickness benefits, you must be unable to work because of illness or injury. A 'day of sickness' is a day on which you meet this condition and for which you did not receive any pay and have filed an application for sickness benefits and a statement of sickness signed by your doctor or other authorized individual. This statement provides evidence of your medical condition and its expected duration.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Ex.
