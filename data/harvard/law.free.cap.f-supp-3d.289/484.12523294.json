FORREST, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is one of a number of cases concerning residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts created in the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2007. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. (\"Deutsche Bank\" or \"plaintiff\"), in its capacity as Trustee for the Morgan Stanley Structured Trust I 2007-1 (\"MSST 2007-1\" or the \"Trust\"), commenced this action against Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Morgan Stanley\" or \"defendant\") on April 28, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 2.) Plaintiff alleges, in relevant part, that defendant damaged the Trust by: (1) transferring a substantial number of materially breaching loans into the Trust; and (2) failing to notify the Trustee of those breaches as required. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-111.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the Court is defendant's motion for summary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 (\" Rule 56\"). (ECF No. 111.) Plaintiff opposed that motion on June 22, 2017 (ECF No. 120), and defendant replied on July 24, 2017 (ECF No. 124). This action was originally assigned to Judge Laura Taylor Swain, but was transferred to the undersigned for all purposes on September 11, 2017. On December 19, 2017, the Court requested additional briefing regarding Morgan Stanley's earlier-filed motion to dismiss (ECF No. 138); it received the parties' respective submissions on January 8, 2018 (ECF Nos. 139 and 140).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In resolving the present motion, this Court is not charting new territory-many if not all of Morgan Stanley's arguments have been considered and decided by other courts in this circuit and elsewhere. For the reasons stated below, this Court concludes that there are triable issues of fact, and therefore DENIES defendant's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the parties' respective submissions under Local Civ. R. 56.1 as well as documents submitted in connection with the pending motion for summary judgment. The facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The MSST 2007-1 Securitization\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2007, Morgan Stanley sponsored the creation of Morgan Stanley Structured Trust I 2007-1 (\"MSST 2007-1\" or the \"Trust\"), a residential mortgage-backed securitization trust originally containing 4,374 individual mortgage loans (the \"Mortgage Loans\"). (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Local Civ. R. 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts and Statement of Additional Facts (\"Pl.'s 56.1 Resp.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 8, ECF No. 121.) Although MSST 2007-1 is the only trust at issue here, similar trusts created in the lead-up to the 2007 financial crisis (including others sponsored by Morgan Stanley) have spurred extensive litigation in this circuit and across the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As sponsor of the MSST 2007-1 securitization, Morgan Stanley acquired the underlying Mortgage Loans from third-party originators (the \"Originators\"), and then pooled and conveyed them to the Trust through a series of transactions described\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-6.) Although Morgan Stanley acquired, pooled, transferred, and made certain representations and warranties concerning the Mortgage Loans, it did not originate any of the Mortgage Loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Mortgage Loans, once transferred to MSST 2007-1, effectively served as collateral for resulting financial instruments known as residential mortgage-backed securities (\"RMBS\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) Those securities (or \"certificates\") were sold to investors (or \"certificateholders\") in exchange for the right to receive future principal and interest payments as borrowers repaid their loans to the Trust. Deutsche Bank, the plaintiff herein, was party to the agreement that created the Trust, and serves as Trustee of MSST 2007-1. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Governing Agreements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Like most RMBS trusts, MSST 2007-1 was created pursuant to a coordinated series of transactions involving multiple financial entities. Two of those transactions are of primary relevance here: (1) the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement by which Morgan Stanley (and an associated entity) sold certain mortgage loans to a depositor; and (2) the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by which the depositor transferred all right, title, and interest in those mortgage loans to the Trust in exchange for certificates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1. The Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By agreement dated May 1, 2007, Morgan Stanley sold an initial pool of mortgage loans to EMC Mortgage Corporation (\"EMC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., Inc. (\"Bear Stearns\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Morgan Stanley and EMC then sold that pool, along with other mortgage loans, to Bear Stearns Asset Backed Securities I LLC (\"BSABS\") pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (\"MLPA\") dated July 6, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) The MLPA explicitly anticipated that BSABS would concurrently \"deposit the Mortgage Loans into a trust fund ... and create [MSST 2007-1] ... under a pooling and servicing agreement, to be dated as of June 1, 2007.\" (Decl. of Brian S. Weinstein (\"Weinstein Decl.\") Ex. F (\"MLPA\") at 1, ECF No. 114-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As relevant here, the MLPA contains a number of representations and warranties (\"R&amp;Ws\") that Morgan Stanley made regarding the included loans. Although the parties disagree about the meaning, scope, and application of certain R&amp;Ws, the language itself is certain and undisputed. Below is a brief summary of the R&amp;Ws most relevant to the current motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 First, in \u00a7 10(a), Morgan Stanley made three R&amp;Ws \"[w]ith respect to each Mortgage Loan\" included in the MLPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(a) at 12-13.) Specifically, Morgan Stanley represented and warranted that: (1) the information set forth in the attached \"Mortgage Loan Schedule\" was \"complete, true and correct as of the Cut-off Date\"; (2) it had complied with \"[a]ny and all requirements of any federal, state or local law\" applicable to the loan; and (3) no Mortgage Loan was a \"High Cost Loan\" or \"Covered Loan,\" as those terms were defined in the MLPA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Second, in \u00a7 10(b), Morgan Stanley made twenty-four additional R&amp;Ws with respect to \"MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans,\" defined to include all loans originated by one of eight originators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(b) at 13-17.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Of note, Morgan Stanley represented and warranted that: (1) \"[n]o fraud, error, omission, misrepresentation, negligence or similar occurrence ... has taken place on the part of MSMCH, or, to the knowledge of MSMCH ... or any other party involved in the origination of the [loan]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(b)(5) at 14); (2) each mortgage file contains a property appraisal that satisfies certain regulatory requirements (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(b)(20) at 17); and (3) \"[n]o MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loan has an LTV greater than 100%\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(b)(21) at 17).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The MLPA also contains a \"Repurchase Protocol\" that sets out a procedure for addressing potential breaches of the various R&amp;Ws:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Upon discovery or receipt of notice by MSMCH or the Purchaser of a breach of any representation or warranty of MSMCH set forth in this Section 10 which materially and adversely affects the value of the interests of the Purchaser in any of the MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans ... the party discovering or receiving notice of such breach shall give prompt written notice to the others. In the case of any such breach ... within 90 days from the date of discovery by MSMCH, or the date MSMCH is notified ... of such breach ... MSMCH will, (i) cure such breach in all material respects, (ii) purchase the affected Mortgage Loan at the applicable Purchase Price or (iii) if within two years of the Closing Date, substitute a qualifying Replacement Mortgage Loan in exchange for such MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10 at 18.) Although loans originated by Accredited Home Lenders, Inc. (\"Accredited\") are not \"MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans,\" Morgan Stanley further agreed to \"cure, substitute or repurchase\" any Accredited-originated loan that breached \"a representation or warranty set forth in this Section 10 made by Accredited with respect to an Accredited Mortgage loan\" in the event Accredited failed to do so (the \"Backstop Provision\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, the MLPA includes the following \"Sole Remedy Provision\" (or \"SRP\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [t]he obligations of MSMCH to cure, purchase or substitute a qualifying Replacement Mortgage Loan shall constitute the Purchaser's, the Trustee's and the Certificateholder's\n   <em>\n    sole and exclusive remedy\n   </em>\n   under this Agreement or otherwise respecting a breach of representations or warranties hereunder with respect to the MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   2. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Concurrently with execution of the MLPA (and as specifically contemplated by that agreement), BSABS transferred\n   \"all right, title and interest\" in the Mortgage Loans to the Trust pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement (\"PSA\") dated June 1, 2017, thereby creating MSST 2007-1. (Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6.) Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\"Wells Fargo\") were parties to the PSA as \"Trustee\" and \"Master Servicer and Securities Administrator,\" respectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) The transaction closed on July 6, 2007. (Weinstein Decl. Ex. B (\"PSA\") at \u00a7 1.01, ECF No. 114-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Pre-Litigation History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1. Accredited's Bankruptcy Proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In 2009, Accredited-the originator of certain loans included in MSST 2007-1-filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Voluntary Pet. (Chapter 11),\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-BK-11516 (Bankr. D. Del. May 1, 2009), ECF No. 1. Deutsche Bank, in its capacity as Trustee\n   <em>\n    for any trust\n   </em>\n   \"which hold[s] mortgage loans originated or sold by [Accredited]\" and on behalf of \"itself, the Trusts, and the owners of certain [RMBS] issued by the Trusts,\" filed a proof of claim in those proceedings on October 6, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weinstein Decl. Ex. JJ (\"DB Claim\") \u00a7 1 at 1, ECF No. 114-42.) The DB Claim explicitly referred to Accredited's obligation to cure or repurchase materially breaching loans, and \"assert[ed] a contingent, unliquidated claim against [Accredited] for indemnification for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , all losses, claims, expenses and damages ... arising out of or based upon any [such] breaches.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On November 27, 2009, the bankruptcy court approved a stipulation that ostensibly resolved the DB Claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order,\n   <em>\n    In Re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-BK-11516 (Bankr. D. Del. Nov. 27, 2009), ECF No. 3103. In exchange for a \"non-priority general unsecured claim in the amount of $2,995,283.82,\" Deutsche Bank agreed to the following release:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ... DB, solely in its capacity as Trustee for each of the\n   <em>\n    applicable trusts\n   </em>\n   , fully and forever releases, surrenders, gives up and discharges the Debtors, the Trustee, the Plan Administrator, the Trust Advisory Board and each of their respective professionals and advisors (collectively, the \"Released Parties\") from any and all claims ... whether now known or hereinafter known, that DB ever had, may have had or may have against the Released Parties solely with respect to the DB Claim[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Weinstein Decl. Ex. LL (\"Accredited Release\") \u00a7\u00a7 2-3 at 7-8, ECF No. 114-44 (emphasis added).) Although the term \"applicable trusts\" is not explicitly defined, the stipulation does include a clause stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   This Stipulation is inapplicable and has no effect on any other trusts upon which DB serves as trustee but is not specifically referenced on the attached Exhibit A and the Parties reserve all of their respective rights, claims, defenses, setoffs, or otherwise with respect to such other trusts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12 at 10.) Furthermore, the stipulation provided that the claim amount would be \"allocated to the securitization trusts ... set forth on the chart attached hereto as Exhibit A.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2 at 7.) MSST 2007-1 is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   referenced in the attached Exhibit A to the stipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   2. The Morgan Stanley Demand\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On April 2, 2013, two MSST 2007-1 certificateholders sent a letter (the \"Breach Letter\") to Deutsche Bank as Trustee, asserting that they had discovered \"material and adverse breaches of representations and warranties by Morgan Stanley\" in 1,620 individual loans. (Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.) The Breach Letter requested that Deutsche Bank make a formal written\n   demand on Morgan Stanley to \"cure the breaches or repurchase the mortgage loans affected thereby within the time frame set out in the MLPA,\" and explicitly stated that \"this repurchase request reflects only current findings.\" (Weinstein Decl. Ex. S, ECF No. 114-23.) The certificateholders further \"reserve[d] the right to give notice of additional breaches relating to any mortgage loans held by the Trust.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On April 4, 2013, Deutsche Bank forwarded the Breach Letter to Morgan Stanley, and formally requested that Morgan Stanley \"cure any material breaches ... or repurchase such Mortgage Loans\" within the timeframe specified in the Repurchase Protocol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Morgan Stanley formally responded to the Breach Letter on July 3, 2013. (Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 63.) While stating that the \"allegations in the [Breach Letter] [were] insufficient\" to establish breaches of the relevant R&amp;Ws, Morgan Stanley agreed to repurchase 149 of the 1,620 identified loans \"as a business accommodation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Weinstein Decl. Ex. T at 3, ECF No. 114-24.) Morgan Stanley refused to cure or repurchase any of the remaining loans identified in the Breach Letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   3. The Accredited Demand\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On April 3, 2013, the same certificateholders who sent the Breach Letter sent a second letter (the \"Accredited Letter\") to Deutsche Bank asserting that they had discovered \"material and adverse breaches of representations and warranties\" by Accredited. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. 4, ECF No. 2-6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 61.) Similar to the Breach Letter, the Accredited Letter explicitly states that \"[r]e-underwriting loan files continues and will likely uncover additional breaches.\" (Compl. Ex. 4 at 7.) Accredited's bankruptcy counsel responded directly to the certificateholders on April 8, 2013, asserting Accredited had been liquidated in 2011 and that Deutsche Bank had filed proofs of claims (and received distributions) in Accredited's 2009 bankruptcy proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9; Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Litigation History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In its capacity as Trustee, Deutsche Bank commenced this action against Morgan Stanley on April 28, 2014. It brought a total of four claims relating to the MSST 2007-1 securitization, namely that Morgan Stanley breached its contractual obligations by: (1) transferring a large number of defective loans to the Trust (the \"R&amp;W Claim\"); (2) refusing to cure or repurchase the defective loans (the \"Cure Claim\"); and (3) failing to provide notice of the breaches as required by the governing agreements (the \"Notice Claim\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-106.) The Complaint further alleged that Morgan Stanley's conduct breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (the \"Covenant Claim\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107-111.) As a remedy, the Complaint sought an order of specific performance of Morgan Stanley's cure or repurchase obligation, as well as \"compensatory, consequential, and/or recissory damages ... in an amount to be proven at trial.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Morgan Stanley moved to dismiss the complaint on July 21, 2014. (ECF No. 18.) On April 3, 2015, Judge Swain issued a Memorandum Opinion &amp; Order dismissing the Cure, Notice, and Covenant Claims, reasoning \"the notice/cure/repurchase protocol is remedial and cannot constitute a basis for an independent breach,\" and that \"New York law ... does not recognize a separate cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when a breach of contract claim, based upon the same facts, is also pled.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (ECF No. 47 at 13, 15 (internal citations omitted).) Judge Swain denied Morgan Stanley's motion to dismiss the R&amp;W Claim, and reserved decision on whether the SRP (the sole remedy provision) precluded Deutsche Bank's prayer for damages (as opposed to specific performance). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   While Morgan Stanley's motion to dismiss was pending, on September 18, 2014, Deutsche Bank filed a motion requesting the right to use statistical sampling to prove liability and damages at trial. (ECF No. 26.) Morgan Stanley opposed that motion, arguing that statistical sampling is incompatible with the SRP, which requires loan-by-loan proof of breach. (ECF No. 27.) Judge Swain addressed this issue during conferences held on September 19, 2014 (ECF No. 35) and May 20, 2015 (ECF No. 54), and determined that Deutsche Bank's request for a formal ruling on sampling was \"premature.\" That said, Judge Swain did direct the parties to \"take a sampling approach to the litigation\" pending resolution of certain key legal issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Initial Pretrial Conf. (\"IPTC Tr.\") at 4, ECF No. 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Following an extended discovery period (which included full expert briefing based on statistical sampling), Morgan Stanley moved for summary judgment on May 8, 2017. (ECF No. 111.) Morgan Stanley's motion argues, in sum, that: (1) the SRP requires loan-by-loan notice and evidence of breach, and therefore precludes the use of sampling to prove liability and/or damages; (2) Deutsche Bank did not comply with the terms of the Repurchase Protocol prior to or during this litigation; (3) Deutsche Bank misinterpreted various R&amp;Ws; (4) Deutsche Bank's expert reports failed to create a genuine dispute as to materiality of alleged breaches; and (5) Morgan Stanley is not liable for MSST 2007-1 loans originated by Accredited, Fremont, or WMC. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mem. of Law in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ J. (\"Def.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 112.) Deutsche Bank opposed Morgan Stanley's motion on June 22, 2017, arguing that the SRP does not preclude an award of damages or the use of sampling, that it properly interpreted the relevant R&amp;Ws, and that Morgan Stanley is ultimately liable for all breaching loans included in the Trust. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 120.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the reasons stated below, this Court concludes that Deutsche Bank's breach of contract claims must proceed to trial, and that statistical sampling is an appropriate means of attempting to prove both liability and damages in this case. This Court further concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact that prevent entry of summary judgment as to all remaining issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   II.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Morgan Stanley's motion raises a number of complex and overlapping legal arguments. That said, the arguments are not novel-most, if not all, have previously (and repeatedly) been raised in RMBS actions like this one. As such, multiple courts have had occasion to pass (explicitly or implicitly) upon the issues raised herein, resulting in a large and growing body of law that this Court must grapple with. Unsurprisingly, given the fact-intensive nature of some issues and the lack of controlling precedent on others, that body of law contains disagreements large and small. It is impossible (and unnecessary) to reconcile every case, and reasonable minds can certainly differ on what the law should be for cases like this. But for the reasons stated below, this Court is persuaded that summary judgment is inappropriate, and that plaintiff's claims must proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Sole Remedy Provision is Voidable\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The force and effect of the Sole Remedy Provision looms large in this action. It is the primary focus of the parties' respective briefs, and has the potential to affect multiple key areas of dispute. According to Morgan Stanley, plaintiff's failure to comply with the strictures of the SRP both before and during this litigation doom its claims for relief. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 9-23.) Plaintiff counters\n   that the SRP is voidable given its allegations of gross negligence, and that in all events, the SRP does not foreclose recovery of damages. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 13-21.) The Court agrees with plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Although courts routinely enforce arms-length clauses that limit or exculpate a party from damages caused by\n   <em>\n    negligent\n   </em>\n   conduct, as discussed above, it is well-established that as a matter of public policy, \"a party may not insulate itself from damages caused by\n   <em>\n    grossly negligent\n   </em>\n   conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Sommer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4423891\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/79/540/#p554\">\n    79 N.Y.2d at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=583%20N.Y.S.2d%20957\">\n    583 N.Y.S.2d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=593%20N.E.2d%201365\">\n    593 N.E.2d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

(Pl.'s Mem. at 1.) Deutsche Bank points to a series of documents, e-mails, and deposition statements that it claims establish that,\n   <em>\n    at the time it entered into\n   </em>\n   the MLPA, Morgan Stanley knew a critical number of the MSST 2007-1 loans contained material breaches. (Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 129-149, 154-161.) Morgan Stanley disputes the context and significance those documents (Def.'s Local Civ. R. 56.1 Reply Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Def.'s 56.1 Reply\") \u00b6\u00b6 129-149, 154-161, ECF No. 125), and argues that Deutsche Bank has \"grossly mischaracterize[d] the evidence in this case.\" (Def.'s Mem. of Law in Further Supp. of Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Reply Mem.\") at 5, ECF No. 124.) It is axiomatic that on summary judgment, the Court's task is to determine whether there exists a genuine dispute of material fact, not to weigh the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    477 U.S. at 248-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p248\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, it is clear that there is a genuine dispute as to whether Morgan Stanley knowingly transferred materially breaching loans into MSST 2007-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Morgan Stanley next argues that, even assuming it did intentionally transfer breaching loans into the Trust \"based on its own economic self-interest,\" that does not constitute gross negligence absent \"evidence of malicious intent.\" (Def.'s Reply Mem. at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13-15.)

Those types of cases, in which a party enters into a contract in good faith and later determines that it is economically\n   imprudent to perform as required, are easily distinguished from cases where, as here, a party is alleged to have been in breach-pervasively so-\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   ; that is, at the time the contract was entered into.

Here, Deutsche Bank has asserted and proffered evidence in support that up to 93% of the loans in MSST 2007-1 contain material breaches (a vast number of which are asserted to have existed\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   ), but Morgan Stanley has only repurchased a grand total of 149 \"as a business accommodation.\" Regardless of whether such conduct (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , non-performance) is now in Morgan Stanley's economic self-interest-and notably, Morgan Stanley has argued at certain points that the conduct alleged here would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be in its self-interest-plaintiff's allegations regarding the circumstances in existence at the time of contract formation, if proven, could well constitute gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The ruling that Morgan Stanley seeks on this issue would limit the public policy exception from\n   <em>\n    Kalisch-Jarcho\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sommer\n   </em>\n   to a very narrow set of cases-those where the breaching party acts primarily to hurt its counterpart, rather than to help itself.

Although\n   <em>\n    Sommer\n   </em>\n   is a leading case, it does not purport to exhaustively list the types of clauses that are ineffective as against gross negligence. And the underlying logic-that courts should not sanction or enforce contractual clauses that shield a party from\n   the consequences of their grossly negligent behavior-applies equally to clauses that exonerate a party and those that establish practical barriers to recovery.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    13ARX\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12167894\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/143/1/#p7\">\n    143 A.D.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the gross negligence exception applies to clause that limit a party to \"remedies that are illusory\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   As noted in\n   <em>\n    ACE\n   </em>\n   , \"numerous courts have held or assumed that less dramatic limitations on remedies, such as caps on damages\n   <em>\n    or restrictions on the types of damages available\n   </em>\n   , can also be void where gross negligence or willful misconduct is shown.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143355\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/5/543/#p555\">\n    5 F.Supp.3d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (collecting cases).

Deutsche Bank is quite correct to point out that in previous cases where loan-by-loan analysis and proof was required, the process proved to be extraordinary and, measured against various benchmarks, impractical. (Pl.'s Mem. at 15-16.) For instance, in\n   <em>\n    MARM II\n   </em>\n   , the court held that language in the applicable repurchase protocol required loan-by-loan proof of materiality.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20764665\">\n    2015 WL 764665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. Following a bench trial in which only 20 out of 9,342 loans at issue (or approximately 0.0021%) were fully analyzed, the court concluded that \"the sheer volume of loans, several thousand for which findings and conclusions are necessary\" necessitated the appointment of a series of masters under Fed. R. Civ. P. 53(a)(1)(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank, Nat'l Ass'n v. UBS Real Estate Sec.

(See No. 12-cv-7322, ECF No. 545, \"Report and Recommendation\".) That review process will be ongoing for the foreseeable future, and the final cost, both in terms of time and resources expended, will be extraordinary. To the extent the Repurchase Protocol here demands such a procedure, the Court concludes that it is demonstrably impracticable, and will permit an award of damages in lieu of specific performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2241613\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/1/439/#p443\">\n    1 N.Y.2d at 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20N.Y.S.2d%2010\">\n    154 N.Y.S.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=136%20N.E.2d%20484\">\n    136 N.E.2d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Second, allowing for an alternative award of damages is consistent with broader principles of equity. Deutsche Bank has alleged that Morgan Stanley not only knowingly and intentionally transferred thousands of breaching loans into the Trust, but also violated the Repurchase Protocol by failing to notify Deutsche Bank and subsequently failing to cure/repurchase the defective loans. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.) And the primary relief that Deutsche Bank is seeking-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the \"Purchase Price\" of materially nonconforming loans-is completely fungible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of the allegations and the relief sought, \"whether the Trustee's remedy is characterized as 'compensatory damages,' 'rescissory damages,' or 'specific performance' ... has little practical significance given that the form of the relief (if not necessarily the quantum) is the same in each case: the payment of money to make Plaintiff whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Alt-A\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831771\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/958/488/\">\n    958 F.Supp.2d at 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As noted above, there is an economic reality to re-underwriting thousands of\n   loans, and an impracticability to timely review of such a massive number. Given that the ultimate form of relief-a payment of money-is the same whether the Court orders specific performance or allows an alternative award of damages, this Court is persuaded that it would be inequitable to require specific performance even in light of the SRP. After all, specific performance is an\n   <em>\n    equitable\n   </em>\n   remedy for breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACE\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143355\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/5/543/#p555\">\n    5 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   554 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warberg Opportunistic Trading Fund\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751794\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/112/78/#p86\">\n    112 A.D.3d at 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751794\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/112/78/#p86\">\n    973 N.Y.S.2d 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And there's nothing equitable about a remedy, contractually \"required\" or otherwise, that dramatically increases the cost and burdens of litigation and frustrates timely resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Morgan Stanley may argue that the form of recovery is not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   the same, since the Repurchase Protocol initially permitted Morgan Stanley to remedy the breach by substituting a new loan. (MLPA \u00a7 10 at 18.) In light of plaintiff's assertions and proffered proof, that argument is unavailing for at least three reasons. First, Morgan Stanley concedes that the substitution remedy expired two years after the Trust was created. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 9.) As such, that particular remedy is no longer available, and Morgan Stanley's only option is to cure or repurchase breaching loans. Second, if Morgan Stanley were permitted to replace up to 93% of the loan pool, even within that two-year window, the Trust would be unrecognizable. It strikes the Court as deeply inequitable to effectively force Deutsche Bank to enter into an entirely new contractual relationship with Morgan Stanley, particularly given the allegations of intent and bad faith. Third, the MLPA only gives Morgan Stanley \"90 days from the date of discovery\" to cure/repurchase any materially breaching loan. (MLPA \u00a7 10 at 18.) If Morgan Stanley knew about the material breaches when the Trust was created, \"the 90-day cure period has long since expired,\" and therefore awarding damages would not \"deprive [defendant] of its side of the contractual repurchase bargain.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flagstar II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324594\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/920/475/#p512\">\n    920 F.Supp.2d at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The reality is that the Repurchase Protocol was not designed or intended to remedy a breach of the nature or magnitude alleged here.

A repurchase protocol theoretically provides security for certificateholders by giving the sponsor a means of maintaining the integrity of the trust and remedying the types of isolated breaches that might be expected to pop up in the loan pool over time. But as plaintiff asserts and has proffered evidence in support, if Morgan Stanley knew that it was transferring thousands of defective loans into the Trust at the time of contract formation, then the Trust was doomed to breach and the Repurchase Protocol doomed to impracticability. If Deutsche Bank can prove its allegations, it would be inequitable to give Morgan Stanley the benefit of such a limitation clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In any event, Deutsche Bank can certainly seek damages (if there are any) for breach of the MLPA's notice provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nomura Home Equity I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363796\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/133/96/#p105\">\n    133 A.D.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the motions court had \"erred in not allowing plaintiff to pursue damages for defendant's failure to give prompt written notice after it discovered material breaches of the representations and warranties\").

As set forth above, the Court has already concluded that the SRP is voidable, and further that it would be impracticable and inequitable to limit Deutsche Bank's recovery to specific performance of the Repurchase Protocol. Thus, the Court need not directly tackle the issue of whether, under different circumstances in which the SRP is not voidable, sampling may not be appropriate. Here, Deutsche Bank is permitted to seek damages on both the R&amp;W and Notice Claims, and statistical sampling is an entirely appropriate method of attempting to prove both liability and damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   That said, the Court wishes to make two broader points regarding statistical sampling and the claims at issue here. First, the Court is persuaded that statistical sampling is consistent with Deutsche Bank's obligations under the Repurchase Protocol, even if one credits Morgan Stanley's interpretation. After all, the entire purpose of statistical sampling is to determine \"the proportion of the individual members in the pool exhibiting any given characteristic\" \"despite the unique characteristics of the individual members populating the underlying pool.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flagstar II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324594\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/920/475/#p512\">\n    920 F.Supp.2d at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, proper statistical sampling is not a shot in the dark-it is a well-established and scientifically sound method of inferring (to varying degrees of certainty) how many\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   loans in the pool contain material breaches. Here, the Repurchase Protocol is triggered upon discovery or notice \"of a breach of any representation or warranty ... which materially and adversely affects the value of ...\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans.\" (MLPA \u00a7 10 at 18 (emphasis added).) A statistically significant sample demonstrating that 93% (or any other percentage) of the underlying loans contain material breaches undoubtedly satisfies that requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Even if the Court were to agree with Morgan Stanley that the Repurchase Protocol requires loan-by-loan proof and that statistical sampling is an improper method of proof, it would still not grant summary judgment in favor of Morgan Stanley. During an initial pretrial conference in this case, Judge Swain directed the parties to \"take a sampling approach to the litigation\" pending resolution of certain issues addressed herein. (IPTC Tr. at 4.) Judge Swain further stated that in the event she ultimately determined that loan-by-loan proof was required (as opposed to statistical sampling), the loans included in the sample would be \"the\n   <em>\n    first tranche\n   </em>\n   of loans to be subject to prove up on a loan by loan basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).) The obvious implication is that Deutsche Bank would be permitted to go back and begin re-underwriting disputed loans that were not included in the initial sample. Given Judge Swain's directives, it would be a bait-and-switch to turn around and grant summary judgment on non-sample loans now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Morgan Stanley Had Adequate Notice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Under the MLPA, Morgan Stanley's cure or repurchase obligation is triggered \"[u]pon discovery or receipt of notice by MSMCH or the Purchaser of a [material] breach of any representation or warranty ... in any of the MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans.\" (MLPA \u00a7 10 at 18.) Morgan Stanley argues that because (1) \"\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   notice or discovery of material breaches in particular loans\" is required, (2) it lacked the requisite notice for loans not specifically identified in the Breach Letter or Complaint, and therefore (3) had no obligation to cure or repurchase such loans. (Def.'s Mem. at 16, 18-19 (emphasis in original).) This Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   First, the contract does not plainly and unequivocally require loan-by-loan notice or discovery. Morgan Stanley's primary argument is that the context and structure of the Repurchase Protocol, which discusses \"such breach\" and \"the affected Mortgage Loan,\" is \"inherently loan specific.\" (Def.'s Mem. at 16.) But that argument conflates the notice that is required to trigger the Repurchase Protocol with what is required of Morgan Stanley to fulfill its cure/repurchase obligation. Ultimately, Morgan Stanley is correct that individual loans can only be substituted or repurchased on a loan-by-loan basis. Yet the contract does not explicitly require that the party providing notice specifically identify or offer proof as to each and every loan subject to cure/repurchase, let alone that they do so in order to satisfy the threshold notice requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The only language in the MLPA regarding adequacy of notice states that it must relate to a \"breach of any representation or warranty ... which materially and adversely affects the value of the interests of the Purchaser in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans.\" (MLPA \u00a7 10 at 18 (emphasis added).) Notably absent is any requirement that the notifying party provide \"actual\" or \"loan-by-loan\" notice of breach in particular loans. Notice of a pervasive breach within a representative sample\n   of loans undoubtedly provides\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   notice, and the MLPA is completely silent as to whether such notice is effective only as to the identified loans, or whether it triggers a broader obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Flagstar I\n   </em>\n   , the court held that notice of \"pervasive breaches\" affecting a group of loans \"rendered [defendant] constructively aware-or, at a minimum, put [defendant] on inquiry notice-of the substantial likelihood that these breaches extended ... into the broader loan portfolio,\" thereby triggering the repurchase protocol as to all potentially breaching loans.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205335566\">\n    2011 WL 5335566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Flagstar II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324594\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/920/475/#p512\">\n    920 F.Supp.2d at 512-513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same); Deutsche\n   <em>\n    Alt-A\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831771\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/958/488/\">\n    958 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   497 n.3 ;\n   <em>\n    Nomura Home Equity I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363796\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/133/96/#p105\">\n    133 A.D.3d at 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that initial breach notices \"put defendant on notice that the certificateholders whom plaintiffs (as trustees) represented were investigating the mortgage loans and might uncover additional defective loans for which claims could be made.\"). That is exactly what happened here. The Breach Letter specifically identified 1,620 loans, which amounted to more than\n   <em>\n    one-third\n   </em>\n   of the underlying loan pool. (Weinstein Decl. Ex. S.) Deutsche Bank made clear that the Letter \"reflect[ed] only current findings,\" and expressly \"reserve[d] the right to give notice of additional breaches.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Similarly, although the complaint only specifically identifies 1,620 allegedly defective loans, it plainly envisions a more extensive breach rate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 3 (alleging that \"nearly 93%\" of the 553 loans selected for forensic review breached Morgan Stanley's R&amp;Ws, and that \"[o]n information and belief, the remainder of the Loans, if reviewed, would exhibit a similar defect rate\").) Based on the notice provided, and given that the MLPA does not contain an explicit \"actual notice\" requirement, this Court concludes that Morgan Stanley was constructively aware (or put on inquiry notice) of pervasive breaches throughout the Trust, thereby triggering the Repurchase Protocol as to all potentially breaching loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, Judge Swain reached a similar conclusion, holding that the Complaint \"sufficiently pleads constructive notice of the additional breaches\" not specifically identified in the Breach Letter. (ECF No. 47 at 7.) Confusingly, Morgan Stanley now argues that Judge Swain's holding related solely to \"notice pleading\" standard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), and not the \"notice\" required under the MLPA. (Def.'s Mem. at 18 (\"There is a critical difference between the 'notice' required for purposes of notice pleading at the motion to dismiss stage, and the 'notice' required under the terms of the contract ....\").) But that argument mischaracterizes both the arguments made to the Court at that time as well as Judge Swain's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   First, if non-identified loans were not properly included in this action, it made no sense for Judge Swain to have spent significant time addressing whether the Complaint provided adequate notice of the fact that Deutsche Bank was seeking relief as to them. In other words, if Judge Swain believed that constructive or inquiry notice was insufficient to satisfy the contractual notice provision, she would have dismissed the non-identified loans regardless of whether they were sufficiently pled or \"noticed\" in the Complaint. Second, Judge Swain specifically considered and discussed the line of cases dealing with the notice required under similar RMBS contracts, and held that \"Plaintiff's letter gave adequate notice with respect to breaching loans beyond the 1,620 specifically mentioned.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47 at 5-6 (discussing\n   <em>\n    Flagstar I\n   </em>\n   and subsequent cases).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The reality is that Morgan Stanley's argument has already been raised and rejected in this very case. And while the\n   Court is well aware that not every court is in agreement on this issue,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    MARM II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20764665\">\n    2015 WL 764665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-11, it happens to agree with Judge Swain's holding for the reasons stated above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The MLPA does not explicitly include an \"actual notice\" standard, and Morgan Stanley reads far too much into the fact that the Repurchase Protocol contains certain singular phrases (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"the affected Mortgage Loan\") in the portion detailing Morgan Stanley's cure/repurchase obligation. This Court concludes that there is no good reason to reverse Judge Swain's prior determination on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Second, and independently, Deutsche Bank has alleged that Morgan Stanley knowingly and intentionally transferred the materially breaching loans into the Trust. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 1; Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 129-149, 154-161.) Because the Repurchase Protocol is triggered by Morgan Stanley's independent discovery of a material breach, that allegation alone precludes summary judgment on all of the loans at issue here. Morgan Stanley's argument that the MLPA requires Deutsche Bank to \"present loan-by-loan evidence that Morgan Stanley actually discovered a material breach\" is unavailing. (Def.'s Mem. at 19.) The import of Deutsche Bank's allegation is that, by virtue of Morgan Stanley's due diligence, it had knowledge of\n   <em>\n    each and every\n   </em>\n   MSST 2007-1 loan that contained a material breach. There is certainly a dispute of material fact as to whether that allegation is true, but it is sufficient to prevent entry of summary judgment on \"notice\" grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Alt-A\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831771\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/958/488/\">\n    958 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   497 (citing\n   <em>\n    Flagstar I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205335566\">\n    2011 WL 5335566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 );\n   <em>\n    ACE\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4143355\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/5/543/#p555\">\n    5 F.Supp.3d at 558-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Morgan Stanley Is Liable For Breaching Accredited Loans\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Putting the above arguments aside, Morgan Stanley argues that Deutsche Bank affirmatively released any claim it might otherwise have had with respect to loans originated by Accredited during Accredited's bankruptcy proceedings in 2009. (Def.'s Mem. at 38-39.) In response, Deutsche Bank argues that the release only pertains to Accredited and other \"Released Parties,\" and that Morgan Stanley is not properly considered a \"guarantor\" or \"surety.\" (Pl.'s Mem. at 39-40.) The Court disagrees with both arguments, but is nonetheless persuaded that the release does not preclude plaintiff's claims in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As an initial matter, it is undisputed that the Accredited Release only explicitly discharged claims against \"the Debtors\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Accredited) and other \"Released Parties\" not including defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Accredited Release \u00a7 3.) However, that alone is not dispositive of whether the release precludes plaintiff's claims in this action. It is well-established that \"a creditor's release of a principal debtor operates to discharge parties, such as guarantors, who are only secondarily liable on a debt.\"\n   <em>\n    Compagnie Financiere de CIC et de L'Union Europeenne v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11572668\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/188/31/#p34\">\n    188 F.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34 (2d Cir. 1999.) Because the Backstop Provision provides that Morgan Stanley will cure/repurchase breaching Accredited loans in the event Accredited fails to do so, Morgan Stanley is effectively a guarantor or surety of Accredited's primary liability as to those loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MLPA \u00a7 10 at 18.) Therefore, it is possible that the Accredited Release, though not directly applicable to Morgan\n   Stanley by its terms, nonetheless precludes the claims in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   That said, the Accredited Release is only relevant to this action to the extent it discharges Accredited's own principal liability for MSST 2007-1 loans. It is true that the DB Claim was brought by Deutsche Bank in its capacity as Trustee for any trust \"which hold[s] mortgage loans originated or sold by [Accredited],\" and that MSST 2007-1 fits that description. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DB Claim \u00a7 1.) But Deutsche Bank only executed the Accredited Release in its capacity as Trustee for\n   <em>\n    specifically named trusts\n   </em>\n   , each of which received an allocation of the claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Accredited Release \u00a7 2-3.) Additionally, the Accredited Release explicitly states that it is \"inapplicable and has no effect on any other trusts upon which DB serves as trustee but is not specifically referenced on the attached Exhibit A.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12.) As to such non-referenced trusts, \"the Parties reserve all of their respective rights, claims, defenses, setoffs, or otherwise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   MSST 2007-1 is not \"specifically referenced on the attached Exhibit A.\" Therefore, it could not be clearer that the Accredited Release does not discharge Accredited's principal liability with respect to that trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though the DB Claim itself appears to cover the Accredited-originated loans in MSST 2007-1, the release does not. Therefore, Morgan Stanley remains liable for breaching Accredited loans by virtue of the Backstop Provision in \u00a7 10 of the MLPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Morgan Stanley Is Liable for Breaching Fremont and WMC Loans\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Morgan Stanley additionally argues that it is not liable for any R&amp;Ws made by Fremont Investment &amp; Loan (\"Fremont\") or WMC Mortgage Corp. (\"WMC\") in their independent agreements, and that the MLPA does not obligate it to\n   <em>\n    cure or repurchase\n   </em>\n   any breaching loans originated by those companies. (Def.'s Mem. at 40.) The Court agrees. However, for the reasons stated below, the Court is nonetheless persuaded that Morgan Stanley is liable for certain breaches with respect to the Fremont and WMC loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   As a threshold matter, it is undisputed that Fremont and WMC loans are not \"MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans\" under the terms of the MLPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MLPA \u00a7 1 at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 32.) Therefore, none of the R&amp;Ws in \u00a7 10(b) of the MLPA apply to Fremont or WMC loans. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley did not guarantee any of Fremont or WMC's independent R&amp;Ws, and did not agree to cure/repurchase Fremont and/or WMC loans in the event those originators failed to do so. As such, breaching Fremont and WMC loans are not subject to cure/repurchase under the MLPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MLPA \u00a7 10 at 18 (stating that the Repurchase Protocol is triggered upon notice/discovery of a material breach \"which materially and adversely affects the value of the interests of the Purchaser in any of the MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans,\" and that Morgan Stanley may substitute a qualifying loan for \"such MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loan\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   However, \u00a7 10(a) of the MLPA contains three R&amp;Ws that are applicable to \"\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   Mortgage Loan\" in the MSST 2007-1 pool. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(a) at 12-13.) Of particular relevance, Morgan Stanley warranted that \"[t]he information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule relating to the Mortgage Loans is complete, true and correct as of the Cut-off Date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(a)(1) at 12.) To the extent Fremont and WMC-originated loans breach that R&amp;W, Morgan Stanley may be liable for ordinary breach of contract damages in amount to be proven at trial. Put simply, it makes no difference whether the Fremont and WMC loans are subject to cure/repurchase under \u00a7 10 or any other provision-a breach is a breach, and given that the Court has already held that plaintiff may seek damages as to loans that\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   subject to cure/repurchase, it could not be clearer that plaintiff may seek damages as to those that aren't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank Has Correctly Construed the Relevant R&amp;Ws\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   There is a dispute regarding the proper interpretation of the primary R&amp;Ws at issue in this action. Morgan Stanley argues that \"Deutsche Bank [has] misconstrue[d] and misapplie[d]\" the relevant R&amp;Ws in an effort to enlarge the protection they provide, and that it is entitled to summary judgment as a result. (Def.'s Mem. at 30-37.) The Court will address each disputed R&amp;W in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   1. \u00a7 10(a)(1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Section 10(a)(1) of the MLPA (the \"MLS Representation\"), which applies to \"each Mortgage Loan\" in the Trust, relates to the information contained in the Mortgage Loan Schedule\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"MLS\") attached thereto. (MLPA \u00a7 10(a)(1) at 12.) Specifically, the MLS Representation states that \"[t]he information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule relating to the Mortgage Loan is complete, true and correct as of the Cut-off Date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   According to Morgan Stanley, the MLS Representation only guarantees that the information in the MLS was correctly\n   <em>\n    transcribed\n   </em>\n   from the underlying loan files. (Def.'s Mem. at 34-35.) In response, Deutsche Bank argues that the MLS Representation affirmatively guarantees that the information in the MLS is\n   <em>\n    actually correct\n   </em>\n   , regardless of what is included in the underlying loan file. (Pl.'s Mem. at 36-37.) Like the majority of courts to have considered this exact issue, this Court agrees with Deutsche Bank's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    MARM IV\n   </em>\n   , Judge Castel held that nearly identical language in an RMBS agreement was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   merely a \"transcription rep,\" but rather \"an unqualified warranty\" that \"expressly warrants the truth and correctness of information 'furnished' in the MLS\" and \"imposes a form of strict or absolute liability for a materially untrue or incorrect statement on the MLS.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20386\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   428-29 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of N.Y.

That is the correct interpretation of the language here as well. Section 10(a)(1) does not contain any language limiting its scope to accurate transcription of the information contained therein. Rather, it states plainly and unequivocally that the information in the MLS is \"true and correct.\" Defendant's argument that such an\n   interpretation vitiates or renders \u00a7 10(b)(5) superfluous is unconvincing-that section not only covers an entirely different subset of loans, it relates to fraud and misrepresentation on the part of or to the knowledge of Morgan Stanley. To the extent the MLS contains any information that was not \"true and correct\" as of the cut-off date, that would constitute a breach of \u00a7 10(a)(1) regardless of whether it was correctly transcribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Separately, Morgan Stanley argues that \"Mortgage Loan Schedule\" is a \"defined term setting forth an exclusive list of information to be included on the MLS.\" (Def.'s Mem. at 36.) According to Morgan Stanley, because debt-to-income ratio (\"DTI\") is not included in that list, alleged breaches of \u00a7 10(a)(1) premised on an incorrect DTI must be dismissed. In response, Deutsche Bank argues that the listing of required fields in the definition of \"Mortgage Loan Schedule\" is not exclusive, and that Morgan Stanley is liable for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   incorrect information actually included in the MLS under \u00a7 10(a)(1). (Pl.'s Mem. at 37.) The Court agrees with plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Although \"Mortgage Loan Schedule\" is a defined term in both the PSA and MLPA, and although DTI is not included as a required field, nothing in the definition of \"Mortgage Loan Schedule\" states that the listed fields are intended to be or must be exclusive. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , MLPA \u00a7 1 at 3-4.) Further, the MLS Representation applies without qualification to \"[t]he information\n   <em>\n    set forth in\n   </em>\n   the Mortgage Loan Schedule.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10(a)(1) at 12.) Therefore, it is clear that defendant guaranteed the truth and accuracy of all information\n   <em>\n    actually contained\n   </em>\n   in the MLS, regardless of whether such information was required to be in the MLS by definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Based on Deutsche Bank's submissions, it appears that DTI information was included in the MLS.

Accordingly, summary judgment to Morgan Stanley on this issue is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   2. \u00a7 10(b)(5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Section 10(b)(5) of the MLPA, which only applies to MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans, guarantees in relevant part that \"[n]o fraud, error, omission, misrepresentation, negligence or similar occurrence ... has taken place on the part of MSMCH, or, to the knowledge of MSMCH ... or any other party involved in the origination\" of those loans. (MLPA \u00a7 10(b)(5) at 14.) The parties disagree as to whether this R&amp;W covers an originator's knowing noncompliance with applicable underwriting guidelines. The Court is persuaded that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Defendant is correct that \u00a7 10(b)(5) does not explicitly reference underwriting guidelines or guarantee that any of the originators complied with same. But \u00a7 10(b)(5), as written, is very broad-it warrants without qualification that \"[n]o fraud, error, omission, misrepresentation, negligence, or similar occurrence\" has taken place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The question, then, is whether knowing noncompliance with applicable underwriting guidelines falls into any of those categories (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , whether it constitutes \"fraud, error, omission, misrepresentation, negligence, or similar occurrence\" on the part of the originator or any other party). This Court concludes that, at the very least, such conduct may constitute evidence of cognizable \"negligence\" in the origination of the loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   To the extent \"any ... party involved in the origination\" of a MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loan knowingly violated the applicable underwriting guidelines, such conduct could constitute, at the very least, some evidence of a breach of \u00a7 10(b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   3. \u00a7 10(b)(20)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Section 10(b)(20) of the MLPA, which only applies to MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loans, guarantees that each mortgage file \"contains an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property\" that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   satisf[ies] the requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 [\"FIRREA\"] and the regulations promulgated thereunder, all as in effect on the date the MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loan was originated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   (MLPA \u00a7 10(b)(20) at 17.) Morgan Stanley argues, in sum, that while \u00a7 10(b)(20) only requires compliance with\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   Fannie Mae\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   Freddie Mac, plaintiff's expert analysis does not adequately distinguish between the two. (Def.'s Mem. at 37-38.) Deutsche Bank argues that because certain FIRREA regulations are incorporated into both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac requirements, an appraisal that is noncompliant under FIRREA is also noncompliant under both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, making distinction unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (\"USPAP\") were promulgated pursuant to FIRREA, and it is undisputed that \u00a7 10(b)(20) guarantees all appraisals and appraisers complied with USPAP, regardless of their compliance with Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 38 (\"[B]y its plain terms, [\u00a7 10(b)(20) ] only requires compliance with USPAP and 'the requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\") (alterations omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 38.) Therefore, a violation of USPAP is sufficient, standing alone, to breach \u00a7 10(b)(20). It is unnecessary at this stage to resolve the parties' dispute as to the adequacy of plaintiff's expert analysis with regards to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulations-there is certainly a genuine dispute of material fact regarding violation of USPAP, and that is sufficient to preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   4. \u00a7 10(b)(21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Section 10(b)(21) of the MLPA relates to the loan-to-value ratio or \"LTV\" of the applicable loans, warranting that \"[n]o MSMCH Represented Mortgage Loan has an LTV greater than 100%.\" (MLPA \u00a7 10(b)(21) at 17.) Put differently, it guarantees that no individual loan amount (the numerator) exceeds the \"value\" of the corresponding mortgaged property (the denominator). The parties' dispute with regard to this R&amp;W principally concerns the proper means (and therefore, method of proof) of determining the value of a mortgaged property for purposes of proving breach/non-breach. Morgan Stanley argues, in sum, that certain defined terms in the PSA (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"Loan-to-Value Ratio\" and \"Appraised Value\") prevent Deutsche Bank from using anything but the\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   appraised value of a mortgaged property at a defined point in time. (Def.'s Mem. at 36-37.) In response, Deutsche Bank argues that \u00a7 10(b)(21) is a warrant against appraisals that result in LTVs that are without basis, incredible, or otherwise fraudulent. (Pl.'s Mem. at 37-38.) Deutsche Bank has stated that it may use an Automated Valuation Model (\"AVM\") to calculate what it intends to assert is a more accurate appraisal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on its view as to how the PSA and MLPA are interpreted,\n   Morgan Stanley's position is that the ex-post AVM must be precluded. The Court takes no position as to the propriety of plaintiff's particular method of proof at this stage in the litigation, but agrees that such proof is not limited to what may be included with the defined phrase \"Appraised Value\" in the PSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   First, while it is true that both \"Loan-to-Value Ratio\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"Appraised Value\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   are defined terms in the PSA, the three capitalized letters \"LTV\" is not a defined term in either the PSA or the MLPA. And the use of \"LTV\" (versus the defined term \"Loan-to-Value Ratio\") in \u00a7 10(b)(21) appears to be intentional, since both the defined terms \"Loan-to-Value Ratio\" and \"Appraised Value\" are used in separate parts of the MLPA (indeed, \"Appraised Value\" is used in a separate R&amp;W). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MLPA \u00a7 1 at 3 (stating that the Mortgage Loan Schedule should include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the \"Loan-to-Value Ratio at origination\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   MLPA \u00a7 10(b)(4)(iii) at 13-14.) The intentional use of the defined terms in one place in the contract, and avoidance of such usage in another, is persuasive evidence that the parties did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   intend to import any definitional restrictions from the PSA into \u00a7 10(b)(21), which uses neither. As such, any restriction that \"Appraised Value\" places on calculation of \"Loan-to-Value Ratio\" is irrelevant to calculation of \"LTV.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Second, and separately, the PSA makes clear that its definitions apply \"unless the context otherwise requires.\" (PSA \u00a7 1.01 at 9.) Here, even if the Court were to assume (though there is no evidence to suggest this is the case) that the parties' use of \"LTV\" in \u00a7 10(b)(21) was a scrivener's error, it would still not limit plaintiffs to the \"Appraised Value\" in attempting to prove breach. Limiting the calculation of LTV to the \"Appraised Value\" of the loan-an appraisal defined to have been performed\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the MLPA was executed-effectively reduces \u00a7 10(b)(21) to a guarantee of accurate mathematical calculation, regardless of the actual\n   <em>\n    credibility\n   </em>\n   of the appraisals (and thus the credibility of the LTV itself). A \"far more reasonable reading\" of \u00a7 10(b)(21) \"is that, if the LTV based on the\n   <em>\n    actual value\n   </em>\n   of the property is greater than 100%, the representation and warranty is breached.\" (Pl.'s Mem. at 38.) That interpretation provides security to the certificateholders by guaranteeing the\n   <em>\n    accuracy\n   </em>\n   of the appraisals and resulting LTVs, which are of great importance in assessing risk. And it is substantially the same interpretation implicitly adopted by the court in\n   <em>\n    Nomura Holding I\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6837798\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/104/441/#p453\">\n    104 F.Supp.3d at 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Although the Court is persuaded that plaintiffs are not limited to using the \"Appraised Value\" of a mortgaged property in attempting to prove a breach of\n   \u00a7 10(b)(21), it takes no position at this stage as to the propriety of plaintiff's particular \"AVM\" method.

Morgan Stanley raises a series of arguments premised on Deutsche Bank's failure to create a genuine dispute of material fact. Some of these arguments have already been addressed herein, but the following are of particular note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   1. Morgan Stanley's Knowledge/Discovery of Breach\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Morgan Stanley argues at various points that Deutsche Bank has failed to create a genuine dispute as to its alleged independent knowledge/discovery of material breaches in the underlying loan pool. But as previously noted, this Court concludes that Deutsche Bank has proffered sufficient evidence to create a dispute as to whether Morgan Stanley knowingly and intentionally \"conveyed a pool of defective mortgage loans\" to the Trust \"as part of a plan to empty [its] position\" of such loans before the housing market collapsed. (Pl.'s Mem. at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 129-149, 154-161.) As such, and for the reasons previously noted, there is also a genuine dispute as to whether Morgan Stanley acted with \"gross negligence\" under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   2. \"Materiality\" of Breaches\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Morgan Stanley argues that Deutsche Bank has failed to create a genuine dispute as to the\n   <em>\n    materiality\n   </em>\n   of any particular breach, which is required to trigger Morgan Stanley's cure/repurchase obligation under the MLPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 24-25.) According to Morgan Stanley, plaintiff's experts have only provided \"conclusory\" opinions regarding the materiality of specific breaches, and conclusory opinions are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Major League Baseball Properties, Inc. v.

In response, Deutsche Bank argues that its experts provided adequate analysis regarding the materiality of alleged breaches, and that courts should be wary of granting summary judgment when conflicting expert reports are presented. (Pl.'s Mem. at 30-31 (citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins.

The Court is persuaded that plaintiff's expert reports are wholly sufficient to create a genuine dispute as to the materiality of defendant's alleged breaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   It is clear to this Court that the materiality of any particular breach is a question of fact under New York law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orlander v. Staples, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342194\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/289/#p298\">\n    802 F.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (2d Cir. 2015). The Court believes that plaintiff's experts have done enough to create a genuine dispute as to the materiality of the alleged breaches. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at 30-34.)
