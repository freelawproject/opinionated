BATES, United States District Judge\n   Federal law provides a path to the United States for foreign citizens who finance American businesses. To become eligible for a visa, however, an investor must actually\n   <em>\n    invest\n   </em>\n   . That is, she must place her money at risk of loss in hopes of potential gain. The question in this case is whether United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it declared plaintiffs ineligible for visas because their investments came with a \"call option,\" which gave the company in which they invested the choice to buy plaintiffs out. Because the call option at issue here does not provide the investors with any right to repayment, the Court answers this question in the affirmative and grants partial summary judgment to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

AR 4 (Joint Appendix [ECF No. 24] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lucky's was a new commercial enterprise at the time of plaintiffs' investments, and at least one of its six planned grocery stores was to be located in a targeted employment area. AR 25, 33, 36. Lucky's used plaintiffs' investments to fund a loan to Lucky's Farmers Market Resources Center LLC, guaranteed by substantially all of the latter's assets; the Market Resources Center in turn lent most of the money to each of the Lucky's Markets stores to cover construction costs. AR 33. The Market Resources Center managed the stores, while the stores pledged substantially all of their assets as security for the Market Resources Center's repayment of its original loan to Lucky's. AR 33. Thus, Lucky's wholly owns the individual stores, and plaintiffs' investment funded the stores' construction and management.

Instead, full \"management, operation and control of\" Lucky's is \"vested exclusively in the General Partner,\" a company named LFM Stores, LLC. AR 18, 101-02. The general partner can distribute profits to the limited partners \"at such times as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion,\" up to a maximum 1% annual return on their original investments. AR 92, 99-100. The Lucky's Limited Partnership Agreement (\"LPA\") also includes two sections regulating the redemption of plaintiffs' investments. The first provision, Section 3.3, prohibits plaintiffs from exercising a sell option unless they are denied EB-5 eligibility. AR 95 (\"Except in the case where a Limited Partner's EB-5 Immigrant Petition Form I-526 has been denied by USCIS, no Partner shall have the right to withdraw from the\n    Partnership or require that the Partnership purchase all or any portion of such Partner's Interest. No Partner shall have a right to receive a return of its Capital Contributions or a dividend in respect of such Partner's Interest ....\"). The second, Section 3.4, provides the general partner with a call option (also known as a \"buy option\"):\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 3.3, during the following periods, the General Partner may cause a Limited Partner's withdrawal from the Partnership by paying to such Limited Partner its (i) unpaid Preferred Return through the date of withdrawal and (ii) Unrecovered Capital Contribution:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    (a) Prior to such Limited Partner's participation in the Loan through its Investment Contribution; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n    (b) At any time after final adjudication of such Limited Partner's Form I-829, Petition to Remove Conditions, if applicable.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    AR 95. Thus, under the LPA, the general partner can buy out a limited partner either before her investment is used to provide the loan to the Market Resources Center or after she becomes a lawful permanent resident, but not in between.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Plaintiffs each filed a Form I-526 petition between December 2013 and September 2014 based on their Lucky's investments. Compl. [ECF No. 1] \u00b6 38. USCIS issued each plaintiff a Request for Evidence in late July or August 2015, asking plaintiffs to provide more documentation to prove that Lucky's would create at least ten new jobs per applicant.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n     \u00b6 40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; AR 914-17.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiffs and Lucky's provided the asked-for evidence, AR 920-23, 931, which USCIS acknowledged receiving without any suggestion of insufficiency, AR 1520. However, USCIS issued each plaintiff a Notice of Intent to Deny (\"NOID\") their Form I-526 petitions in December 2015. AR 1518. The NOIDs were based, not on the agency's initial objections, but instead on its previously undisclosed concerns about the call option contained in the LPA. AR 1520-23. The \"deficiency\" created by the call option, according to USCIS, was \"revealed\" during \"a final review of the petition[s].\" AR 1520. USCIS read\n    <em>\n     Matter of Izummi\n    </em>\n    as requiring immigration officials to scrutinize \"the substance of the investment ... over its form in order to determine if an investment is really a prohibited 'debt arrangement.' \" AR 1522. Like the sell option at issue in\n    <em>\n     Matter of Izummi\n    </em>\n    , USCIS determined that several features of the call option in plaintiffs' LPA made it \"indicative of a prohibited debt arrangement.\" AR 1522.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Plaintiffs, Lucky's counsel, and Lucky's senior vice president all responded to the NOID, stating that the call option did not guarantee plaintiffs anything, and that plaintiffs' capital was indeed \"at risk\" as required by DHS's regulations.

Plaintiffs also argued that USCIS's rationale for denying their petitions \"would constitute an impermissible retroactive application of agency policy.\" Compl. \u00b6 48.

Plaintiffs assert that the evidence provided to USCIS proved that the call option did not qualify as a debt arrangement, both because it could not be used if the company were not profitable and because exercising the call option was the general partner's choice rather than plaintiffs' right. USCIS contends that it correctly read its own regulations\n    and the reasoning of\n    <em>\n     Matter of Izummi\n    </em>\n    ; that, under these authorities, the LPA's call option is more debt-like than equity-like; and that plaintiffs therefore did not place their capital at risk.

ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    USCIS rejected plaintiffs' Form I-526 petitions because, in its view, \"[t]he call option in the LPA provides a fixed rate of return and redemption upon exercise that is irrespective of the income and fortunes of Lucky's Farmers Market, LP.\" AR 1560. In both its NOID and final Notice of Decision, USCIS read\n    <em>\n     Matter of Izummi\n    </em>\n    's reasoning as implicitly extending beyond sell options, leaving open the potential boundaries of what constitutes a debt arrangement. AR 1522, 1561. For USCIS, this reading was consistent with the plain language of \u00a7 204.6(e)'s definition of \"debt arrangement,\" which USCIS viewed as prohibiting \"equity investments with debt features.\" AR 1522, 1561. As USCIS read the LPA, the call option constituted a debt feature because it gave plaintiffs a guaranteed redemption at a fixed price, and because the general partner's ability to exercise the option depended not on the general success of the business but rather only on whether the Market Resources Center repaid its highly-structured loan to Lucky's. AR 1522, 1561. Thus, \"each of the investors has entered into their investment assured that they will be repaid at a fixed price dependent only on the corresponding fixed price repayment of the loan to Lucky's Farmers Market, LP.\" AR 1522. The fixed price of the call option also prevented plaintiffs' capital from being \"at risk,\" USCIS asserted, because the option caps the total gain plaintiffs could receive.

While \"any\" ensures that a broad set of arrangements similar to the listed examples will be prohibited, it cannot reach agreements under which the capital contributor has no right to recall her investment. To interpret the regulatory language to reach those agreements, as USCIS has done, would be to read the examples out of the regulation and treat the exception as applying simply to \"any debt arrangement\"-or, perhaps more accurately, to \"any arrangement we see as suspect.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20491526\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This is not what the regulation says.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Other aspects of the regulatory language confirm that it does not extend to the buy option in plaintiffs' LPA.

In each of the examples the regulation lists, the creditor gives capital to the debtor in exchange for the debtor's promise to repay the creditor.

A buy option, however, is a contractual right held by the\n    <em>\n     company\n    </em>\n    to end the financial relationship by returning the investor's money. The investor does not contribute her capital \"in exchange for\" a debt arrangement, because she does not receive any consideration in return for her money. Rather, it is the company that benefits from both sides of the agreement: it has both the money and the right to return the money if it would prefer to have the investor's partnership interest back. For the same reason, a buy option places the investor's \"capital at risk for the purpose of generating a return on the capital placed at risk,\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.6\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 204.6(j)(2), while the debt arrangements prohibited by the regulation do not.

AR 1522-23. Yet even the broadest language in that decision underlines the distinction between sell and buy options that USCIS now attempts to blur. Consider this statement, quoted in the NOID in this case: \"For the alien's money truly to be at risk, the alien cannot enter into a partnership knowing that he already has a willing buyer in a certain number of years, nor can he be assured that he will receive a certain price.\"\n    <em>\n     Matter of Izummi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20169\">\n     22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 186\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (quoted in AR 1522). But this reasoning exonerates buy options. Under a buy option, the\n    <em>\n     company\n    </em>\n    knows that it has a willing seller at a certain time and is assured that it can pay a certain price. While a sell option shields the investor's capital from risk, plaintiffs' buy option does not; instead, it allows the general partner to reassert control over the partnership.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Similarly, the NOID points to this statement:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n    To enter into a redemption agreement at the time of making an \"investment\" evidences a preconceived intent to unburden oneself of the investment as soon as possible after unconditional permanent resident status is attained. This is conceptually no different from a situation in which an alien marries a U.S. citizen and states, in writing, that he will divorce her in two years.

A buy option-which is held by the company-does not evidence such an intent on the investor's part. To use the BIA's analogy, it is as if an alien marries a U.S. citizen, but the citizen spouse states, in writing, that she has the option of divorcing him after a set time. Whatever the spouse's intent, it cannot be said from these facts alone that the\n    <em>\n     alien\n    </em>\n    intends to break his bonds as soon as he receives his green card.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    USCIS argues that such intent could still manifest itself through a buy option \"coupled with assurances from the recipient company in other documentation that signals to the investor that there is a 'willing buyer' at a 'certain price' once the conditions on lawful permanent residence have been removed.\" Defs.' Mot. at 15-16. No doubt. The regulation clearly would allow USCIS to conduct a holistic examination of the applicant's investment agreement, and any other documentation, to determine whether a buy option has been effectively converted into a de facto sell option. But the record in this case contains no evidence of such assurances from Lucky's-indeed, quite the opposite. AR 1547-48, 1552, 1561. Without concrete indications of collusion between plaintiffs and Lucky's, or a determination-based on data and agency expertise-that investment agreements with buy options are highly likely to involve such collusion, USCIS's conclusion that \"each of the investors has entered into their investment assured that they will be repaid at a fixed price,\" AR 1522;\n    <em>\n     accord\n    </em>\n    AR 1561, \"runs counter to the evidence before the agency\" and thus lacks a \"rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\"\n    <em>\n     State Farm\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     463 U.S. at 43\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n     103 S.Ct. 2856\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
