Gox bitcoin exchange. Doc. 245. Plaintiffs bring only state law claims, and subject matter jurisdiction lies under the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Earlier in the litigation-when Greene, an Illinois citizen, and Lack, a California citizen, were the only named plaintiffs-the court issued an opinion, familiarity with which is assumed, denying Mizuho Bank's motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) to dismiss the claims against it for lack of personal jurisdiction.

Ill. 2016) ). For complicated reasons explained in the opinion, the denial was conditioned on putative class counsel's adding as a named plaintiff an Illinois resident alleged to be a member of the Deposit Subclass. The third amended complaint met that condition by adding Anthony Motto, an Illinois citizen, as a named plaintiff and class representative of the putative Deposit Subclass. Docs. 205-206. In February 2017, putative class counsel moved for leave to file a fourth amended complaint adding Gregory Pearce, a Pennsylvania citizen, as a named plaintiff. Doc. 242. After Mizuho informed the court that it did not oppose the amendment, the motion was granted, Doc. 244, and the fourth amended complaint, now the operative complaint, was filed, Doc. 245.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The complaint names Motto, Greene, Lack, and Pearce as representatives of the putative Mt.

At argument on the motion, Doc. 304, Plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal of Lack's claims as a named plaintiff against Mizuho; they did so because putative Deposit Subclass, of which Lack can be an absent member, may proceed with\n   Motto as its representative. Plaintiffs oppose the dismissal of Pearce's claims as a named plaintiff against Mizuho; they do so because Pearce is the only representative of the putative Withdrawal Subclass.

As noted in the personal jurisdiction opinion, the relevant background on a Rule 12(b)(2) motion includes the complaint's well-pleaded allegations and the evidentiary materials submitted by both sides.

Mizuho certainly could have employed those decisions to argue that personal jurisdiction did not lie over Pearce's (and Lack's) claims against Mizuho simply because those claims are closely related to Motto's claims, over which there is specific jurisdiction. Indeed, several pre-\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   decisions held, in circumstances materially identical to those here, that specific personal jurisdiction does not lie over a nonresident plaintiff's claim against a defendant not subject to general jurisdiction based solely on the close relationship between that claim and a claim brought in the same case by a resident plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Prime Healthcare Centinela, LLC v.
