Here, even if the DIG group is disaggregated, one of its members-Scarpatetti-still has the highest loss. Had Scarpatetti sought lead plaintiff status on his own, he would have achieved it. Therefore, to appoint Pontiac because of the DIG group's alleged deficiencies would effectively be to penalize Scarpatetti because he joined DIG. The Court fails to see how that outcome furthers any goal of the PSLRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the hearing on these motions, Pontiac's lawyer repeatedly cited\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Eichenholtz\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that the Court should disregard the investor with the largest loss if that investor is the member of a group that cannot otherwise establish lead plaintiff status. In\n   <em>\n    Eichenholtz\n   </em>\n   , the court did find a movant group inadequate, and it also found an investor member of the group inadequate even though that investor had suffered the largest claimed loss. But the court rejected the individual investor for reasons having to do only with that investor's inadequacy-that it was subject to unique defenses, that the judgment might not be given effect in the investor's home country, and that the investor was located in a foreign country far away from the court-and nothing to do with the fact that the investor joined a poorly put-together group.\n   <em>\n    Eichenholtz v.

ECF No. 34 at 9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37 at 11. Pontiac responds to this\n   argument on the merits, but also suggests that it is DIG that is not adequate, because DIG has undermined certain class members' claims by conceding a loss causation problem at the beginning of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 37 at 10-11. This, DIG says, makes Pontiac an inadequate lead plaintiff because it will not stand up for the class as a whole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Pontiac offers no case law supporting the proposition that a court should disregard an investor movant with the largest financial interest because that investor made arguments about the weakness of another investor's claim in its lead plaintiff briefing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pontiac's argument has some force: it seems counterproductive at the inception of the litigation for the parties whose financial interests are aligned to weaken each other's claims to the benefit of their mutual opponent. But that is precisely what the PSLRA encourages plaintiffs to do. In fact, arguments by one movant against another movant's liability or damages claims are practically inevitable, given that the plaintiff with the largest losses may nonetheless be disqualified from lead plaintiff status if she \"is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4 (a)(3)(B)(iii)(II)(bb). This is particularly so given the low bar to the raising of such defenses: a competing movant need not prove the defense at this stage of the case, but merely \"show a degree of likelihood that a unique defense might play a significant role at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Netflix, Inc., Sec.
