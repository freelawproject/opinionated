This litigation currently consists of 110 actions pending in seven districts, as listed on Schedule A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the filing of the motion, the Panel has been notified of 57 related federal actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Plaintiffs in 60 actions on the motion and 32 potential tag-along actions, represented by two law firms, oppose centralization. At oral argument, opposing plaintiffs in all but one of those actions stated that the Central District of California would be an acceptable choice to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in the remaining 50 actions on the motion\n   have not responded and thus are deemed to have acquiesced in the motion under Panel Rule 6.1(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs opposing centralization do not dispute that all actions present factual questions concerning the allegedly defective DPS6 PowerShift transmission in certain Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus vehicles. Instead, they argue that centralization is not appropriate because the actions also involve individualized questions of fact regarding the problems experienced by each plaintiff's vehicle, the nature and number of repairs, the efficacy of the repairs, and the extent to which the alleged defect impaired each plaintiff's use of the vehicle. They further identify a handful of cases alleging additional problems unrelated to the transmission. But the central question in all actions is whether the DPS6 PowerShift transmission is defective and, as a result, caused operational problems relating to the transmission that affect the drivability, safety, and value of the vehicles. Product liability litigation typically involves some plaintiff-specific factual issues, but centralization still may be warranted where the actions allege a common defect involving similar products manufactured by the same company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: MI Windows and Doors, Inc., Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573529\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/857/1374/#p1375\">\n    857 F.Supp.2d 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1375 (J.P.M.L. 2012). Transfer under Section 1407 does not require a complete identity of factual issues when the actions arise from a common factual core.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Kugel Mesh Hernia Patch Prods. Liab. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3437839\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/493/1371/#p1372\">\n    493 F.Supp.2d 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1372 (J.P.M.L. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that centralization would be unjust on the ground that Ford improperly removed the vast majority of cases to avoid adverse state court rulings, and many plaintiffs have remand motions pending. It is well-established that jurisdictional objections, including objections to removal, are not relevant to transfer. This is so even where, as here, plaintiffs assert that the removals were patently improper. \" Section 1407 does not empower the MDL Panel to decide questions going to the jurisdiction or the merits of a case, including issues relating to a motion to remand.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Ivy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525911\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/901/7/#p9\">\n    901 F.2d 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9 (2d Cir. 1990). Plaintiffs alternatively request a delay or stay of the decision on centralization until their motions for remand to state court are decided, but there is no persuasive basis to do so. The Panel's longstanding practice is to decide motions to transfer even though remand motions are pending, as plaintiffs can present those motions to the transferee court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. Sales Practices Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9473754\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/170/1346/#p1347\">\n    170 F.Supp.2d 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1347-48 (J.P.M.L. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Additionally, plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Hibdon\n   </em>\n   argues that Ford intends to use the MDL to delay resolution of the cases and coerce plaintiffs into undesirable settlements. But plaintiff's concerns about litigation delays and the future of settlement discussions are highly speculative. Moreover, these essentially are case management issues. As we have observed, \"[i]t is incumbent upon the parties to bring their concerns to the attention of the transferee court and to propose ways to resolve them.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Walgreen's Herbal Supplements Mktg. and Sales Practices Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365109\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/109/1373/#p1376\">\n    109 F.Supp.3d 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1376 (J.P.M.L. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we find that these actions involve common questions of fact, and that centralization will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation. The actions share complex\n   factual questions arising out of allegations that the DPS6 PowerShift Transmission installed in certain Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus vehicles\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is defective and negatively affects the drivability, safety, and useful life of the vehicles. The actions allege that plaintiffs' vehicles suffer from similar transmission-related problems, including slipping, bucking, jerking, sudden acceleration, delayed acceleration and downshifting, and premature wear that requires repair or replacement. Common factual questions include (1) whether the design or manufacturing of the PowerShift transmission is defective; (2) defendant's knowledge of, and conduct in response, to the alleged defect; and (3) whether vehicle owners and lessees have suffered a diminution in vehicle value or other economic damages. Centralization will eliminate duplicative discovery; prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings; and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel, and the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude that the Central District of California is an appropriate transferee district for this litigation. The vast majority of the actions are pending in California, including 35 actions in the Central District. Centralization in this district also will facilitate coordination with California state court litigation involving the same alleged defect. Judge Andr\u00e9 Birotte, Jr., managed a related nationwide class action settlement involving the same Ford vehicles and alleged transmission defect,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus is familiar with the factual and legal issues in this litigation. He presides over the actions pending in this district, and is an experienced transferee judge. We are confident he will steer this litigation on a prudent course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the actions listed on Schedule A and pending outside the Central District of California are transferred to the Central District of California and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Andr\u00e9 Birotte, Jr., for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   MDL No. 2814 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: FORD MOTOR CO.
