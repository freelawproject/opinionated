BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Although the Freedom of Information Act requires agencies to issue decisions on requests for documents within twenty working days, few departments consistently meet this deadline. Plaintiff American Center for Law and Justice believes that the State Department, in fact, has an actual policy or practice of not complying until the requester brings suit. In this case, ACLJ both seeks specific documents and asserts such a policy-or-practice claim. This Court initially dismissed the latter count without prejudice, but allowed Plaintiff to file an Amended Complaint. Once ACLJ did so, the Court permitted the claim to proceed, despite a renewed Motion to Dismiss. State now moves for partial summary judgment on this count alone. Concluding that the third time is the charm for Defendant, the Court grants the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In seeking summary judgment, State avers that it does not have a policy or practice of pushing off FOIA requests (from ACLJ or other requesters) until litigation, much less a policy egregious enough to warrant injunctive relief. ACLJ, unsurprisingly, disagrees and argues that it can prove the existence of such a policy or at least raise an issue for trial with the aid of discovery. The Court first addresses the summary-judgment Motion and, finding ACLJ's claim wanting, then concludes that Plaintiff is also not entitled to relief under Rule 56(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Policy-or-Practice Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ACLJ claims that State refuses to issue a determination on FOIA requests until organizations file a lawsuit. The Act requires an agency to \"determine within 20 days ... after the receipt of any ... request whether to comply with such request\" and immediately notify the requester about its decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A)(i). \"In unusual circumstances,\" the agency can extend the deadline by a maximum of ten days, but it must provide the requester \"written notice ... setting forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i). Despite\n   the clear statutory language, agencies have had difficulty meeting the FOIA deadline since it was added in 1974. From the beginning, they have felt that having to respond to requesters in such a short timeframe would engender \"the very real problem of spreading available resources too thin.\" H. Rep. No. 93-876, at 137 (1973) (Letter from Malcolm D. Hawk, Acting Asst. Att'y Gen., Dep't of Justice). Congress, nevertheless, has insisted that agencies adhere to the strict timetable and has provided requesters a private right of action when the agency fails to perform its statutory duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B).

As Director of IPS, Stein has personal knowledge of \"all of the Department's policies and practices, both formal and informal, concerning responses to\n   FOIA requests.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 3,5. He avers that Defendant does not have any policy or practice of FOIA non-compliance but instead suffers from a \"substantial FOIA caseload and backlog\" made worse by \"high FOIA litigation demands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 14. Indeed, the Department's annual reports substantiate Stein's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   State began 2016 with 11,731 pending requests and processed 15,482 throughout the year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ, Exh. B (2016 Annual Report) at 11. It still ended up in the hole, however, because it received a whopping 27,961 requests that year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Going into 2017, therefore, State had 24,210 pending requests-more than double what it started the year with.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is hardly shocking, then, that Defendant rarely meets the twenty-day FOIA-response deadline. When State processes FOIA requests, they \"are placed in different processing tracks\" (simple, complex, or expedited) \"on the basis of the complexity of the search and/or review of the responsive material.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. On average in 2016, it took the Department almost a full calendar year (342 days) to process a simple request and 517 days for a complex request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Even taking into account that the average can be misleading because requests can vary widely in the number of documents sought, the Department is still woefully behind schedule. The median number of days for a simple request was 166, with 392 needed for a complex one-roughly 8 and 20 times longer than FOIA allows.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although a requester can ask for expedited processing, it likely will not help very much; those requests took State an average of 139 days to process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   While these statistics are clear evidence of the Department's non-compliance with FOIA, the numbers do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   lead to the conclusion that litigation is the only hope for requesters. State \"is engaged in approximately 108 FOIA litigation cases,\" which is roughly 1% of the total requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., \u00b6 17. The vast majority of FOIA requests, then, are completed without judicial involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Trying another tack, Plaintiff argues that State cannot truly mean to comply with FOIA because it \"intentionally understaff[s] its FOIA department.\" Opp. at 8. Although the agency has roughly 130 full-time FOIA staff members, ACLJ latches onto Defendant's admission that, because of a Department-imposed hiring freeze, the FOIA arm of State has 18 job vacancies, and there are another 13 FOIA support positions currently unfilled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. Yet viewed within the context of the affidavit, State's \"concession\" is evidence that it is trying to bring itself into FOIA compliance, not \"intentionally understaff[ing] its FOIA department.\" Opp. at 8. Once State received authorization for 25 new FOIA positions, it quickly filled \"10 positions directly supporting FOIA.\" Stein Decl., \u00b6 36. It is also actively \"pursuing alternative means to increase its number of reviewers using existing Department resources,\" including reassigning Foreign Service Officers to assist in FOIA processing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 38. This evidence strongly supports Defendant's assertion that it is its FOIA backlog and caseload-not lack of effort or a specific policy-that makes it difficult (if not impossible) to comply with the statutory deadlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to ACLJ, these \"efforts\" are merely a fa\u00e7ade because they have not \"actually resulted in any increase in the rate of FOIA requests processed each year and/or response time to FOIA requests.\" Opp. at 9. Indeed, between 2015 and 2016, for example, State's wait times to process simple requests did increase from 111 to 342 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ, Exh. C (2015 Annual Report) at 24; 2016 Annual Report at 22. Complex requests marginally slowed down as well, going from 511 days to 517.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These numbers, however, comport with\n   State's own explanation-that delays are due to \"the massive FOIA caseload facing the Department and the complicated, laborious review process that the Department must undertake in responding to many of the FOIA requests it receives,\" in addition to increased litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MPSJ at 11-12. In fact, total processed requests increased by 10.5% between 2015 and 2016, and, in this past year, the agency's backlog decreased by a substantial 52%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2015 Annual Report at 15; 2016 Annual Report at 13; Stein Decl., \u00b6 28. In absolute terms, therefore, the agency is showing some improvement. Neither is the Department alone in facing this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp., Exh. 1 (2016 Office of Inspector General Report) at 6 (noting that \"few agencies are able to meet the 20-day deadline for complex requests\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court also rejects ACLJ's argument that State's practice of prioritizing FOIA requests in litigation over others is somehow evidence of a policy to wait until a requester files suit to process requests. Faced with limited resources, the agency must decide which FOIA requests get priority. It is true that cases in litigation and expedited requests are given top billing, and then simple or complex requests are processed on a first-in, first-out basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MPSJ, Exh. D (2017 Chief FOIA Officer Report) at 13. Prioritizing litigation cases, however, is not \"an improper litigation-forcing policy,\" MPSJ at 12 n.3, but part of the statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daily Caller v. Dep't of State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288679\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/1/#p10\">\n    152 F.Supp.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 10 (D.D.C. 2015) (\"[T]his twenty-day deadline serves primarily as a means to obtain immediate judicial supervision over an agency's response to an outstanding FOIA request.\"). In fact, it seems that litigation-such as the five suits brought by ACLJ-only exacerbates delays. For example, current court orders require the agency to process a minimum of 9,100 pages every month across 16 cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., Exh 1 at 1. In another 18 cases, the Department does not have a monthly minimum but must process some documents on a monthly to bi-monthly basis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288679\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/1/#p10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288679\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/1/#p10\">\n    at 1-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

FOIA suits cost the agency over $19 million in 2016, though it only collected $1,373.55 in fees from requesters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2016 Annual Report at 31-32. In addition to the demands that all litigation imposes, once State is under a court-ordered schedule, it has to divert resources and personnel from processing non-litigation requests to court-ordered processing and production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2017 Chief FOIA Officer Report at 2. This resource split is no small matter; in 2016 the Department had \"to allocate about 80% of its FOIA resources to meet these court-ordered productions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288679\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/1/#p10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Though State has been able to satisfy its litigation obligations, \"these accomplishments were done at the expense of all other requesters seeking information from the government. The Department's FOIA backlog increased from 10,045 cases in FY 2014 to 28,505 at the beginning of FY 2016.\" Stein Decl., \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, to the extent ACLJ claims that State specifically targets it in connection with FOIA delays,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 7, the numbers also belie that conclusion. According to Plaintiff, \"Regardless of whether Defendant is given 1 month or 8 months-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   up to 286 days,\" it does not respond (other than the perfunctory acknowledgment-of-receipt letter) to ACLJ requests until litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 2. But, in the context of overall response times, 286 days-the high end of ACLJ's wait time-is still two months shorter than the Department's average time for all simple FOIA requests. The statistics thus do not bear out ACLJ's claim that State treats it differently. Perhaps Plaintiff would prefer State to move faster in filling open positions and processing requests, but the Department's pace does not amount to a \"willful and intentional\n   dereliction of its FOIA responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288679\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/1/#p10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4288679\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/152/1/#p10\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Reply at 8. State correctly notes that discovery is generally \"disfavored\" in mine-run FOIA cases.\n   <em>\n    Justice v.

Yet, in a typical FOIA case the question is whether the \"agency has conducted a thorough search\" and given \"reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption.\"\n   <em>\n    Carney v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10511083\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/807/#p812\">\n    19 F.3d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812 (2d Cir. 1994). \"The peculiarities inherent in FOIA litigation, with the responding agencies often in sole possession of requested records and with information searches conducted only by agency personnel, have led federal courts to rely on government affidavits to determine whether\" the agency has met its FOIA obligations.\n   <em>\n    Perry v. Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3633372,529469\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/684/121/\">\n    684 F.2d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Indeed, the statute itself instructs courts to \"accord substantial weight to an affidavit of an agency concerning the agency's determination\" of exemptions and reproducibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). That does not mean, however, that agencies get to phone it in when defending their FOIA conduct. Courts require that any supporting affidavits are \"relatively detailed[,] ... nonconclusory[,] and ... submitted in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Goland v. CIA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1431828,3785037\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/607/339/\">\n    607 F.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Relying on affidavits when deciding whether the agency has properly searched or withheld documents allows courts to balance FOIA's overarching purpose of disclosure with the Executive's need to prevent \"adverse effects [that] might occur as a result of public disclosure of a particular\" sensitive record.\n   <em>\n    Weissman v. CIA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"898480,3531283\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/565/692/\">\n    565 F.2d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (quoting S. Rep. No. 93-1200, at 12 (1974) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The scales may shift, however, in a FOIA policy-or-practice suit, in which confidentiality is not typically at issue. While a court may still accord agency affidavits a presumption of good faith in such cases, persistent and unexplained delays in processing FOIA requests may \"raise a sufficient question of bad faith on the part of the government ... to warrant further exploration through discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Wash. v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   , No. 05-2078,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%201518964\">\n    2006 WL 1518964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (D.D.C. June 1, 2006) (permitting limited discovery when \"even after a full round of briefing and a motions hearing, there still remain[ed] unanswered questions regarding the government's position that what occurred ... [was] ordinary and normal [FOIA] processing\"). In such cases, a plaintiff may need to conduct narrow discovery on the agency's \"policies and practices for responding to FOIA requests, and the resources allocated to ensure its compliance with the FOIA time limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Gilmore v. Dep't of Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1386956\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/33/1184/#p1190\">\n    33 F.Supp.2d 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1190 (N.D. Cal. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Unfortunately for ACLJ, this is not one of those cases. As the Court has just explained, State convincingly avers that its \"policy is to fully comply with the FOIA and to continue improving its FOIA operations.\" Stein Decl., \u00b6 7. The Court has\n   agreed with Stein that Defendant \"does not have a policy or practice, either formal or informal, of refusing to respond to FOIA requests or otherwise refusing to comply with the FOIA until a requester files a lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8. Plaintiff nonetheless argues that these are just \"bald assertions of fact and conclusory statements,\" Opp. at 5, which it cannot rebut without discovery. The Court concludes otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Given the undisputed facts in the record, Plaintiff's request seems little more than the proverbial fishing expedition. ACLJ claims it requires discovery because \"Defendant asserts in conclusory fashion that it does not maintain a policy of intentionally violating FOIA ... but fails to provide a single policy of the Department regarding its FOIA practices.\" Mot. for Discovery, \u00b6 3.a. Not so. The 2017 Chief FOIA Officer Report clearly outlines State's FOIA policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The Department makes every effort to respond to FOIA requests within the statutory response period. In an effort to respond to all requests in the most comprehensive manner, the Department processes FOIA requests incrementally and makes interim responses to requesters as document searches and reviews are completed rather than waiting until all responsive records are located and reviewed. To implement its statutory responsibilities under FOIA, the Department has established a centralized and comprehensive FOIA Program, in which a single office receives and coordinates the processing of FOIA requests made to the Department. Whether that coordination is with the Department's domestic offices and bureaus, its posts overseas, other federal agencies, or foreign governments, the process is managed by the FOIA Program in the Bureau of Administration's Office of Information Programs and Services (A/GIS/IPS).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2017 Chief FOIA Officer Report at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As discussed above, moreover, State's disavowal of any litigation-forcing policy is not based on \"bald assertions of fact and conclusory statements,\" Opp. at 5, but is instead supported by hard data corroborating its claim that it must handle immense FOIA obligations with limited resources. ACLJ has not provided any evidence to suggest bad faith on the part of the Department, and it is hard to see what information Plaintiff would hope to find that would matter to the litigation at hand. Plaintiff's 56(d) Motion for Discovery will, therefore, be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Count II and deny Plaintiff's Motion for Discovery. A separate Order so stating will issue this day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
