Catherine brings claims under Illinois tort law for Mentor's alleged noncompliance with the FDA's premarket approval process for Class III devices, alleged failure to warn consumers of the risks posed by MemoryGel implants, and allegedly defective design and manufacture of the implants. Travis brings a loss of consortium claim. Mentor removed the suit to federal court, Doc. 1, and now moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss the complaint, Doc. 11.

Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6 21; Doc. 12-1 at 3-5. Specifically, the FDA required Mentor to conduct: (1) a core post-approval study to assess the long-term clinical performance of breast implants among women who had participated in the studies supporting the company's PMA application; (2) a large post-approval study to assess long-term outcomes and identify rare adverse events among a new sample of 40,000 patients who had not participated in the earlier studies; (3) a device failure study to describe the modes and causes of failure of MemoryGel implants; (4) a focus group study to improve the form and content of patient labeling; (5) an annual physician-informed decision survey to monitor how patient labeling is distributed to women considering silicone gel breast implants ; and (6) an adjunct survey to provide performance and safety information about silicone gel implants from 1992 to 2006, when the agency barred new patients from being treated with such implants. Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6 21; Doc. 12-1 at 3-5. Pertinent here, the November 2006 letter required that Mentor \"continue [the] Core Study until all patients have completed their 10-year evaluation\" and report that study's results for ten years, and include 41,900 Mentor silicone gel patients in the large post-approval study.

Moreover, as to causation, the complaint plausibly alleges both that Catherine would not have consented to the implant procedure if she had known the true risk of device rupture and that, were they informed that the risks of MemoryGel implants were higher than disclosed, Catherine's physicians would not have recommended that she undergo the MemoryGel implant procedure.

And because the court concludes that Catherine's claims are viable, Travis's loss of consortium claim survives as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mentor's motion to dismiss is granted in part and denied in part. Plaintiffs may proceed with Catherine's claim that Mentor violated its state tort law duties by concealing that the risk of gel bleed associated with MemoryGel was higher than the company publicly revealed, and with Travis's associated consortium claim. Plaintiffs' other claims are dismissed, though the dismissal is without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. &amp; Nw.

Plaintiffs have until February 1, 2018 to file an amended complaint. If Plaintiffs file an amended complaint, Mentor shall respond by February 15, 2018. If Plaintiffs do not file an amended complaint, the dismissal of the other claims\n   will convert automatically to a dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
