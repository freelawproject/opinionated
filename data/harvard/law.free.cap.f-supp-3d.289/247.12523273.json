(collectively, \"defendants\" or \"Forest\"). Plaintiffs Delana Kiossovski and Renee Ramirez (collectively, \"the Kiossovski plaintiffs\") and plaintiff Painters and Allied Trades District Council 82 Health Care Fund (\"Painters\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\") allege that defendants 1) engaged in a fraudulent marketing scheme designed to induce consumers to purchase Celexa and Lexapro for pediatric use in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and (d), 2) were unjustly enriched, 3) violated the Washington Consumer Protection Act (\n   <em>\n    Kiossovski )\n   </em>\n   and 4) violated the Minnesota Consumer Fraud Act and Minnesota Unfair Trade Practices Act (\n   <em>\n    Painters)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pending before the Court are (1) Painters' motion for partial summary judgment on Forest's statute of limitations affirmative defense (\n   <em>\n    Painters)\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 662), (2) Forest's cross-motion for summary judgment on all claims (\n   <em>\n    Painters)\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 676) and (3) Forest's motions for summary judgment on all claims (\n   <em>\n    Painters\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Kiossovski )\n   </em>\n   (Docket Nos. 797 and 798). For the reasons that follow, this Court will deny as moot Painters' motion for partial summary judgment, allow, in part, and deny as moot, in part, Forest's cross motion for summary judgment and allow Forest's motions for summary judgment on all claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court heard oral argument on the pending motions on January 11, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background and procedural history\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Celexa and Lexapro are closely related selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (\"SSRI\") anti-depressants sold by Forest. Forest obtained approval from the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") to market Celexa for adult use in 1998 and Lexapro for adult use in 2002. It later sought to market both drugs to treat pediatric major depressive disorder (\"MDD\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. FDA Approval Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To obtain FDA approval to market Celexa and Lexapro for pediatric use, Forest had to show that the drugs would be more effective than placebos in treating MDD in pediatric patients. The FDA typically requires at least two \"positive\" placebo-controlled clinical trials before approval. A \"positive\" drug study shows statistically significant improvements for patients who are administered the drug rather than a placebo while a \"negative\" study indicates no statistically significant difference. Drug manufacturers submit trial results to the FDA as part of their \"new drug applications\" (\"NDAs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Forest and Lundbeck, the Danish pharmaceutical company that developed the drugs and licensed them to Forest, conducted four double-blind, placebo-controlled studies on the efficacy of Celexa and Lexapro in treating pediatric depression. The first two studies examined the efficacy of Celexa, were completed in 2001 and were submitted to the FDA in 2002. The Celexa Study 18 (\"MD-18\") produced results that the FDA determined were positive (although plaintiffs dispute that finding). On the other hand, Celexa Study 94404 (\"Lundbeck Study\") produced negative results. Forest submitted the results of the two Celexa studies to the FDA in a supplemental NDA in 2002. The FDA denied Forest's application for a pediatric indication for Celexa after finding that the Lundbeck Study was negative. The other two studies addressed the efficacy of Lexapro. Lexapro Study 15 (\"MD-15\") was completed in 2004 and produced negative results but Lexapro Study 32 (\"MD-32\"), completed in 2007, produced statistically significant, and therefore positive, results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before 2005, the FDA-approved labels for both drugs stated that \"[s]afety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established\". In February, 2005, Forest revised Celexa's label to include a description of MD-18 and the Lundbeck Study and Lexapro's label to describe the negative study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2008, Forest submitted study results to the FDA in a supplemental NDA. The following year, the FDA reviewed the positive results in MD-18 and MD-32, noted the chemical similarities between Celexa and Lexapro and approved Lexapro as safe and effective in treating MDD in adolescents ages 12-17. Forest did not seek similar FDA approval for Celexa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Delana Kiossovski and Renee Ramirez\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   From July, 2001 to February, 2002, Kiossovski bought Celexa for her daughter, who was then 13 years old, based upon the recommendation of her daughter's psychiatrist, Dr. Stephen Barnett. A short time later, Kiossovski's daughter developed a rash and stopped ingesting Celexa for approximately two months. She resumed taking the medication in October, 2001. In March, 2002, Kiossovski's daughter attempted suicide. Shortly after her attempted suicide, Kiossovski's daughter was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by psychiatrist Dr. Carola Bosenberg. Dr. Bosenberg discontinued the prescription of Celexa for use by Kiossovski's daughter and prescribed other medication. Thereafter the daughter stopped using Celexa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Kiossovoski became aware in 2014 that the efficacy of Celexa for pediatric use was unproven when it was prescribed for her daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   From February, 2003 to April, 2004, Ramirez purchased Celexa for her eight-year-old son and from May, 2004 to December, 2006 she bought Lexapro. Ramirez continued to fill her son's Lexapro prescriptions until March, 2010. Dr. Michael Saito, a neurologist, treated Ramirez's son from March, 2001 to September, 2010. During that time, the son was diagnosed with several disorders including autism and anxiety. Dr. Saito prescribed Celexa and Lexapro to treat symptoms of autism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Painters and Allied Trades District 82 Council Health Care Fund\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Painters is a third-party payor (\"TPP\") that provides medical benefits, including prescription drug coverage, to its insured beneficiaries, who are employees of unionized commercial painting companies. Painters retains a pharmacy benefit manager (\"PBM\"), Prime Therapeutics (\"Prime\"), that administers Painters' prescription drug benefit program. Painters delegated to Prime responsibility for 1) determining which drugs to include on the approved drug formulary, 2) negotiating rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and 3) imposing limitations on coverage, if necessary. A drug formulary lists medications that will be reimbursed by the insurer or TPP, in this case, Painters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Between January, 1999 and October, 2004, Painters reimbursed 72 Celexa prescriptions for 16 of its pediatric insureds, at a total cost of $4,210. Between August, 2002 and January, 2015, Painters reimbursed 234 prescriptions for Lexapro for 31 of its pediatric insureds, at a total cost of $20,262.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural history\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff Painters and another TPP initiated this action in the District of Minnesota on behalf of two putative nationwide TPP classes in November, 2013. The case was transferred to this Court pursuant to a multi-district litigation assignment in December, 2013. Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint in February, 2014, asserting violations of RICO (Counts I and II) and three Minnesota consumer protection statutes (Counts III, IV and V) on behalf of the two putative nationwide classes of TPPs and two putative Minnesota classes of TPPs and consumers. This Court dismissed Count V and all claims brought by TPP Allied Services Division Welfare Fund and New Mexico UFCW Union's and Employers' health and Welfare Trust Fund in December, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Painters moved for class certification in February, 2016 and that motion was denied in June, 2016. In December, 2016, the First Circuit Court of Appeals denied Painters' Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f) petition seeking permission to appeal this Court's order denying class certification. Painters filed its second motion for class certification in February, 2017. Forest has not opposed that motion but instead sought a stay of consideration of that motion until the motions for summary judgment have been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In August, 2014, former plaintiff Marlene LoConte and Kiossovski commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington on behalf of themselves and putative consumer classes. They alleged that Forest fraudulently promoted the pediatric use of Celexa and Lexapro despite knowing that the drugs did not provide any clinically significant benefit over placebos in treating MDD. The case was transferred to this Court pursuant to a multi-district\n   litigation assignment in October, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In June, 2015, this Court 1) allowed defendants' motion to dismiss the action with respect to the RICO, Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, M.G.L. c. 93A (\"Chapter 93A\") and unjust enrichment claims brought by LoConte and 2) denied the motion with respect to the RICO, Washington Consumer Protection Act and unjust enrichment claims brought by Kiossovski. Plaintiffs amended the complaint in January, 2016 by replacing LoConte with Ramirez as the second putative class representative. The amended complaint raises two RICO claims by Kiossovski and Ramirez, an unjust enrichment claim by both plaintiffs and a Washington Consumer Protection Act claim by Kiossovski.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In February, 2016, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint which this Court denied in June, 2016. In March, 2017, the Kiossovski plaintiffs moved for class certification which defendants opposed. This Court denied the Kiossovski plaintiffs' motion for class certification in August, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motions for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Civil RICO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Forest moves to dismiss plaintiffs' civil RICO claims, contending that plaintiffs (1) lack RICO standing because they cannot show a RICO injury or causation, (2) have failed to establish a pattern of racketeering activity, (3) cannot establish a RICO enterprise and (4) attempt to bring claims that are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The civil RICO statute prohibits, in relevant part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce [from] conduct[ing] or participat[ing], directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Forest contends that Painters and Ramirez cannot establish a RICO injury because neither plaintiff has presented individualized evidence of the lack of efficacy of Celexa or Lexapro for plan members or for Ramirez's son. As to Painters, Forest suggests that plaintiffs have not identified any specific plan member for whom Celexa or Lexapro was ineffective. Further, Forest notes that Painters has not produced medical records or evidence regarding the efficacy of the subject drugs with respect to any plan member nor has it deposed any parent or physician. With respect to Ramirez, Forest contends that plaintiff has not offered proof that either Celexa or Lexapro was ineffective for her son. Forest presents evidence that Dr. Saito, the Ramirez's doctor, considered the drugs to be efficacious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs maintain that Painters and Ramirez have demonstrated an injury sufficient to establish RICO standing. They frame the RICO injury differently than Forest, relying on a \"quantity effect\" theory to claim that plaintiffs suffered an injury in the form of the money paid as a result of Forest's alleged fraud. Plaintiffs maintain that they are not required to prove the ineffectiveness of each off-label prescription in order to establish injury but rather need only show that money was paid as a result of fraudulently induced prescriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Furthermore, plaintiffs recast their rebuttal of the FDA's decision with respect to MD-18 into the \"efficacy\" umbrella, contending that plaintiffs have challenged the efficacy of Celexa /Lexapro by\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   exposing the corrupt nature of the clinical trials and subsequent reporting of the results by Forest to the FDA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Essentially, plaintiffs suggest that they need not prove inefficacy as to any individual because they have created a genuine dispute of fact as to whether the FDA found the drugs effective for pediatric use through an uncorrupted process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To establish an injury sufficient to maintain a RICO action, a plaintiff must demonstrate a claim of \"injury\" to its \"business or property\".\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ;\n   <em>\n    Sedima\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201448\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/479/#p496\">\n    473 U.S. at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201448\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/479/#p496\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a plaintiff \"only has [RICO] standing if, and can only recover to the extent that, he has been injured in his business or property by the conduct constituting the violation\").

Plaintiffs suggest that\n   <em>\n    Maio\n   </em>\n   is inapposite because benefit of the bargain damages are generally not available in RICO cases.

Dr. Saito testified that he continued to prescribe the drugs because, in his clinical experience, they had been effective in treating the symptoms of his patient's autism. Rather than presenting affirmative evidence that the drug was ineffective for Ramirez's son, plaintiffs contend that the clinician's testimony must be disregarded as unreliable and anecdotal.

Painters has produced no medical records for any of its insureds nor has it deposed any parent or physician. As Forest notes, Painters has not directed Prime to remove the subject drugs from its approved drug formulary. Painters admits that it continues to reimburse pediatric prescriptions for Celexa and Lexapro but contends that such reimbursement is irrelevant because inefficacy is not central to the question of RICO injury. The Court has found otherwise and concludes that Painters has failed to meet its burden of presenting affirmative evidence as to the inefficacy of the subject drugs sufficient to establish RICO injury.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    UFCW Local 1776\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Eli Lilly &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782283\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/121/#p135\">\n    620 F.3d 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135-36 (2d Cir. 2010) (explaining that the TPP and its PBM's decisions to approve the subject drug on the formulary and continue reimbursing for the prescriptions brought into question the plaintiffs' quantity effect theory for demonstrating RICO injury).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In lieu of any evidence of inefficacy of the drugs for specific plan members or for Ramirez, plaintiffs rely on a theory that, despite the FDA's opinion to the contrary, the drugs were ineffective in treating adolescents. Plaintiffs proffer expert testimony attempting to show that Celexa and Lexapro are generally ineffective by challenging the FDA's determination that MD-18 and MD-32 were positive. Their fraud theory is a tenuous attempt to shoehorn the facts of this case into the facts of\n   <em>\n    Neurontin\n   </em>\n   , where there were no positive, or even equivocal, clinical trials for the indications at issue. Plaintiffs suggest that a packaging error in MD-18 rendered the study \"unblinded\" and thus negative. They also proffer an expert report that MD-32 used an oversized sample and therefore ought be reclassified as negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The FDA in this case, however, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Neurontin\n   </em>\n   , determined that two clinical studies were positive. The FDA is \"the exclusive judge of safety and efficacy\" and a court should not question that judgment unless \"new information not considered by the FDA develops\".\n   <em>\n    In re Celexa and Lexapro Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Marcus\"\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011407\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/34/#p41\">\n    779 F.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 41 (1st Cir. 2015). The FDA made the determination that MD-18 was positive after being informed that there was a supply packaging error and that there were eight potentially unblinded patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs endeavor to reframe the packaging error as new information but cannot escape the fact that the FDA was informed of the potential unblinding. They proffer testimony from Dr. Laughren, a doctor at the FDA who worked on the approval of Lexapro for pediatric use, to assert that the facts surrounding that mistake constitute new information. His testimony states\n   that he would consider a clinical trial patient who was given pills with the brand name Celexa on them \"new information\". The tablets were not, however, stamped with the brand name but were instead simply the wrong color (a fact of which the FDA was aware).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Given the presence of two positive clinical studies, any evidence of general inefficacy is insufficient and plaintiffs have failed to present evidence of individual inefficacy as to Ramirez or any Painters' insured. Accordingly, there is no evidence of RICO injury and Forest is entitled to judgment as a matter of law in that regard with respect to Painters and Ramirez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Although plaintiffs Painters and Ramirez have failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to the existence of a RICO injury, Forest does not dispute that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the efficacy of the drugs for Kiossovski's daughter. The Court will therefore proceed to consider the other elements of a RICO claim with respect to Kiossovski.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Forest contends that Kiossovski can show neither but-for nor proximate causation. There is no but-for causation because neither Kiossovski nor her daughter's doctor was exposed to off-label promotion. Forest suggests that Kiossovski cannot establish proximate causation because she cannot establish a direct causal relationship between the alleged injury and Forest's alleged off-label promotion. Forest also asserts that the causal chain is broken by the intervening diagnosis of bipolar disorder of Kiossovski's daughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs retort that, with respect to proximate causation, they are not required to show individual direct reliance on fraudulent conduct but rather need only show that consumers were foreseeable targets of Forest's off-label promotion. They also dispute Forest's but-for causation argument, suggesting that there is evidence that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that Kiossovski's prescriber was influenced by Forest's off-label promotion. They proffer testimony of the prescriber that, although he could not recall any off-label promotion, he could not \"rule out\" the possibility that he had seen some advertisement from Celexa at some point years ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To succeed on their RICO claims, plaintiffs must show that Forest's alleged mail or wire fraud was a \"but for\" cause of their injuries as well as the proximate cause.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George Lussier Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Subaru of New England, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169146\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/36/#p51\">\n    393 F.3d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Secs.
