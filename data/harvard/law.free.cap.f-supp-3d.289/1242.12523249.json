The dispute is between a non-Indian, Lynn Becker, and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation (the Tribe)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   under a contract that includes express waivers of the Tribe's sovereign immunity and any requirement for exhaustion of remedies in the Tribal Court. The Tribe's Business Committee approved the contract by a resolution that incorporated the contract by reference. The Tribe was represented in the transaction by experienced and competent counsel. A tribal ordinance in force at the time expressly stated that the Tribal Court lacked jurisdiction over such a dispute with the Tribe. In connection with entering the contract with Becker, the Tribe adopted the Ute Energy Operating Agreement, amended three times, for which the Tribe requested and received certification from the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, that no federal approval was required because it created no interest in trust lands subject to approval. The Operating Agreements provided for the distribution of Ute Energy's profits and losses, a percentage to which Becker now claims he is entitled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Becker alleges that, after he fully performed all obligations required by the contract, the Tribe refused to pay him according to the terms of the contract. After accepting full performance under the contract, and after a change in the makeup of the Business Committee, the Tribe now claims the contract was void from the beginning and that the express waivers, including waivers of sovereign immunity and tribal jurisdiction, have no effect. The dispute has now been pending in state court for more than three years and is set to begin a nine-day jury trial on February 20, 2018. The state court has heard and rejected the Tribe's arguments, finding that it has jurisdiction over the dispute, and the Tribe's requests for interlocutory appeals in the state appellate courts have been denied. Moreover, the issues of waiver and jurisdiction have been raised in three separate appeals to the Tenth Circuit, resulting in decisions that have left resolution of the jurisdictional dispute to this court in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On remand from the Tenth Circuit, the Tribe now asks this court to enter a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction precluding the state court from trying Becker's breach of contract claims. The United States Supreme Court, and other lesser courts, have provided strong guidance that this court should allow the state court to determine its own jurisdiction, except in the most extraordinary circumstances. This is particularly true when, as here, the underlying merits presented for declaratory judgment in this court are primarily federal defenses to the state law claims now poised for resolution by the state court. For the reasons set forth below,\n   the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction and stays this case pending resolution of the issues before the state court, the state courts of appeal, and any possible appeal to the United States Supreme Court. Where such remedies are available to the parties, this court should refrain from becoming involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Becker entered an independent contractor agreement (the contract) with the Tribe, effective 2004, to provide services related to the Tribe's development of its energy and mineral resources. (ECF No. 4-1.) The contract contains the following provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Article 21. Governing law and Forum. This Agreement and all disputes arising hereunder shall be subjected to, governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah. All disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be resolved in the United States District Court for the District of Utah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Article 23. Limited Waiver of Sovereign Immunity; Submission to Jurisdiction. If any Legal Proceeding (definition follows) should arise between the Parties hereto, the Tribe agrees to a limited waiver of the defense of sovereign immunity, to the extent such defense may be available, in order that such legal proceeding be heard and decided in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.... The Tribe specifically surrenders its sovereign power to the limited extent necessary to permit the full determination of questions of fact and law and the award of appropriate remedies in any Legal Proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Parties hereto unequivocally submit to the jurisdiction of the following courts: (i) U.S. District Court for the District of Utah, and appellate courts therefrom, and (ii) if, and only if, such courts also lack jurisdiction over such case, to any court of competent jurisdiction and associated appellate courts.... the Tribe waives any requirement of Tribal law stating that Tribal courts have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving the Tribe and waives any requirement that such Legal Proceedings be brought in Tribal Court or that Tribal remedies be exhausted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    (Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In February 2013, following a dispute concerning Becker's compensation under the contract, Becker sued the Tribe in the United States District Court for the District of Utah for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and accounting claims. The Tribe moved to dismiss under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Judge Dee Benson dismissed the action, concluding that under the \"well-pleaded complaint rule\" Becker's causes of action were all state causes of action and thus the complaint did not meet the federal question requirement set forth in 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1331.\n   <em>\n    Becker v.

(ECF No. 67-3.) The Tribe moved to dismiss, and on July 23, 2015, Judge Barry Lawrence denied the Tribe's motion. Judge Lawrence found, in part, (1) that the independent contractor agreement \"contained a clear and express waiver of sovereign immunity\" and was \"accompanied by the required Resolution in which the Tribal Business Committee resolved to enter the Agreement;\" (2) that this process complied with Ute Law section 1-8-5; (3) that the Tribe contractually \"consented to any court of competent jurisdiction and thus consented to suit in Utah;\" and (4) that Public Law 280 does not prohibit \"a non PL-280 State like Utah from having jurisdiction in a case where the Tribe has consented to jurisdiction.\" (Order Denying Mot. to Dismiss 2-3, ECF No. 67-4 (citing\n   <em>\n    C &amp; L Enters., Inc. v.

The Complaint alleges the Tribe is entitled to the following: (1) declaratory judgment that the state court lacks subject matter jurisdiction; (2) declaratory judgment finding the independent contract agreement void under federal and tribal law; (3) declaratory judgment that the Tribe did not waive sovereign immunity; and (4) injunctive relief enjoining the state court from further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Tribe also filed a Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (Original TRO). (ECF No. 13.) The crux of the Tribe's Original TRO was that the contract is void because it was not approved by the Department of the Interior, and that the waiver of sovereignty provision is invalid because it was not approved by the Tribe's Business Committee, as required by tribal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341624,12341633,12341642,12341616\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/398/54/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response to the Tribe's federal complaint, Judge Lawrence filed a motion to dismiss.

One day later, December 7, 2017, the Tribe filed 868 pages of memoranda and appendices consisting of four motions: two expedited motions for summary judgment and for interim and permanent injunctions on grounds of federal preemption, infringement of tribal sovereignty, the state court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction, illegality of the agreement, and illegality of the waiver of sovereign immunity provision within the agreement, (ECF Nos. 52, 53); an Emergency Motion for Injunctive Relief under Rule 56 to permanently \"enjoin\" the state court action, (ECF Nos. 54, 55); and a Verified Motion to Expedite Briefing and Rulings on the Ute Tribe's Motions for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction, (ECF No. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   A week later, on December 14, 2017, this court issued an Order Requesting Supplemental Briefing.

As explained above this court finds, however, its jurisdiction to decide the merits of the Tribe's declaratory judgment claims is based solely on supplemental jurisdiction under \u00a7 1367, which it has declined to exercise.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    C &amp; L Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301349\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/411/\">\n    532 U.S. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121 S.Ct. at 1597 (holding that a contract's arbitration requirement was sufficient to waive the tribe's sovereign immunity and support remand to the state court);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shingle Springs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%204054232\">\n    2010 WL 4054232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (finding a simple contract dispute between a tribe and a California corporation did not give rise to \u00a7 1362 jurisdiction);\n   <em>\n    Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v.

Based on the circumstances here and this case law, the court finds the \"expressly authorized\" exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The \"necessary in aid\" exception also does not apply. Contrary to the Tribe's position, the mere existence of a parallel state action involving the defenses of tribal preemption and \"interference with tribal sovereignty\" does not meet this exception. The Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [A] federal court does not have inherent power to ignore the limitations of \u00a7 2283 and to enjoin state court proceedings merely because those proceedings interfere with a protected federal right or invade an area pre-empted by federal law, even when the interference is unmistakably clear.... Rather, when a state proceeding presents a federal issue, even pre-emption, the proper course is to seek resolution of that issue by the state court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Chick Kam Choo v. Exxon Corp\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211896\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/140/#p149\">\n    486 U.S. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149-50,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211896\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/140/#p149\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211896\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/140/#p149\">\n    100 L.Ed.2d 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) (citing\n   <em>\n    Atl.

Accordingly, the Tribe must exhaust its federal defenses in the state court, and the \"necessary in aid\" exception does not apply here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Next, the Tribe argues this court has an obligation to \"protect and effectuate judgments entered\" in this case and four others involving the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Becker\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-958-CW, ECF No. 75 at 10 n.10. Notably, the four cases the Tribe cites are distinct from this one because they involved disputes over the exterior boundaries of the reservation and/or prosecution of traffic offenses on tribal land. Thus, any judgments in those cases do not apply to this matter, which involves a contract dispute over payment for services to a non-Indian. Moreover, there is no final judgment for the court to \"protect and effectuate\" in this case. Thus, this exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Because the court concludes the relief sought by the Tribe falls within the purview\n   of the Act, and none of the narrow exceptions to the Act apply, the court may not enjoin the state court or issue any rulings on the pending motions that have the effect of enjoining the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, the decision to defer to the state court is supported by serious questions about the underlying merits of the equitable relief the Tribe seeks. \"The grant of a preliminary injunction is within the sound discretion of the district court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Kiowa Indian Tribe of Okla. v.

The court may issue a preliminary injunction if the movant shows the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   (1) the movant will suffer irreparable harm unless the injunction issues; (2) there is a substantial likelihood the movant ultimately will prevail on the merits; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs any harm the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) the injunction would not be contrary to the public interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540727\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1163/#p1171\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court concludes there are serious concerns about whether these conditions would likely be met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   First, the Tribe will not suffer irreparable harm because it can address (and has addressed) all of its federal defenses in the state court action. Second, there is a serious question of whether the Tribe is likely to prevail on the merits. The question of this court's alleged original jurisdiction is inextricably related to whether the contract contains a valid waiver of sovereignty, preemption, tribal exhaustion, and the applicability of Public Law 280-all involving state-law issues that Judge Lawrence is better suited to decide. This is true because the Tribe has yet to offer an explanation for how the Tribal Court has jurisdiction over a dispute expressly precluded by an ordinance in place at the time the contract was entered\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and by the Tribal Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Yazzie\n   </em>\n   about the effect of this ordinance.\n   <em>\n    Yazzie v. Ute Indian Tribe\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CV-09-188, at 3 (holding that where Ordinance 87-04 divested the Ute Tribal Court of jurisdiction over claims against the Tribe, \"a tribal ordinance is required to amend the Law and Order Code to restore the Ute Tribal Court's jurisdiction over claims brought against the Tribe and its officers\"). Those issues are best left for the state court to decide after trial and upon full presentation of the evidence. Third, if this court decides these issues now, Becker, the opposing party, would suffer irreparable harm given the advanced stage of the state court action, including the upcoming trial. Fourth, the public interest weighs strongly in favor of allowing the state court to\n   determine its own jurisdiction and determine the enforceability of the contract, especially given that Judge Lawrence can address any and all federal issues raised by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For these reasons, the court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under \u00a7 1367 or address any of the Tribe's pending motions. Instead, the court stays this matter pending resolution of these issues in the state court, including any appellate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    The Plaintiffs in this matter also include the Uintah and Ouray Tribal Business Committee, Shaun Chapoose, former Chairman of the Tribal Business Committee, and Ute Energy Holdings, LLC.
