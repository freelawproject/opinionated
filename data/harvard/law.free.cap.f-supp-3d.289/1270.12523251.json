Klayman is also the founder and former chairman of Defendant Judicial Watch, another non-profit conservative organization. Defendant American Conservative Union is also a non-profit conservative organization that hosts the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual trade fair for conservative organizations. Plaintiff alleges that Defendants entered into an anticompetitive agreement to exclude Plaintiff from the Conference as a sponsor and exhibitor, and that Klayman would be prohibited from speaking at the conference. Plaintiff alleges that it attempted to obtain a sponsorship at the Conference and make arrangements to have Klayman speak on Plaintiff Freedom Watch's behalf. As a result of the agreement between Defendants, Plaintiff alleges that Freedom Watch and Klayman were excluded from the Conference. Plaintiff avers that this exclusion deprived the Conferences' attendees of the ability to learn more about Plaintiff Freedom Watch and potentially donate to its cause. In addition, Plaintiff submits that it was deprived of the opportunity to increase its prestige, goodwill, and the ability to increase its business interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Amended Complaint includes two counts. Count I is a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count II is claim under Florida law for tortious interference with a prospective business advantage. Defendant Judicial Watch moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint with several procedural and substantive arguments, including:\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , standing, and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Defendant American Conservative Union also moves to dismiss on two bases: standing and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court denies the motion to dismiss finding that this district is a more adequate forum, but grants the motion to dismiss finding that Defendants have not engaged in commercial activity subject to the antitrust laws of the Sherman Act. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim in Count II and dismisses that count without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Forum Non Conveniens\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Judicial Watch moves to dismiss based on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   and asserts\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the District of Columbia is the more proper forum for this dispute because each party is formed and headquartered there, and the dispute arises from an alleged agreement regarding a conference held in the District of Columbia. \"Under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , a district court has inherent power to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a case when an adequate, alternative forum is available.\"\n   <em>\n    La Seguridad v.

Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   is not the proper avenue to remove this case from the Southern District of Florida, because none of the facts involve a foreign jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Defendant Judicial Watch's intent was to transfer venue pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Court finds that transfer is not warranted because the Southern District of Florida is the proper forum for this dispute. Judicial Watch has not explicitly stated which judicial district would be a more convenient forum for this dispute, but instead alludes to the connections the parties have with the District of Columbia, and seems to imply that the District of Columbia would be a more convenient forum for this suit. Moreover, Judicial Watch argues that the Florida connections Plaintiff relies on, including that a \"substantial part\" of Plaintiff's supporters reside in the Miami-Dade and Broward counties, that several Florida supporters and entities attended and sponsored the Conference, and that Defendants are registered to conduct business in Florida, are insufficient and irrelevant to the claims in this case. Plaintiff counters that even if Plaintiff indeed intended for the District of Columbia to be the alternative forum, Judicial Watch's justification that the Conference's location weighs in favor of the District of Columbia is misguided, because the Conference took place in Maryland, a judicial district separate from the District of Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff adds that the Southern District of Florida is best suited for this dispute because it is registered to do business in Florida and Judicial Watch has an office in Miami, Florida. Furthermore, a large portion of the evidence and possible witnesses, including Plaintiff's donors who attended the Conference and would have donated to Plaintiff had it been permitted to attend, are located in the Southern District of Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On a motion to transfer venue, the Court engages in a two-part inquiry. First, the Court must consider whether the case might have been brought in the transferee court.\n   <em>\n    Team Sys. Int'l, LLC v. AQuate Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:13-CV-427-KOB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201346788\">\n    2013 WL 1346788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (N.D. Ala. Apr. 1, 2013). Second, the Court must ask whether the balance of factors under \u00a7 1404(a) weighs in favor of transferring this action to the transferee court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201346788\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The factors include: (1) convenience of witnesses; (2) the location of relevant documents and the relative ease of access to sources of proof; (3) the convenience of the parties; (4) the locus of operative facts; (5) the availability of process to compel the attendance of unwilling witnesses; (6) the relative means of the parties; (7) a forum's familiarity with the governing law; (8) the weight accorded a plaintiff's choice of forum; (9) trial efficiency and the interest of justice, based on the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manuel v.

However, after balancing the \u00a7 1404(a) factors, the Court finds that neither the District of Maryland, nor the District of Columbia are adequate alternative forums. The Parties' only connection to the District of Columbia is that all three entities were formed and headquartered there. Similarly, their only connection to the District of Maryland is that the Conference takes place there. All other factors-namely potential witnesses' in the Southern District of Florida and Plaintiff's choice of forum-favor venue in the Southern District of Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Antitrust standing generally has two requirements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an \"antitrust injury\" and (2) the plaintiff must be an \"efficient enforcer\" of the antitrust laws.\n   <em>\n    Duty Free Americas, Inc. v.

The Court disagrees. At its core, the Conservative Political Action Conference is nothing more than a gathering of individuals intending to raise funds, generate awareness for the conservative movement, and influence public officials to govern conservatively. Contrary to Defendants' contention, the Parties' legal status as nonprofit organizations is not dispositive. The crux of the issue is whether Defendants performed acts that were commercial in nature. They did not-the Conference is nothing more than a social event. In fact, this noncommercial activity\n   is precisely what Congress intended to shy away from the auspices of antitrust regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi v.

Even taking Plaintiff's well-pleaded allegations as true, which the Court must on a motion to dismiss, Plaintiff still does not allege any facts that could support its antitrust claims.
