In response, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to join a party under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19. (Docket No. 96). Plaintiffs then filed a motion for voluntary dismissal as to defendant PRMDIC and asked the Court to deny Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Docket No. 97). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiffs' motion for voluntary withdrawal is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Defendants' motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Docket No. 28 \u00b6 3.3). The tissue was sent to Integrated Psychology Services (\"IPS\"), where Dr. Nella Fern\u00e1ndez diagnosed a type of cancer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .4.

Nevertheless, her doctors at Hospital Auxilio Mutuo concealed this information from her, referring her to an oncologist, and limiting themselves to telling her that she did not need cancer therapy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10, 3.12; 3.16-3.17.

Likewise, Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez, one of the doctors who misdiagnosed Guzm\u00e1n-Fonalledas, allegedly moved to Florida. (Docket No. 98 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to the misdiagnosis and the ensuing damages, Plaintiffs sued Hospital Espa\u00f1ol Auxilio Mutuo and various physicians for concealing the misdiagnosis, as well as Dr. Carlo-Vargas, Dr. Fernandez, and their employer, IPS, for the misdiagnosis. Plaintiffs allege that all defendants are jointly and severally liable. (Docket No. 28 \u00b6 3.27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs amended their complaint twice. First, to add Puerto Rico Medical Defense Insurance Company (\"PRMDIC\") as insurer of IPS, Dr. Carlo-Vargas, and Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez; then, to drop Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez as a named party because her presence would deprive the Court of diversity jurisdiction. (Docket Nos. 12; 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint alleging that PRMDIC, as an insurer of Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez, was a citizen of Florida, thus depriving the Court of diversity jurisdiction. (Docket No. 96).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants also argued that Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez was an indispensable party under Rule 19, and because joining her would defeat diversity jurisdiction, the Court had to dismiss the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, Plaintiffs\n   requested the Court to dismiss without prejudice PRMDIC and deny Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Docket No. 97). Defendants opposed the motion for voluntary dismissal and insisted that Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez was an indispensable party. (Docket 98). As a result, the Court ordered the parties to file memoranda discussing whether Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez was an indispensable party. (Docket No. 105). Having reviewed their submissions, the Court will now proceed to discuss the motion for voluntary dismissal and motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Plaintiff's Motion for Voluntary Dismissal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants contest Plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal of PRMDIC. Rule 41(a)(2) permits a plaintiff to request dismissal of an action \"by court order, on terms that the court considers proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Cason v. Puerto Rico Elec. Power Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266301\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/971/#p976\">\n    770 F.3d 971\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 976 (1st Cir. 2014) (citing FED. R. CIV. P.41(a)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Col\u00f3n-Cabrera v. Esso Standard Oil Co.

The First Circuit has held that \"[t]he rule allows a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss his own case as long as 'no other party will be prejudiced.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064505\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/723/82/#p87\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    P.R.

Moreover, Rule 21 \"explicitly vests district courts with authority to allow a dispensable non-diverse party to be dropped at any time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 977. Therefore, here the Court must decide if (1) PRMDIC's voluntary dismissal would prejudice Defendants, and (2) whether PRMDIC is a dispensable non-diverse party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants argue neither that they would be prejudiced by PRMDIC's dismissal, nor that PRMDIC is indispensable. Defendants do argue that Plaintiffs dropped PRMDIC to defeat their motion to dismiss, labeling the motion for voluntary dismissal \"an acknowledgment that diversity jurisdiction is lacking.\" (Docket No. 98 at 2). First, it is inaccurate that Plaintiffs acknowledged that PRMDIC's participation defeated diversity jurisdiction. Plaintiff asked to dismiss PRMDIC \"in the interest of saving valuable time, energy and resources of the parties and of the Court\" because the party was dispensable in the context of joint and several liability. (Docket No. 97 at 1). Second, even assuming that Defendants are correct and PRMDIC is a non-diverse party, Plaintiffs were entitled to drop them from the case to cure the jurisdictional defect under Rule 21.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cason\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266301\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/971/#p976\">\n    770 F.3d at 977\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants also argue that dismissing PRMDIC \"does not cure the fatal jurisdictional defect\" because Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez is an indispensable party who must be joined under Rule 19. Yet this goes to the merits of their motion to dismiss, and has nothing to do with their opposition to PRMDIC's dismissal. Therefore, Plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal as to PRMDIC is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The motion hinged on Defendants' belief that PRMDIC was not a diverse party under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But PRMDIC is no longer a party to this case because the Court has granted Plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal. Therefore, Defendants' motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    12(b)(7) Failure to Join a Party under Rule 19\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rule 12(b)(7) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires a court to dismiss a case for failure to join a party under Rule 19, which governs the required joinder of parties. FED. R. CIV. P.12(b)(7) ; 19. Under Rule 19(a), the Court must determine if a party must be joined if feasible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If it concludes a party must be joined, Rule 19(b) instructs it to consider if \"doing so is actually feasible.\"\n   <em>\n    Maldonado-Vinas v. Nat'l W. Life Ins.

If the Court concludes that a person must be joined but jounder is not feasible, \"the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.\" FED. R. CIV. P.19(b) In other words, the Court must determine if the party is \"indispensable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although Rule 19 lists factors to consider and determine if a party is necessary and indispensable, it is unnecessary to dive deep into the Rule 19 analysis here because Dr. Fernandez's status as a joint tortfeasor neatly disposes of the issue. \"It has long been the rule that it is not necessary for all joint tortfeasors to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Alejandro-Ortiz v.
