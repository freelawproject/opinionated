Mass. Nov. 27, 2017), and only briefly summarizes the relevant background information here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Humanitarian Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioners are Christian Indonesian nationals who have lived in New Hampshire for many years (some for over a decade), but are subject to final Orders of Removal. In 2010, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") instituted a humanitarian program called \"Operation Indonesian Surrender\" in New Hampshire. Petitioners and other Indonesian nationals with final Orders of Removal were encouraged to come \"out of the shadows\" and identify themselves to ICE during the program. In exchange, they were granted temporary stays of removal and placed under Orders of Supervision (\"OSUPs\"). These OSUPs allowed them to seek employment and also prescribed conditions with which the recipients had to comply. Petitioners lived and\n   worked under these OSUPs without incident until 2017 and generally complied with their conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government never made any promises or agreements that the program participants could stay in the country indefinitely. However, nothing in the record suggests that Petitioners were notified that they would forfeit the right to assert changed country conditions if they did not file motions to reopen while they participated in Operation Indonesian Surrender. They reasonably relied on their OSUPs in not filing motions to reopen earlier and had no reason to suspect that the Government would abruptly change its mind about the humanitarian program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 1, 2017, a group of Petitioners checked in with ICE pursuant to the conditions of their OSUPs. They were informed that they would be subject to a \"thirty-thirty\" deportation schedule: they would have to depart for Indonesia no later than thirty days after their upcoming thirty-day check-in appointment (i.e., sixty days from August 1, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fears of Persecution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioners' expert, Jeffrey Winters, Ph.D., states that Indonesian society has recently faced a \"rising tide of extremist Islam.\" Winters Aff. (Docket No. 49-6) \u00b6 8. Petitioners have presented evidence that they may face \"intimidation, physical harm, and threats to their personal safety and well-being,\" based on their Christian religion, if they returned to Indonesia. Winters Aff. (Docket No. 49-6) \u00b6 2. According to Dr. Winters, since 2012, the level of violence and intolerance directed at religious minorities has increased at a \"shocking rate,\" and Christian Indonesians face an \"extremely high probability of persecution.\" Winters Supp. Aff. (Docket No. 88-1) \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Dr. Winters's supplemental affidavit further states that law enforcement in Indonesia is unlikely to provide meaningful protection to religious minorities-and Evangelical Christians, like Petitioners, in particular-in the face of violence and intolerance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Winters Supp. Aff. (Docket No. 881) \u00b6\u00b6 14, 33. He writes that \"the Indonesian government actively supports Islamic extremists who are anti-Christian\" and \"will punish those who are 'vocal' and 'assertive' Christians, such as Plaintiffs.\" Winters Supp. Aff. (Docket No. 88-1) \u00b6 6. Dr. Winters also cites a 2013 United States government report, which found that the Indonesian government \"did not enforce laws that would protect vulnerable groups and religions\" and \"collaborated with hardline groups against members of sects they deemed to be 'deviant.' \" Winters Aff. (Docket No. 49-6) \u00b6 08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   His supplemental affidavit also includes articles covering this case in the media in Indonesia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Winters Supp. Aff. (Docket No. 88-1) Ex. A. Although names of some of the Petitioners are mentioned in media coverage, Petitioners have presented no affidavits about their individual situations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BIA Procedures\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Congress created a statutory right for each alien to file a motion to reopen immigration proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    Perez Santana v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705470\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/50/#p51\">\n    731 F.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51 (1st Cir. 2013). Based on the alleged changed conditions in Indonesia, Petitioners seek to file motions to reopen with the BIA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) (\"There is no time limit on the filing of a motion to reopen ... based on changed country conditions ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Petitioners may request from the BIA a stay of their removal pending a ruling on the motion to reopen. A stay is discretionary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gearin Decl. (Docket No. 36-2) \u00b6 7. A stay request can only be submitted to the BIA if the individual previously filed or contemporaneously files a motion to reopen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BIA Practice Manual \u00a7 6.4(b). The BIA \"categorizes stay requests into two categories: emergency and non-emergency.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3705470\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/50/#p51\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.4(d). But the BIA does not consider stay requests on an immediate \"emergency\" basis unless removal is imminent and the individual is in ICE's physical custody. Gearin Decl. (Docket No. 36-2) \u00b6\u00b6 8-9;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   BIA Practice Manual \u00a7 6.4(d)(i). Petitioners are not in physical custody, so the BIA's emergency stay procedures would not apply to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Instead, Petitioners would be subject to the \"non-emergency\" stay procedures. The BIA's practice manual states that it \"does not rule immediately on a 'non-emergency' stay request, but considers the request during the normal course of adjudication.\" BIA Practice Manual \u00a7 6.4(d)(ii). In practice, the BIA often does not rule on non-emergency stay requests from non-detained individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chan Decl. (Docket No. 72-2) \u00b6 12; Mesa Aff. (Docket No. 72-6) \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; Piereson Aff. (Docket No. 72-7) \u00b6 11. When the BIA does rule on non-emergency stay requests, it typically does so at the same time that it decides the motion to reopen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Greenstein Aff. (Docket No. 72-3) \u00b6 19. Even if the BIA rules on the motion for a stay and denies it, there is no right to appeal the stay denial until the BIA also rules on the motion to reopen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gando-Coello v. I.N.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524497\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/857/25/#p26\">\n    857 F.2d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 1988) (holding that BIA's denial of stay pending disposition of motion to reopen is not a final administrative order reviewable by Court of Appeals).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In sum, absent a judicial stay, contrary to the Government's assertions, I find that it is likely that Petitioners will be deported to Indonesia\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   their motions to stay and motions to reopen are considered by the BIA and the Court of Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Preliminary Injunction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The Court previously found that the Immigration Court's procedures for adjudicating motions to reopen and motions to stay \"typically are an adequate and effective administrative alternative to habeas corpus relief consistent with the Suspension Clause.\" Docket No. 65 at 19. However, the Court did not address the adequacy of the opportunity for judicial review. The Court also reserved the question of whether the BIA's procedures are an adequate and effective substitute\n   for habeas relief for these Petitioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 65 at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the fuller record now before the Court, I find that the BIA's processes for adjudicating motions to reopen and motions to stay are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   adequate administrative alternatives to habeas for these Petitioners. The Government has conceded that Petitioners-who are not in custody-would not be subject to the BIA's emergency stay procedures. Gearin Decl.

This injunctive relief is consistent with Congressional intent.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh v.

(Docket No. 72-1) \u00b6\u00b6 10-11 (explaining that \"the A-File provides the necessary baseline for comparison\" for a changed country conditions motion); Greenstein Aff. (Docket no. 72-3) \u00b6 16 (noting that the Records of Proceedings available for review in the Immigration Court are not a sufficient substitute for the full A-file); Realmuto Aff. (Docket No. 49-5) \u00b6 10 (describing differences between A-file and Record of Proceedings). These affidavits are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Immigration attorneys also have stated that counsel for Petitioners will need six weeks to three months after receiving the A-files to submit the motions to reopen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Anker Decl.
