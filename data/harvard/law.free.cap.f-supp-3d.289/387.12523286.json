Plaintiff was exonerated of Mitchell's murder in 2016 after another man confessed the precise details of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 7, 2017, Dukes brought this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and related state law asserting claims for malicious prosecution, denial of his fair trial rights, a violation of his right against self-incrimination, and negligence\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against defendants City of Albany (the \"City\") and the six detectives involved in obtaining his false confession and then securing his wrongful conviction: Detective Kenneth Wilcox (\"Detective Wilcox\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective Anthony Ryan (\"Detective Ryan\"), Detective Michael Sbuttoni (\"Detective Sbuttoni\"), Detective Peter McKenna (\"Detective McKenna\"), Detective Sergeant Kevin Breen (\"Detective Sergeant Breen\"), and Detective Ronald Matos (\"Detective Matos\") (collectively \"defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 1, 2017, defendants moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) seeking to dismiss Dukes' complaint in its entirety on the basis of various principles of claim and issue preclusion. The motion has been fully briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are taken from the complaint and assumed true for purposes of this motion. In 1996, Dukes, who was then 19 years old and living in Albany, agreed to help Matthew Parsons (\"Parsons\") rob Mitchell, a small-time marijuana dealer and college student Parsons met while working at the SUNY Albany cafeteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 4, 1996, Dukes and Parsons, aided by Lavell Jones (\"Jones\"), Pierre Lyons (\"Lyons\"), and Zakee Abdul-Hameed (\"Abdul-Hameed\"), broke into Mitchell's apartment while he was not home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the quintet initially escaped, Albany police managed to identify and charge three of the men-Parsons, Lyons, and Abdul-Hameed (but not Dukes or Jones)-with the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Four months later, on February 18, 1997, someone shot and killed Mitchell in the vestibule of his apartment building. Forensic evidence recovered from the scene indicated Mitchell had been shot at close range by a .25 caliber bullet. Under the supervision of Detective Sergeant Breen, defendants opened an investigation and initially identified Jeffrey Conrad (\"Conrad\") as a potential suspect in the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dukes alleges Conrad was a known felon on probation whose girlfriend lived several doors down from Mitchell, and who had attempted to purchase a firearm shortly before the murder occurred. However, defendants completely neglected to investigate Conrad because they believed one or more of the participants in the earlier robbery must have also carried out the later murder. According to plaintiff's complaint, defendants hatched a plan to turn this hunch into one or more murder convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 19, 1997, the day after Mitchell's murder, detectives interviewed Parsons, who they had initially arrested for the robbery months earlier. Although he denied any knowledge of the murder, the detectives tried again on April 30, 1997, interrogating Parsons until they succeeded in coercing him into claiming he \"heard\" from an unidentified person that Dukes and Abdul-Hameed had gone back to Mitchell's apartment to look for someone else, unexpectedly ran into Mitchell, and shot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On September 8, 1997, while Dukes sat in the Albany County jail awaiting trial on an unrelated charge, defendants ordered him brought to the Albany County Courthouse. When plaintiff arrived he was met by Bertrand Gould, his public defender. Attorney Gould explained to plaintiff that defendants wanted to speak to him about an ongoing robbery investigation. Plaintiff was then brought into a conference room where several detectives were waiting. At that point, Attorney Gould announced that \"due to a conflict of interest\" he would not remain in the room for the interrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Beginning around 9:00 a.m., Detectives Wilcox and Matos interrogated Dukes about the robbery of Mitchell's apartment. Although they did not read him his Miranda rights, they asked plaintiff to initial a form stating they had in fact done so. By 12:30 p.m., defendants convinced plaintiff to acknowledge his involvement in the October robbery and persuaded him to sign a statement Detective Matos had prepared to that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dukes alleges Detective Matos had secretly added language to this written statement which falsely indicated plaintiff also had knowledge of Mitchell's murder in February. According to plaintiff, the detectives' questioning that morning did not\n   touch on the subject of the murder at all and therefore plaintiff failed to notice defendants had included information about this second crime before he signed the statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After taking a break for lunch, Detectives Wilcox and Matos resumed the interrogation, again asking Dukes to initial a form acknowledging his Miranda rights even though they never actually read them to him. The detectives then began to question plaintiff about Mitchell's murder. Plaintiff repeatedly denied having any involvement in the murder, at one point breaking down in tears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nevertheless, Detective Wilcox began to feed Dukes a false narrative in which plaintiff had gone to Mitchell's apartment with Jones and Lyons, two of the other robbers, and that Jones had shot Mitchell. Detective Wilcox demanded that plaintiff adopt this story, and threatened plaintiff with the death penalty if he refused. Eventually, plaintiff relented and signed a statement, again prepared by Detective Matos, which recounted the story Detective Wilcox had pushed onto plaintiff. Attorney Gould returned to the room and terminated the interview. Plaintiff was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After obtaining Dukes' coerced confession, defendants were faced with a problem: plaintiff's story was inconsistent with the prior coerced statement from Parsons, which claimed Abdul-Hameed (not Jones or Lyons) had been with plaintiff at Mitchell's apartment the night of the murder. Defendants resolved this inconsistency by obtaining a second false corroborating statement from Parsons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But defendants weren't done yet. They proceeded to build the murder case against Dukes by eliciting false confessions from Jones and Lyons using the same aggressive interrogation tactics employed against plaintiff. First, Detectives McKenna and Ryan traveled to Brooklyn, where Jones had been arrested during a traffic stop, and coerced him into signing a statement falsely admitting his involvement in Mitchell's murder. In addition, these detectives coerced Jones's girlfriend into signing a statement falsely claiming Jones had confessed directly to her. Second, Detectives Matos and Sbuttoni traveled to Georgia where they induced Lyons, one of the other robbers, to make yet another false statement implicating plaintiff and Jones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 6, 1998, Dukes faced trial in Albany County Court on the robbery and murder charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   No forensic evidence tied plaintiff to the February murder, and when Parsons was called to testify he recanted his false statement implicating plaintiff. Instead, the prosecution relied on Detectives Wilcox and Matos, both of whom testified falsely about the circumstances of plaintiff's interrogation and the validity of his confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The jury relied on this evidence to convict Dukes of the February murder as well as the October burglary and robbery of Mitchell's home. Plaintiff was sentenced to 25 years to life for the murder, and to 12.5 to 25 years for the robbery. Plaintiff took a direct appeal, and later sought habeas relief, but various courts rejected his claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 3, 2014, 17 years after Dukes' original arrest, police in Ohio arrested Conrad, the man initially identified as a suspect in Mitchell's murder, for the stabbing death of his girlfriend. During an interrogation by the Cuyahoga County police, Conrad confessed to Mitchell's murder, accurately stating numerous details, including the distinctive position in which\n   Mitchell's body had fallen as well as the relatively unique caliber of bullet used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Upon learning of Conrad's confession, Dukes sought relief from Supreme Court, Albany County, which granted vacatur of both of plaintiff's convictions. Although the County Court dismissed the murder charge outright, it did not dismiss the charges arising from the October robbery of Mitchell's apartment. Plaintiff pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree in satisfaction of this remaining charge, received a sentence of 7 to 14 years (since he had already served 18 years on the murder and robbery convictions), and was released. This action followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the '[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ginsburg v.

Defendants offer three reasons why plaintiff's claims must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Collateral Estoppel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, defendants contend Dukes cannot re-litigate whether his confession was coerced because this issue was raised and rejected at his criminal trial and in his post-conviction proceedings.

Although they concede plaintiff's murder conviction has since been vacated, defendants point out that it was vacated based on new evidence of another man's guilt rather than a specific finding that plaintiff's confession was involuntary. According to defendants, the decisions of the state appellate court and the federal habeas court affirming the admission of plaintiff's confession remain valid and bar re-litigation of the coercion issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Working from the assumption that estoppel bars litigation in this case over the propriety of the confession, defendants go on to make arguments about why each of Dukes' claims for relief must fail. First, defendants argue plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim must be dismissed because his adjudged-voluntary confession gave officers probable cause to charge him with murder. Second, defendants contend this conclusion also forecloses his coercion and denial of fair trial rights claims because they are premised on an allegedly invalid confession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Third, defendants argue Dukes'\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim must be dismissed because he is estopped from demonstrating either an individual constitutional violation (for instance, a coerced confession) which might have been caused by an underlying policy or practice attributable to the City. Fourth, defendants contend plaintiff's negligence claim must be dismissed because plaintiff cannot use evidence that officers coerced his confession to demonstrate the City's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Dukes responds that the vacatur of his murder conviction prevents that criminal judgment, as well as any of the post-conviction decisions reviewing it, from having any preclusive effect in this case. Plaintiff further argues the issue of coercion was never actually litigated in any of those prior proceedings. According to plaintiff, the suppression hearing and post-conviction challenges were limited to the issue of whether plaintiff knowingly waived his right to counsel before the interrogation, not the voluntariness of the uncounseled confession itself. Finally, plaintiff invokes equitable principles to contend it would be unjust to preclude him from seeking recourse here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants' interpretation of collateral estoppel seems plainly wrong-a vacated criminal conviction cannot have preclusive effect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Church v.

Plaintiff's murder confession, obtained outside the presence of counsel, was put in serious doubt after another man credibly confessed to the crime. Indeed, it is on this basis that the County Court tossed out plaintiff's conflicting murder conviction. At this point, it would be inequitable to deny plaintiff the opportunity to demonstrate his rights were violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In light of the relaxed standard applicable at the motion-to-dismiss stage, Dukes has pleaded sufficient facts to support his claims of individual constitutional violations as well as the existence of a policy or practice attributable to the City. Accordingly, defendants' estoppel arguments as to each of plaintiff's claims will be rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Claim Accrual\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants next argue that Dukes' \u00a7 1983 and negligence claims are time-barred because the applicable limitations period began to run either at the time of his confession, arrest, indictment, or conviction, the latest of which occurred at least 16 years before he filed this civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The statute of limitations for \u00a7 1983 actions is the same as that for personal injury actions in the state in which the cause of action arose.\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

Likewise, plaintiff's challenges to the fairness of his original trial only put in doubt his original convictions, not his later guilty plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Furthermore, as noted above the murder and robbery charges Dukes faced are so distinct that are effectively two separate prosecutions. Given that the\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Heck\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   bar is in many ways analogous to the favorable termination element of malicious prosecution, the question of whether a mixed verdict gives rise to a\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Heck\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   -based bar may be analyzed in the same way the favorable termination element is analyzed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 484-85, 489-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Again, the charges of conviction should be compared to the acquitted (or dismissed) charges to determine whether they are sufficiently distinct.
