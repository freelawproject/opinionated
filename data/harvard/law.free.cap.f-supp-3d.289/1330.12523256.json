This litigation consists of thirty-six actions-thirty-five actions pending in the Eastern District of New York and one action pending in the Eastern District of Texas-as listed on Schedule A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff in the Texas action, Archer and White Sales, Inc. (Archer) opposes centralization. No other parties responded to the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we conclude that centralization is not necessary for the convenience of the parties and witnesses or to further the just and efficient conduct of the litigation. These actions share common factual questions relating to allegations that Benco, Patterson, and non-movant Henry Schein, Inc., all of which are distributors of dental supplies and equipment, engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy and agreed to block the entry and expansion of lower-margin distributors (such as Archer) into the market by pressuring manufacturers of dental equipment to refuse to deal with the lower-margin distributors. The procedural posture of these actions, though, weighs heavily against centralization. The Texas action-the only action proposed for transfer-has proceeded at an expeditious pace. Discovery is complete, dispositive motions are pending, and trial is set to begin on May 14, 2018. The New York actions are similarly\n   advanced-discovery is nearly complete, dispositive motions are pending in the\n   <em>\n    SourceOne\n   </em>\n   competitor action, and a class certification motion will be filed in the thirty-four consolidated class actions by February 22, 2018. There are few pretrial proceedings remaining that would benefit from centralized treatment. Accordingly, centralization at this juncture will not produce significant efficiencies and would delay resolution of the actions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Signal Int'l LLC Human Trafficking Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339472\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/38/1390/#p1391\">\n    38 F.Supp.3d 1390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1391 (J.P.M.L. 2014) (denying centralization where common fact discovery was mostly complete and trial was imminent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion for centralization of these actions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MDL No. 2813 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: DENTAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT ANTITRUST LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Eastern District of New York\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   COMFORT CARE FAMILY DENTAL, P.C., ET AL. v.
