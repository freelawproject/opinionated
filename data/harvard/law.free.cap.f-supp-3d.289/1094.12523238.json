At the time of the alleged incidents, Plaintiff was a pre-trial detainee in the custody of Defendant County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 29, 2016, Defendant County filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on December 20, 2016, Defendant Rich filed a motion to stay this action pending the resolution of the state court criminal prosecution against him. (ECF Nos. 7, 11.) On March 21, 2017, the Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's recommendation that the Court dismiss Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim with leave to amend against Defendant County and stay the action as to Defendant Rich at that time, but not as to Defendant County unless and until an answer is filed by Defendant County. (ECF No. 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 4, 2017, Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint, which Defendant County moved to dismiss on April 18, 2017. (ECF Nos. 30, 31.)

The Magistrate Judge also conducted a review hearing as to the stay for Defendant Rich on September 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 29, 2017, the Magistrate Judge filed findings and recommendations on the motion to dismiss and motion to lift the stay. (ECF No. 75.) The findings and recommendations recommended that the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim be dismissed without leave to amend and that the stay be lifted as to Defendant Rich for any evidence of a non-testimonial nature which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights. The Magistrate Judge also recommended that a review hearing be set for 60 days from the date that the order adopting issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 13, 2017, Plaintiff filed objections to the findings and recommendations.

With these standards in mind, the Court turns to the factual allegations in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On or about January 27, 2015 at 9:40pm, Plaintiff, a pretrial detainee, was being taken from the Merced County courthouse back to the John Latorraca Correctional Facility (\"JLCF\"). (SAC \u00b6 12.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Rich, a Correctional Officer that was driving the County vehicle, grabbed and groped her genital area more than once while transporting her back to JLCF (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.) Defendant Rich was terminated and is now\n   facing criminal prosecution for the incident. (ECF No. 75 at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Complaint alleges that on that same day (January 27, 2015), Rich also groped two of his co-workers, (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 25-26), who are referred to herein as Coworker 1 and Coworker 2. Specifically, Rich allegedly and without consent groped Coworker 1's breast. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .) Coworker 1 reported the incident to her supervisor who later reported it to others up the chain of command. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Also on that same day, Defendant Rich grabbed Coworker 2's left buttocks and made sexually inappropriate comments to her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Because both of these events are contemporaneous conduct, the Court does not consider them as contributing toward any pattern/custom allegation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, certain evidence related to the day-of conduct is relevant. First, the Complaint alleges that Coworker 2 had been \"subjected to previous sexual harassment by defendant Rich, including requests to touch her butt,\" but she did not report those incidents because she feared retaliation by Rich or others because she \"heard RICH state several times that he had been through many internal affairs investigations (\"IAs\"), and had gotten out of every single one of them.\" (SAC \u00b6 28.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is an allegation of first person knowledge of sexually inappropriate behavior workplace by Rich prior to January 27, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is also alleged that Coworker 2 told another female correctional officer (Coworker 3) about the incident on January 27, 2015. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.) Coworker 3 responded in a manner that indicated she was aware of Defendant Rich's propensity to engage in such behavior (i.e., inappropriate sexual touching). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, it is alleged that Coworker 2 told Coworker 3 that Rich \"had done something highly inappropriate to her,\" and asked \"please don't leave me alone with him again[,]\" to which Coworker 3 replied: \"Oh, I figured. That's why I came back.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Complaint goes into further detail about Coworker 3's experience with Defendant Rich. It is alleged that at some point prior to (perhaps by several weeks) the January 27, 2015 incident, Coworker 3 made a formal written complaint to a supervisor, Sgt. Tilley, that Defendant Rich engaged in \"sexually abusive and harassing behavior at JLCF\" by masturbating in front of her in an isolated area of the facility, despite her protests. Sgt. Tilley reported this to Lt. Jason Goins who later became the Undersheriff for the County. (SAC \u00b6 21.) \"[Coworker 3] testified that this had happened several times at work, in the control room at JLCF, which is a secluded area...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Furthermore, Plaintiff alle\n   ges that after conferring with Lt. Goins, Sgt. Tilley decided not to investigate Coworker 3's complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The timing of this incident and Coworker 3's reporting of it to her supervisors vis-\u00e0-vis the January 27, 2015 incident is somewhat unclear. The Complaint alleges that the incident occurred in \"early 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It is less clear, and the F &amp; Rs discuss at length, when it was reported to supervisory staff. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 75 at 19-20.) However, the Court finds that because the applicable \"constructive notice\" standard does not require direct notice, the timing of the reporting is not dispositive of the materiality of this incident to the present inquiry. It represents an example of Defendant Rich engaging in serious, inappropriate sexual behavior in at JLCF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, Sgt. Tilley testified at Defendant Rich's state criminal preliminary hearing that \"he had\n   <em>\n    received complaints about RICH before the subject incident\n   </em>\n   , but which he interpreted as personality conflicts he hears on a daily basis as a supervisor.\" (SAC \u00b6 22) (emphasis added.) Sgt. Tilley also admitted personally overhearing Rich \"make sexually inappropriate comments about other female correctional officers, but he dismissed them as 'shop talk.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sgt. Tilley confirmed, under oath, that such shop talk \"was a common occurrence at JLCF...\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, as this Court must at this stage, this testimony, coupled with the fact that Sgt. Tilley decided to take no action on Coworker 3's complaint, plausibly suggests the existence of an environment at JLCF that encouraged and emboldened individuals to act in sexually inappropriate ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Viewing the allegations in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the SAC suggests the existence of a custom of sexually inappropriate touching at JLCF and that the County was on constructive notice of the existence of such a custom. Assuming such a custom did exist, that custom could plausibly amount to deliberate indifference to Plaintiff's rights and be the driving force behind the violation of her rights. As a pretrial detainee, Plaintiff was in a position of less power than the various corrections officers involved in the prior incidents discussed above. It is plausible to infer from the circumstances alleged that if JLCF employees experienced sexually inappropriate conduct of the nature alleged, detainees would be subject to similar (if not worse) conduct. Accordingly, the Court declines to adopt the findings and recommendations with regard to Plaintiff's policy/custom allegation. Defendant's motion to dismiss is DENIED as to this form of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court adopts the findings and recommendations (\"F &amp; Rs\") as to the failure to train, inadequacies in hiring, and ratification theories of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability (ECF No. 75 at 15-18). As the F &amp; Rs discuss, Plaintiff acknowledges a failure to train employees not to commit sexual assault is not a plausible claim since there is no patently obvious need to train officers not to sexually assault women.

(SAC \u00b6\u00b6 15, 56.) The Court agrees with the F &amp;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Rs that, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   , here there were no closely analogous written regulations, rules, or policies that would have put the County on notice that its policy to permit individual male officers to transport female detainees was deficient. Rather, the only evidence that supports a finding of constructive notice is the evidence discussed above involving the existence of a widespread custom of sexual misconduct by Defendant Rich (and other JLCF employees). However, because the allegations of prior sexual misconduct do not point toward a \"particular\" policy change that would be needed, the Court does not believe a policy deficiency claim has been stated under the\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   standard. In other words, while the past pattern of sexual misconduct plausibly put the County on notice that JLCF employees could sexually touch inmates in an inappropriate manner, nothing in the allegations of past misconduct suggest the sexual touching would be any more likely to occur during transport than in other situations. Why wouldn't the pattern evidence just as easily put the County on notice that male officers should never be permitted to be alone with female inmates in any situation? Deliberate indifference under\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   requires a much more precise link between the conduct that put the municipality on notice and the alleged policy deficiency. As such, the Court finds there is not a sufficient link between the allegations of past sexual misconduct and the deliberate indifference required to establish a deficient policy claim. Accordingly, the Court adopts the F &amp; Rs conclusion as to any\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim based on deficient policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim is DISMISSED WITHOUT LEAVE TO AMEND as to the failure to train, inadequacies in hiring, ratification and deficient policy theories of\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1.

(SAC at \u00b6 12, ECF No. 49.) One of Defendant Rich's responsibilities granted by Defendant County was driving inmates to and from their court appearances. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff was seated on one side of the vehicle with another female inmate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.) A cage separated the female inmates' side from the male inmates' side. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the male inmates were unloaded and gone from the vehicle, Defendant Rich directed Plaintiff to exit the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.) There was no second correctional officer present and there was no video surveillance system or other system of documentation to document incidents or deter misconduct by correctional officers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff asked \"[f]or what?\" and then proceeded to get up from her seat to go to the other side of the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16-17.) In order to move to the other side of the vehicle, Plaintiff had to turn her back to Defendant Rich as she utilized the vehicle's built in step-stool to help her get down to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17.) There were no other correctional Officers around, and specifically, there were no female correctional officers around. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant County failed to require that Defendant Rich be equipped with a body camera or that there be some other camera or observation of his one-one-one, unsupervised contact with a female inmate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As she was on the step-stool part of the vehicle with her back to Defendant Rich, Defendant Rich deliberately, without consent, and in a constitutionally violative fashion reached his arm through her legs and grabbed her vaginal area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff responded with an emphatic question along the lines of, \"what the ...?\" in an immediate, vigorous, loud, and protesting manner as she sat down where she was ordered to sit by Defendant Rich.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   After Plaintiff seated herself, Defendant Rich, who was facing Plaintiff, groped Plaintiff again in her genital area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff was helpless and unable to defend herself because she was in full body shackles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant Rich then drove Plaintiff to the female entrance to the JLCF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.) Defendant Rich groped Plaintiff in the vaginal area as she was stepping out of the van. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff did not physically resist, insult, threaten, touch, batter, or assault Defendant or fail to promptly obey any order prior to or after the alleged batteries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff felt helpless, violated, humiliated, and dehumanized by Defendant Rich's alleged batteries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that when she first reported the incident to officials of Defendant County, she was told to keep quiet about the matter and not to discuss it with anyone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) She alleges that the instruction to Plaintiff by officials not to disclose the matter was pursuant to a custom, policy, or practice of Defendant County to intentionally minimize, conceal, prevent, or otherwise avoid the dissemination throughout Defendant County of information of such incidents and to attempt to avoid or limit documentation of any instances of guard-on-inmate sexual abuse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Merced County is a rural county, where distances between destinations are longer and there are a lot of secluded areas, which enables a male officer to take a detour or pull over in order to achieve a sexual assault on an inmate, so policymakers must be extra vigilant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that prior to the instant incident, Defendant Rich had committed nonconsensual sexual batteries and engaged\n   in sexually abusive and harassing behavior in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant County and that Defendant County knew, should have known, had constructive knowledge, or had reason to know of such conduct by Defendant Rich prior to the instant incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 25-30.) The prior incidents were accomplished using the opportunities created to commit sexual batteries by the policies, or lack or inadequacy thereof, created, executed, perpetuated, and/or facilitated by Defendant County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff provides specific allegations for two incidents of alleged sexual batteries by Defendant Rich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.) Plaintiff alleges that at, before, or around 10:00 a.m. on January 27, 2015, Defendant Rich unlawfully touched a female (coworker 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) This individual was an assistant/medical clerk at JLCF in the jail medical division who worked pursuant to a contract between Defendant County and the California Forensic Medical Group, Inc. (\"CFMG\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Rich unlawfully and without consent groped coworker 1 in the left breast area and accomplished this by utilizing his position to gain private access to coworker 1 in circumstances that provided seclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This incident was reported shortly thereafter to coworker 1's supervisor, who later reported it to others, including officials of Defendant County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Rich had also previously engaged in inappropriate verbal conduct with coworker 1 on a repeated basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that during the same day of the instant incident, but prior to the instant incident, Defendant Rich committed a sexual battery against a female correctional officer at JLCF employed by Defendant County (\"coworker 2\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.) Just as he waited until he had an opportunity to commit the sexual battery against Plaintiff, Defendant Rich waited until he was alone with coworker 2 in a room at JLCF. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Rich asked coworker 2, \"Let me touch your butt, let me touch your butt,\" and then after being refused, asked her, \"Let me lick your clit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After sexually harassing coworker 2 and being refused, Defendant Rich grabbed her in the left buttocks area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff contends this incident was due to Defendant County's failure-and Defendant Rich's knowledge of such failure-to protect female employees and female inmates from him and others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant Rich utilized his position of authority and the access to areas where he would be alone with female coworkers and female inmates to sexually harass and unlawfully and without consent grab the left buttocks of coworker 2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After the incident with coworker 2, but before the instant incident, coworker 2 told another employee of Defendant County at JLCF (\"coworker 3\") that Defendant Rich had done something highly inappropriate to her, pleading, \"Please don't leave me alone with him again.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Coworker 3 responded, \"\u2026That's why I came back,\" which coworker 2 believed indicated that coworker 3 knew of other sexually inappropriate contact by Defendant Rich against others and Defendant Rich's propensities to engage in sexually inappropriate conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.) Plaintiff alleges that coworker 3's response implied and suggests that Defendant Rich's propensities were known within JLCF, and suggests that other correctional officers and \"likely supervisors\" had actual and constructive knowledge of Defendant Rich's \"propensities to commit such sexual batteries, and to touch women inappropriately or otherwise sexually harass them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) On\n   the same day as the instant incident, coworker 2 also said to coworker 3, \"what's wrong with him, he's gross.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that at some time coworker 3 made a formal written complaint to a supervisor, Sgt. Tilley, regarding Defendant Rich engaging in sexually abusive and harassing behavior at JLCF, such as going through repeated masturbation motions in front of her despite her protests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Sgt. Tilley related this information to Lt. Jason Goins, who later became the Undersheriff for Defendant County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to coworker 3, there were several times where Defendant Rich groped himself in front of her in the control room, which is a secluded area, by placing his hand on his private area and thrusting his pelvis around. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After conferring with Lt. Goins, Sgt. Tilley chose not to investigate coworker 3's complaint further, even though there was a mandatory duty to investigate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Sgt. Tilley received complaints about Defendant Rich before the instant incident, but Sgt. Tilley interpreted them as personality conflicts he hears on a daily basis as a supervisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Sgt. Tilley personally overheard Defendant Rich make sexually inappropriate comments about other female correctional officers, but dismissed them as \"shop talk.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sgt. Tilley testified under oath that, \"We sit around and talk about other officers or-or other women in particular, yes. It's-it's a common occurrence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that the \"shop talk\" coupled with the failure to take action in response to coworker 3's report suggests that Defendant County, including supervisors at JLCF, permitted, encouraged, and ratified a sexually charged environment, emboldening Defendant Rich and others to act on their sexual urges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At the time of the instant incident, Defendant County failed to staff its jails at levels that Sgt. Tilley thought they should be at, which was a problem during the 12 years that Sgt. Tilley was there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At the time of the instant incident, Defendant County was experiencing \"extreme\" problems with its video surveillance system, which supervisors, including Sgt. Tilley were aware of, and correctional officers, including Defendant Rich, would have also been aware of. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) The DVR surveillance system at JLCF was not recording to Defendant County's DVR system. (Id.) \"Inferably, an Officer [sic] that wished to engage in sexual misconduct with a female transport inmate, such as RICH, would be able to do so with the knowledge of where there were, and were not, cameras, and with the knowledge that it would be not be recorded to the COUNTY's DVR system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant Rich had previously requested to touch coworker 2's butt, but she was placed in fear of retaliation by Defendant Rich and others because she heard Defendant Rich state several times that he had been through many internal affair investigations (\"IAs\"), and had \"gotten out of every single one of them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant Rich's previous conduct in the presence of coworker 2 and others was physically intimidating to coworker 2. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   After coworker 2 reported the alleged sexual assault by Defendant Rich, her work environment at Defendant County became worse because she was subjected to hostility by employees and correctional\n   officers of Defendant County, which potentially included supervisors, who were supporters of Defendant Rich and/or his conduct, and subjected to intimidation by other employees of Defendant County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Female correctional officers told coworker 2 that they were aware of other similar incidents of female deputies being sexually touched by Defendant Rich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) Plaintiff alleges that these reports by other females, the report by coworker 3, and the other information in the second amended complaint plausibly suggests that Defendant County knew, should have known, had constructive knowledge by virtue of the knowledge of its employees, or had reason to know of such conduct by Defendant Rich prior to the instant incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Coworker 2 testified that Defendant Rich made statements that Defendant Rich was the subject of a number of internal affair (\"IA\") investigations by Defendant County prior to the instant incident and incidents involving coworker 1 and coworker 2, but was exonerated by Defendant County in all of them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff alleges that coworker 3's report of the incident between she and Defendant Rich, which was not investigated and for which Defendant Rich was not disciplined or terminated, the accepted and ratified practice of engaging in sexually charged \"shop talk\" on a daily basis, reports by other female correctional officers being victimized by Defendant Rich, Defendant Rich stating that he had beat his IAs to coworker 2, and the sexual touching of coworker 1, coworker 2, and Plaintiff by Defendant Rich \"taken cumulatively plausibly suggests that at least some of such prior IA incidents/investigations concerning Defendant Rich involved sexual misconduct, including, but not limited to sexual harassment, sexual batteries of female inmates or co-workers, or other inappropriate sexual behavior.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that it is plausible based on Defendant Rich's comment to coworker 2 to infer that he communicated Defendant County's acquiescence in his misconduct in order to generate fear and potentially limit reporting of his misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant County's acquiescence and failure to discipline Defendant Rich for the incident with coworker 3 even though Sgt. Tilley and Lt. Goins were informed about it encouraged and emboldened Defendant Rich to engage in sexual misconduct because it signaled to him that he would not be disciplined by Defendant County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff alleges based on the information stated above and because it would seem highly unlikely that Defendant Rich would decide one day out of the blue to start committing sexual batteries that it is plausible to infer that Defendant Rich had previously engaged in other sexually inappropriate or harassing conduct, and had previously committed nonconsensual sexual batteries in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant County and/or there were facts available to put Defendant County on notice of this. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) Plaintiff alleges that if Defendant County had put proper policies in place and had not encouraged or permitted a \"code of silence\" among correctional staff, a culture that retaliated against or shunned correctional officers that reported misconduct, and a sexually charged culture that engaged in sexual \"shop talk\" daily, Defendant County would have known of at least some of such previous incidents by Defendant Rich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant County's policies, customs, practices, or lack thereof coupled with information about Defendant Rich posed a substantial risk of serious harm to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the information stated above plausibly suggests that supervisors at JLCF, coworkers of Defendant Rich, and officials of Defendant County had actual or constructive knowledge or reason to know of Defendant Rich's propensities and conduct, including inappropriate sexual behavior, sexual misconduct, and/or prior sexual batteries, and the fact that Defendant Rich utilized secluded settings to accomplish sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, indecent acts, and sexual batteries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.) However, they failed to protect female inmates, including Plaintiff, and female coworkers from Defendant Rich, instead continuing to permit Defendant Rich to have unrestricted and secluded access to female inmates and female coworkers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendant Rich's unlawful touching of coworker 1, coworker 2, and Plaintiff was part of a pattern of conduct by Defendant Rich to use his position of authority, power, and seclusion granted to him by Defendant County to commit sexual batteries against female coworkers and female inmates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Rich and other male employees of Defendant County unlawfully touched female coworkers, inmates, and others by exerting the authority and access granted to them by Defendant County and by virtue of Defendant County's failure to properly monitor their movements and activities and failure to implement policies that would prevent individuals like Defendant Rich from having secluded and prolonged contact with female inmates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant County was on both actual and constructive notice based on an abundance of evidence regarding the prevalence of officer-on-inmate sexual assault in correctional facilities and cites to four articles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) Plaintiff also alleges that the widespread knowledge within the corrections and justice systems, and of Defendant County in particular, of officer-on-female inmate assaults, Defendant County's policy failures evidence deliberate indifference to the reasonably foreseeable risk of sexual assault against female inmates by opportunistic male correctional officers, such as Defendant Rich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.) Plaintiff alleges that the risks are recognized and codified in the Department of Justice's \"Standards to Prevent, Detect, and Respond to Prison Rape,\" promulgated pursuant to the Prison Rape Elimination Act (\"PREA\"), and she cites to 42 U.S.C. 15601 as a congressional finding in the PREA that \"experts have conservatively estimated that at least 13 percent of the inmates in the United States have been sexually assaulted in prison.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant County had actual knowledge, reason to know of, or should have known of the risk of the type of harm that befell Plaintiff and cites to several performance modules and policies of Defendant County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 55.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant County had specific reporting requirements for a deputy transporting an inmate for a medical emergency, but no such requirements were provided to deputies with respect to transportation of opposite sex inmates to and from the jail facility and the court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59.) Plaintiff alleges that based on 15 C.C.R. \u00a7 1027, Defendant County should have required that a female correctional officer be present with Defendant Rich and other male correctional officers during opposite-sex transports, and that there is a recognition that it is important to not leave female inmates solely in the care of male correctional officers in secluded circumstances such as transport vans where they are vulnerable to sexual assault. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant County failed to require proper activity logs, or if such logs were required, by failing to properly review, audit, and/or oversee them and enforce the policy requiring them, providing\n   a second officer, providing video coverage, or providing procedures minimizing the risk such as unloading the female inmates first. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   On or about April 21, 2015, Defendant Rich was charged with a felony violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 149 (assault by officer under color of authority) and a misdemeanor violation of Penal Code \u00a7 243.4(e)(1) (sexual battery) for the instant incident, and two additional misdemeanor violations of Penal Code \u00a7 243.4(e)(1) (sexual battery) for the incidents involving coworker 1 and coworker 2.

In Plaintiff's second amended complaint, she alleges that Defendant County failed to properly and adequately hire Defendant Rich, Doe Defendants, and any other personnel under each supervisory defendant's supervision. (SAC at \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.) Plaintiff fails to allege any facts supporting her claim that Defendant County inadequately hired Defendant Rich, any Doe Defendants, and any other personnel under each supervisory defendant's supervision. The Supreme Court found that in claims based on deficiencies related to hiring, \"[o]nly where inadequate scrutiny of an applicant's background would lead a reasonable policymaker to conclude that the plainly obvious consequence of the decision to hire the applicant would be the deprivation of a third party's federally protected right can the official's failure to adequately scrutinize the applicant's background constitute 'deliberate indifference.' \"\n   <em>\n    Board of County Com'rs of Bryan County, Okl. v.

The second amended complaint does not allege any facts describing how Defendant County was deficient in the hiring of Defendant Rich, any doe Defendants, and any other personnel under each supervisory defendant's supervision. Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim based on the hiring of Defendant Rich or other personnel as she has not alleged any facts to support this claim. Thus, the deficiencies in hiring claim should be dismissed. The Court next addresses a ratification theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    c.

To the extent that Plaintiff is alleging a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim based on ratification by the authorized policymakers of Defendant Rich's conduct in the instant incident,\n   Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a ratification theory. Plaintiff alleges that no procedure or prophylactic steps were taken by Defendant County after the instant incident to assure that on-duty transporting deputies did not violate Defendant County's legal duty to keep its prisoners free from sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   To show ratification, a plaintiff must prove that an official with final policy-making authority approved a subordinate's decision or action and the basis for it.\n   <em>\n    Sheehan v.

The fact that Defendant County did not change its policies regarding opposite sex transports from court to JLCF after the instant incident is not sufficient to state a claim on a ratification theory. There are no facts alleged by which the Court can reasonably infer that Defendant County ratified the conduct of Defendant Rich.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff alleges that Defendant County failed to properly supervise, investigate, and/or discipline officers for inappropriate sexual behavior. As the Court stated at the hearing, Defendant Rich's alleged conduct is reprehensible, but the question is whether Plaintiff has sufficiently alleged the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, and specifically, deliberate indifference against Defendant County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   A \"custom\" is a \"widespread practice that, although not authorized by written law or express municipal policy, is so permanent and well-settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Louis v.

Plaintiff alleges in the second amended complaint that prior to the instant incident, Defendant Rich had committed nonconsensual sexual batteries and engaged in sexually abusive and harassing behavior in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant County and that Defendant County knew, should have known, had constructive knowledge, or had reason to know of such conduct by Defendant Rich prior to the instant incident. (SAC at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 25-30.) Plaintiff again alleges that Defendant Rich committed sexual batteries against coworker 1 and coworker 2 on the same date as the instant incident. (Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) Plaintiff adds a new allegation that Defendant Rich groped himself in front of coworker 3, but it is unclear as to when the incident involving coworker 3 was reported, although Plaintiff's counsel states that it was probably reported after the instant incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 21, 25, 26.) Therefore, these facts indicate that Defendant Rich allegedly committed two sexual batteries on the same day as the instant incident and that a third incident happened at an unknown time and was probably reported after the instant incident. These facts are insufficient to allege a widespread practice or repeated constitutional violations for which Defendant Rich was not discharged or reprimanded or that the County had actual or constructive notice subjecting them to\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Next, the Court discusses the allegations involving other inappropriate sexual behavior by Defendant Rich. Plaintiff alleges that Sgt. Tilley personally overheard Defendant Rich make sexually inappropriate comments about other female correctional officers, but dismissed them as \"shop talk.\" (SAC at \u00b6 22.) This fact is insufficient to plead that Defendant County had a custom or practice of allowing sexual batteries of females, or even sexual harassment of females. It is too attenuated to say that a\n   custom or practice of \"shop talk\" is the moving force behind the alleged sexual battery of Plaintiff, a detainee being transported by Defendant Rich.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that after the incident with coworker 2 and Defendant Rich on the same day as the instant incident, coworker 2 told coworker 3 that Defendant Rich had done something highly inappropriate to her. (SAC at \u00b6 26.) Plaintiff alleges that coworker 3's response implied knowledge of Defendant Rich's propensities to engage in sexually inappropriate conduct and plausibly suggests that Defendant Rich's propensities were known within JLCF and that likely supervisors had actual and constructive knowledge of the propensities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, it is not plausible that coworker 3 indicating that she knows of Defendant Rich's propensities means that supervisors had actual or constructive knowledge of the propensities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant Rich was the subject of a number of IA investigations by Defendant County prior to the incidents involving Plaintiff, coworker 1, and coworker 2, but that he was exonerated by County based on Defendant Rich's statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff alleges that coworker 2 heard Defendant Rich state several times that he had been through many IAs and gotten out of every single one of them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) Regarding these IA investigations, Plaintiff alleges that it is plausible to suggest that at least some of such prior IA incidents/investigations concerned sexual misconduct, including, but not limited to sexual harassment, sexual batteries of female inmates or coworkers, or other inappropriate sexual behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) However, the Court does not find it plausible that the subject of the IAs that Defendant Rich alleges he beat involved sexual misconduct just because Defendant Rich is alleged to have committed the incidents involving coworkers 1, 2, and 3, Defendant Rich allegedly committed the incident involving Plaintiff, Defendant Rich engaged in shop talk on a daily basis, the allegation that female correctional officers told coworker 2 that other female correctional officers had been touched by Defendant Rich, and the allegation that Defendant Rich had related that he beat his IAs to coworker 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff alleges that coworker 2 was subjected to previous sexual harassment by Defendant Rich, but coworker 2 was placed in fear of retaliation because of Defendant Rich stating that he had gotten out of IAs. (Id.) She alleges other facts regarding ideas of retaliation and a code of silence. She alleges that coworker 2's work environment at Defendant County became worse after reporting the incident involving her and Defendant Rich on January 27, 2015, because she was subjected to hostility by fellow employees of Defendant County and correctional officers, which potentially included supervisors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant County knew, should have known, or had reason to know of at least some of such previous incidents of Defendant Rich, including nonconsensual sexual batteries in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant County, if Defendant County had put proper policies in place and had not encouraged or permitted a \"code of silence\" among correctional staff and had not encouraged or permitted a culture that retaliated against or shunned correctional officers that reported misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) However, Plaintiff does not explain how coworker 2's work environment became worse after she reported the incident, and she only alleges that the hostility was potentially by supervisors. The fact that a fellow employee may have intimidated coworker 2 or subjected her to hostility after she reported the alleged sexual assault by Defendant Rich does not show that Defendant County was aware of any conduct or that Defendant County allowed retaliation to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that coworker 2 said that there are female correctional officers that have confided to her about their awareness of other similar incidents of female deputies being sexually touched by Defendant Rich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.) Plaintiff alleges that it is plausible to infer that Defendant Rich had engaged in other sexually inappropriate or harassing conduct, and had previously committed nonconsensual sexual batteries in the course and scope of his employment with Defendant County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.) The allegation regarding other female officers confiding in coworker 2 that they were aware of other female deputies being sexually touched by Defendant Rich is not sufficient to plead actual or constructive knowledge on the part of Defendant County. There is no indication in this factual allegation or anywhere else in the second amended complaint that these female deputies who were touched by Defendant Rich reported the conduct to any supervisors at Defendant County or that anyone else reported it to any supervisors or anyone at Defendant County. There are no facts alleged that these women were afraid to report the sexual touching by Defendant Rich.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant County told her to keep quiet about the instant incident, and not to discuss it with anyone when she reported it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.) She alleges that this was an attempt to minimize, conceal, prevent, or avoid the dissemination throughout Defendant County of information of such incidents and that Defendant County hoped that by limiting the documentation of such incidents it could deny knowledge of such incidents later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Plaintiff does not allege that the instant incident was not documented. Plaintiff only alleges that she was told to keep quiet about the matter and not discuss it with anyone. Plaintiff does not allege that there were other incidents where Defendant County gave a similar instruction, and as discussed above, there are no factual allegations that other incidents had been reported to Defendant County prior to the instant incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Defendant Rich was criminally charged for the instant incident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) While Plaintiff states that being told to keep quiet about the instant incident was because of Defendant County's attempts to minimize or conceal information in an attempt to cover it up, the Court finds that the plausible inference of Plaintiff being told not to discuss this incident was to avoid interference with any internal affairs investigation and/or criminal investigation as Defendant Rich was terminated and criminally charged. More facts would be necessary to lead to Plaintiff's plausible interpretation,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiff further alleges it is plausibly suggested by the evidence that other male employees of Defendant County unlawfully touched females, including coworkers, inmates, and others. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.) However, there are no facts alleged by which it is plausible to infer that other correctional officers unlawfully touched females. Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that there was a practice by male correctional officers of Defendant County of sexually assaulting females.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that Defendant County allowed a custom or practice of sexual assaults to occur, such as by not investigating or disciplining reports of sexual assault, and that this basis of the claim should be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, the Court\n   discusses Plaintiff's allegations of deficiencies in the policies of Defendant County regarding opposite-sex transports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Deficient Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant County's policy regarding opposite-sex transports was deficient and that Defendant County should have had a policy requiring the presence and supervision of at least two correctional officers, one of each sex, when transporting inmates to and from the Merced County Courthouse and the JLCF; should have had video monitoring; should have required proper activity logs, or if such logs were required, should have properly reviewed, audited, and/or oversaw them; or should have had a procedure of unloading the female inmates first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   As noted above, Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that Defendant County knew or should have known about any prior similar incidents involving Defendant Rich or other officers at Defendant County. Although Plaintiff is correct that\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability based on deficiencies in a policy does not require a pattern of similar violations to show deliberate indifference, there must still be deliberate indifference. As stated above, the objective deliberate indifference standard is met when a \"plaintiff [ ] establish[es] that the facts available to [entity] policymakers put them on actual\n   <em>\n    or constructive notice\n   </em>\n   that the particular omission is substantially certain to result in the violation of the constitutional rights of their citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4350534\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/833/1060/#p1076\">\n    833 F.3d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Canton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p396\">\n    489 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (emphasis added).

While both involve transporting inmates, the reason for the transport raises different potential for inmate contact. Module 13 is specifically addressing inmate transportation to the hospital in a medical emergency. Medical transports to the hospital in an emergency and transports from the court to the jail are not the same. The Court finds that Defendant County's policy requiring deputies to state the starting and ending mileage in opposite sex transports in medical emergencies (Module 13) is insufficient at the pleading stage to show that Defendant County was deliberately indifferent in opposite sex transports from court to JLCF.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   (ECF No. 43 at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Plaintiff now also alleges deliberate indifference based on Defendant County's policy addressing the Prison Rape Elimination Act (JTO Performance Module 32); Merced County Sheriff's Office Corrections Division, Transport Unit Policy 05.01; Merced County's Sheriff's Office, Search &amp; Seizure Policy 322 at 322.2; and Merced County's Disciplinary Policy 340. (SAC at \u00b6 55.) Upon review of these policies of Defendant County that were attached to the second amended complaint, the Court finds that none of these policies required or even suggested the measures that Plaintiff alleges Defendant County should have taken to protect detainees.

Plaintiff alleges that based on this standard, Defendant County should have required a female correctional officer to be with male correctional officers during opposite-sex transports and that there is a recognition that it is important to have female officers present so as not to leave female inmates solely in the care of male correctional officers in secluded circumstances like transport vans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, as pointed out by Defendant County, this requirement for one female employee is part of a larger paragraph, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Whenever there is an inmate in custody, there shall be at least one employee on duty at all times in a local detention facility or in the building which houses a local detention facility who shall be immediately available and accessible to inmates in the event of an emergency. Such an employee shall not have any other duties which would conflict with the supervision and care of inmates in the event of an emergency. Whenever one or more female inmates are in custody,\n   there shall be at least one female employee who shall be immediately available and accessible to such females.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   15 CCR \u00a7 1027.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   This requirement to have one female officer who is immediately available and accessible to female inmates who are in custody pertains to local detention facilities, and there is no requirement that a female officer must be on transports. Further, it is not plausible to infer that this regulation recognizes that female inmates should not be left in the care of male correctional officers in secluded circumstances such as transport vans as there is nothing to indicate that male correctional officers can never be alone with a female inmate, just that a female officer should be immediately available and accessible to a female inmate. The regulations in\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable from 15 CCR \u00a7 1027. Therefore, the Court finds that 15 CCR \u00a7 1027 does not put policymakers of Defendant County on actual or constructive notice regarding the particular omission that Plaintiff alleges, which is a requirement that two correctional officers transport inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint fails to sufficiently allege that Defendant County had actual or constructive notice.

The Court cannot say that the violation of federal rights in this case, the sexual assault of Plaintiff, is a \"highly predictable\" or \"plainly obvious\" consequence of Defendant County's action or inaction. The Court finds that there is no basis to conclude that Plaintiff has sufficiently pled that the unconstitutional consequences of failing to have a policy of two or more officers transporting opposite sex inmates, having a policy allowing one officer to transport opposite sex inmates, not recording times of transports, not using cameras to record transports, and the other policies and omissions that Plaintiff alleges in the second amended complaint are so patently obvious that Defendant County was deliberately indifferent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   While Plaintiff points to measures that she believes Defendant County could have taken that would have prevented the alleged sexual assault, it is not sufficient for a plaintiff to merely point to something that the city could have done to prevent the incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clouthier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3508178\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/591/1232/#p1249\">\n    591 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1250 (citing\n   <em>\n    Canton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p396\">\n    489 U.S. at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032186\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/378/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

At the time of Plaintiff's motion to lift the stay, the current trial date in the criminal case was August 28, 2017. Plaintiff contended that if the trial was continued again beyond August 28, 2017, then this Court would face continued interference with its ability to conduct its proceedings expeditiously and fairly for all parties. Plaintiff argues that the history of the criminal case is indicative of the fact that the trial continuances will continue. Plaintiff argues that she has been prejudiced because she has not been able to depose knowledgeable witnesses regarding the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. Plaintiff also argues that at a minimum, she should be able to preserve evidence, obtain evidence of a non-testimonial nature that does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Defendant Rich argues that there is little, if any, prejudice to Plaintiff in delaying this action two more months until November 2017, when his criminal trial will occur. He also contends that the delay to November 2017 is not prejudicial because Defendant County's motion to dismiss is still pending. He asserts that Plaintiff's claim regarding witnesses' memories fading and evidence being lost cannot be reconciled with Plaintiff's twenty-two month delay in filing this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Defendant County argues that there is little prejudice to Plaintiff from the delay in the criminal action because the instant action is still in the pleadings stage, there has not been a scheduling conference, and the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is pending. Defendant County contends that it is still highly likely that the criminal trial will proceed before the civil trial in the normal course of proceedings. Defendant County asserts that Plaintiff has set forth no basis for blaming Defendant Rich for the delays in the criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Court is recommending that Defendant County's motion to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim be granted without leave to amend. This matter is still in the pleadings stage. Although Defendant Rich has filed an answer, there has been no scheduling conference yet. The scheduling conference is currently scheduled for November 6, 2017, before the undersigned. While Plaintiff contends that she would want to conduct discovery concerning the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, as the case is still in the pleadings stage, and there has not been a scheduling conference in this action, discovery is not open and she would not be able to depose employees of Defendant County or conduct other discovery that she wishes to conduct. Discovery other than initial disclosures will not open until after the Rule 26(f) conference absent a stipulation or a court order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Court notes that Plaintiff filed the instant action on November 4, 2016. The alleged incident occurred on January 27, 2015. Although it has been almost three years since the alleged incident, it has been less than a year since the action was filed. The action has been stayed as to Defendant Rich since March 21, 2017. Defendant Rich's criminal trial is expected to commence in the next two months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that Plaintiff has suffered minimal prejudice from the stay so far as this matter is still at the pleading stage. However, Plaintiff will suffer greater prejudice at the time that this matter is ready for a scheduling conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of granting Plaintiff's motion to lift the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Burden Which Any Particular Aspect of the Proceedings May Impose on Defendant Rich\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Originally, the Court found that the burden that the instant civil action may impose on Defendant Rich weighs heavily in favor of granting the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Plaintiff argues that Defendant Rich Fifth Amendment rights are not implicated by production of Defendant Rich's personnel file, IA investigations, and other documentary evidence that does not implicate his Fifth Amendment rights. Plaintiff contends that Defendant Rich's assertion that failing to stay this civil litigation will impose a serious burden on him and prejudice his criminal defense is merely speculative. Plaintiff suggests that the Court could tailor and limit discovery in a manner that does not burden or expose the basis of Defendant Rich's criminal defense by using a protective order. Plaintiff also agrees to forbear from deposing Defendant Rich and from requiring any verifications until after the conclusion of Defendant Rich's criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that Defendant Rich could have invoked his statutory speedy trial rights under the California Penal Code or he could have withdrawn his general waiver at any time which would have ensured that he would have been brought to trial within sixty days. Plaintiff contends that there is no indication how long Defendant Rich waited to bring the motion for the District Attorney to produce evidence, what the motion was, why it took so long, why it was not brought earlier, and why the trial had to be continued seven weeks to August 28, 2017, if Defendant Rich had an order entitling him to documents which were in the possession of the District Attorney. Plaintiff contends that while disclosing the type of motion and information that Defendant Rich is seeking in the criminal case could result in issues with preserving Defendant Rich's defense strategies, Defendant Rich has not requested to disclose the information in chambers or pursuant to an attorney eyes only protective order. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Rich has not acted diligently to promptly bring his criminal case to trial and has failed to act promptly to obtain the discovery needed and to enforce any orders with sufficient diligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Defendant Rich argues that because he has a pending criminal case involving the same subject matter as the instant civil action, he has a powerful incentive to invoke his Fifth Amendment right from compelled self-incrimination. Defendant Rich also argues that if he does exercise that right in the civil action, then he cannot adequately defend himself in this action, and the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference, which prejudices him. Defendant Rich contends that he may be forced to expose the basis of his criminal defense and the scope of discovery for the criminal case would in effect be expanded since civil discovery has a broader scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Defendant Rich has filed a declaration of his counsel in the criminal matter, which states that criminal counsel had filed a motion to compel the District Attorney to produce documents that the office had not produced. (Declaration of Eloise Kelsey (\"Kelsey Decl.\") at \u00b6 2, ECF No. 68-1.) On August 21, 2017, the court in the criminal matter granted the motion to compel and issued an order to show cause why such documents should not be produced forthwith. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On August 28, 2017, the date on which the trial was scheduled to begin, the District Attorney could not explain why such documents still had not been produced and the District Attorney had a witness that was unavailable because of a\n   death in the family, so a continuance was requested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court in the criminal case continued the case to September 5, 2017, and the District Attorney produced part of the requested documents during the Labor Day weekend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.) Defendant Rich's expert was unavailable to examine the documents prior to September 5, 2017, so Defendant Rich agreed to the District Attorney's request for a continuance in order to have time to examine the newly produced documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. Kelsey contends that Defendant Rich was ready for trial in July and August, but for the problems with witness availability and the late production of documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Defendant County argues that the broad civil discovery rules would permit discovery that would most likely interfere with Defendant Rich's ability to defend himself in the criminal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Here, there is a pending criminal prosecution against Defendant Rich, and not merely a speculative chance of a criminal prosecution. As discussed above, the Court finds that the overlapping facts and circumstances of these two cases would adversely affect Defendant Rich's ability to defend himself in the related criminal action. Based on the information presented to this Court, the delay in the criminal action is not only due to Defendant Rich, as the District Attorney requested a continuance due to witness unavailability and there was the pending motion for production of documents. However, the Court notes that Defendant Rich has not provided this Court with a complete history of the motion and the delay in filing the motion when the criminal case has been pending for over two years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Court finds that the greatest burden on Defendant Rich would be any discovery that implicates his Fifth Amendment rights. However, as Plaintiff suggests, discovery in this action of evidence that does not implicate Defendant's Rich's Fifth Amendment rights would not create much of a burden on Defendant Rich.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the burden that the instant civil action may impose on Defendant Rich weighs heavily in favor of denying the motion to lift the stay fully, but weighs in favor of granting the motion to lift the stay as to discovery that is of a non-testimonial nature which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Convenience of the Court in the Management of Its Cases, and the Efficient Use of Judicial Resources\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Court originally found that the convenience of the Court in the management of its cases and the efficient use of judicial resources weighed in favor of granting the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that the testimony at the criminal trial is going to be narrowly focused and that not all of the witnesses that Plaintiff seeks to depose will be testifying at the criminal trial, so depositions in the instant civil action will still be required. Plaintiff contends that there is no reason to believe that the same discovery disputes will be brought before the Court twice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Defendant Rich argues that if this action is stayed, there will not be the need for duplicative depositions or the depositions would be shorter as the scope of testimony and issues in this civil action could be narrowed because of the criminal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Defendant County argues that staying this civil action would avoid duplicative civil depositions, or at least only require short civil depositions, as the criminal trial will provide testimony of both prosecution and defense witnesses. Defendant County also contends that staying this civil action would result in fewer discovery disputes and a more open, unimpeded discovery\n   process in the civil action after the resolution of the criminal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The Court notes that it has an interest in resolving cases on its docket in a timely manner. However, lifting the stay fully and allowing this civil action to continue while Defendant Rich's criminal prosecution is pending could result in an inefficient use of judicial resources. Allowing the criminal action to proceed first may streamline discovery in this action and help expedite the resolution of this action. Yet, there has been the preliminary testimony in the criminal trial and Plaintiff indicates that not all of the witnesses it wants to depose will be called at the criminal trial and that it will want to depose witnesses on a broader range of testimony than just the testimony at the criminal trial, so depositions will still be needed in this matter. The Court is aware that if it lifts the stay regarding any evidence of a non-testimonial nature which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights, there could be a number of discovery disputes regarding whether evidence is of a non-testimonial nature which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights. When the Court considers the convenience of the Court and the efficient use of judicial resources, it appears to be more efficient to allow discovery in this matter that will not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In the interests of judicial efficiency, the Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of denying the motion to lift the stay fully and in favor of lifting the stay as to discovery that is non-testimonial which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Interests of Persons Not Parties to the Civil Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The Court originally found that this factor does not weigh in favor of granting or denying a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Plaintiff argues that this factor may not directly weigh either way since there are no such parties, but she also argues that the community has an interest in the case proceeding without delay. The next factor in the analysis appropriately addresses the interest of the public. Defendant Rich and Defendant County contend that there are no third-party interests that depend on resolution of the action and are affected by this stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The Court finds that this factor does not weigh in favor of granting or denying the motion to lift the stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Interest of the Public in the Pending Civil and Criminal Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Originally, the Court found that the interest of the public in the pending civil and criminal litigation weighs slightly against granting a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Plaintiff argues that this factor weighs heavily against continuing the stay based on the information discussed in the other factors. Defendant Rich and Defendant County argue that the public has an interest in the orderly and proper administration of criminal justice. Defendant County contends that the criminal proceedings against Defendant Rich should have precedence over the civil action. Defendant County and Defendant Rich cite to several district court cases which stayed a civil action because of criminal cases. Plaintiff responds that\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   recognizes a court may be justified in staying civil proceedings when there is substantial prejudice shown, but it also recognizes that there are other protective measures available.\n   <em>\n    S.E.C. v. Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%205388000\">\n    2010 WL 5388000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6-7 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 22, 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The public's interest in a speedy resolution of this civil action is balanced against its interest in maintaining the \"integrity of\n   the criminal case.\"\n   <em>\n    Keating\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412902\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/322/\">\n    45 F.3d at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   , the Northern District of California recognized that \"where a criminal case on the same matter is already underway, some courts have reasoned that the criminal case is of primary importance to the public, and that the public's strongest interest is in ensuring the criminal proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%205388000\">\n    2010 WL 5388000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   While the public does have an interest in ensuring that the victim is made whole as rapidly as possible, the stay in this matter is not expected to last a long time from the time that this findings and recommendations is adopted by the district judge, as it is anticipated that Defendant Rich's criminal trial will be set for a date in November 2017. Further, as discussed above, this case is still in the pleading stage. Lifting the stay in this matter fully could affect the integrity of the criminal proceeding, but lifting the stay as to matters that do not implicate the Fifth Amendment would not affect the integrity of the criminal proceeding. Therefore, this factor weighs slightly against lifting the stay fully, but weighs slightly for lifting the stay as to evidence that is non-testimonial which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Weighing of the Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Accordingly, when the Court weighs the five\n   <em>\n    Keating\n   </em>\n   factors, the Court recommends that Plaintiff's motion to lift the stay be granted in part. The stay should be lifted as to Defendant Rich for any evidence of a non-testimonial nature which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights. Therefore, the parties should be able to conduct discovery of any evidence of a non-testimonial nature which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendments rights. Plaintiff indicates that she would be willing to stipulate to a protective order. The parties may enter into a protective order regarding the production of documents and any other matter that the parties feel is necessary. If the parties are unable to agree on the protective order, they may seek the Court's assistance to resolve any disagreement through the informal discovery dispute process found on the Court's website, under Judge Boone, in an effort to avoid expenses and further delays.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    RECOMMENDATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Based on the foregoing, it is HEREBY RECOMMENDED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   1.

(SAC \u00b6 30.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    There is a great deal of discussion in the F &amp; Rs and the parties' briefs about the extent to which Coworker 2's allegation that she heard Rich discussing prior IAs contributes to the quantum of allegations related to pattern/custom. For purposes of this analysis, the Court is not considering any allegations regarding prior IAs because those are not needed in order to permit this claim to proceed. To the extent that discovery reveals further information about the IAs or related investigations, those may be material at later stages of the case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    The County does itself no favors in its briefing concerning this particular incident. The County points out, correctly, that Coworker 3 was previously involved in a relationship with Defendant Rich and that when she discussed her complaint with Sgt. Tilley one thing she wanted to do was \"make it clear to Rich that it was not allowable now that they weren't in a relationship anymore.\" (ECF No. 51-3 at 134:19-26.) The County goes too far, however, by arguing that the above complaint was therefore merely \"[a]n ex-girlfriend making sure a relationship is over.\" (ECF No. 78 at 5.) This attempt to establish that this incident \"has nothing to do with a sexual assault of an inmate\" is unavailing. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The record demonstrates that Rich had a propensity to behave in sexually inappropriate ways in the workplace, a workplace in which he interacted with individuals in custody, who were in a position of less power than his coworkers. That the conduct was not identical does not make it irrelevant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Hogan v.

Plaintiff's arguments suggest that they are attempting to piggyback a deficient policy claim on this \"pure\" custom claim. But, this mixes issues. In evaluating a deficient policy claim, the question is whether the municipality was on notice (directly or constructively) that it was a\n    <em>\n     policy\n    </em>\n    failure or omission that was the driving force behind the violation of Plaintiff's rights. The custom evidence discussed above, presumed true at this stage of the case, plausibly suggests that there was a widespread custom of sexual misconduct that was the driving force behind the violation of Plaintiff's rights.

She has sufficiently pled that she possessed a constitutional right of which she was deprived.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    All references to pagination of specific documents pertain to those as indicated on the upper right corners via the CM/ECF electronic court docketing system.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    Although Plaintiff does not allege in her second amended complaint that Defendant Rich was terminated following the instant incident, she does not allege that he was not terminated. The Court notes that she previously stated in her opposition to the motion to dismiss the first amended complaint that Defendant Rich was terminated, and at the September 20, 2017 hearing, her counsel referred to Defendant Rich being terminated when discussing the timing of a report of another incident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    At the hearing, Plaintiff's counsel admitted that paragraph 21 of the second amended complaint is inaccurate because it is not clear that the report to Defendant County's supervisors happened prior to the instant incident. The Court appreciates Plaintiff's counsel's candor. Plaintiff's counsel stated that the report of the incident involving coworker 3 was more than likely after the incident, but it is unclear. He also could not say that it is definitely after the incident. He asserted that Plaintiff should be able to do discovery on that issue. As Plaintiff's counsel did not actually concede that the report was after the instant incident, the Court reviews this allegation in light of Plaintiff alleging that it is \"unclear\" as to when the report happened, but probably after the instant incident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-218\">\n    Further, to the extent that Plaintiff attempts to allege this as its own custom, there are no allegations of how this alleged custom itself was a moving force in Plaintiff's injuries.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    The Court also notes that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged a custom or practice of sexual harassment by male correctional officers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    The Court notes that one of the articles with data that Plaintiff cites in the second amended complaint provides that Merced County Jail authorities had no allegations of sexual victimization in 2011, but it does not affirmatively say that Merced County Jail authorities did or did not have allegations of sexual victimization in 2010 and 2009.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4881 (last visited September 26, 2017). Merced County Jail was not part of the list of authorities with no allegations of sexual victimization in 2010 and 2009, but it was also not listed in the table for jails with allegations of sexual victimization reported by local jail authorities in 2010 and 2009.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716534\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/1194/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    The Court notes, as discussed above, that the complaint is devoid of factual allegations and only contains conclusory statements regarding inadequacies in hiring.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    Plaintiff requests that Defendant County's motion to dismiss be continued and the stay in this action be lifted if Defendant County's motion to dismiss the second amended complaint is not denied. The Court infers that Plaintiff requests a continuance of the motion to dismiss so that she can conduct discovery. The Court is recommending that Defendant County's motion to dismiss be granted. The Court finds that it is appropriate to decide the instant motion to dismiss at this time as motions to dismiss are routinely decided prior to discovery in an action.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Starr\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759026\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/652/1202/#p1216\">\n     652 F.3d at 1216\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (finding that a complaint's allegations must plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, \"such that it is not unfair to require the opposing party to be subjected to the expense of discovery and continued litigation.\")\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    The Court notes that should additional facts become known to Plaintiff that would change the analysis on the\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim, there are remedies available, such as seeking leave to amend.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    While the Court is recommending that discovery be allowed that is non-testimonial which does not implicate Defendant Rich's Fifth Amendment rights, this is just a recommendation to the district judge which may or may not be adopted. Further, the opening of discovery is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
