MOODY, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Land's End at Sunset Beach Community Association, Inc. successfully defended itself against an Alaskan corporation for its use of \"Land's End\" in advertisements. In this suit, the Community Association argues its insurer, Aspen Specialty Insurance Company, had a duty to defend it in the underlying suit. Whether that duty arose requires this Court to determine what claims the Alaskan corporation brought-a task much more complicated than it sounds-and whether those claims were excluded under the Policy. After careful consideration, the Court concludes Aspen is entitled to judgment on the pleadings because the claims against the Community Association were excluded from coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Insurance Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Community Association operates a condominium complex in Treasure Island, Florida, and advertises short-term rentals of its condos. Aspen issued a commercial general liability policy (No. CIUCAP001300-01) to the Community Association. The Policy provides coverage for \"Personal and Advertising Injury\" subject to certain exclusions. The relevant portions of the Policy, to which the Community Association cites in its Amended Complaint (Doc. 5) and Aspen cites in its Motion (Doc. 17),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    SECTION I-COVERAGES\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    COVERAGE B-PERSONAL AND ADVERTISING INJURY LIABILITY\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The Claims against the Community Association\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Land's End Acquisition Corporation (\"LEAC\") is a corporation that operates hotels and resorts in Alaska, including the Land's End hotel. (Doc. 5-10). LEAC owns the \"LAND's END\" trademark, which it uses to advertise its hotels and resorts. (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In September 2015, LEAC sent the Community Association a cease and desist letter accusing the Community Association of improperly using the \"LAND's END\" trademark. (Doc. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). After attempting to resolve the situation, the Community Association filed a declaratory judgment action against LEAC in the District Court for the Middle District of Florida seeking a declaration that the Community Association had not infringed on LEAC's trademarks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, LEAC filed counterclaims and third-party complaint (the \"Counterclaim\") (Doc. 5-9), and then amended counterclaims and third-party complaint (the \"Amended Counterclaim\"). (Doc. 5-10). The Community Association notified Aspen of the Counterclaim and Amended Counterclaim and requested a defense under the Policy. (Doc. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 35-63). Aspen denied the Community Association's request for a defense, arguing the claims against the Community Association were not covered. (Doc. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 35-63). Because the duty to defend could have arisen either based on the allegations in the Counterclaim or Amended Counterclaim, both must be reviewed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    1. LEAC's Counterclaim against the Community Association\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its Counterclaim against the Community Association, LEAC alleged that the Community Association used \"the LAND's END mark in connection with short-term\n   rental services ... which creates a likelihood of confusion with LEAC's LAND's END marks.\" (Doc. 5-9, Counterclaim \u00b6 20). Based on this allegation, LEAC brought four causes of action against the Community Association: trademark infringement under the Lanham Act (Count I), false designation of origin (Count II), trademark infringement under Florida common law (Count III), and unfair competition under Florida common law (Count IV).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Each of the Counts incorporated the same general allegations and included claim-specific allegations. In Count I of the counterclaim, LEAC alleged that the \"above-cited acts,\" referring to the use of the LAND's END mark, constituted trademark infringement, \"thereby creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source of origin, affiliation, approval or sponsorship of such services.\" (Doc. 5-9, Counterclaim \u00b6 24). Count II alleges the Community Association used the LAND's END mark \"in promoting and marketing ... thereby falsely designating the source of origin, affiliation, approval or sponsorship of such services.\" (Doc. 5-9, Counterclaim \u00b6 30). Count III claims the general allegations (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   use of the LAND's END mark) state a claim for trademark infringement. (Doc. 5-9, Counterclaim \u00b6 36). And Count IV states the general allegations (again, the use of the LAND's END mark) constitutes unfair competition given \"the likelihood of confusion as to the source or affiliation, sponsorship or approval of [the Community Association's] services and activities and the relationship of such activities to LEAC.\" (Doc. 5-9, Counterclaim \u00b6\u00b6 39-40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    2. LEAC's Amended Counterclaim against the Community Association\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Amended Counterclaim has more in-depth general allegations against the Community Association, but is basically the same. LEAC still alleges that the Community Association used the LAND's END mark \"in connection with condominiums that are leased as short term vacation accommodations in the same way that hotel rooms are leased as short term vacation accommodation.\" (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 50). LEAC alleges the Community Association's use of the LAND's END mark began sometime after LEAC started using it. (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 47). LEAC also alleges the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   On information and belief, in many instances, Community Association appears to use the LAND's END mark alone, as a trademark, not descriptively, without the proper full name of the property (e.g. Land's End at Sunset Beach or Land's End at Treasure Island), in connection with short-term room rental services .... This use of the LAND's END mark creates a likelihood of confusion with LEAC's LAND's END marks for the same or similar and related goods and services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Amended Counterclaim brings the same four causes of action as did the Counterclaim (and in the same order), but this time also brings a fifth action for declaratory judgment (Count V). As with the general allegations, some of the allegations are more in-depth in the specific counts of the Amended Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In Count I, LEAC again alleges that the acts cited in the general allegations (use of the LAND's END mark) constitute trademark infringement \"thereby creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source of origin, affiliation, approval or sponsorship of such services.\" (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 90). Count I also alleges the Community Association is using the identical mark for the same or\n   related goods and services, targeting the same customers. (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The allegations in Counts II and III of the Amended Counterclaim are unchanged from the Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In Count IV, LEAC alleges the Community Association's \"use of the LAND's END mark ... without using their full name ... is deceptive conduct within the meaning of the term as defined by Florida common law.\" (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 113). LEAC then alleges that it was damaged by the Community Association's \"unfair competition by reason of the likelihood of confusion as to the source or affiliation, sponsorship or approval [the Community Association's] services and activities....\" (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 114).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Count V does not allege damage to LEAC, but simply seeks a declaration as to whether the Community Association has any common law trademark rights. Importantly, the Community Association does not allege the duty to defend arose from Count V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A motion for judgment on the pleadings is governed by the same standard as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawthorne v.

The Court will first address the law governing interpretation of insurance policies and the duty to defend, and will then lay out the Community Association's arguments as to why it believes the allegations in the Counterclaim and Amended Counterclaim fall within the personal and advertising injury coverage of the Policy.

Community Association's Arguments in Favor of Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   For the Community Association to prevail in this action, this Court must conclude that at least one of the claims in the Counterclaim or Amended Counterclaim were within the Policy's coverage and were not clearly excluded, which would have triggered Aspen's duty to defend the Community Association. In its Amended Complaint, the Community Association describes why it thinks the Court should reach that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, the Community Association focuses on the definition of \"personal and advertising injury\" in the Policy, specifically what it refers to as offenses (f) and (g). Offense (f) refers to the use of another's advertising idea in your \"advertisement.\" Offense (g) refers to infringing on another's copyright, trade dress or slogan in your \"advertisement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Second, the Community Association argues that LEAC's claims against it in the Counterclaim and Amended Counterclaim fall within the scope of offenses (f) and (g). This is where things get more complicated. The Community Association acknowledges that LEAC did not bring explicit claims for \"use of another's advertising idea\" or for \"infringing on another's copyright, trade dress or slogan.\" Instead, the Community Association argues that some of the allegations in the underlying suit fall within the scope of these offenses, which triggers coverage. Hopefully, this explanation puts the Community Association's following arguments in context so they are easier to understand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Community Association argues the allegations in the unfair competition claims (Counts IV of the Counterclaim and Amended Counterclaim) fall within the scope of offense (f), the use of another's advertising idea (the \"Advertising Idea Offense\"). Generally, an advertising idea \"can be any idea or concept related to the promotion of a product to the public.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Hyman v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11404622\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/304/1179/#p1188\">\n    304 F.3d 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1188 (11th Cir. 2002). The remainder of the definition is unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    IVFMD Florida, Inc. v. Allied Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=679%20Fed.%20Appx.%20769\">\n    679 Fed.Appx. 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773 (11th Cir. 2017) (analyzing the same definition of \"personal and advertising injury\"). In this case, the Community Association argues that LEAC's allegations that it used \"LAND's END\" in advertisements is an allegation that the Community Association used LEAC's advertising idea. (Doc. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 64- 81; Doc. 21, pp. 6-9). So, the Community Association argues, the allegations in the unfair competition counts state a claim within scope of the personal and advertising injury coverage via the Advertising Idea Offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Community Association also argues that the allegations in the underlying suit fall within the scope of offense (g), infringement on another's slogan (the \"Slogan Offense\"). The Community Association argues the Court should give the dictionary definition to the word \"slogan,\" which is not defined in the Policy. (Doc. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 82-93; Doc. 21, pp. 9-11). Applying that definition, the Community Association argues that the Court should conclude \"LAND's END\" is a slogan, and that LEAC's claims that the Community Association used \"LAND's END\" in its advertisements states a claim within the scope of the personal and advertising injury coverage under the Slogan Offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, the Community Association argues that exclusion for \"Infringement of Patent, Copyright, Trademark or Trade Secret\" (the \"IP Exclusion\") does not exclude coverage for these offenses given the allegations in the underlying suit. Again, this argument gets somewhat complicated, so the Court will try to succinctly explain the Community Association's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As to the Advertising Idea Offense, the Community Association argues that the IP Exclusion is inapplicable in the context of the unfair competition claim of the Amended Counterclaim. (Doc. 5, \u00b6 121) (citing to the allegations of Count IV of the Amended Counterclaim, and not to the allegations of the Counterclaim).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is because, \"it is possible to be liable for unfair competition even when trademark infringement is not present if use of a similar but non-infringing mark or device is combined with unfair practices in a manner which is likely to deceive purchasers regarding the origin of goods under all the circumstances.\" (Doc. 5, \u00b6 122).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Alternatively, the Community Association argues that \"even for those claims premised on trademark infringement, potential coverage arises even if there is no basis for trademark infringement.\" (Doc. 5, \u00b6 123). Though somewhat confusing, the gist of this argument is that LEAC at some point realized it was unlikely to prevail on the trademark infringement claims, and so added allegations in the Amended Counterclaim that were broader than trademark infringement. (Doc. 21, p. 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Community Association also raises an argument in its Response, which is not in its Amended Complaint, that the false designation of origin count (Count II) states a claim for an Advertising Idea Offense that is not barred by the IP Exclusion. Although not argued explicitly, the advertising idea that was used would, again, be the LAND's END mark. The Community Association argues that because use of the LAND's END mark in Count II would not be for trademark infringement-but, rather, for false designation of origin-the IP Exclusion would not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   While the Community Association argues that the IP Exclusion is inapplicable to the Advertising Idea Offense, it argues that the Slogan Offense falls within an exception to the IP Exclusion. Specifically, the IP Exclusion states: \"However, this exclusion does not apply to infringement, in your 'advertisement', of copyright, trade dress or slogan.\" (Doc. 5-1, p. 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Policy Coverage and Applicability of the IP Exclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   With that lengthy background and explanation, the Court can make relatively short work of its analysis. First, the Court will determine whether the claims in the underlying suit contained allegations that the Community Association used LEAC's advertising idea or its slogan (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the underlying suit made claims within the scope of coverage). Then the Court will determine whether any covered claims were excluded by the IP Exclusion (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the underlying complaint shows the applicability of an exclusion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    1. The underlying suit alleged the Community Association used LEAC's advertising idea, but did not allege it used LEAC's slogan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Aspen concedes that the unfair competition counts of the Counterclaim and Amended Counterclaim fall within the broad definition of an \"advertising idea.\" So the Court accepts the Community Association's argument that the underlying suit alleged claims that fall within the Advertising Idea Offense, included in the broader definition of \"personal and advertising injury,\" for which the Policy provided coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court rejects, though, the idea that the underlying suit alleged the Community Association used LEAC's slogan. LEAC never referred to \"LAND's END\" as a slogan in the Counterclaim or Amended Counterclaim, and did not bring an explicit action for slogan infringement. LEAC also alleged in the Amended Counterclaim that the Community Association appeared to use the LAND's END mark alone, \"not descriptively.\" (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 52). In other words, not as a slogan. While not dispositive, that is telling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court also declines to conclude that any reasonable interpretation of the policy would allow \"LAND'S END\" to be considered a slogan under these circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Policy makes a distinction between a \"trademark\" and a \"slogan.\" (Doc. 5-1). This is abundantly clear because the IP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Exclusion bars coverage for trademark infringement, but expressly permits coverage for slogan infringement. So it would make little sense for this Court to allow \"LAND's END\" to serve as both a trademark-as LEAC expressly alleged-and also conclude it is a slogan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This result is supported by rulings in other circuit courts. In\n   <em>\n    Hugo Boss Fashions, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11087931\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/252/608/#p618\">\n    252 F.3d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618-19 (2d Cir. 2001), the Second Circuit explained that \" 'trademarked slogans' are phrases used to\n   <em>\n    promote or advertise\n   </em>\n   a house mark or product mark, in contradistinction to the house or product mark itself.... Thus, it seems clear that a \"slogan\" must be something,\n   <em>\n    other than the house mark or product mark itself,\n   </em>\n   that provides such a reminder.\" (italics in original). That reasoning makes sense, and the Court adopts it as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    2. The allegations that the Community Association used LEAC's advertising idea are excluded from coverage pursuant to the IP Exclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Having concluded that the allegations in the underlying suit can safely be said to fall within the Advertising Idea Offense definition of personal and advertising injury-but not within the Slogan Offense-the Court must now determine what effect, if any, the IP Exclusion has on the coverage. For the reasons below, the Court concludes that the IP Exclusion bars coverage for the claims arising from the Advertising Idea Offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As explained above, the Community Association argues that the IP Exclusion is inapplicable to the Advertising Idea Offense alleged in the unfair competition counts because a claim for unfair competition is broader than a claim for trademark infringement. It is true that an unfair competition claim\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be broader than a trademark infringement claim. But the Court is not concerned with what\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   be; instead, the Court must look to the allegations in the Counterclaim and Amended Counterclaim to determine if LEAC's allegations of unfair competition are broader than trademark infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Having closely reviewed LEAC's claims, the Court concludes that all LEAC alleges is that the Community Association infringed on its LAND's END mark. In the Counterclaim, LEAC incorporates the general allegation that the Community Association used the LAND's END mark, which gave rise to all the causes of action. (Doc. 5-9, \u00b6\u00b6 39- 40). In the Amended Counterclaim, LEAC again alleges that the Community Association used the LAND's END mark, which created a likelihood of confusion. (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 52). In the Amended Counterclaim's unfair competition count, it alleged the damage from the \"unfair competition [was] the likelihood of confusion ....\" (Doc. 5-10, \u00b6 114). All of the allegations go back to the same premise: the Community Association infringed on LEAC's LAND's END mark. Nothing beyond that is alleged, and this Court \"need not stretch the allegations beyond reason to impose a duty on the insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    Trailer Bridge, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=657%20F.3d%201135\">\n    657 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1144 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Power Corp. v. Amerisure Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:12-CV-192-FTM-29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%204523490\">\n    2013 WL 4523490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 26, 2013) (concluding a claim for Federal False Advertising arose from trademark infringement, and applying the identical IP Exclusion to conclude the insurer owed no duty to defend against the claim).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Having made that determination, it is clear the claims are excluded. The IP Exclusion\n   states that there is no coverage for \" 'Personal and advertising injury' arising out of the infringement of ... trademark.\" (Doc. 5-1). Because the IP Exclusion bars coverage for claims arising out of trademark infringement, and the underlying suits claims arose out of trademark infringement, the claims are clearly excluded from coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   And contrary to the Community Association's argument, the second sentence of the IP Exclusion does not apply. The second sentence states, \"Under this exclusion, such other intellectual property rights do not include the use of another's advertising idea in your 'advertisement'.\" (Doc. 5-1). So, the Community Association argues, the Advertising Idea Offense claims are within an exception to the IP Exclusion. But the exception does not apply to trademark infringement-it only applies to infringement of other intellectual property rights.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Fire Ins. Co. v. Cyanotech Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV. 12-00537 JMS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205755338\">\n    2013 WL 5755338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (D. Haw. Oct. 23, 2013) (explaining, \"the [identical] exception only applies to 'other intellectual property rights.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   And this result makes sense. Given the broad definition of advertising idea under Florida law, all cases of trademark infringement involving advertisements would fall within the exception to the IP Exclusion at issue if the Court were to adopt the Community Association's position. That would make the exception swallow the IP Exclusion, which cannot be the intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Community Association is correct that LEAC made claims against it in the underlying suit that fell within the broad grant of the Aspen Policy's \"personal and advertising injury\" coverage. Specifically, LEAC alleged the Community Association infringed on its LAND's END trademark, which gave rise to multiple causes of action in the Counterclaim and Amended Counterclaim. But because all of the causes of action were dependent on the Community Association's infringement of the LAND's END trademark, the IP Exclusion unambiguously barred coverage under the Policy. Because it was clear that none of the claims LEAC alleged against the Community Association were covered by the Policy, Aspen did not owe a duty to defend the Community Association in the underlying suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   1.

It is unclear why the Community Association made this alteration.
