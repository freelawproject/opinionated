Respondent Andrew Moser (\"Moser\" or \"respondent\") timely removed the action to this Court and thereafter filed a motion to partially vacate the award. For the reasons stated herein, Salus's petition is granted and Moser's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Underlying Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2011, Moser was hired as President and CEO of Salus, a financial and asset management company. Partial Final Award, Petition Ex. C (\"Partial Award\"), at 5. The relationship between the parties was governed by two agreements: an employment agreement, governed by New York law, first executed in November 2011 and later amended as of August 26, 2014 (the \"Employment Agreement\"), and a Limited Liability Agreement, governed by Delaware law, effective as of December 1, 2011 (\"LLC Agreement\"). Partial Award at 5. Both the Employment and LLC Agreements contain arbitration clauses. Pursuant to Section 17(a) of the Employment Agreement, \"Employee and Company agree to arbitrate any controversy or claim arising out of this Agreement or otherwise relating to Employee's employment by Company or the cessation of such employment for any reason ....\" Petition Ex. B. \u00a7 17(a). Under Section 10.2(a) of the LLC Agreement, \"Each of the Members agrees to arbitrate any controversy or claim arising out of this Agreement or otherwise relating to the Members' Interests.\" Petition Ex. C \u00a7 10.2(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In April 2015, Salus terminated Moser, without cause, for \"poor performance, lack of trustworthiness, lack of transparency with respect to the value of the loan portfolio, and disparagement of\" Salus's corporate, and publically traded parent, HRG Group, Inc. (\"HRG\"). Partial Award at 5, 9. Thereafter, Salus conducted a \"routine due diligence review\" of Moser's emails, which uncovered evidence that Moser had \"affirmatively sought to conceal unauthorized personal charges on the corporate credit card.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Because Moser had signed the auditor's letter for Salus's consolidated financial statements, attesting that he had no knowledge of \"fraud or suspected fraud,\" Salus retained outside counsel, Skadden Arps (\"Skadden\"), to conduct an internal investigation and \"to advise it on the potential regulatory implications and its potential affirmative obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2015, Skadden, relying in part on the forensic accounting efforts of AlixPartners, concluded that there was \"substantial evidence that Mr. Moser misappropriated company funds for personal use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Skadden determined, however, that \"None of the misconduct affected Salus clients [or] materially harmed HRG investors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (alterations in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Moser misappropriated company funds in three ways. First, Moser retained a vendor, Audio Visual Intelligence (\"AVI\"), which was concurrently providing services to Salus, to install almost $100,000 worth of audio-visual equipment in his homes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Moser charged the equipment to his corporate credit card and requested the vendor's owner, James Shapiro (\"Shapiro\"), to create and submit falsified invoices\n   to substantiate the charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Moser asked that Salus's office address be substituted on the invoices for the addresses of his homes where the work was actually performed, and \"instructed Shapiro to make the descriptions of the work performed 'plain' and that 'work invoices' be produced ... to falsify the descriptions of the work performed ... to make them appear as if the work had been performed on Salus's premises.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Second, Moser incurred more than $90,000 in \"questionable charges\" beyond the AVI charges on his corporate credit card, including for purchases of patio furniture; watches; items on Amazon.com; family travel expenses; purchases at gas stations, coffee shops, grocery and liquor stores; and for miscellaneous items, such as Boston Bruins gear.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, 16. Moser also used Salus's corporate jet account for multiple trips for himself and his family, costing Salus over $35,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Third, in 2013, while Salus was serving as the collateral manager for collateralized loan obligations for Radio Shack, Moser purchased a $25,000 zero-coupon subordinated note, through which he would receive $25,000 on the note's 2021 maturity date \"and periodic interest payments along the way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. By late 2014, however, the value of the note was expected to diminish \"significantly\" with Radio Shack's impending bankruptcy \"of which Moser was fully aware.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moser, therefore, caused Salus to purchase his interest at a full face value of $25,000, \"knowing that the shortfall in value would ultimately likely be borne by Salus.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By a June 2, 2015 letter from counsel, Salus notified Moser's counsel that a number of \"troubling issues\" had come to light, including \"strong evidence showing that [Moser] had misappropriated corporate funds and resources for personal use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 (alterations in original). Salus sought to meet with Moser \"so he c[ould] address these issues directly.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Moser \"curiously\" wrote a letter to his former assistant \"explaining that he charged personal expenses to the corporate credit card so that Salus could benefit from the 'points' earned on the credit card but assured her that he ... would reimburse Salus.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After multiple failed efforts to meet with Moser, Salus re-characterized Moser's termination as one for cause in July 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Soon thereafter, Moser's counsel acknowledged that Moser would \"reimburse Salus for all personal expenses charged on a corporate credit card,\" but could not confirm the amount owed as he \"did not have access to the relevant documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Then, in August 2015, Moser and his counsel met with Salus to review Moser's corporate credit card statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moser \"personally noted\" which charges were personal in nature, valued at approximately $140,000, including the AVI charges, the purchase of the patio furniture, meals, and personal vacations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"He also asked for additional time to research and confirm some additional charges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Neither Moser nor his counsel ever got back to [Salus] with respect to these open items, nor was payment ever made or the admitted indebtedness put in escrow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Arbitration Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In September 2015, Salus initiated an arbitration proceeding against Moser pursuant to the Employment and LLC Agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Salus asserted various claims, including breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and the duty of loyalty, fraud, conversion, and violation of New York's faithless servant doctrine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In a thorough, twenty-seven page decision, the arbitrator concluded that Moser had \"charged substantial personal expenses to his Salus credit card,\" and had \"compounded his error by not repaying this indebtedness, despite repeatedly\n   promising to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. These failings, however, \"pale in contrast to Moser's pre-meditated and focused plan to falsify invoices and deceive Salus as to the true nature of the expenses incurred, directly involving a vendor in his scheme. That was fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The arbitrator awarded $98,355.86 in reimbursement for the fraudulent AVI invoices, $90,964.55 for miscellaneous personal charges on Moser's corporate credit card, and $35,075.10 for Moser's personal use of Salus's NetJets account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Partial Award at 25; Final Award, Petition Ex. D (\"Final Award\"), at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Concluding that Moser had manipulated AVI invoices to fraudulently transfer personal charges to Salus and to deceive Salus as to his intent, the arbitrator awarded the disgorgement of Moser's compensation from June 2014 until his final payment. Partial Award at 22-24. The arbitrator found the disgorgement of $879,514.02 warranted under New York's faithless servant doctrine, which \"provides that an employee must forfeit the compensation earned during a period that he or she violates the duty of loyalty or fidelity in the performance of that employee's duties to the employer.\" Partial Award at 22; Final Award at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The arbitrator awarded $748,155.49 in attorneys' fees and costs incurred in Skadden's investigation following Moser's termination. Final Award at 8. \"As a registered investment adviser, Salus bears substantial reporting obligations to the SEC and has fiduciary duties to its investors.... Salus's decision to conduct an outside investigation was both prudent and necessary and was caused solely by Moser's malfeasance coupled with his failure to fully cooperated [sic] when his fraudulent acts were uncovered.\" Partial Award at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The award also included $422,746.43 in Salus's attorneys' fees and costs incurred in the arbitration proceeding itself. Final Award at 8. Moser had continued his evasive behavior throughout the arbitration. Early on, Moser was granted an adjournment of the arbitration hearing on the basis of his counsel's representation that Moser \"suffered from a serious health condition.\" Partial Award at 2. At a subsequent conference, his counsel represented that \"Moser's poor health prevented him from participating in the proceeding for the 'foreseeable future,' \" submitting a doctor's note in support thereof.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Yet after Salus presented \"credible evidence\" that Moser was \"gainfully employed-indeed, traveling extensively, including cross country,\" Moser declined to make his physician available for a preliminary hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moser also failed to appear for\n   <em>\n    five\n   </em>\n   noticed and scheduled depositions, as well as multiple telephonic case management conferences, despite being repeatedly reminded by the arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4. And Moser refused to comply with a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces tecum\n   </em>\n   by failing to appear at the arbitration hearing which had been rescheduled on multiple occasions at his request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 4 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%205001\">\n    N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 5001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the arbitrator awarded $324,622.35 in pre-award interest that had accrued with respect to Moser's personal charges, disgorged income, and Salus's attorneys' fees and costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Final Award at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Salus filed the instant petition to confirm the arbitration award in New York\n   Supreme Court in July 2017. Several weeks later, Moser removed the petition to this Court and moved for partial vacatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moser challenges the arbitral award on multiple bases. First, he contends that the arbitrator exceeded his power in awarding Salus's attorneys' fees and costs. Second, he argues that the arbitrator erred by misapplying the faithless servant doctrine in awarding Salus his disgorged compensation. Finally, respondent asserts that the award is excessive in comparison to the \"amount in controversy,\" the personal charges he incurred, and thus impermissibly punitive. We proceed to analyze each alleged ground for vacating the award\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   and, finding each to be meritless, grant Salus's petition to confirm the arbitration award. Before doing so, however, we first consider two threshold issues raised by Moser and Salus, respectively; whether this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Moser, and whether Moser's motion for partial vacatur is timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Personal Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moser claims, as an initial matter, that this Court is unable to exercise personal jurisdiction over him because of purported defects in the service of Salus's petition. This is so, he explains, because he was never served a formal petition (instead, a petition in the form of an affidavit), and because proof of service was not timely filed in the court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Neither of Moser's arguments is persuasive. First, defects in pleadings such as petitions \"shall be ignored if a substantial right of a party is not prejudiced.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%203026\">\n    N.Y.

Moser offers no reason why he was prejudiced through Salus's use of an affidavit, entitled \"Petition to Confirm Arbitration Award,\" that otherwise satisfies the requirements of New York's Civil Procedure Law and Rules.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20C.P.L.R.%20%C2%A7%203026\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3013. Second, New York courts have expressly held that the filing of proof of service is not jurisdictional in nature; jurisdiction attaches once service (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , personal service and mailing of the petition and notice of petition) is complete.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Conde v.

Neither argument is persuasive.
