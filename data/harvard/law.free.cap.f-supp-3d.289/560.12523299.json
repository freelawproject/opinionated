Melvin also told the Government (c) that after some robberies, the robbery crew went to Tyrone's apartment, not the apartment of Kevin's mother.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Heller Decl. Ex.

At the close of that proceeding, in part because the Government had not submitted even an affidavit attesting to when and how it learned that Tyrone may have perjured himself during the trial, the Court scheduled an evidentiary hearing to learn more of the facts underlying the Government's investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    at 3:5-18, 5:16-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Detective McCready credibly testified that the Government took appropriate steps to ascertain whether Tyrone's information was accurate prior to trial and found it corroborated by other evidence the Government had acquired in support of its case. Hearing Tr. at 17:9-14, 47:5-17. It is true that the proffer sessions began in the same month that Kevin's trial began,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:2-18, resulting in a \"rather hectic schedule prior to trial\" and an allegedly inadequate investigation, Defendant Kevin Walker's Post-Hearing Brief in Support of His Motion for a New Trial Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. Pro. 33 (\"Def. Post-Hearing Br.\") at 4-8, ECF No. 154. But while this condensed schedule may have made the Government's assessment of Tyrone's credibility less than perfect, it does not support an inference that the Government should have known that Tyrone may not have been entirely truthful during his proffer sessions. Nor does Tyrone's statement that he could not recall the password to a cell phone that the Government had recovered almost two years earlier and that Tyrone only used for at most a year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

Therefore, Kevin's motion for a new trial should be granted only if Kevin most likely would not have been convicted had the jury known that Tyrone had lied on the stand. Courts consider several factors in ascertaining whether the defendant would have been acquitted had the jury known about the perjury, including \"whether the new information would have provided merely additional, cumulative, impeachment information,\" \"whether the false testimony related to the merits of the case, or merely to tangential questions concerning misconduct by the witness,\" and \"the existence of evidence independent of the witness's testimony establishing the defendant's guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Critical portions of Tyrone's perjury relate directly to the merits of the Government's case against Kevin. Tyrone testified that both guns used in the robberies belonged to Kevin. In fact, it now appears likely that one of the guns belonged to Tyrone. Tyrone testified that he was not present at the February 5, 2015 robbery. In fact, it now appears likely that Tyrone did participate in that robbery. This newly disclosed evidence went to \"the heart\" of the Government's case: the nature of Kevin's participation in the robberies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Although there was evidence at trial independent of Tyrone's testimony tending to establish Kevin's guilt, the interests of justice require granting a new trial.
