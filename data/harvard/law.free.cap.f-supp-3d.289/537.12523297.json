(\"Defendant\" or \"Airbnb\"). Before me is Airbnb's motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the action. Because Plaintiffs and Defendant entered into a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement, Airbnb's motion is granted in part and denied in part, and this action is stayed pending the outcome of arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Naude originally created her account and registered as a user with Airbnb on July 29, 2009. (Naude Decl. \u00b6 3; Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff Plazza initially registered with Airbnb on August 21, 2011, and created a second account on October 2, 2014. (Plazza Decl. \u00b6 2; Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege that by creating and maintaining a website that lists, advertises, and takes fees or commissions for property rentals posted by individual members on the site, Airbnb is acting as an unlicensed real estate broker in violation of New York Real Property Law \u00a7 440,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs assert that in this way Airbnb avoids being subject to the laws governing real estate brokers, and \"place[s] itself in the position of sole arbiter and decision-maker in all member disputes and vests itself with complete discretion with regard to the fees and commissions its [sic] takes as well as the distribution of rental payments it processes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiffs allege that Airbnb's actions and behavior are \"deceptive and fraudulent\" and result in actual harm to\n   Airbnb's members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Plaintiffs bring this putative class action on behalf of themselves and all similarly situated individuals who \"[p]aid any fee, commission, or rent to Airbnb for the purpose of listing and/or renting real property, including apartments, co-ops, condominiums, and houses, within the State of New York within the six year period preceding the filing of the complaint in this action.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Specifically, Plaintiffs claim violations under New York Real Property Law \u00a7 440,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., deceptive trade practices under New York General Business Law \u00a7 349, fraud, and unjust enrichment.

(Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Naude Decl. \u00b6 3; Plazza Decl. \u00b6 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is implied, and I assume in connection with my consideration of this motion, that the 2009 Terms of Service (\"TOS\") did not contain an arbitration clause. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13; Def.'s Mem. 6; Pls.' Mem. 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, since 2009 Airbnb has modified its TOS numerous times, and since August 15, 2011, the TOS includes a mandatory arbitration provision with a class action waiver. (Miller Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13; Pls.' Mem. 6-11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The TOS modifications have effective dates of August 15, 2011, May 22, 2012, April 7, 2014, June 30, 2014, and July 6, 2015. (Miller Decl. \u00b6 11, Exs. 4-8.) During each of these years, the arbitration provision in the TOS reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   You and Airbnb agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, \"\n   <strong>\n    Disputes\n   </strong>\n   \") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Airbnb are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you\n   and Airbnb otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13, Exs. 4-8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The arbitration provision also includes paragraphs addressing the arbitration rules and governing law, arbitration process, arbitration location and procedure, arbitrator's decision, and the responsibility for paying any arbitration-related fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 4-8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the initial paragraphs of the TOS state that \"[b]y using the Site and Application, you agree to comply with and be legally bound by the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As of May 22, 2012, the TOS was also preceded by a capitalized admonition to users to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 5-8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Airbnb's archived computer code, as of 2009, the sign-up screen for potential users included a sentence, directly below the sign-up button, stating that \"By clicking 'Sign Up,' you confirm that you accept the\n   <em>\n    Terms of Service\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5, Ex. 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The TOS were hyperlinked, and there was one other hyperlink allowing existing members to sign in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As of August 21, 2011, Airbnb presented users with one of two possible alternate sign-up screens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, Ex. 2.) The first allowed potential users to either \"Connect with Facebook\" or \"\n   <em>\n    Create an account with your email address\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2.) The phrase \"\n   <em>\n    [c]reate an account with your email address\n   </em>\n   \" was hyperlinked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Below those two options was a sentence stating that \"By clicking 'Connect with Facebook,' you confirm that you accept the\n   <em>\n    Terms of Service\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The phrase \"\n   <em>\n    Terms of Service\n   </em>\n   \" was in blue text and underlined, indicating a hyperlink. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The second alternate screen similarly presented users with two options; however, users could now click a button stating \"Connect with Facebook\" or input their first name, last name, email address, password, and password confirmation prior to clicking on a button stating \"Create Account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Above the button \"Connect with Facebook\" was text stating \"Sign up using Facebook.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Directly underneath the two options was text stating \"By clicking 'Sign Up' or 'Connect with Facebook,' you confirm that you accept the Terms of Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Terms of Service\" was in blue text, indicating a hyperlink. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) There was one other hyperlink allowing existing members to sign in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, as of October 2, 2014, although the two alternate sign-up screens now allowed three methods of signing up, including \"Sign up with Facebook,\" \"Sign up with Google\" or \"Sign up with Email,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   they still noted that \"[b]y signing up,\" the user \"agree[s] to Airbnb's\n   <em>\n    Terms of Service\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Privacy Policy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Guest Refund Policy\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Host Guarantee Terms\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, Ex. 3.) The Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Guest Refund Policy, and Host Guarantee Terms were all separately hyperlinked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs further referenced, and presented in advance of an April 28, 2016 conference in this matter, a \"screenshot\" of a 2016 sign-up screen. (Norton Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, Ex. A; Pls.' Pre-Mot. Letter.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   This sign-up screen displayed three options for signing up-\"Continue with Facebook,\" \"Continue with Google,\" or \"Sign up with Email\"-and included, underneath the third option, the sentence stating that \"[b]y signing up, I agree to Airbnb's Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Guest Refund Policy, and Host Guarantee Terms.\" (Norton Decl. Ex. A; Pls.' Pre-Mot. Letter.) As with the other sign-up screens, the TOS and other documents were separately hyperlinked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Quite apart from the initial sign-up process, Airbnb presented its modified TOS to users the first time they attempted to log in to their Airbnb accounts after the particular modified TOS took effect. (Miller Decl. \u00b6 16.) Users were required to accept the modified TOS prior to accessing any part of the Airbnb platform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Naude Decl. \u00b6 7; Plazza Decl. \u00b6 6.) Airbnb terms these acceptances \"consent events.\" (Miller Decl. \u00b6 16.) The 2012, 2014, and 2015 modifications of the TOS each presented Airbnb users with a screen box titled either \"Updated Terms of Service and Privacy Policy,\" \"Terms of Service,\" or \"Updated Terms of Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 9-11.) Below the title was a short paragraph notifying users that Airbnb recently updated its terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In that introductory paragraph, the 2014 and 2015 screen boxes further told users to read each term carefully and provided a hyperlink for users to \"[l]earn more about what's changed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 10-11.) Below the introductory paragraph, each screen box provided a scrollable version of the TOS and tabs to the other relevant agreements that had been modified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 9-11.) Finally, each screen box required users,\n   underneath the scrollable TOS, both to click a check box next to text stating \"I agree to the terms and conditions of the updated Terms of Service\" or other similar language, and to click a red button reading \"I Agree\" or \"Agree.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-19, Exs. 9-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Airbnb's records indicate that Plaintiff Naude \"consented\" to the TOS on July 29, 2009, May 23, 2012, May 7, 2014, and August 16, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, Exs. 17-19.) Similarly, Airbnb's records indicate that Plaintiff Plazza \"consented\" to the TOS on August 21, 2011, May 22, 2012, May 30, 2014, and November 22, 2015 under his first account, and on October 2, 2014 and August 6, 2015 under his second account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, 24, Exs. 17-19.) In addition to the modification screens, Airbnb's records indicate that since 2014, Plaintiffs would have received emails after these modifications were enacted notifying Plaintiffs of the TOS modifications and providing links to explanations of those changes as well as the old and new versions of the TOS itself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, Exs. 12-16.) Plaintiffs provided copies of emails sent to Plaintiff Naude on July 10, 2015 and March 30, 2016, and to Plaintiff Plazza on March 31, 2016, which informed Plaintiffs in the subject line that \"We're updating our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy,\" informed Plaintiffs that they would be asked to agree to these terms upon using the site, and linked to information explaining the changes as well as old and new versions of the TOS. (Nadler Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, Exs. A-C.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs do not appear to dispute the accuracy of the modification and email records, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. 7-10),\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   but rather indicate a lack of recollection as to certain facts related to the initial sign-up process. Specifically, Plaintiff Naude does not recall seeing, being provided with, or being required to agree to Airbnb's TOS during the initial registration process or at any point between 2009 and 2012. (Naude Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.) Plaintiff Naude does, however, recall \"visiting the Airbnb site and being required to click a button indicating that [she] accept[s] Airbnb's updated Terms of Service and other policies\" on \"at least one occasion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Plaintiff Naude did not read the TOS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, with respect to the emails, Plaintiff Naude acknowledges receipt of email \"notices that Airbnb had updated its Terms of Service\" and accurately notes that the emails did not explicitly inform users of the arbitration provision and class action waiver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9; Miller Decl. Exs. 12, 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff Plazza similarly has \"no specific recollection of either seeing the Terms of Service hyperlink or any statement\" noting his agreement to the TOS before setting up his accounts. (Plazza Decl. \u00b6 3.) Plaintiff Plazza further notes that while creating his accounts, he was not actually presented with the TOS, and was able to enter the site without clicking on an actual button reading \"I Agree.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff Plazza does recall being required to click such a button \"[o]n several occasions\" after he created his accounts, but also indicates that he did not read the TOS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Finally, like Plaintiff Naude, Plaintiff Plazza acknowledges receipt of email \"notices that Airbnb had updated its Terms of Service,\" but likewise reiterates that the emails did not explicitly inform him of the arbitration provision and class action waiver. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Miller Decl. Exs. 13, 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their putative class action complaint on February 11, 2016, claiming violations under New York Real Property Law \u00a7 440,\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., deceptive trade practices under New York General Business Law \u00a7 349, fraud, and unjust enrichment. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-73.) In accordance with my Individual Rules, on March 28, 2016, Defendant filed a letter that requested a pre-motion conference on its anticipated motion to compel arbitration and outlined the basis for such a motion. (Doc. 8.) Defendant filed a letter with supplemental authority on March 29, 2016. (Doc. 9.) On March 31, 2016, Plaintiffs responded to this letter, (Doc. 10), and on April 28, 2016, I held a conference regarding Defendant's anticipated motion.

Pursuant to that stipulation, Defendant filed its motion to compel arbitration on July 22, 2016, (Docs. 18-21), Plaintiffs filed their opposition on August 22, 2016, (Docs. 22-23), and Defendant filed its reply on September 12, 2016, (Doc. 26). Plaintiffs filed a notice of supplemental authority on October 5, 2016, (Doc. 27), to which Defendant responded on October 11, 2016, (Doc. 28). Defendant filed its own notice of supplemental authority on November 1, 2016, (Doc. 29), to which Plaintiffs responded on November 16, 2016, (Doc. 30). Defendant filed an additional notice of supplemental authority on August 17, 2017, (Doc. 37), to which Plaintiffs responded on August 18, 2017, (Doc. 38). Defendants filed a reply to Plaintiffs' letter that same day, (Doc. 39), and Plaintiffs filed a response on August 30, 2017, which provided an update noting that the Second Circuit had denied without prejudice a motion to amend its decision in\n   <em>\n    Meyer v.

(Pls.' Mem. 16-17.) However, Plaintiffs maintain that the screens were insufficient notice because they did not directly refer to the arbitration provision, nor did the emails concurrently sent after the 2014 and 2015 modifications advise users of the arbitration provision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.) These facts alone do not mandate a finding that there is no notice, and the other facts present do support the conclusion that there was a valid agreement to arbitrate. Specifically, after modifying the TOS, Airbnb provided the modified TOS to users the first time that any user tried to access his or her account after the modified TOS took effect. (Miller Decl. \u00b6 16.) During those times, Airbnb presented an actual scroll box with the modified TOS and would not allow users to access any part of Airbnb's website or continue using the platform until they indicated their assent to the TOS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Naude Decl. \u00b6 7; Plazza Decl. \u00b6 6.) At the very top of the modified TOS was text warning users to \"READ THE TERMS CAREFULLY\" as they contained important legal information, including a clause governing \"JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES.\" (Miller Decl. Exs. 5-8, 10-11.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the evidence establishes that directly underneath the scroll box, users had to click on two buttons manifesting assent: a check box with the text \"I agree to the terms and conditions of the updated Terms of Service [and other terms],\" and a red button right below it, with white text, reading \"I Agree\" or \"Agree.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 9-11.)

Indeed, Plaintiff Naude admits that she recalls \"[o]n at least one occasion ... being required to click a button indicating [acceptance of] Airbnb's updated Terms of Service and other policies.\" (Naude Decl. \u00b6 7.) Similarly, Plaintiff Plazza recalls that on \"several occasions\" after he created his accounts, he was \"required to click a button indicating that [he accepted] Airbnb's updated Terms of Service and other policies.\" (Plazza Decl. \u00b6 6.) In addition, Airbnb presents evidence that Plaintiff Plazza accessed one of his two accounts and was required to accept the modified\n   TOS on May 22, 2012, May 30, 2014, August 6, 2015, and November 22, 2015. (Miller Decl. \u00b6 24, Exs. 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The emails sent by Airbnb to its users upon the modification of the TOS in 2014 and 2015 are yet another form of notice provided to Plaintiffs. While the subject lines of these emails are not apparent from the exhibits attached by Airbnb to the Miller declaration, (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204254062\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exs. 12-16), the 2015 and 2016 emails actually sent to Plaintiffs and attached to the Nadler declaration clearly state in the subject line that Airbnb is \"updating [its] Terms of Service and Privacy Policy,\" (Nadler Decl. Exs. A-C). Moreover, the substance of the emails notified users that Airbnb had updated its Terms of Service, hyperlinked a page explaining the changes, and hyperlinked a page where the TOS could be found. (Miller Decl. Exs. 12-16; Nadler Decl. Exs. A-C.) Even without the evidence provided by Airbnb, Plaintiffs both acknowledge receiving emails with \"notices that Airbnb had updated its Terms of Service.\" (Naude Decl. \u00b6 9; Plazza Decl. \u00b6 7.)

(Pls.' Mem. 18-20.) This argument is equally unpersuasive. Regardless of the placement of the arbitration clause, Plaintiffs do not dispute that, beginning in May 2012, the TOS was preceded by a capitalized admonition warning users to read the terms carefully as they contained important legal information, including a clause governing \"JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES.\" (Miller Decl. Exs. 5-8.) It is also undisputed that Plaintiffs would have been confronted by that sentence when they attempted to access their respective accounts after the TOS had been modified. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-19, Exs. 9-11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Naude Decl. \u00b6 7; Plazza Decl. \u00b6 6.) Moreover, in the emails sent by Airbnb and received by Plaintiffs in 2014 and 2015, Airbnb told users that they \"should review the documents in full on [their] own.\" (Miller Decl. Exs. 12-16.) Finally, the arbitration provision could at all times be found under a bolded heading, titled \"Dispute Resolution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 4-8.)

Plaintiffs raise two issues they claim impact the enforceability of Airbnb's arbitration clause: fraudulent inducement and unconscionability. These arguments are not supported by the facts and are, in any event, unpersuasive. I address each in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Fraudulent Inducement of the Arbitration Provision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs set forth their facts supporting a fraudulent inducement claim in a single, brief paragraph, arguing that Defendant surreptitiously inserted an arbitration provision into its TOS materially altering the rights of users, and buried the arbitration provision deep within a voluminous document without drawing the users' attention to that provision. (Pls.' Mem. 21.) Putting aside the fact that Plaintiff Plazza initially signed up for his account after the date that the arbitration provision was added-a fact that makes Plaintiff Plazza's assertion of this argument more flawed and unpersuasive-I find that these arguments fail with regard to both Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   If the claim involves fraudulent inducement of an arbitration provision as opposed to the contract itself, a court as opposed to the arbitrator may decide the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buckeye\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5962007\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/440/#p443\">\n    546 U.S. at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5962007\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/440/#p443\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, Plaintiffs do not provide any case law supporting that fraudulent inducement exists in this case. In fact, in the one case cited by Plaintiffs where fraudulent inducement of an arbitration provision was found sufficiently colorable to send the parties to trial, the case involved a standalone alternative dispute resolution document that was written in English and given to a non-English speaking plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caseres v.

Nov. 4, 2013). Furthermore, the court in that case cited three cases where fraud was found, each involving improper or allegedly improper translation of agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. Similar facts do not exist here. The underlying facts supporting the holdings of these courts are not surprising since a fraudulent inducement claim must be premised on some form of actual reliance. Here, Plaintiffs Naude and Plazza, unlike the plaintiffs in these cases, are not relying on some faulty translation; rather, they argue that they did not even read the TOS, and do not cite to any evidence to show that Airbnb misleadingly communicated the terms of the TOS prior to Plaintiffs' signing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hinesley v.

For these reasons and given that Plaintiffs' fraudulent inducement claim here rests solely on the same faulty foundation upon which they base some of their arguments as to lack of notice, I find that the fraudulent inducement argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Unconscionability of the Arbitration Provision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs' final claim is that the arbitration provision contained in Airbnb's TOS is unconscionable.

With respect to procedural\n   unconscionability, Plaintiffs first refer to the factual circumstances surrounding Airbnb's insertion of the arbitration provision into the TOS in 2011-namely, the insertion of the clause without notification to existing users, the lack of any bolding or capitalization to draw the attention of new users, and the alleged \"hidden\" nature of the clause.

In addressing these arguments, I note again that the arbitration provision was present when Plaintiff Plazza first signed up for his account and that the revised TOS containing the arbitration clause was presented to Plaintiff Naude when she attempted to access her account on May 22, 2012. In any event, beginning in 2011, the arbitration clause was set off by a bolded heading titled \"Dispute Resolution,\" with various sections of information-including \"Arbitration Rules and Governing Law\" and \"Arbitration Process\"-underlined. (Miller Decl. Exs. 4-8.) Furthermore, beginning in 2012, the TOS included a capitalized admonition at the very outset that referred to \"A CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS THE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF DISPUTES,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 5-8), minimizing any impact that the location of the arbitration provision itself would have. Finally, although the 2011 modification did not present such a warning at the top of the agreement, California courts have found that parties are \"under no obligation to highlight the arbitration clause of [a] contract, nor [are they] required to specifically call that clause to [the other party's] attention.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=190%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20812\">\n    190 Cal.Rptr.3d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=353%20P.3d%20741\">\n    353 P.3d at 751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a state law to the contrary would be preempted by the FAA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs' second argument of procedural unconscionability relates to the unavailability of the arbitration rules.

In\n    <em>\n     Berkson\n    </em>\n    , Judge Weinstein derived certain general principles which permit, rather than forbid, the validity of Airbnb's TOS: first, a TOS will not be enforced when there is \"no evidence\" the website user had notice; second, the TOS will be enforced if the user is encouraged by the design and content of the website and webpage to examine the terms; and third, the TOS will not be enforced where the link to the terms is \"buried at the bottom of a webpage or tucked away in obscure corners where users are unlikely to see it.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339601\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/97/359/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339601\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/97/359/\">\n     at 401-02\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Judge Weinstein further distinguished\n    <em>\n     Gogo\n    </em>\n    from another case on the grounds that Gogo did not have a practice of emailing or mailing the contents of the terms to its customers and did not make an effort to draw the plaintiff's attention to the terms,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339601\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/97/359/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339601\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/97/359/\">\n     at 403\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , two facts that are present in the current case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"28\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Plaintiffs state that they felt forced into accepting the modified TOS because they otherwise would be unable to access their account information.
