Under the current version of Oakland's ordinance, which was enacted in July 2017, a developer of a multifamily project with over twenty units must either: (i) spend 0.5 percent of building development costs on art displays on the site of the development or a nearby right-of-way; or (ii) pay an equivalent amount to a city-operated fund for public art installations. A developer of certain commercial projects must purchase and install art valued at one percent of building development costs or pay an equivalent fee to Oakland's public-art fund. This requirement applies generally to all development projects that fit the Ordinance's criteria, although there are ways for some developers to get out of the requirement or reduce the amount they need to spend. For example, a developer of affordable housing doesn't need to comply with the ordinance if it can show that compliance costs would make the project economically infeasible. And the ordinance includes a mechanism to administratively appeal a decision by the Planning Commission or Planning Director requiring compliance with the ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Building Industry Association-Bay Area has challenged the validity of the ordinance on two constitutional grounds. First, the Association claims the ordinance violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Second, the Association claims the ordinance compels speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With respect to the takings claim, the Association argues that the ordinance is an unlawful exaction that violates the \"exactions doctrine\" applied in\n   <em>\n    Nollan v.

But the Supreme Court has only applied this exactions doctrine in cases involving a particular individual property, where government officials exercised their discretion to require something of the property owner in exchange for approval of a project.

Although the Ninth Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    McClung\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    Nollan\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   do not apply to generally applicable development conditions, Judge Breyer concluded that this holding was invalidated by the Supreme Court's subsequent ruling in\n   <em>\n    Koontz\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4210956\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/1072/\">\n    71 F.Supp.3d 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1083 n. 4 (N.D.

The exactions doctrine, in other words, has historically been understood as a means to protect against abuse of discretion by land-use\n   officials with respect to an individual parcels of land, and\n   <em>\n    Koontz\n   </em>\n   itself spoke of it in those terms, undermining Judge Breyer's argument that\n   <em>\n    Koontz\n   </em>\n   displaced the Ninth Circuit's rule that the exactions doctrine is unavailable to a plaintiff making a facial challenge to a generally applicable land-use regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Perhaps reasonable arguments could be made for expanding the reach of the exactions doctrine so that it can be invoked in facial challenges to a generally applicable regulations, rather than merely discretionary decisions regarding an individual property by land-use officials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Calif.

On the other hand, if the speech requirement is minimal, if there is minimal risk that the speech could be misattributed, and if the speech requirement doesn't significantly deter other speech, judicial scrutiny is far more relaxed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rumsfeld v.

The ordinance does not require a developer to express any specific viewpoint, because developers can purchase and display art that they choose. To the extent a developer wishes for the building to convey a particular message, there's no reason to believe that an art display would muddle that message. (And in at least some cases, a developer can comply with the ordinance without modifying the building's design at all by placing the art in a nearby right-of-way.) Perhaps most importantly, even if the ordinance to some extent encourages developers to engage in expressive conduct by purchasing and displaying art, the degree of compulsion is minimal, because if developers do not want to purchase and display art on or near their property, they can comply with the ordinance by paying a fee to the City in the same amount. And although Oakland uses that money to fund art, the Association does not argue (and could not reasonably argue) that the First Amendment prevents a local government from earmarking revenue collected from its residents to display art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Therefore, the ordinance is subject to review under the First Amendment only to ensure that it is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Expressions Hair Design\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12603180\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1144/#p1152\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n    471 U.S. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Beeman v.

It is reasonable to believe that the installation of art at or around new developments and the installation of public art funded by the in lieu fee will both improve the city's aesthetics and increase property values. It is also reasonable to assume that development\n   can have adverse effects on aesthetics in a city (for example, obstruction of views and reduction in sunlight), and that the art requirement mitigates those adverse effects. Therefore, the ordinance does not violate the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
