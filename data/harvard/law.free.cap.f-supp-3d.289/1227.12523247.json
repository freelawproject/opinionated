Nevertheless, I will briefly respond to Defendants' arguments concerning statutory context and legislative history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants argue that viewing the APH Yield Exclusion as immediately implementable cannot be squared with other FCIA requirements that the agency establish underwriting rules, use sufficient actuarial data before offering insurance coverage, and operate the crop insurance program in an actuarially sound manner. ECF No. 37 at 15 (referencing \u00a7 1508(g)(1), \u00a7 1508(a)(1), \u00a7 1506(n) ). While immediate implementation of the APH Yield Exclusion undoubtedly created substantial logistical difficulties for the agency, the Court nevertheless must apply the statute as written. The\n   <em>\n    Adkins\n   </em>\n   court summarized this well:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The administrative record reflects that the agency had much to do to prepare for the 2015 crop year, but that does not permit the Court to re-write the statute to permit the delay sought by the agency in this case. It is the role of Congress, not the courts, to write and enact statutory provisions. The Court's role is one of interpretation and enforcement, and in this instance, the Court [finds] legal error in the agency's decision with respect to the APH Yield Exclusion set out in \u00a7 1508(g)(4)(C).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Adkins\n   </em>\n   , at 601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, Defendants point to a few statements within the legislative history to support their contention that the APH Yield Exclusion was meant to be implemented on a date later than the effective date. ECF No. 37 at 16. The Court acknowledges that the legislative history cuts both ways in this case. However, courts turn to legislative history for guidance only if the text of the statute is ambiguous, and here it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based upon this Court's review of the plain text, I find that Congress directly spoke to the issue presented. The agency's decision to delay implementation of the APH Yield Exemption without clear Congressional direction constitutes legal error. The agency viewed Congressional silence as creating ambiguity, but this stands in direct opposition to\n   <em>\n    Gozlon-Peretz\n   </em>\n   's binding precedent that silence with respect to an enactment date is a clear statement of immediate effectiveness. The APH Yield Exclusion should have been applied in time for Plaintiffs' 2015 winter wheat crop, and therefore Plaintiffs were wrongly denied a benefit to which they were entitled under \u00a7 1508(g)(4)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court REVERSES the National Appeals Division Director's decision and REMANDS for proper application of the APH Yield Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Pub.
