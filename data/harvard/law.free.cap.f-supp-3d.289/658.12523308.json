At the time of sentencing, he had a 1985 conviction for simple assault under Pennsylvania law and a 1988 conviction for robbery, burglary, and conspiracy under Pennsylvania law. The court found that these offenses were crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. As a result, he was a career offender subject to a Guideline range of 360 months' imprisonment to life. However, the court determined that his designation as a career offender overstated the seriousness of his criminal history and thus departed downward from criminal history category VI to category IV. This resulted in a Guidelines' range of 210 to 262 months. The court then sentenced Hoffner to 240 months' imprisonment, five\n   years' supervised release, and a $1,200 special assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed Hoffner's conviction and sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

We reach this conclusion in light of the Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   . First,\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   made clear that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not set forth a rule of general application since it did not apply to the advisory Guidelines even though the relevant language of ACCA and the\n   advisory Guidelines was the same. Moreover, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   expressly cautioned that its holding applies \"only [to the] advisory Sentencing Guidelines.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p890\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plainly, it was signaling in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   should not be read to govern the residual clause of \u00a7 4B1.2 of the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. Justice Sotomayor in her concurring opinion confirmed that the issue of\n   <em>\n    Johnson's\n   </em>\n   applicability to the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines is an \"open ... question\" in which the Court in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   \"take[s] no position on its appropriate resolution.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609931\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/886/#p890\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   903 &amp; n.4. Here the Supreme Court has made a clear declaration that it was deciding only a specific question and that it has left open and undecided a separate question. Under the circumstances, it would be improper to conclude that the Supreme Court's \"new rule of constitutional law\" related to the specific question decided is also applicable retroactively to that separate question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Regardless of what the Supreme Court may decide in the future, it has for now turned on the red light, and we are not free to ignore it.
