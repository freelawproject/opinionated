Most truly fixed costs, such as rent, interest, and depreciation, are capital-related costs and are paid on a reasonable cost basis, regardless of volume. Variable costs, on the other hand, are those costs for items and services that vary directly with utilization such as food and laundry costs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   In a hospital setting, however, many costs are neither perfectly fixed nor perfectly variable, but are semifixed. Semifixed costs are those costs for items and services that are essential for the hospital to maintain operation but also vary somewhat with volume. For purposes of this adjustment, many semifixed costs, such as personnel-related costs, may be considered as fixed on a case-by-case basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   In evaluating semifixed costs, the intermediary considers the length of time the hospital has experienced a decrease in utilization. For a short period of time, most semifixed costs are considered fixed. As the period of decreased utilization continues, we expect that a cost-effective hospital would take action to reduce unnecessary expenses. Therefore, if a hospital did not take such action, some of the semifixed costs may not be included in determining the amount of the payment adjustment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The adjustment amount includes the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services. The intermediary reviews the determination of core staff and services based on an individual hospital's needs and circumstances; e.g., minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(B).

The intermediary makes a determination on the request and notifies the hospital of the decision within 180 days of the date the intermediary receives all required information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The payment adjustment is calculated under the same assumption used to evaluate core staff, i.e., the hospital is assumed to have budgeted based on prior year utilization and to have had insufficient time in the year in which the volume decrease occurred to make significant reductions in cost. Therefore, the\n   adjustment allows an increase in cost up to the prior year's total Program Inpatient Operating Cost (excluding pass-through costs), increased by the PPS update factor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2810.1(D).

After looking at the statute and regulations, Mr. Steiner testified that he had determined the MAC had not been handling variable costs properly and that the only costs the MAC was to consider were fixed and semi-fixed costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 263, 274). He testified the MAC asked CMS for guidance but they never received a response. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Because neither Unity nor Lakes had identified variable costs in their submissions, Mr. Steiner and the MAC reviewed the trial balances submitted with the hospitals' cost reports and \"identified those accounts or sub-accounts that in our judgment would vary with utilization.\" (Tr.

To the extent an account may have included rental equipment or salaries, Steiner did not include those accounts, taking what he testified was a \"very conservative approach in identifying what [he] thought were variable costs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 265). After coming up with total variable costs, they used a factoring schedule and grouped the adjustments by cost center, then reran the cost report to compute a revised Medicare operating cost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. Steiner testified some providers may submit variable costs with their requests; some would submit variable costs when the MAC requested; and some would not provide any variable cost estimates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266). The PRM manual defined variable costs as \"those that vary based on utilization.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271). He testified that physical therapy services were considered variable since they were usually paid on a per service or percentage of charge basis; medical supplies and drugs because they were charged to particular patients. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) His assumption that drugs varied with patient volume was only a \"commonsense assumption\" and not based on any studies or any reference book. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 270). He agreed that hospital management had no control over physician orders of various things as blood or drugs.

It found the MAC was authorized to eliminate variable costs to determine total fixed operating costs, but that the MAC had improperly calculated the adjustment amount and the hospitals were entitled to the VDA amounts they had requested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [10] at 63; [13-1] at 64). Specifically, the PRRB found that the net payment adjustment requested by the hospitals was the ceiling for payment and that since the fixed costs of each (after exclusion of the variable costs) exceeded that \"ceiling,\" both hospitals were entitled to the ceiling amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [10] at 62; [13-1] at 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Administrator notified the parties the PRRB decisions would be reviewed.

Arbitrary/Capricious/Contrary to Applicable Law\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The hospitals' challenge to the Secretary/Administrator's decision is three-fold: (1) the Secretary ignored the plain language of the VDA statute and regulation; (2) the decision directly contradicts the Secretary's own interpretive guidelines on the VDA regulation; and (3) the Secretary's decision is illogical. The Secretary responds that exclusion of variable costs is supported by the plain language of the statute, regulation and guidelines, and the methodology applied accomplishes the purposes of the statute. Interestingly, both sides argue the language of the statute, regulation and PRM is plain, plaintiff arguing the Secretary did not follow them, the Secretary arguing he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The issue raised is a matter of first impression in this district. The parties have brought to the Court's attention only one other federal court case dealing with the issues at hand: Magistrate Judge Mahoney's Report and Recommendation in\n   <em>\n    St. Anthony Regional Hospital v. Hargan\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:16-cv-3117-LTS (N.D. Iowa Dec. 29, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The statute states the VDA is intended to compensate \"medicare dependent, small rural hospital(s)\" for fixed costs they incur when they have a qualifying decrease in inpatient cases. The statute does not reference \"semi-fixed\" or \"variable\" costs. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(G)(iii). The implementing regulation expands reimbursable costs to include \"semi-fixed\" costs.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3). \"Variable costs\" are not referenced in either. Both the statute and regulation, however, reference \"necessary core staff and services\" as being included in \"fixed costs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (i) In determining the adjustment amount, the intermediary considers-\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (A) The individual hospital's needs and circumstances, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services in view of minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (B) The hospital's fixed (and semi-fixed) costs, other than those costs paid on a reasonable cost basis under part 413 of this chapter; and ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.92\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3). \"Variable costs\" are separately discussed in the history accompanying publication of the original interim rule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Variable costs, on the other hand, are those costs for items and services that vary directly with utilization. However, in a hospital setting many costs are neither perfectly fixed nor perfectly variable, but are semifixed. Semifixed costs are those costs for items and services that are essential for the hospital to maintain operation but will also vary with volume. For the purposes of this adjustment, many semifixed costs, such as personnel related costs, may be considered as fixed on a case by case basis. An adjustment will not be made for truly variable costs, such as food and laundry services.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   48 FR 39752, 39781 (Sept. 1, 1983). PRM 15-1 \u00a7 2810.1(B) tracks the language from the Federal Register, with the addition of \"food and laundry costs\" as examples of costs which vary with utilization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   When Congress made the switch to the IPPS system, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   promulgated new rules to implement the switch \"from a cost-based, retrospective reimbursement system to a diagnosis specific prospective payment system.\" 48 FR 39752, 39752. HCFA noted as reasons for the change:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Numerous studies have highlighted the dynamic growth in health care spending in the United States, particularly the rapid increase in Medicare program hospital costs. These cost issues have been, for many years, a focal point of discussion and action on the part of all levels of government and various sections of the health care industry. Of concern to us is that these increasing Medicare expenditures constrain the ability of the Federal government to fund other needed programs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A third factor is Medicare's current cost reimbursement system, which by its very nature tends to aggravate this cost problem. The economic incentives of this system contribute to cost increases by rewarding hospitals and physicians who increase utilization and thus their allowable reimbursable costs. There is little incentive for hospitals and physicians to operate more efficiently as all allowable costs are fully reimbursed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   As a means of restraining hospital expenditure growth, prospective payment places hospitals at risk in terms of the management of their operations and the use of their resources. Thus, we believe that this system will begin to address some of the serious problems inherent in the present cost reimbursement payment methodology and, therefore, will allow us to better manage the Medicare program and preserve the integrity of the trust funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   48 FR 39752, 39804-05. Given the above expressed legislative goal of restraining the growth of hospital expenditures and passing some of the burden (and risk) of cost management on to the hospitals, the Secretary's interpretation of the statute and the regulation as requiring qualifying hospitals be compensated only for fixed (or\n   semifixed) costs is not inconsistent with the plain language of the statute or with the legislative intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The hospitals next argue the Secretary's decision contradicts the PRM and he has failed to give a \"reasoned basis for failing to comply with [his] own express, longstanding interpretive rules governing calculation of the VDA payment.\" (Pl. Brief [19-1] at 18). They argue the MAC's explanation \"that it was handling more requests and requests for larger amounts\" coupled with a 2004 letter from CMS instructing the MAC to include variable costs in the VDA calculation (with respect to the request of another provider) and the instructions in the PRM itself demonstrates the arbitrary and capricious nature of the Secretary's decision to exclude variable costs in the 2006 calculations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Taking the last argument first, the instructions in the PRM are ambiguous. The PRM examples do not explain what makes up the amount in line 4 of the examples-FY Program Inpatient Operating Cost-the hospitals assume it is the total cost for the fiscal year. Line 4 could just as readily be, as the Secretary has now determined, the net costs for the fiscal year after variable costs are subtracted. The hospitals do not cite the Court to anything in the PRM which suggests the Line 4 amounts can only be or must be a hospital's total FY inpatient costs, both fixed and variable. In any event, the PRM is not a \"notice-and-comment\" rule covered by the APA, instead, it falls into the category of \"interpretative rules, general statements of policy or rules of agency organization, procedure or practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587337\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1199/#p1209\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1203-04 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(A).

Reg. 33034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 33049 (\"We determine on a case-by-case basis whether an adjustment will be granted and the amount of that adjustment.\"). Clearly, the VDA determinations are made on an individualized basis and in the 2004 case, the provider itself \"excluded costs relating to food, drugs and supplies\" when it submitted its SCH payment adjustment application. (Tr. [10-2] at 724). It is not determinable from the 2004 determination\n   letter what variable costs CMS determined would be appropriate to include with respect to the provider involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The MAC's explanation for exclusion of variable costs came via the testimony of Mr. Steiner, who testified that in late 2008 his manager directed him to look at the VDAs \"because \"we were seeing some very high dollar amounts in reviewing that process.\" (Tr. [10] at 261). Mr. Steiner understood that in the past the MAC had not removed variable costs in processing VDA requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 273). After looking at the statute and regulations, Mr. Steiner testified that he had determined the MAC had not been handling variable costs properly and that the only costs the MAC was to consider were fixed and semi-fixed costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 263, 274).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   At hearing, counsel for the hospitals argued that because hospitals cannot control what tests and medications physicians might order which the hospitals must then provide, those \"uncontrollable\" costs qualify as \"fixed\" costs, in line with guidance in the PRM that \"Fixed costs are those costs over which management has no control.\" Again, the PRM does not have the force and effect of law and the Court finds the language in the PRM defining \"fixed costs\" to be overly simplistic, given the complicated cost accounting involved. Counsel also pointed to provisions in the Iowa Administrative Code requiring hospitals to provide proper dietary services and to Medicare's formulary requirements as supporting a finding medications and food should be considered fixed costs. Mr. Steiner testified that when he reviewed the hospitals' trial balances submitted with their cost reports, he went through and identified accounts or sub-accounts that would vary with utilization, such as medications and supplies charged to patients, outside laboratory tests, radiology and therapy services, but excluded sub-accounts for professional fees and equipment rentals as fixed costs. (Tr. [10] at 264-265). This is consistent with the statute which \"also requires that the adjustment amount include the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services. HCFA will review the determination of core staff and services based on an individual hospital's needs and circumstances; e.g., minimum staffing requirements imposed by State agencies.\" 48 FR 39752-01, 39781-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The hospitals argued fewer patients does not necessarily translate into less patient utilization if the patients are sicker. As the Secretary pointed out, however, there is nothing in the record to suggest the hospitals had \"sicker\" patients during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court finds the following: The regulations did not change nor did the facts underlying their promulgation-the Secretary discovered the Department had made a mistake in how it had been calculating VDA payments under the existing regulations. The government was paying out increasing sums to hospitals, payments which covered the hospitals' fixed\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   variable inpatient costs, a scenario not contemplated by the statute or the intent of the IPPS system: \"[to] restrain[ ] hospital expenditure growth, prospective payment places hospitals at risk in terms of the management of their operations and the use of their resources.\" 48 FR 39752, 39804-05. The IPPS was not intended to make qualifying hospitals whole, only to \"full compensate the hospital for the\n   <em>\n    fixed costs\n   </em>\n   it incurs ... including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww(d)(5)(D)(ii), (d)(5)(G)(iii).

Mr. Steiner testified that the PRM defined \"variable costs as those that vary based on utilization\" and in response to a query whether drugs could be considered \"semi-fixed costs\" testified that drugs chargeable to a particular patient was utilization and that \"[a]s there are fewer drugs prescribed by physicians, fewer drugs provided by the hospital, the cost would go down. There's less utilization of chargeable drugs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 271). Plaintiffs did not, however, present any evidence regarding the costs excluded by Mr. Steiner, only argument and inferences from cross-examination of witnesses on general cost topics. Plaintiffs did not present any empirical studies to contradict Mr. Steiner's \"commonsense\" assumptions. Plaintiffs did not bring in any witnesses to explain why the costs excluded were in fact necessary and essential to the hospitals' core services. In fact, outside of the various cost statements included in the record, the Court cannot make any determination about the validity or invalidity of Mr. Steiner's assumptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   On the record before the Court, plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proof on their claim the Secretary's decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   C.
