UBS and the Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   UBS Trust is a trust company organized pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. (Docket No. 37 at p. 2.) UBS Asset Managers, a division of UBS Trust, manages fourteen closed-end funds and co-manages nine additional closed-end funds with Banco Popular (collectively, \"funds\"). (Docket No. 89, Ex. 1 at p. 19.) UBS Asset Managers is also an investment adviser for the funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   UBS PR is a subsidiary of UBS Financial Services Incorporated (\"UBS Parent\"). (Docket No. 89, Ex. 3 at p. 18.) UBS PR is a licensed broker-dealer registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and was an underwriter for the funds, as well as for bonds issued by various Puerto Rico government entities (\"PR bonds\"). (Docket No. 89, Ex. 1 at pp. 19-21, 25.) UBS PR sold shares of the funds to its brokerage customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The 2012 SEC order stated that UBS PR misrepresented the risks associated with the funds to customers \"seeking stable, consistently-priced securities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4. While \"any secondary market sales [that] investors wanted to make depended largely on UBS PR's ability to solicit additional customers or willingness to purchase shares into its inventory,\" UBS PR failed to inform investors that it \"controlled the secondary market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The 2012 SEC order asserted that UBS PR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   knew investor demand [in the funds] was significantly declining relative to supply.

XL responded to UBS with a price quote conditioned on UBS's acceptance of an attached specific litigation exclusion. (Docket No. 89, Ex. 28.) The exclusion was expansive, precluding coverage for\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   any Claim in connection with any proceeding set forth below, or in connection with any Claim based on, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of, or in any way involving any such proceeding or any fact, circumstance or situation underlying or alleged therein:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Union de Empleados de Muelles de Puerto Rico PRSSA Welfare Plan, et al. v.

The policies also set forth definitions to eliminate ambiguity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 89, Ex. 23. As an overview, the policies provide \"claims made coverage\" for \"Insureds [sic] Loss resulting from Claims first made against the Insureds during the Policy Period ... for Wrongful Acts.\" (Docket No. 89, Ex. 23 at p. 20.) A \"Claim\" is \"(1) any written notice received by an Insured that any person or entity intends to hold any Insured responsible for a Wrongful Act; (2) any civil proceeding in a court of law or equity, or arbitration; or (3) any criminal proceeding which is commenced by the return of an indictment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 14.

Moreover, the policies include an interrelated claims provision that stipulates, \"All Claims arising from Interrelated Wrongful Acts shall be deemed to constitute a single Claim and shall be deemed to have been made at the same time at which the earliest such Claim is made.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 17. \"Interrelated Wrongful Acts\" are \"Wrongful Acts which are based on, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of, or in any way involving any of the same or related series of related facts, circumstances, situations, transactions or events.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The\n   <em>\n    W Holding II\n   </em>\n   policy was also narrower than the policies in this case. The policy in\n   <em>\n    W Holding II\n   </em>\n   contained a notice provision that \"require[d] the claims to be linked by 'facts alleged.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court thus evaluated the facts alleged in the prior matter to determine whether there was \"substantial overlap\" with the \"specific factual allegations\" in the subsequent matters, finding that only certain subsequent matters sufficiently overlapped.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Court is unpersuaded by UBS's argument. The factual overlap between the prior and disputed matters in this case differs from the insufficient overlap discussed in\n   <em>\n    W Holding II\n   </em>\n   , and the exclusion in this case is far broader than the notice clause in\n   <em>\n    W Holding II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   UBS's efforts to disaggregate the disputed matters belies its argument that the disputed matters are covered within the policy period. Only the 2013 SEC investigation and approximately 14 of the FINRA arbitrations in the sample set were made during the policy period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rest of the disputed matters, including\n   <em>\n    Casasnovas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fern\u00e1ndez\n   </em>\n   , the 2014 FINRA investigation, and approximately 70 of the 84 FINRA arbitrations provided in the sample set, were initiated after the policy period expired.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The latter disputed matters can only be considered within the policy period if they are interrelated wrongful acts pursuant to the interrelated claims provision. (Docket No. 89, Ex. 23 at p. 17.) The policies' interrelated claims provision provides, \"All Claims arising from Interrelated Wrongful Acts shall be deemed to constitute a single Claim and shall be deemed to have been made at the\n   <em>\n    same time\n   </em>\n   at which the earliest such Claim is\n   made.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). As the insurers note, \"UBS cannot have it both ways: the Interrelated Claims provision cannot both aggregate the Disputed Matters to bring them into the 2013-14 Policy Period and simultaneously disaggregate the same Disputed Matters into thousands of claims to disconnect them from the Prior Matters\" to avoid exclusion. (Docket No. 131 at p. 1.) The same broad construction of the policies necessary to bring the disputed matters within coverage also requires the Court to find that the disputed matters sufficiently overlap with the prior matters as to be barred by the exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Duty to Defend Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Court rejects UBS's arguments based on cases concerning \"duty to defend\" insurance policies because the \"duty to defend\" is not at issue in this case. UBS argues that Puerto Rico law requires \"insurers to establish that the allegations of a complaint, read liberally and with all doubts resolved in the insured's favor, do not create even a 'remote possibility' of coverage.\" Docket No. 123 at p. 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    W Holding I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5887059\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/377/#p385\">\n    748 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   384 ). UBS conflates the applicable standard for insurers' duty to defend, however, with the law governing the duty to indemnify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414023\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/45/564/#p569\">\n    45 F.3d 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 569 (1st Cir. 1995) (remanding the case because the court failed to \"discuss the asserted distinctions between the duty to indemnify and a duty to defend\");\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins.
