French (\"French\"), Priya Gogia (\"Gogia\"), Summer Atkinson (\"Atkinson\"), Jason Debasitis (\"Debasitis\"), and Dennis Meletiche (\"Meletiche\") (collectively, \"defendants\"). Plaintiff seeks to remand this action pursuant to\n  <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n   28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n  </extracted-citation>\n  (c) or, alternatively, to conduct limited jurisdictional discovery. (Docket Entry # 17). Defendants oppose the motion to remand. (Docket Entry # 20). Meletiche filed a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ.

(Docket Entry # 6). After conducting a hearing on September 6, 2017, this court took the motions (Docket Entry ## 4, 6, 17) under advisement.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  <em>\n   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </em>\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  On March 2, 2017, plaintiff filed a complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court Department (Middlesex County) against the Former Employees, Equitas, and Meletiche. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff alleges that defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy to form Equitas, a company that would compete with plaintiff, \"secretly take inVentiv's clients,\" and \"misappropriate [its] trade secrets.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The complaint sets out the following claims: tortious interference with contractual relations against Equitas (Count I); tortious interference with contractual relations against French (Count II); tortious interference with advantageous business relations against all defendants (Count III); trade secret misappropriation under the common law and Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93, section 42 (\"chapter 93\") against Equitas and the Former Employees (Count IV);\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   unfair or deceptive trade practices in violation of Massachusetts General Laws chapter 93A, section 11 (\"chapter 93A\"), against Equitas and the Former Employees (Count V);\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and civil conspiracy against all defendants (Count VI).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 13, 2017, defendants removed this action on the basis of diversity jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1441, and 1446. (Docket Entry # 1). Debasitis\n   and Meletiche, however, defeat diversity jurisdiction because, as Massachusetts residents, they are citizens of Massachusetts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Defendants therefore contend that plaintiff fraudulently joined Debasitis and Meletiche and diversity jurisdiction is therefore proper. (Docket Entry # 1). Plaintiff moves to remand this action on the basis that defendants fail to demonstrate fraudulent joinder. (Docket Entry # 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is incorporated in North Carolina with a principal place of business in Raleigh, North Carolina. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Equitas is a Delaware limited liability company with a principal place of business in Cambridge, Massachusetts. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Defendants assert that Equitas' members are not citizens of Massachusetts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff provides \"strategic management consulting services to biopharmaceutical and medical technology companies.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff's clients are pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology companies, medical device companies, and diagnostics companies in North America, Europe, and Japan. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff's consulting services include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [N]ew product planning for development-stage assets, launch planning for assets in the critical product launch window, strategy development and tactical solutions for in-line products, portfolio strategy, and organizational development.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff also helps clients develop commercialization strategies and market development plans for new products. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Over 85% of plaintiff's business consists of repeat clients. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff's employees bear responsibility for developing and maintaining relationships with its clients. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff invested \"considerable amounts of time, money and effort\" to maintain and develop goodwill with its clients. (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the complaint, throughout the course of its business, plaintiff \"developed, accumulated, maintained, and refined trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information\" at \"great expense.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). Such trade secrets and information include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [B]usiness plans, account plans, business policies, client proposals, client deliverables, financial plans and forecasts, research, pricing information, business forecasts, product information, expert data and reports, business strategies, statements of work, market access strategies, value propositions, client and prospect lists and information, client usage, data sources, industry and company analyses, market information and analysis, methodologies, templates, techniques, and other information relating to inVentiv, its clients, and its contractors ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff protects its trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information on secure, password-protected computer systems. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff terminates its employees' access to such systems \"immediately upon termination of employment\" and requires the employees to return company property and information upon termination. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff also requires employees to sign an employment agreement, which includes covenants regarding\n   confidentiality, noncompete, and/or nonsolicitation. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The confidentiality covenants specifically restrict former employees from disclosing plaintiff's confidential information. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Debasitis' employment agreement contained a forum selection clause that states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   This Agreement shall be subject to and governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such states. All disputes pertaining to this Agreement shall be decided exclusively by a state or federal court located in Wake County, North Carolina, and Employee hereby consents to personal jurisdiction of such courts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Docket Entry # 1-1, Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   French formerly served as a managing director for plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 1-1). In this role, French supervised a number of plaintiff's employees, including other Former Employees. (Docket Entry # 1-1). While employed by plaintiff, each of the Former Employees signed an employment agreement, which included restrictive covenants regarding the \"confidentiality and protection of inVentiv's information,\" customer relationships, and goodwill. (Docket Entry # 1-1, Ex. A). The employment agreements also contained noncompete covenants, which prohibited the Former Employees from \"competing against inVentiv for at least one year\" following termination of employment. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The confidentially restriction prohibited the Former Employees from disclosing confidential information belonging to plaintiff, or \"using such information on behalf of anyone other than inVentiv.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   From 2013 to 2016, French served as the primary point of contact for two of plaintiff's clients (\"the Clients\"), with whom plaintiff had relationships prior to French's involvement. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The Clients generated \"several million dollars\" in revenue for plaintiff between 2013 and 2016. (Docket Entry # 1-1). One of the Clients, \"Client A,\" was plaintiff's second largest client in terms of annual revenue and, from 2014 to 2015, plaintiff's revenue from Client A significantly increased. (Docket Entry # 1-1). While employed by plaintiff, French worked on a specific project for Client A called \"Project One.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Meletiche was employed by Client A during the time that Client A was plaintiff's client. (Docket Entry # 1-1). In or around \"the summer of 2014,\" French informed plaintiff's employee, Keith Kelly (\"Kelly\"), about a discussion or discussions with Meletiche concerning the formation of a new health economics and outcomes research company. (Docket Entry # 18-2). According to Kelly's affidavit, a health economics and outcomes research company provides companies in pharmaceutical and biotech industries with information needed to \"demonstrate the value of their innovations to providers, healthcare decision makers, payers, and ultimately, stakeholders.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket Entry # 18-2). Kelly told French that he was not interested in joining a new company, but would speak with Meletiche about the opportunity as a courtesy. (Docket Entry # 18-2). Kelly subsequently spoke to both Meletiche and French, at which time Meletiche asked Kelly if he would be interested in joining Meletiche to start a health economics and outcomes research company. (Docket Entry\n   # 18-2). Kelly declined Meletiche's offer. (Docket Entry # 18-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   French and Meletiche incorporated Equitas more than a year later on November 3, 2015, at which time French was still employed by plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 1-1). French requested to work part time for plaintiff in November 2015, citing his desire to \"devote more time to completing his doctorate.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff approved French's request, after which French began working part time in or around February 2016. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The complaint alleges that French requested to work part time in order to devote more time to Equitas. (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Equitas' application for registration, filed with the Massachusetts \"Secretary of the Commonwealth Corporations Division,\" lists French and Meletiche as the founding members of Equitas and Equitas' focus as \" 'consulting in the life sciences industry.' \" (Docket Entry # 1-1, Ex. B). The domain name \"equitasls.com\" was created on December 3, 2015. (Docket Entry # 1-1). On December 17, 2017, Equitas applied for an H-1B Visa to allow Equitas to hire a foreign worker to fill a managing director position. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The H-1B Visa application listed Meletiche's home as Equitas' business address. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Equitas' principal place of business was located in Meletiche's home as recently as February 2017. (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In early 2016, French informed plaintiff that business with Client A \"was winding down.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff subsequently experienced a corresponding decline in revenue from Client A. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Beginning in January 2016, several of plaintiff's employees, supervised by French, began submitting resignations. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Gogia resigned as of January 15, 2016, stating that she needed \"to take out some time to both focus on her family and take a break to think about her career direction.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 22, 2016, Client A sent an email to French at his Equitas email, \"adf@equitasls.com,\" at which time French was still employed by plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 1-1). French neither sought nor obtained authorization from plaintiff to work on behalf of Equitas or to perform work for Client A on the side. (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 25, 2016, Equitas posted a classified advertisement seeking a managing director, which directed applicants to send applications to Meletiche's home address. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The advertisement described the managing director's role as, among other responsibilities, \"[s]erv[ing] as a subject-matter expert at global prices\" and market access, including \"European, Asian, &amp; Latin American\" markets. (Docket Entry # 1-1). As set out in the advertisement, Equitas required applicants to have a master's degree in \"health policy, health care [management], public health, health econ[omics], pharmacy/biotech, bus[iness] admin[istration], or a relevant discipline ....\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). The advertisement further required a minimum six years of management consulting experience \"focusing on the pharmaceutical/biotech industry.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Atkinson resigned as of May 27, 2016, citing her desire to \"enter graduate school.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). Around June 2106, French requested an unpaid leave of absence claiming he \"was dealing with family medical issues that were causing him stress.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). French's unpaid leave lasted approximately six weeks. (Docket Entry # 1-1). On June 3, 2016, Equitas amended its application for registration with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth Corporations\n   Division naming Kerry Seagle as Equitas' sole manager. (Docket Entry # 1-1, Ex. B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Debasitis resigned as of July 8, 2016, claiming a personal reason for \"why [he] sought employment elsewhere.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). French resigned as of July 25, 2016 to \"focus on [his] own health and wellbeing.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). In total, between January 15 and July 25, 2016, eight of plaintiff's employees resigned \"citing personal reasons for their departure.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The complaint asserts, upon information and belief, that French orchestrated \"at least some of\" plaintiff's employees' resignations and encouraged the Former Employees to work for Equitas. (Docket Entry # 1-1). None of the Former Employees informed plaintiff that they were resigning to work for Equitas and each of the Former Employees began working for Equitas after resigning. (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 18, 2017, plaintiff received an electronic calendar invitation from Client A. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The calendar invitation was addressed to French's previous inVentiv email address, \"Alan.French@inventivhealth.com.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). The calendar invitation was also addressed to Atkinson at \"ssa@equitasls.com\" and Gogia at \"pmg@equitasls.com.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). On January 19, 2017, a Client A employee addressed an email to French's previous inVentiv email address and Atkinson's Equitas email address. (Docket Entry # 1-1). This second email concerned work on Project One by both Client A and Equitas. (Docket Entry # 1-1). It was this second email, according to the complaint, that provided the first indication to plaintiff that the Former Employees were employed by Equitas and that French, Gogia, and Atkinson were working with Client A on Project One. (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff performed forensic analysis of the computers previously used by certain Former Employees. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff discovered that French accessed plaintiff's confidential information on July 23, 2016, two days prior to his resignation. (Docket Entry # 1-1). When French accessed such confidential information, he immediately inserted a USB device into the computer. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Plaintiff contends that the USB device could be used to transport a copy of confidential information elsewhere. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Based on these findings, the complaint alleges that defendants used, or are currently using, plaintiff's confidential information and goodwill in connection with operating Equitas. (Docket Entry # Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On January 24, 2017, plaintiff delivered demand letters to French, Gogia, and Atkinson. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The letters stated that French, Gogia, and Atkinson were working for Equitas in violation of their employment agreements with plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The letters requested a written response by January 27, 2017. (Docket Entry # 1-1). The response from the Former Employees was to include: \"a description of their work for Equitas\"; \"written assurance that they will honor their obligations to inVentiv and not solicit or service any clients of inVentiv-including Client A\"; \"written assurances that they will not solicit other employees of inVentiv to leave the company\"; \"written assurances that they will cease and desist from further solicitation of, or work for, inVentiv's clients, including the Clients\"; and \"written assurances that they have returned or destroyed all confidential or proprietary information, as well as other information, that belongs to inVentiv.\" (Docket Entry # 1-1). French, Gogia, and Atkinson responded to the demand letters on February 16, 2017, but did not provide the requested information or the written\n   assurances. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Two weeks later, plaintiff filed the complaint in Massachusetts Superior Court (Middlesex County).

Mass. 1997) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants' argument that Meletiche did not contact any of plaintiff's customers is misguided in light of the facts and reasonable inferences in the complaint. Meletiche founded a competing company and operated it out of his home. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Drawing reasonable inferences,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Stryker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203815937\">\n    2017 WL 3815937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, he was intimately familiar with Equitas and its operations. Indeed, Meletiche's home served as the principle business address for Equitas. Meletiche spoke to Kelly, plaintiff's employee, about joining a new company covering the same business as plaintiff, i.e., health economics and research, albeit in the summer of 2014. (Docket Entry # 18-2). French, a co-founder of Equitas along with Meletiche,\n   accessed and likely copied plaintiff's confidential information shortly before French resigned. The Former Employees left plaintiff to work at Equitas. French, plaintiff's managing director prior to his resignation, likely knew about the restrictive covenants in the Former Employee's employment agreements due, in part, to the pretextual reasons the Former Employees gave for their resignations. Meletiche worked for Client A when it was one of plaintiff's major clients. French communicated with Client A through his Equitas email address and Client A worked with Equitas on Project One.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   A reasonable possibility exists that Meletiche improperly solicited one or more of the Former Employees to leave plaintiff in order to work for Equitas in violation of their noncompetition agreements. Meletiche's reasonably inferred intimate familiarity with Equitas and his relationship with French render it more than a reasonable possibility that French informed Meletiche about the noncompete restriction in one or more of the Former Employee's employment agreements. The reasonable possibility of an improper motive on the part of Meletiche is further bolstered by the Kelly affidavit, which demonstrates that Meletiche spoke to at least one of plaintiff's employees about the prospect of leaving plaintiff to join a new company covering the same business as plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 18-2). With respect to the fourth element, the complaint states that plaintiff experienced a decline in its advantageous and economically beneficial relationship with Client A, and other clients, as a result of Meletiche's and the other defendants' actions. (Docket Entry # 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Hence, although defendants are correct that the complaint did not include Meletiche as a \"Former Employee\" or in certain allegations of wrongdoing, the complaint and the record as a whole presents a reasonable possibility of a tortious interference with business relations claim against Meletiche. Based on the facts set out in the factual background, there is a \"reasonable possibility that the state's highest court would find that the complaint states a cause of action\" for tortious interference with business relations against Meletiche.\n   <em>\n    In re: Stryker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203815937\">\n    2017 WL 3815937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Indeed, defendants fail to show no reasonable possibility not only by clear and convincing evidence, but also by a lesser preponderance of the evidence standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Civil Conspiracy by Meletiche\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Meletiche committed civil conspiracy because he was aware of plaintiff's restrictive covenants by virtue of his \"long-standing working relationship with French\" and his role, together with French, in forming Equitas. (Docket Entry # 18). Plaintiff submits that Meletiche used, or at least knew the other defendants were using, plaintiff's confidential information to service plaintiff's clients, namely Client A. (Docket Entry # 18). Furthermore, plaintiff argues that Meletiche provided \"substantial assistance in furthering the scheme\" because \"he founded Equitas, hired the Former Employees, and runs Equitas from his home.\" (Docket Entry # 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants dispute such allegations, claiming that plaintiff was required to, and failed, to show \"substantial assistance, with the knowledge that such assistance is contributing to a common tortious plan.\" (Docket Entry # 20); (citing\n   <em>\n    Kurker v.

Defendants also assert that plaintiff did not allege that Meletiche accessed \"[p]laintiff's purportedly confidential information, used such information, took any steps to attract clients to Equitas or even encouraged any of the other Defendants to\n   do so.\" (Docket Entry # 20). Defendants maintain that, without such allegations, \"[p]laintiff cannot state a claim of civil conspiracy against Mr. Meletiche, individually.\" (Docket Entry # 20). Defendants further argue that Kelly's affidavit undercuts plaintiff's civil conspiracy claim because it depicts conduct in 2014. (Docket Entry # 20). Defendants contend that plaintiff \"fails to explain how any action Mr. Meletiche undertook in 2014 can possibly shed any substantive light on actions he allegedly took two years later.\" (Docket Entry # 20). Defendants note that, while Kelly \"declined Mr. Meletiche's entreaty,\" Kelly's affidavit does not show that Kelly mentioned any restrictive covenants to Meletiche in 2014 \"as a reason for declining the opportunity.\" (Docket Entry # 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To establish a civil conspiracy, plaintiff must \"show an underlying tortious act in which two or more persons acted in concert and in furtherance of a common design or agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Bartle v.

More to the point, the complaint reflects a reasonable possibility that Meletiche engaged in substantial assistance in furtherance of a common design. Meletiche incorporated Equitas together with French on November 3, 2015 and, together with French, spoke to at least one of plaintiff's employees, Kelly, about leaving plaintiff to join a new company in the summer of 2014. (Docket Entry # 18-2). Meletiche worked for Client A while Client A was serviced by French in his capacity as a managing director for plaintiff. (Docket Entry # 1-1). Although defendants argue that Meletiche's actions in 2014 cannot shed light on Meletiche's actions two years later, as previously stated and drawing reasonable inferences from the facts in the complaint, Meletiche was intimately familiar with Equitas and communicated with\n   French, who likely knew about the restrictive covenants. Together, these facts demonstrate a \"reasonable possibility\" that Meletiche acted in concert with French and/or the Former Employees in furtherance of a common design. Furthermore, any ambiguities with respect to the alleged facts in the complaint regarding civil conspiracy, are resolved in favor of plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Stryker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203815937\">\n    2017 WL 3815937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In sum, based on the facts in the complaint, there is a reasonable possibility that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would find that the \"complaint states a cause of action upon which relief may be granted against the non-diverse defendant,\" Meletiche, both as to the interference with business relations claim and the civil conspiracy claim.\n   <em>\n    In re: Stryker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203815937\">\n    2017 WL 3815937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1.
