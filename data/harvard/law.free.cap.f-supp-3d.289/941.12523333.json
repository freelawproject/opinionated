Griesbach, Chief Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs Dean and Margaret Thomas brought this suit advancing claims of negligence and strict liability against defendant Ford Motor Company. The Thomases have named Wisconsin Physicians Service Insurance Corporation (WPS) as an involuntary plaintiff in this action to resolve any subrogation interest it might have in the proceeds. Ford has filed motions to dismiss against both the Thomases and WPS (collectively referred to as Plaintiffs) pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that it is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Wisconsin. Plaintiffs have moved for an extension of time to respond to the motions in order to conduct discovery regarding personal jurisdiction. For the reasons set forth below, Ford's motions will be denied and Plaintiffs' motion will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dean and Margaret Thomas, residents of Green Bay, Wisconsin, owned a 2009 Ford Flex that was primarily designed and developed in Michigan and assembled in Canada. Initially, Hertz-Rent-A-Car located in San Francisco, California purchased the Flex from an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Ford dealership. Although it is unclear how the vehicle ended up in Wisconsin, the Thomases purchased the Ford Flex on June 30, 2010, from Eric von Schledorn Ford Inc. located in Random Lake, Wisconsin. The purchase also included the remainder of the manufacturer's warranty. The Thomases titled, licensed, registered, and insured the Ford Flex in Wisconsin and serviced the vehicle at Dorsch Ford Lincoln in Green Bay, Wisconsin until the warranty expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2015, the Thomases drove their Ford Flex to Pennsylvania to visit their daughter. While driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Allegheny County on October 25, 2015, Margaret hit a deer that had jumped in front of the Flex. As she slowed and moved to the shoulder of the turnpike, the Flex was rear-ended. Plaintiffs allege that upon impact, the back of the right front passenger seat where Dean was sitting malfunctioned. As a result, Dean was rendered a quadriplegic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) challenges whether the court has jurisdiction over a party.

Even though the Thomases' accident did not occur in Wisconsin, Wisconsin has an interest in adjudicating Plaintiffs' claims here because its residents were allegedly injured by a Ford product they purchased in the forum State. Along with the purchase of the 2009 Ford Flex, the Thomases received the remainder of Ford's manufacturer warranty on the vehicle, and serviced the vehicle under that warranty at a Ford dealership in the forum State. The Thomases also titled, licensed, registered, and insured the Ford Flex in Wisconsin since its purchase.

To satisfy the due process element of the personal jurisdiction analysis, the particular product causing the injury need not be placed in the forum State by the defendant.

The fact that Ford did not initially sell the\n   Thomases' Ford Flex in Wisconsin is wholly irrelevant to the personal jurisdiction inquiry. Rather, it is Ford's willingness to serve and sell to Wisconsin consumers, its pervasive marketing on multiple platforms to Wisconsin residents, and its accrual of benefits from Wisconsin consumers buying its products that make it reasonable for Ford to anticipate being haled into a Wisconsin court. Plaintiffs have satisfied the due process requirements of the personal jurisdiction inquiry. Accordingly, Ford is subject to personal jurisdiction in this court for the purposes of this action. Because no further discovery is required on this matter, Plaintiffs' motion for an extension of time to respond in order to conduct discovery regarding personal jurisdiction will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Ford's motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 9 &amp; 17) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .
