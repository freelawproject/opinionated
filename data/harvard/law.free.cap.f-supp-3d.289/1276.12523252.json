No. [154] at 176:24-178:15. Plaintiff contends that he was fired because of his religious speech-which is grounded in conservative Christian principles-in violation of the Constitution, while Defendants contend that he was fired because he did not comply with the City's pre-clearance rules for outside employment and for facilitating a massive public relations campaign against the Mayor and the City. Defendants also contend that Plaintiff's speech made the City potentially vulnerable to employment discrimination claims and substantial disruption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Kelvin J. Cochran was first appointed Fire Chief of the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department (\"AFRD\") in 2008. Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6 5. In 2009, Plaintiff left the AFRD to serve as Administrator of the United States Fire Administration, but he\n   returned ten months later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9. Plaintiff remained the AFRD Fire Chief until January 6, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is also a devout evangelical Christian who holds \"historic Christian beliefs\" and is a member and Deacon at Elizabeth Baptist Church.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18. Plaintiff's Christian views compel him to \"honor God in all aspects of his work by doing everything with excellence throughout his job,\" and \"compel him to treat all fire department staff under his command, and all members of the community he serves, with dignity, justice, equity, and respect, regardless of their personal traits, characteristics, and beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff was generally regarded as an excellent Fire Chief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. In 2008, when Plaintiff became Atlanta's Fire Chief, he set out to assemble a group of firefighters within the AFRD who represented diverse backgrounds, characteristics, and beliefs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Plaintiff knew at least two LGBT employees were members of this group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Plaintiff also had experienced racial discrimination in his early years in fire service, so he worked diligently to ensure that no one in his command would be mistreated because of his or her membership in a particular group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In late 2013, Plaintiff wrote and self-published a book entitled \"Who Told You That You Were Naked?: Overcoming the Stronghold of Condemnation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 44. Plaintiff's book was inspired by a men's Bible study at Plaintiff's church, which included a unit on God's question to Adam, \"Who told you that you were naked?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31-33.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's book was written primarily for Christian men and is intended to help them fulfill God's purpose for their lives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. According to Plaintiff, one of the book's goals is to guide men to live faith-filled, virtuous lives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The book includes passages indicating that sex was created for procreation and marital pleasure in holy matrimony, and that sex outside of the confines of marriage between a man and woman-including fornication, homosexual acts, and all other types of non-marital sex-is contrary to God's will.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. The book also categorizes the following as equally \"unclean\"-or \"whatever is the opposite of purity\": \"sodomy, homosexuality, lesbianism, pederasty, bestiality, and all other forms of sexual perversion.\" Book, Dkt. No. [106-3] at 20. Plaintiff claims this list originated from his study of Galatians 5:19-21, which lists 17 \"works of the flesh.\" Cochran Dep., Dkt. No. [154] at 192:1-6. The City has admitted that \"[t]hese teachings are consistent with the Bible and historic Christian teaching.\" Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The basic premise of the book is the dichotomy between being \"naked\" and \"clothed\" in the Bible. Pl. Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6 33. According to Plaintiff, a \"naked\" man is one who lacks a working relationship with God, and a \"clothed\" man is one who enjoys a working relationship with God because he has accepted Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. To become \"clothed,\" one must be a born-again Christian. Cochran\n   Dep., Dkt. No. [154] 174:9-10. Essentially, per Plaintiff, \"naked means that you're a sinner, and clothed means you're righteous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176:2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff writes that the Bible teaches the following are synonyms for nakedness: \"wicked,\" \"un-Godly,\" \"evildoers,\" \"deceitful,\" \"mischievous,\" and \"loathsome.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 176:24-178:23. Citing Proverbs, Plaintiff writes that when the naked die, there is joy and celebration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177:16-178:15. And there are not gradations of nakedness-every person, if naked, is equally sinful. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6 36. But a clothed person can still transgress; Plaintiff states that he wrote his book to assist clothed men in avoiding \"issues\" with these works of the flesh through their desire to please God. Cochran Dep., Dkt. No. [154] at 194:20-195:1, 199:1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff also wrote a section entitled, \"You Need to Talk to My Husband.\" Book, Dkt. No. [107-9] at 25. It opens with a hypothetical that discusses what would have happened if Eve had, instead of eating the forbidden fruit, first told the serpent that he needed to talk to her husband.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff suggests that had Eve first come and spoken to her husband, the Fall\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   would not have occurred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff believes those\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   words coming from Eve would have empowered and emboldened Adam as the protector of Eve and the Garden. He would have responded with righteous indignation and killed the serpent on the spot-even cut off his head. The scriptural account could have possibly been, \"And the Spirit of the Lord came upon Adam, and he cut off the serpent's head and they lived happily ever after.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff states that \"[u]nfortunately, that's not what happened.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, Eve ate the fruit and gave some to her husband.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that this book is not intended for women, so he was not concerned with including examples of virtuous, biblical women in his book. Instead, women were used as an \"issue\" or \"challenge\" that men \"wrestle with.\" Cochran Dep., Dkt. No. [154] at 189:5-190:2. In the \"About the Author\" section of the book, Plaintiff states that he is \"currently serving as the Fire Chief of the City of Atlanta Fire Rescue Department (GA).\" Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The City maintains three pre-clearance rules which require the AFRD Chief to seek permission from the Board of Ethics and his or her supervisors prior to beginning any outside employment (hereinafter, \"Pre-Clearance Rules\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff never sought or received permission from the Board of Ethics to sell his book, and he never discussed his plan to sell his book with either of his supervisors, Mayor Reed or Chief Operating Officer Michael Geisler.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43; Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6 90. However, on October 31, 2012, Plaintiff called Nina Hickson, the City of Atlanta Ethics Officer, for advice about a \"non-city-related\" book he was authoring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. It is disputed\n   what was said during this conversation, including whether Plaintiff discussed the book's subject matter or if Hickson indicated Plaintiff would need Board of Ethics approval for such a book.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In early 2014, after the book was published, Plaintiff provided book copies to between 9 and 12 of his Christian subordinates at the AFRD, all of whom were either: (1) close personal friends who asked for a copy before it was finished; (2) employees who asked about the book once they learned of its publication; or (3) men who Plaintiff gave an unsolicited copy of the book. Cochran Dep., Dkt. No. [154] at 140:2-141:15, 142:11. These subordinates included all four of his Deputy Chiefs and four of the six Assistant Chiefs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 216:21-217:18. Plaintiff also contends that he provided Mayor Reed with a copy via Mayor Reed's assistant, though Mayor Reed disputes that fact. Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6 46. From the time the book was published until late 2014, the City did not receive any complaints about the book.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In November 2014, Assistant Chief Wessels-one of Plaintiff's subordinates and one of the individuals who had received a copy of the book from Plaintiff during a work event-brought Plaintiff's book to the attention of Stephen Borders, the President of the local firefighter's union.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. Wessels had received the book in June or July 2014, but had only just read it. Wessels told Borders that some passages were disturbing to him-especially because Plaintiff referred to himself as the Fire Chief in the book.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Borders then ordered copies of the book online to review himself and, following that review, took a copy of the book to Councilmember Alex Wan to seek his advice about how the City should handle the book.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Borders expressed concern to Wan about the content of the book and its distribution at work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Councilman Wan then read the book and shared Borders's concerns about the passages that referenced the gay and lesbian community, specifically a risk of discrimination against LGBT members of the AFRD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the same time Borders approached Councilman Wan, another member of the union board contacted retired AFRD Chief Cindy Thompson, who happened to be in Atlanta at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Borders then had lunch with Thompson and showed her the book.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. On November 23, 2014, Thompson sent an email to Mayor Reed's LGBT Advisor, Robin Shahar, stating that she and other LGBT firefighters she knew were extremely insulted and saddened by the book's discriminatory text.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Meanwhile, Councilman Wan decided the book presented a human resources matter. He delivered a copy of the book to City of Atlanta Human Resources Commissioner Yvonne Yancy on November 19, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-68. Wan advised Yancy that a current firefighter had brought the book to his attention, and that he was concerned with both the book's sexual morality passages and Plaintiff's references to himself as AFRD Chief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-69. Wan also told her that he was concerned employees who found the book offensive were going to protest at a fire foundation breakfast later that week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Yancy read the book the next day. She was concerned that Plaintiff had not received City permission to write the book, despite referring to himself as Fire Chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   And she thought the content of the book could implicate Title VII and other local laws, specifically with regard to gender and sexual orientation discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-76. Yancy then took the book to Mayor Reed, who read it. He testified that he did not agree with-and was offended by-many of the comments that were insensitive to women and the LGBT and Jewish communities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-82. Yancy eventually concluded that, based upon the beliefs espoused in the book and Plaintiff's connection of the book to his position, a Title VII investigation would need to occur to determine if Plaintiff's views affected his departmental leadership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. Mayor Reed instructed Yancy to investigate whether Plaintiff had received Board of Ethics approval and to forward her concerns to City Attorney Cathy Hampton. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 24, 2014, a meeting was held in Yancy's Office with Plaintiff, Yancy, Chief of Staff Candace Byrd, and Law Department representative Robert Godfrey present. Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6 87. Plaintiff was suspended for 30 days without pay, told the City would investigate the matter, and advised that he would need to attend sensitivity training.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. It is disputed, however, what Plaintiff was told regarding what he could say publicly regarding his suspension: the City contends it told him not to comment publicly at all, but Plaintiff contends he was only told not to conduct media interviews. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the meeting, the City expressed concerns with the content of Plaintiff's book and that he had not complied with City policy to obtain permission from the Board of Ethics and Mayor about the book prior to writing and publishing it. Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6\u00b6 89-95. Yancy recommended terminating Plaintiff, but Mayor Reed instead elected to impose a 30 day suspension. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In a statement issued November 24, 2014, Mayor Reed stated \"I profoundly disagree with and am deeply disturbed by the sentiments expressed in the paperback regarding the LGBT community,\" and \"the material in Chief Cochran's book is not representative of my personal beliefs, and is inconsistent with the Administration's work to make Atlanta a more welcoming city for all of her citizens-regardless of their sexual orientation, gender, race and religious beliefs.\" Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6\u00b6 98-100. Mayor Reed's Facebook page stated that \"[t]he contents of the book do not reflect the views of Mayor Reed or the Administration.\" Facebook Post, Dkt. No. [107-8] at 2. City Councilmember Wan made a statement to the Atlanta Journal Constitution that \"I respect each individual's right to have their own thoughts, beliefs and opinions, but when you're a city employee, and those thoughts, beliefs and opinions are different from the city's, you have to check them at the door.\" Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6 102. Shahar also invited Anti-Defamation League (\"ADL\") members to give their opinions about the book. Following a meeting with the City, the ADL sent Mayor Reed a letter that the statements in Plaintiff's book blatantly contradicted the City's non-discrimination policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 105-111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During his suspension, Plaintiff interacted with many members of the public regarding his situation. Plaintiff exchanged emails with two members of the public in\n   which he described his situation as a time of \"spiritual warfare\" and stated that he was \"grateful for this divine opportunity to suffer this for Christ and rejoicing every day.\" Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6\u00b6 63-64. Plaintiff also provided his testimony at the Georgia Baptist Convention's (\"GBC\") executive committee meeting, a group of 200 pastors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-67. The GBC later: published a web-based editorial criticizing Plaintiff's suspension; created an online petition linked to a forum through which Plaintiff's book could be purchased; instituted a social media campaign to pressure the Mayor to reinstitute Plaintiff; and, posted Plaintiff's testimony to its website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. It is undisputed that Plaintiff reviewed the proposed editorial prior to publishing, but it is disputed whether Plaintiff \"coordinated\" with the GBC or was merely generally aware of its actions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Another Christian fire chief from Virginia, Ed Elliot, also began a social media campaign that called on the Mayor to reinstitute Plaintiff. While it is disputed whether Plaintiff affirmatively enlisted his assistance, it is undisputed that Plaintiff did not deny his assistance. Cochran Dep., Dkt. No. [154] at 264:3-5, 268:23-269:5. Plaintiff also spoke at two churches that invited him during his suspension. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During Plaintiff's suspension, Mayor Reed received thousands of angry emails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6 68. Mayor Reed also received phone calls to his home in which he was called a racial slur, the Anti-Christ, and a terrorist. Some calls even included death threats.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The City contends it initially intended to bring Cochran back to work after his suspension, assuming the Title VII investigation revealed that Plaintiff had not discriminated against anyone because of the views expressed in his book. Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6\u00b6 112-16. The Title VII investigation by the Law Department concluded that \"[n]o interviewed witness could point to a specific instance in which any member of the organization has been treated unfairly by Chief Cochran on the basis of his religious beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118. But it also concluded that Plaintiff had not obtained the Board of Ethics's approval in violation of Section 2-280(d) of the City's Ethics Code. Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [144] \u00b6 72. And that \"[t]here ... is general agreement the contents of the book have eroded trust and have compromised the ability of the chief to provide leadership in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On January 6, 2015, the day Plaintiff's unpaid suspension ended, the City fired Plaintiff. Defs.' Resp. to Pl.'s Stm't of Facts, Dkt. No. [141] \u00b6 129. Why is hotly disputed. Plaintiff contends he was fired because of the book's content. The City contends he was fired because (1) he did not comply with the Pre-Clearance Rules; and (2) he refused to comply with the directive not to comment publicly on his suspension, instead instituting a firestorm and \"falsely perpetuating the narrative that [Plaintiff] was being punished for his religious beliefs, and encourag[ing] and facilitat[ing] a massive PR campaign against the Mayor personally.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed suit against the City and Mayor Reed. Following the\n   Court's rulings on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff now asserts the following claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the City of Atlanta and Mayor Reed for violation of his constitutional rights: First Amendment free speech and freedom of association retaliation; unlawful prior restraint and unbridled discretion in violation of the First Amendment; violation of the First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion and the no religious tests clause of article VI, cl. 3 of the Constitution; and, violation of the Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process.

Circuit held that the plaintiff did not have a First Amendment right to act as counsel for others while working for the government, while it is plain that this bar would prevent speech. Essentially, then, the Court is left with mere assertions by the City that there is a wrong to be cured. But the Supreme Court has said that is not enough. The City's interest as presented is thus relatively weak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    3. Balancing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court finds that the balance weighs in the potential speaker and audience's favor. In conducting\n   <em>\n    NTEU\n   </em>\n   balancing, \"courts must consider whether the challenged statute or regulation is tailored to address the harm that the government allegedly aims to protect.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanjour\n   </em>\n   , 56 F.3d at 97 ;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]his [tailoring] requirement appears close to the heart of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    NTEU\n   </em>\n   .\"). The Court finds that these Pre-Clearance Rules are not properly tailored in light of Defendants' stated rationale that the policy's aim is to prevent conflicts of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   First, the Pre-Clearance Rules are underinclusive. Pursuant to Section 2-820(d), high-level employees are not required to obtain permission to engage in single speaking engagements or to participate in conferences or professional panels. This exception renders the policy underinclusive, because it is entirely plausible that a one-time speaking engagement could create more of a conflict for the City than full-time employment. For instance, under the plain text of Section 2-820(d), it would be permissible for a high-level employee to speak in return for compensation at a different potential governmental contractor without Board of Ethics approval every week, so long as the income was later reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   And the Rules are also overinclusive. Section 2-280(d) applies to all outside employment even if it is plainly untethered from the employee's job. This policy would prevent an employee from writing and selling a book on golf or badminton on his own time and, without prior approval, would subject him to firing. It is unclear to the Court how such an outside employment would ever affect the City's ability to function, and the City provides no evidence to justify it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   When comparing the potential speaker and audience's interests against the City's failure to proffer any evidence to support its poorly tailored Pre-Clearance Rules, the Court finds that the\n   <em>\n    NTEU\n   </em>\n   balancing weighs in Plaintiff's favor. The potential for stifled speech far outweighs an unsupported assertion of harm. The Court thus\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on its Prior Restraint challenge to the City's Pre-Clearance Rules, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion on the same ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Unbridled Discretion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiff additionally claims that the Pre-Clearance Policies are unconstitutional as content-based restrictions in that they grant unbridled discretion to the City to approve or deny outside employment\n   requests. \"The infirmity flowing from 'unbridled discretion' is that it allows the government official to reject or limit [ ] application[s] based on improper content based considerations.\"\n   <em>\n    Bloedorn v.

As set out in Section 2-802, the City's purpose in enacting those rules is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   It is the purpose of this division to promote the objective of protecting the integrity of the government of the city by prohibiting any official or employee from engaging in any business, employment or transactions, from rendering services or from having contractual, financial, or personal interests, direct or indirect, which are in conflict with or which would create the justifiable impression in the public of conflict with the proper discharge of the official or employee's official duties or the best interest of the city or which would tend to impair independence or objectivity of judgment or action in the performance of official duties. It is also the purpose of this division to require disclosure of the assets and income of elected officials and certain employees so that the public may review actual and potential conflicts of interest. Finally, it is the purpose of this division to provide for an orderly and fair process for raising and addressing ethical questions and for disciplining those officials and employees and other persons who violate these standards of conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Atlanta, Ga.

The above purpose is not specifically referenced as the guidepost that the Board should use in making its decision. This ultimately could result in inconsistent results and does not provide the Board any standards to use in defining what a \"conflict\" would be, assuming the purpose is the relevant standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   But even if the Court were to import the standards from Sections 114-436 and 114-437, many of these provisions do not set\n   out objective standards for the supervisor to employ. For instance, the provisions state that the employment \"shall not interfere with or affect the performance of the employee's duties,\" and \"shall not involve a conflict of interest or a conflict with the employee's duties,\" but it does not set out what constitutes such an interference or conflict. This does not pass constitutional muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Taking the facts most favorable to Defendant, the Court finds that the City's Pre-Clearance Rules invite unbridled discretion.
