For example, an entity that provides \"an electronic communication service to the public\" may not \"knowingly divulge to any person or entity the contents of a communication\" that the entity maintains in \"electronic storage\" on behalf of its customers.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Entities covered by the SCA face serious penalties for violations of the Act, including actual damages of not less than $1,000 per offense, punitive damages in certain cases, up to a year's imprisonment for first offenses not committed for purposes of commercial advantage, and administrative discipline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2701(b)(2), 2707(a)-(d).

While this declaration does not, by operation of law, make Airbnb an ECS provider, that a company concedes being subject to a statutory regime and its attendant penalties is telling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
