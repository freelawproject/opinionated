An employee seeking compensation under Part B of the EEOICPA for chronic beryllium disease (\"CBD\") must first provide proof she qualifies as a \"covered beryllium employee,\" i.e., that she was potentially exposed to beryllium while working at a covered DOE facility. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7384l(1), (7).

(Administrative Record 197, DN 18-2 [hereinafter AR] ). Lahndorff alleges that he was exposed to hazardous substances during his time at the PGDP, which caused various illnesses. (Compl. \u00b6 9, DN 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In October 2010, Lahndorff filed claims for benefits under Parts B and E of the EEOICPA for CBD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AR 345). Upon receipt of this claim, the district office of DOL's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (\"OWCP\") referred the medical records Lahndorff submitted in support of his claims to an on-site contract medical consultant for review. (AR 696). As documented in the case file by a claims examiner, the consultant opined that: (1) the chest x-ray reports did not support a diagnosis of CBD, especially since a 1981 chest x-ray showed calcified granulomas, which are not characteristic of CBD; and (2) treatment notes were needed to show a clinical course consistent with chronic respiratory disorder. (AR 696). In the course of processing Lahndorff's claims, the district office sent him two letters describing the pre- and post-1993 statutory criteria for establishing a diagnosis of CBD and informing him that additional evidence was needed to establish a claim for CBD under Part B. (AR 342-43, 332-33). More particularly, the district office explained that: (1) the x-ray reports Lahndorff submitted, which noted \"parenchymal and hilar calcifications\" and \"calcified granulomas,\" were not consistent with CBD and thus were not sufficient to meet Criterion I of the pre-1993 statutory criteria; (2) the actual x-rays were not submitted and the notations were not signed by a physician; (3) there was insufficient evidence to show that Lahndorff had a clinical course consistent with chronic respiratory disorder as required by Criterion IV of the pre-1993 statutory criteria; and (4) Lahndorff's beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (\"BeLPT\") was normal; thus, the post-1993 statutory criteria were inapplicable. (AR 342-43, 332-33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lahndorff elected not to submit any additional medical evidence in support of his CBD claims, maintaining that the evidence already on file established three of the pre-1993 statutory criteria, namely characteristic chest radiographic (Criterion I), restrictive or obstructive lung physiology testing (Criterion II), and a clinical course consistent with a chronic respiratory disorder (Criterion IV). (AR 288-89). Accordingly, the district office recommended that Lahndorff's Part B and E and claims for CBD be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (AR 192-99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lahndorff objected to the district office's recommended disposition of his claims and requested a hearing. (AR 154-55, 108-43). After the hearing, on July 5, 2012, FAB issued a decision consistent with the district office's recommendation that Lahndorff's Part B claim for CBD, as well as his Part E claims for CBD and other illnesses be denied. (AR 98-104). Lahndorff asked FAB to reconsider its July 2012 decision, (AR 85-93), but, on September 18, 2012, FAB declined to do so because Lahndorff had \"not provided any new evidence or a sufficient argument which justifie[d] reconsideration.\" (AR 78-79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In December 2012, Lahndorff requested that his Part B and E claims be reopened. (AR 53-60). However, on March 14, 2013, the Director of the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illnesses Compensation denied Lahndorff's request because he had submitted no new evidence. (AR 43-48). In April 2014, Lahndorff requested reopening of his Part B and E claims for CBD \"based on exposure to a toxic substance(s) beryllium oxide, beryllium sulfate, and welding fumes listed in the [PGDP] Site Exposure Matrices (SEM) ....\" (AR 24-26). The District Director of the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illnesses Compensation denied this request on November 26, 2014, because \"[t]here was no new medical or employment evidence submitted with the request to reopen....\" (AR 3-5). The District Director explained that Lahndorff's CBD claims were denied for lack of medical evidence necessary to establish a diagnosis of CBD, not because Lahndorff had no exposure to beryllium at the PGDP; in fact, based on his employment at the PGDP, the potential for beryllium exposure was presumed. (AR 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This lawsuit followed on January 26, 2015. Lahndorff challenges DOL's July 5, 2012, decision, which became final on September 18, 2012, denying his claims under Part B for CBD and Part E for CBD and other illnesses. (Compl. \u00b6 1). Lahndorff also challenges DOL's November 26, 2014, denial of his request to reopen his Part B and E claims for CBD.

It is undisputed that the results of the BeLPT submitted by Lahndorff were normal. Therefore, Lahndorff could establish a CBD diagnosis only through Section 7384l(13)(B). Lahndorff argues that the medical evidence shows that Criterion I, II, and IV of the pre-1993 criteria are met and that DOL acted arbitrarily and capriciously in concluding otherwise. The Court disagrees. For example, in determining whether Criterion I was met, the district office summarized the medical evidence Lahndorff had submitted as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [i]n the x-ray dated December 15, 1976, there was a notation that the chest showed a few parenchymal and hilar calcifications without evidence of active lung disease.... Also submitted was a notation regarding an x-ray on February 12, 1981 that indicating the lateral view of the chest showed calcified granulomas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (AR 194). The district office explained that the chest x-ray reports Lahndorff had submitted were not characteristic of CBD because they showed calcified granulomas. (AR 194). This opinion is consistent with Chapter 2-1000.6a, Federal (EEOICPA) Procedural Manual (July 2011), which provides that \"[c]alcification in a granuloma is usually associated with the healing of the granuloma. A calcified granuloma is not characteristic of CBD.\" The medical consultant concluded likewise, noting that the 1981 x-ray showed calcified granulomas and that \"CBD should be non-calcified.\" (AR 696).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Lahndorff's contention that DOL improperly relied on a medical consultant's opinion in rendering its decision is without\n   merit. This Court and the Sixth Circuit have approved the referral of certain matters to independent medical professionals for review and interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bradford v.

Lahndorff requested that those claims be reopened \"based on exposure to the following toxic substances: beryllium oxide, beryllium sulfate, and welding fumes, as identified in the PGDP SEM that links the claimant's covered illness of [CBD].\" (AR 16). However, based on his employment at the PGDP, DOL presumed that Lahndorff was potentially exposed to beryllium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, Lahndorff's exposure to beryllium was not a factor in the denial of his claims and is not new evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Featherston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204746211\">\n    2016 WL 4746211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Instead, Lahndorff's Part B and E claims for CBD were denied because of insufficient medical evidence. Lahndorff submitted no new medical evidence in support his request to reopen those claims. Therefore, the Court concludes that Lahndorff's request was based on a purported material error in DOL's decision. Under\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   , such reopening requests are not reviewable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   First, as to his Part B claim, Lahndorff failed to establish the statutory criteria for a diagnosis of CBD. FAB's decision so concluding was logical and based on record evidence; it was neither arbitrary nor capricious. Second, the Court lacks jurisdiction to review the denial of Lahndorff's Part E claims. Last, the denial of Lahndorff's request to reopen his claims is unreviewable under\n   <em>\n    Berry v.

(AR 192-99). However, it recommended that his Part E claim for skin cancer be accepted. (AR 199).
