This exception stems from the language of section 1446(b)(2)(A), which states that \"all defendants\n   <em>\n    who have been properly joined and served\n   </em>\n   must join in or consent to the removal of the action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karpowicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20528372\">\n    1996 WL 528372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3. Though the Removing Defendants' interpretation of this exception is generally correct, their argument fails for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, courts in the First Circuit have consistently ruled that the consent requirement ought not be waived if all of the defendants were served within thirty days of one another-that is, if the removing defendant had the opportunity to consult with its codefendants before filing notice of removal.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Karpowicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20528372\">\n    1996 WL 528372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7 ;\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Phillips, Barratt, Kaiser Eng'g Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667629\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/586/944/#p946\">\n    586 F.Supp. 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 946 (D. Me. 1984). For example, Judge Wolf in\n   <em>\n    Karpowicz\n   </em>\n   held that the removal of a case was invalid because the defendant \"had more than 10 days to persuade [a codefendant] to agree to removal\" before the codefendant's 30-day time limit under section 1446 expired.\n   <em>\n    Karpowicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20528372\">\n    1996 WL 528372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7. Though these cases involve situations where a\n   <em>\n    later-served\n   </em>\n   defendant failed to obtain the consent of an\n   <em>\n    earlier-served\n   </em>\n   defendant, the logic ought still apply where an earlier-served defendant removes the action so needlessly early that it deprives defendants served only days later of the opportunity to reject the removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, the defendants were all served within thirty days of one another. Given the timing of service on their codefendants, the Removing Defendants had 27 days to procure McGuire's consent before the expiration of their removal window on October 11; 19 days to obtain Krakow's consent; and 8 days to obtain consent from the METCO Board of Directors. Instead, they chose to file the notice of removal three days after receiving the complaint, without consulting any other codefendant. Under these circumstances, excusing unanimity would deviate from the longstanding principle that each defendant has the right to exercise an \"absolute veto over removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Garside\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Osco Drug, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7396314\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/702/19/#p21\">\n    702 F.Supp. 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 21 (D. Mass. 1988) (Tauro, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, even assuming that the appearance of an attorney on behalf of Krakow constitutes a sufficient manifestation of consent within Krakow's thirty-day removal window (which itself is questionable given that \"courts typically require some type of writing that evinces consent,\"\n   <em>\n    Esposito\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505366\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/72/#p75\">\n    590 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   76 ), the Removing Defendants needed the consent of McGuire, which they do not claim to have obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Strict construal of the removal statutes compels the conclusion that the Removing Defendants were required to obtain McGuire's consent because she was served on the same day as the notice of removal was filed. The removal statute does not require the consent of \"all defendants\n   <em>\n    whose proof of service is on file\"\n   </em>\n   ; rather, it requires the consent of \"all defendants who have been properly joined and served.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A). Allowing defendants to use proof of service as a proxy for actual service would be particularly ill-advised in Massachusetts, where \"[f]ailure to make proof of service ... 'does not affect the validity of the service.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sindi\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    El-Moslimany\n   </em>\n   , Civ. A.

This Court agrees with the conclusions of other courts confronting similar situations that a removing defendant must exercise reasonable diligence, beyond a glance at the docket, in attempting to discern the status of service on codefendants and obtain unanimous consent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Aqua-Gulf Transp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Twin Cty.

Mass. 2009), but more importantly, the 2011 amendments to section 1446 all but abrogated this rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   28 U.S.C. 1446(b)(2)(C) (\"If defendants are served at different times, and a later-served defendant files a notice of removal, any earlier-served defendant may consent to the removal even though that earlier-served defendant did not previously initiate or consent to removal.\"). Even if the first-served defendant rule were still in effect, however, it would not excuse the Removing Defendants' noncompliance with the unanimity requirement. This judicially crafted rule provides only that a \"first-served defendant [who] fails to file the notice of removal during his thirty day period ... definitively forfeits his right to remove.\"\n   <em>\n    BCCTC Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767730\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/656/208/#p213\">\n    656 F.Supp.2d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though it relates to the issue of consent, the rule was developed to resolve claims of untimeliness, where later-served defendants filed a notice of removal after the removal period for earlier-served defendants had expired.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767730\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/656/208/#p213\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Gorman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Abbott Labs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3839341\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/629/1196/#p1201\">\n    629 F.Supp. 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1201 (D.R.I. 1986) ;\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667629\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/586/944/#p946\">\n    586 F.Supp. at 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In other words, the Removing Defendants appear to be confusing their obligation to remove on a timely basis with their obligation to obtain unanimous consent. In\n   <em>\n    BCCTC Associates\n   </em>\n   , this Court observed that timely notice by one group of defendants \"does not guarantee removal because the consent of all other defendants is required,\" recognizing that \"[i]t is crucial to distinguish the ability to file the notice and the ability to consent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3667629\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/586/944/#p946\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 214 &amp; n.4. Here, though the first-served Removing Defendants' notice of removal was timely, removal was improper because they made no attempt to obtain the consent of the latter-served defendants, despite having the opportunity to do so within their thirty-day removal window. This conclusion strikes a fair compromise between the interest of the first group to preserve their right to remove and the interest of the second group to participate in \"[this] matter of trial strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    Garside\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7396314\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/702/19/#p21\">\n    702 F.Supp. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this Court on December 12, 2017 granted the Does' motion to remand and remanded this case to the Massachusetts Superior Court sitting in and for the County of Suffolk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 47, No. 48.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The Removing Defendants were also the only defendants to file an opposition to the motion to remand, though attorneys for Krakow and McGuire appeared at oral argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Though the METCO Board of Directors is no longer a party to this action,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    note 1, it was a named defendant at the time of removal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    It also bears mentioning that proof of service was filed on September 18,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    State Ct. R. 3, and thus the Removing Defendants had ample opportunity to obtain McGuire's consent and cure this defect within their thirty-day window or even outside of it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Esposito\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3505366\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/590/72/#p75\">\n     590 F.3d at 77\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (concluding that defendant expressed consent and cured unanimity defect by joining opposition to plaintiff's remand motion). They failed to avail themselves of this option and do not claim to have made an effort to do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
