(\"Sequans\") from April 29, 2016 through July 31, 2017. Plaintiffs Andrew Renner (\"Renner\") and Kevin Shillito (\"Shillito\") have brought claims pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"the Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 against Sequans and Georges Karam (\"Karam\"), Sequans's Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chairman of its Board of Directors; and Deborah Choate (\"Choate\"), Sequans's Chief Financial Officer. (Dkt. No. 1, Renner Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7-10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two separate actions brought by Renner and Shillito were consolidated on September 29, 2017.

(together \"Pomerantz and Rosen\") for appointment as Co-Lead Class Counsel for the class, is granted. The motion of Jerry L. Searing (\"Searing\") to be appointed Lead Plaintiff, and for Glancy Prongay &amp; Murray LLP (\"GPM\") to be appointed Lead Class Counsel for the class is denied. The motion of The Boca Raton Police and Firefighters' Retirement System (\"Retirement System\") to be appointed Lead Plaintiff, and for Berman Tabacco (\"Berman\") to be appointed Lead Class Counsel, is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Renner filed his Complaint on August 9, 2017. One day later, Shillito filed a virtually identical complaint. (2:17-CV-4707, Dkt. No. 1). The Honorable Frederic Block consolidated\n   both actions on September 29, 2017. (Dkt. No. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Renner\n   </em>\n   Complaint alleges that on April 29, 2016, Sequans filed a Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), containing false financial results for the company. (Renner Compl. \u00b6 15). The 20-F was signed by Karam, and contained certifications from both Karam and Choate, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX\") attesting to the accuracy of, among other things, the company's financial reporting, internal controls, and revenue recognition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Another Form 20-F was filed by the company with the SEC on March 31, 2017 for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). That Form 20-F also contained SOX certifications from Karam and Choate attesting to the accuracy of various statements contained therein, including about the company's revenue recognition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). Renner alleges that various statements in the Forms were materially false and misleading because, among other things, they failed to disclose that the company was improperly recognizing revenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Shillito\n   </em>\n   Complaint contains nearly identical allegations. Filed against the same Defendants-Sequans, Karam, and Choate-it also alleges that on April 29, 2016, Sequans filed an annual Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, containing false financial results. (Shillito Compl. \u00b6 22). Form 20-F was signed by Karam, and included necessary SOX certifications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Sequans filed a second 20-F on March 31, 2017, for the operating results of fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24). The second 20-F was again signed by Karam, and included SOX certifications attesting to the accuracy of the statements provided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The\n   <em>\n    Shillito\n   </em>\n   Complaint alleges that Sequans's statements in its 20-F submissions were materially false and misleading because \"the Company was improperly recognizing revenue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Renner\n   </em>\n   Complaint contains two causes of action: (1) alleging a violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, (Renner Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-43); and (2) alleging a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-49). The\n   <em>\n    Shillito\n   </em>\n   Complaint contains the same two causes of action, alleging a violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, (Shillito Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-50); and (2) alleging a violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-56). Both Complaints contain the same class periods of April 29, 2016 to July 31, 2017.

The three Movants are: (1) Johal and McGee, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 9-11, 23-24, 32); (2) Searing, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

After the motions were filed, Searing filed a \"Notice of Non-Opposition\" in which he indicated that he does not oppose the appointment of Johal and McGee as Lead Plaintiffs or to their choice of counsel.

During the class period, they collectively suffered approximately $144,271 in losses, based on a total purchase of 193,695 shares of Sequans, costing $721,574, and while retaining 190,945 shares. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lieberman Decl., Ex. C).

In contrast, Searing suffered $1209 in losses, based upon a purchase of 1000 shares, all of which he retained, costing $4186. (Declaration of Lesley F. Portnoy dated October 10, 2017, Ex. C (\"Portnoy Decl.\") ). And Retirement System suffered losses of $45,948, based on the purchase of 38,900 shares, all of which it retained, costing $161,734. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Jay Eng dated October 10, 2017, Ex. C). On each measure-losses suffered; total shares purchased; net shares purchased; and net funds expended-Johal and McGee's expenditures or losses is greater than the other two Movants. As a result, the Court concludes they have the largest financial interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Retirement System argues that its losses are comparable to those of Johal (whose claimed loss standing alone is $108,303) and greater than McGee's individually ($35,968), and given the PLSRA's alleged preference for institutional investors serving as lead plaintiffs, the financial interest element of the presumption test favors Retirement System, not Johal and McGee. Even disaggregating Johal and McGee's losses, Johal's losses are more than double those of Retirement System. This is a far larger discrepancy than in those cases cited by Retirement System, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 19, Retirement System's Response in Opposition (\"Ret. Sys. Br.\") at 6-8).\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Randall v. Fifth St. Fin.

Feb. 1, 2016) (competing putative lead plaintiffs' losses were as close as $20,000 under one calculation, and depending on methodology, different plaintiffs had largest calculated loss);\n   <em>\n    Juliar v. Sunopta Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 08-CV-1070,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201955237\">\n    2009 WL 1955237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 30, 2009) ($30,000 differential).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The raw differential can be misleading; a difference of $5000 in losses may be significant where two competing movants suffered losses of say, $500 and $5500. It is less significant where there two movants have suffered losses of say, $350,000 and $355,000. The difference in magnitude does to some degree help put the losses in a larger context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the cases cited by\n   Retirement System involve a court ignoring the result compelled by the PLSRA, in the face of losses that are twice that of the next potential lead plaintiff. Even if that were not the case, there are three other\n   <em>\n    Olsten\n   </em>\n   factors in evaluating financial interest, and each of those factors also favor Johal and McGee,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   , and Johal individually as well. For example, Johal spent $602,956 acquiring his Sequans shares, of which he retained 165,900 shares, which is more than four times the shares held by Retirement Systems. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lieberman Decl., Ex. C). Consequently, the Court concludes that Retirement System's losses are not comparable to those of Johal, and axiomatically not to those of Johal and McGee combined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Retirement System also argues that the PLSRA prefers institutional investors as lead plaintiffs, and then cites to cases where courts have chosen institutional investors over individuals when their losses are comparable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ret. Sys. Br. at 6-8). It is true that several courts have found that the PSLRA's legislative history embodies a preference for institutional investors serving as lead plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Gentiva Sec.

Whatever the merits of that position may be-the preference is not embodied in the statutory text in any respect-that preference has been \"determinative\" when an \"institutional investor has a slightly lower loss than another potential lead plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4282313\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/281/108/#p112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But as discussed above, Retirement System does not have a \"slightly lower\" loss than Johal and McGee, and the Court rejects the contention (based on an analysis of all four\n   <em>\n    Olsten\n   </em>\n   factors) that the financial interests are comparable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court therefore concludes that Johal and McGee have the largest financial interest in relief sought by the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Rule 23\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The next step in identifying which plaintiff is entitled to the presumption is to \"ensure that the person (or persons) with the largest financial interest 'otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23.' \"\n   <em>\n    Maliarov v.

Nothing about their interests appears to be antagonistic to the interests of the other class members; this appears to be a fairly common class action based on alleged violations of the Exchange Act where class members are relying on the same statements or omissions as the factual basis of their claims, and where the financial losses are tied to the drop in value that occurred after a specific statement or omission took place.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Gentiva Sec.

They point out that McGee's certification only authorizes one firm (Rosen) to file a complaint; Johal's certification does not reference any law firm; and neither certification references the other investor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ret. Sys. Br. at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The objection is without merit.

Nothing in the PSLRA requires such a relationship for groups or class members jointly appointed. And as Johal and McGee both point out, courts routinely appoint unrelated class members as co-lead plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re eSpeed, Inc. Sec.

Such complexities are absent from the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is certainly possible to identify cases in which unrelated investors were deemed not to be adequate representatives and lead plaintiff designation was provided to another class member. That is the inexorable conclusion of a case-by-case approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the predominant feature of such cases is that the aggregation of class members is done solely to create an artificially large financial interest.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Buettgen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267798\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/263/378/\">\n    263 F.R.D. at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Like the Buettgen Group, the Lyman Group has provided no rationale for this grouping other than to manufacture the greatest financial interest in order to be appointed lead plaintiff.\") (citations and quotations omitted);\n   <em>\n    In re Petrobras Sec.

May 26, 2016) (\"I will not permit the Public Pension Funds to aggregate their losses to achieve the largest financial loss.\"). In the present case, however, Johal standing alone would still have the largest financial interest in the case, one larger than Retirement System. As such, potential lead plaintiffs are not being deprived of the PSLRA presumption by the aggregation of parties. At that point, the adequacy concern should be focused on whether the aggregation is otherwise problematic-if for example, the joinder is of members with competing or diverting interests. And as explained earlier, the traditional inquiry on those issues suggests no such problem with the joinder of Johal and McGee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Consequently, the Court concludes that Johal and McGee have satisfied the Rule 23 typicality and adequacy requirements, and with the largest financial loss, are entitled to a presumption that they are the most adequate plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Rebuttal of the Presumption\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The presumption \"may be rebutted only upon proof\" that Johal and McGee \"will not will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class\" or are \"subject to unique defenses that render [them] incapable of adequately representing the class.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(II). Retirement System's arguments about the improper relationship between Johal and McGee are, as explained above, without merit; in any event, they do not rise to the level, even if true, of suggesting that they could not fairly and adequately protect class members' interests. Nor has there been any suggestion that Johal and McGee are subject to unique defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On January 29, 2018, Retirement System provided the Court with supplemental authority,\n   <em>\n    Abouzied v. Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-CV-2399,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20539362\">\n    2018 WL 539362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Tex. Jan. 22, 2018), it believes supports its position. In\n   <em>\n    Abouzied\n   </em>\n   , the court relied on, among other things, cases in the Fifth Circuit that rejected co-lead plaintiff groups composed of more than five members,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *4, to reject a proposed group of 12 movants. The Court did find that the proposed group had no pre-existing relationship and was a lawyer-led coalition, whose joint declaration was deemed to be insufficient in areas which the Court found problematic.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. That there are courts that reject certain proposed groupings is to be expected. But, ultimately, the question is whether there is reason to believe that the proposed co-lead plaintiffs could not adequately represent the interests of the case such that the Court should override the PSLRA's presumption and preference to appoint the investor(s) with the largest financial loss as lead plaintiff. In this case, where Johal's financial loss alone is still larger than Retirement System's loss, adding one individual investor to serve as co-Lead Plaintiff does not render the group inadequate, simply because there is some theoretical possibility that they could not resolve potential disputes between them, and in the absence of any PSLRA requirement that co-lead plaintiffs have some pre-litigation relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freudenberg v.
