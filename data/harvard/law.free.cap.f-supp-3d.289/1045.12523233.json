Campbell, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This multidistrict litigation proceeding (\"MDL\") involves thousands of personal injury cases related to inferior vena cava (\"IVC\") filters manufactured and marketed by Defendants C. R. Bard, Inc. and Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. (collectively, \"Bard\"). Plaintiff Sherr-Una Booker, who had a Bard filter implanted ten years ago, brought one of the MDL cases. Plaintiff Booker's case has been selected as one of several bellwether cases and is set for trial in March 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs have filed a motion in limine based on Federal Rules of Evidence 402 and 403 to preclude evidence of (1) the premarket clearance of Bard IVC filters by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), and (2) the lack of FDA enforcement action against Bard. Doc. 9529. The motion is fully briefed, and the parties agree that oral argument is not necessary. The Court will deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The IVC is a large vein that returns blood to the heart from the lower body. IVC filters are small metal devices implanted in the IVC to catch blood clots before they reach the heart and lungs. Seven different versions of Bard IVC filters are at issue in this MDL-the Recovery, G2, G2 Express, G2X, Eclipse, Meridian, and Denali.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   IVC filters and other medical devices must be approved or cleared for market by the FDA. The FDA may approve a medical device that is shown to be safe and effective through a process known as \"premarket approval[.]\" 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(a). Such approval is not required, however, for most medical devices. Through a less rigorous process known as section \"510(k)\" review, a manufacturer can obtain \"clearance\" to market a device by showing that it is substantially equivalent to a device already on the market. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c(f)(1)(A). Each Bard IVC filter at issue in this MDL received FDA clearance through 510(k) review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Bard filters are more dangerous than other IVC filters because they have a higher risk of tilting, perforating the IVC, or fracturing and migrating to neighboring organs. Plaintiffs further allege that Bard failed to warn physicians and patients about these higher risks. Doc. 303-1. Bard disputes Plaintiffs' allegations, contending that overall complication rates for Bard filters are comparable to those of other IVC filters and that the medical community is aware of IVC filter risks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Booker was implanted with a G2 filter in June 2007 and suffered injuries from the filter's failure. She asserts various claims against Defendants under Georgia law. Doc. 1, CV-16-00474-PHX-DGC. The following claims remain for trial: design defect, failure to warn, and punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8874 at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 402, and 403.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The relevance and admissibility of evidence at trial is governed in part by Rules 401, 402, and 403. Evidence is relevant under Rule 401 if it has any tendency to make a material fact more or less probable. Fed. R. Evid. 401(a)-(b). Rule 402 provides that relevant evidence is admissible unless otherwise excluded by the rules, a federal statute, or the Constitution; irrelevant evidence is not admissible. Fed. R. Evid. 402. Under Rule 403, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of \"unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" Fed. R. Evid. 403. Trial courts have discretion to limit or exclude evidence under Rules 402 and 403.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The FDA's Clearance of the G2 Filter Under 501(k) Review.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Defendants intend to assert an \"FDA defense\" at trial by implying that the 510(k) clearance process demonstrates filter \"safety and effectiveness\" and the reasonableness of Bard's conduct. Plaintiffs contend that such evidence is not relevant to any issue in the case and should be excluded under Rule 402. Doc. 9529 at 1-2. The Court does not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Georgia courts have adopted a risk-utility analysis for design defect claims like those asserted by Plaintiff Booker. This analysis incorporates negligence principles and the \"concept of 'reasonableness,' i.e., whether the manufacturer acted reasonably in choosing a particular product design[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Banks v. ICI Ams., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239276\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/264/732/\">\n    264 Ga. 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239276\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/264/732/\">\n    450 S.E.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 673 (1994). One of the many factors a jury may consider in its reasonableness determination is the manufacturer's compliance with federal regulations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1239276\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/264/732/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 675 &amp; n.6. Compliance with the regulations may not render a manufacturer's design choice immune from liability, but it can be a \"piece of the evidentiary puzzle.\"\n   <em>\n    Doyle v. Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"70208\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/267/574/\">\n    267 Ga. 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"70208\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/267/574/\">\n    481 S.E.2d 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521 (1997) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duren v.

Given these principles of Georgia law, the Court finds that evidence of Bard's compliance with the 510(k) process, while certainly not dispositive, is nonetheless relevant to the reasonableness of Bard's conduct and whether the company defectively designed the G2 filter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The evidence is also relevant to Plaintiff's punitive damages claim. Under Georgia law, punitive damages may be awarded only where the defendant's actions showed \"willful misconduct, malice, fraud, wantonness, oppression, or that entire want of care which would raise the presumption of conscious indifference to consequences.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ga.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2051-12-5.1\">\n    Ga.

Compliance with federal regulations is not sufficient to preclude an award of punitive damages,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 8874 at 18, but it is probative of whether the manufacturer acted with conscious indifference to the dangers posed by its device.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stone Man, Inc. v.

But this does not render evidence of the 510(k) process irrelevant to the reasonableness of Bard's conduct. The FDA grants 510(k) clearance only where the device \"is as safe and effective as a [predicate device] and does not raise different questions of safety and efficacy than the predicate device.\" Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-629, \u00a7 12(a)(1)(A)(ii). The 510(k) process may not speak directly to the applicable standard of care under Georgia law, but it does have probative value in the determination of this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winebarger v.

Defendants will not, however, be permitted to present evidence or argument that the FDA \"approved\" the G2 filter for market, or that clearance of the device under 510(k) review constitutes a finding by the FDA that the filter is \"safe and effective.\" As relevant FDA regulations explain: \"Any representation that creates an impression of official approval of a device because of complying with the [510(k) ] premarket notification regulations is misleading[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20807.97\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 807.97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Many of the relevant events in this case occurred in the context of FDA 510(k) review, and much of the evidence is best understood in that context. Attempting to remove any references to the FDA from the trial would risk creating a misleading, incomplete, and confusing picture for the jury. Additionally, the Court is not convinced that all FDA-references could be removed, given that much of the evidence-such as the MAUDE database-comes from the FDA. And if the evidence was half-baked, containing some references to the FDA but not explaining what role the FDA played with respect to the Bard filters, the jury would be left to speculate about the FDA's involvement and conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court is also convinced that efficient management of the evidence and adherence to the Court's time limits will avoid any risk of unnecessary or time-consuming mini-trials. Plaintiffs argue that\n   the parties' regulatory experts likely will take a day each for direct and cross-examination, and that the time limitations set by the Court will prove prohibitive.
