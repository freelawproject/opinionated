FAC \u00b6\u00b6 2-6; Pl.'s Mem. at 5-12. For example, the plaintiff suggests that Consultant Nurses directed Field Nurses \"to destroy\" records and \"collaborated\" with Claims Examiners to deny the plaintiff benefits,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 2; Pl.'s Mem. at 4, 15, but he cites as support for this accusation Field Nurse reports that simply do not pertain to any lack of notice or suggestion that his evidence was not actually considered,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 2 (citing FAC Attach., Ex.

To the extent the plaintiff challenges \"no ... oral arguments\" held by OWCP, the record makes clear that the plaintiff's filing for reconsideration of the June 10, 2013 OWCP decision before requesting oral argument operated to preclude oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2010.616\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (stating claimant cannot have hearing on OWCP decision if she \"previously submitted a reconsideration request ... on the same decision\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, the plaintiff's complaint that OWCP \"did not provide,\" and \"did not require DHS to complete\" various forms required by internal guidelines, and in violation of his due process rights,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. 14, is not a \"structural\" and \"systemic\" challenge that would overcome FECA's bar to judicial review,\n   <em>\n    Lepre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453986,3726391\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/275/59/\">\n    275 F.3d at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).
