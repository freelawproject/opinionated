She asserts, on behalf of herself only, that Defendants failed to produce certain documents supporting the calculation of her benefits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Parties and the Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about September 4, 1968, Plaintiff began working as a stewardess for United Airlines, Inc. (\"UAL\"). (Amended Complaint [16] (\"Am. Comp.\") \u00b6 12). During her time at UAL, she also worked as a ticket reservation agent and technical support agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff was continuously employed with UAL until approximately June 30, 1988, when \"certain UAL employees, Plaintiff among them, were transferred to...Covia [Corporation (\"Covia\") ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Plaintiff worked for Covia until approximately December 31, 1992. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). \"On or about January 1, 1993, Plaintiff's employment was transferred to Apollo Travel Services Partners [ (\"Apollo\") ], which upon information and belief was a successor by mergers and name changes to Covia.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). Plaintiff's last day of employment with Apollo was May 6, 1997. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that she was a pension plan participant during the entirety of her employment with UAL, Covia, and Apollo-approximately twenty-eight (28) years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). Plaintiff first participated in the UAL Non-Union Ground Employees' Retirement Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [4.2] ). Plaintiff then participated in the Covia Pension Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [4.3] ). Plaintiff finally participated in the Galileo International Employees Pension Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [4.4] ). Plaintiff states that the Galileo International Employees Pension Plan was later amended and restated as the Galileo &amp; Worldspan U.S. Legacy Pension Plan [4.1] (the \"Plan\"), which Plaintiff asserts is now the \"operative plan\" governing her pension benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16, 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [4.1] at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Plan is an employee pension plan sponsored and administered by Travelport within the meaning of ERISA, 29. U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(2)(A). (Galileo &amp; Worldspan U.S. Legacy Pension Plan Summary Plan Description [4.6] (\"Summary Plan Description\") at 32). It applies to any employee terminating employment \"on or after January 1, 1997,\" which includes Plaintiff. ( [4.1] at 9). The Plan is funded by Travelport contributions, which are determined by the Plan's actuary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plan participants are not themselves permitted to make contributions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Plan is a \"non-integrated defined benefit pension plan,\" and the terms and details for determining benefits are outlined in the Plan. ( [4.1] at 8). The Plan states that \"Normal Retirement Benefits\" are calculated using the following formula: \"1.6% of your monthly Final Average Compensation multiplied by Months of Benefit Service divided by 12.\" ( [4.1] at 29). \"Final Average Compensation\" is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [T]he highest monthly average of a Participant's Compensation attributable to the sixty (60) consecutive Months of Service occurring during the last one-hundred twenty (120) Months of Service of employment with the Employer; provided, however, that if a Participant has fewer than sixty (60) Months of Service with the Employer, such Participant's Final Average Compensation shall be determined by dividing the total Compensation\n   for all Months of Service during his period of employment by the number of such Months of Service. With respect to a Participant who becomes Disabled, Final Average Compensation shall be determined as of his date of Disability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ( [4.1] at 16). The Plan includes in its \"Benefit Service\" definition the following: \"(b) Prior Plan Participant. A Participant who was in [a] Prior Plan\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   shall be credited with months of Benefit Service equal to the number of Months of Service for benefit accrual purposes that were standing to his credit under the Prior Plan as of December 31, 1992.\" ( [4.1] at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Summary Plan Description provides that, when a Plan participant decides to retire and receive payments, he or she may contact the Travelport Retirement Benefits Center (\"TRBC\") to start the plan benefit process. ( [4.6] at 20). The Employee Benefits Committee (the \"Committee\") is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32). The Plan states that the Committee \"shall have the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for Plan benefits and to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan, including the making of factual determinations, and the decision thereon of the Committee shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons to the extent permitted by law.\" ( [4.1] at 62). If a Plan participant disagrees with a determination regarding his or her benefits or other rights under the Plan, the Plan provides that he or she may file a claim following the procedures outlined in the Plan. ( [4.1] at 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Request for Documents Substantiating Her Pension Benefits\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that, in anticipation of her December 1, 2011, \"normal\" retirement date, she contacted Travelport about the process for making a claim for pension benefits under the Plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ( [16] \u00b6 25). Plaintiff alleges that, starting in mid-2011, she spoke with several individuals concerning how to apply for her pension benefits under the Plan. ( [16] \u00b6 26). She asserts that she spoke, or otherwise corresponded with, Russell Ferrante (\"Ferrante\") of Travelport, Don Johnson (\"Johnson\") of TRBC, Jennifer Lansing McGrath (\"McGrath\") of TRBC, and Douglas Neu (\"Neu\"), Travelport's in-house lawyer. ( [16] \u00b6 18, 26). Plaintiff acknowledges she was provided with a number of documents regarding the Plan, but claims she was not provided with any \"documents or backup regarding the underlying figures used to calculate...the Final Average Compensation\" that applied to her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges she requested, orally and in writing, documents supporting the benefits that she would receive. She asserts that she received the following responses to her document requests, on the dates indicated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 February 9, 2012: Ferrante provided to Plaintiff her Early Retirement Letter supplied to Plaintiff on October\n   15, 1999, but without the \"Administrative Worksheet\" that was initially attached in 1999. ( [16] \u00b6 29).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 February 10, 2012: Plaintiff orally requested \"the plan documents containing the formulas referred to in the October [15th] [ ] Letter, historical documents relating to the plan and any changes made to the plans or formulas over the years, documents relating to the corporate history and documents relating to the calculation of the amount of the benefits, and Plaintiff's attendance records during her employment.\" ( [16] \u00b6 31).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 February 17, 2012: Neu provided Plaintiff with the current Legacy Plan, the then-current Summary Plan Description, and a 1994 draft of the Summary Plan Description for the 1993 predecessor Galileo International plan. He also provided in narrative form some additional information. ( [16] \u00b6 34).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 April 12, 2012: Plaintiff's counsel orally requested, without specifics, documents demonstrating that the calculation of monthly pension benefits was correct. ( [16] \u00b6 35).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 April 18, 2012: Neu provided Plaintiff with another copy of the October 15th Letter, \"this time with the Administrative Worksheet and the benefit calculation contained therein (the computational formula in which was [sic] supposed to be drawn from the Legacy Plan, Section 6.02 and related Definitions.\" ( [16] \u00b6 36).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 August 21, 2012: Plaintiff sent Travelport an email stating, \"By five o'clock p.m. on Tuesday, August 28th, you will physically deliver to me, in hard copy (no emails with attachments or the like) ALL of the materials that I have previously requested. Those will include every document, plus sworn statements from witnesses with personal knowledge explaining or supplying facts as to which testimony would be necessary, which you would present in court to prove conclusively the amount of Mrs. Williamson's pension.\" ( [4.13] at 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [16] \u00b6 145).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 August 27, 2012: Neu responded with a computer printout containing \"some additional 'Pensionable Earnings History,\" \"some computer numbers concerning 'Total Benefit Service,' \" and \"a copy of a November 15, 1990, letter to Plaintiff from UAL, allegedly regarding the amount of pension benefits she had accrued while a UAL employee.\" Neu stated: \"Travelport has complied fully with ERISA's requirements for the provision of documentation to a participant, and, in fact, has gone beyond the law's requirements in order to assist Plaintiff.\" ( [4.14] at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [16] \u00b6 42).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 August 27, 2012: TRBC sent Plaintiff a Pension Modeling Statement. ( [16] \u00b6 46).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 October 9, 2012: Plaintiff's counsel sent, by email, a request seeking the computational formula used to arrive at each annual earnings figure for the years 1987 to 1996, with underlying computations for each year, and copies of original documents. ( [4.16];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [16] \u00b6 145).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 October 22, 2012: Neu responded by letter stating: \"We are not going to\n   turn over any additional documents....We are confident we have met and exceeded the requirements of the law to provide [Plaintiff] with documentation to explain the calculation of her pension benefit.\" ( [4.17];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [16] \u00b6 48).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 January 23, 2014: Plaintiff submitted an \"extensive written letter\" directly to TRBC making what appears to be the same request made in her October 9, 2012, letter. ( [4.18]\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [16] \u00b6 50).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 March 3, 2014: TRBC responded to Plaintiff's January 23, 2014, request reiterating that it was not obligated to provide Plaintiff's earnings history. The letter states: \"Travelport has provided you with all the required data elements needed to understand the Plan's calculation of your accrued month benefit calculation and has fully complied with ERISA's requirements for the provision of documents to a participant.\" ( [4.19] at 2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 May 20, 2014: Plaintiff's counsel submitted a written request, with accompanying documentation, to commence receipt of the undisputed amount of Plaintiff's monthly pension payments. ( [4.20] )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 July 9, 2014: Plaintiff's counsel wrote Travelport: \"I now find it necessary to investigate and demand backup for the other calculation contained in the spurious worksheet-my Months and Years of Benefit Service.\" ( [4.22] at 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff claims that, upon providing TRBC with her W-2 Forms \"going back decades,\" TRBC \"tacitly admitted\" in a letter to Plaintiff dated June 2, 2014, that it used an incorrect earnings amounts in computing her Final Average Compensation. ( [16] \u00b6 52-54;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [4.21] ). TRBC updated Plaintiff's earnings accordingly-adjusting the amount from $77,973.57 to $82,111. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52-54;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   [4.21] ). Plaintiff contends that despite TRBC's \"updating\" her earnings, TRBC's \"new\" calculation improperly calculated her \"Months of Benefit Service,\" \"Pre Age 25,\" and \"Months of Service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff alleges she filed, in May 2015, a claim to receive the undisputed amount of her pension benefits with the understanding that her pension payment would be without prejudice to her continuing to dispute the accuracy of the \"Months of Benefit Service,\" \"Pre Age 25,\" and \"Months of Service\" amounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In mid-June 2015, Plaintiff allegedly began receiving her undisputed monthly pension benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96). On August 8, 2015, Plaintiff submitted a Claim Letter for the additional, disputed monthly pension benefits. Plaintiff argued in the Claim Letter that she was entitled to $629.53 per month-approximately $144.18 more than the Plan's $485.35 per month calculation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [4.33] at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On December 7, 2015, Travelport, through its Employee Benefits Committee (the \"Committee\"), denied Plaintiff's claim for additional pension benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99). Travelport determined that: (1) Plaintiff\n   was not entitled to service credit for Plaintiff's first year of service (while she was age 21); (2) Plaintiff was not entitled to an additional 12 months in the Months of Benefit Service calculation; and (3) Plaintiff's pension benefit was required to be offset by an annuity purchased by UAL to cover benefits accrued as of July 1, 1985. ( [4.33] at 5-7). Plaintiff appealed the decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101). On August 2, 2016, the Committee denied the appeal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [4.38] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On February 1, 2017, Plaintiff filed her Complaint, and on May 9, 2017, Plaintiff filed her First Amended Complaint [16] (\"Am.

In this action, Plaintiff seeks, on behalf of herself, and all others similarly situated: (1) a declaratory judgment pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) finding that their pension benefits were wrongfully calculated (Counts I and VI); (2) damages pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) in the amount of those pension benefits allegedly wrongly withheld based on alleged improper calculations (Counts II and VII); (3) a finding that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA (Counts IV and VIII); and (4) attorney's fees plus prejudgment interest pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

Defendants seek dismissal of the Amended Complaint on the grounds that (1) it is an improper shotgun pleading in violation of Rule 8(a) and Rule 10(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ; (2) Plaintiff lacks any plausible document disclosure penalty claim because she timely received all documents to which she was entitled under ERISA; (3) Plaintiff failed to plead a plausible benefits claim under Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, and she may not bring suit under Section 502(a)(3) because her benefits claim under Section 502(a)(1)(B), if successful, provides her with complete relief; and (4) Plaintiff's breach of fiduciary duty claim is barred by the statute of limitations and statute of repose, and, in any event, the duty she alleges is not imposed by statute.

( [19.1] at 11-15). The Amended Complaint and exhibits show that when Plaintiff made her first request for documents,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants, on February 17, 2012, provided Plaintiff with the current Plan, the then-current Summary Plan Description, a 1994 draft of the Summary Plan Description for the 1993 predecessor Galileo International plan, and a narrative with additional information. ( [16] \u00b6 34). Upon a further oral request, Defendants, within six days of the request, provided to Plaintiff, the \"Administrative Worksheet and the benefit calculation contained therein (the computational formula in which was [sic] supposed to be drawn from the Legacy Plan.\" ( [16 \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Over the course of the next two years, Plaintiff made four written requests for historical earnings statements, original documents, and underlying computations for each annual earnings figure for the\n   years 1987 to 1996.

Defendants, to accommodate these demands, provided the requested additional back-up documentation always noting for Plaintiff they had fully complied with the requirements under ERISA to provide certain Plan documents and were providing the additional information to respond Plaintiff's demands. ( [4.14]; [4.17]; [4.19]; [16] \u00b6\u00b6 42, 46, 48). For example, six days after Plaintiff's first written request, Defendants provided a computer printout containing \"some additional 'Pensionable Earnings History,\" \"some computer numbers concerning 'Total Benefit Service,' \" and \"a copy of a November 15, 1990, letter to Plaintiff from UAL, allegedly regarding the amount of pension benefits she had accrued while a UAL employee.\" ( [4.14] at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   [16] \u00b6 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   ERISA requires a pension plan administrator to provide certain specified documents to its plan participants.

Plaintiff does not cite any controlling law in the Eleventh Circuit that the documents she demanded were required to be produced to Plaintiff under \u00a7 1024(b)(4). Here, Plaintiff does not allege that Plaintiff was denied any particular historical plan documents or Summary Plan Descriptions. Plaintiff, instead, only broadly asserts in her Amended Complaint that she was not provided with \"relevant documents, including but not limited to Plan documents.\" ( [16] \u00b6 146). Her Amended Complaint, including documents attached to it, alleges that Plaintiff was given historical plans and Summary Plan Descriptions and various other records not required by ERISA because Defendants sought to assist Plaintiff in understanding the calculations supporting her monthly pension benefits. She acknowledges she was given: (i) the Summary Plan Description for the 1993 predecessor Galileo International Employees Pension Plan, which described the Benefit Service under the UAL Plan, (ii) an Early Retirement Letter with an attached Administrative Worksheet detailing Plaintiff's benefit calculation, (iii) a November 15, 1990 letter, from the Manager of Pension Plans at Covia explaining the transfer of benefit from the UAL Plan, (iv) a listing of Plaintiff's months of pension service under the UAL Plan when she transferred to Covia, and (v) a Pension Benefit Modeling Statement. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , [4.8]; [4.11]; [4.14] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On March 4, 2015, Defendants provided even further documentation, including a copy of the outdated versions of a Covia pension plan. ( [16] at \u00b6 93). That Plaintiff did not receive each and every original, historical record or value supporting her current benefits calculation does not support that she is entitled to statutory penalties here. The record clearly shows Defendants provided the documents required by ERISA and Defendants otherwise accommodated Plaintiff's repeated requests for information to substantiate Plaintiff's monthly pension benefit calculation, even though these documents were not required under ERISA to be provided.

Taking all of Plaintiff's alleged facts as true, in light of the Plan language submitted as part of the Amended Complaint, the Court finds the Plan administrator's decision on Plaintiff's claim is not wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff appears to assert in her Amended Complaint that Defendants improperly denied her credit for, or otherwise miscalculated: (1) Plaintiff's first year of service (the \"pre-age 25\" amount); (2) Plaintiff's months of service in the UAL Plan; and (3) an offset in the amount payable to Plaintiff as an annuity purchased by UAL to cover accrued benefits under the UAL Plan. ( [16] at 20-30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiff is not entitled to credit for her first year of service. Section 3.01 of the Plan states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Each eligible Employee shall become a Participant in the Plan as of the later of January 1, 1997 or the first Entry Date coinciding with or next following the date they have:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (a) attained age 21;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (b) completed one (1) year of Service; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (c) Effective April 30, 2003, new participation in the Plan shall cease, and no person shall become a Participant.

Despite this language, Plaintiff alleges the 2009 Summary Plan Description contains the following provision: \"If you were employed by United Airlines between the ages of 21 and 25, you will be credited with one month of Benefit Service for each month of employment with United Airlines that you completed between ages 21 and 25.\" ( [4.6] at 39). The Committee, in its Denial Letter, stated that the Plan governs the pre-age 25 period determination, not the Summary Plan Description. ( [4.33] at 5). The Committee also pointed out that the Summary Plan Description\n   upon which Plaintiff relied included the same eligibility language\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   stated in the Plan also requiring completion of one year of service before being considered a Plan participant. ( [4.6] at 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has held that, where a conflict arises between a pension plan and the Summary Plan Description, a plaintiff must prove reliance on the Summary Plan Description.\n   <em>\n    Heffner v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045739\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/1330/#p1343\">\n    443 F.3d 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1343 (11th Cir. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Branch v.

Plaintiff has not made a claim that she either relied upon the Summary Plan Description, or that she even read the Summary Plan Description before she filed her claim. The Court defers to the general eligibility language in the Plan, which plainly states that Plaintiff must reach age 21\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   complete one year of service prior to being considered a Plan participant-the same requirement that is in the Summary Plan Description. The Committee's decision was not\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiff next disputes the Committee's decision regarding whether she is entitled to additional \"Months of Service\" credit for her service with United Airlines, Inc. from November 1977 through June 30, 1988. She argues she is entitled to credit for twelve additional months of service-apparently because she was not provided with \"relevant source\" documents substantiating why Defendants reduced her months of service credit. ( [16] \u00b6 107). Plaintiff argues that she should not be required to \"just 'trust' \" computer printouts provided by Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Committee's Denial Letter states that, \"[u]pon [Plaintiff's] transfer to Covia from United Air Lines on July 8, 1988, [she] was credited with one hundred eighty-seven (187) months of participation service or 15.5833 years of participation, as reported by the administrator of the UA[L] [ ] Plan.\" ( [4.33] at 5). The Denial Letter notes further that Plaintiff was provided with a Covia Pension Asset Transfer File reflecting her participation data as reported by the administrator of the UAL Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). The Denial Letter concludes that Plaintiff's demand that Defendants \"preserv[e] underlying 'source documents' for decades,\" such as W-2 Forms, is \"unworkable and burdensome.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Plaintiff's primary contention here focuses on Defendants' refusal to produce certain \"relevant source documents.\" As discussed in Section II.B.1, above, Defendants' refusal to provide \"relevant source documents\" such as W-2 Forms, is not required by ERISA. The Committee states in the Denial Letter that the twelve-month reduction in Plaintiff's months of service while at United Airlines, Inc. was reported by the UAL Plan administrator when\n   Plaintiff transferred to Covia in 1988, and that Plaintiff was notified of this information at that time. ( [4.33] at 5-6). Plaintiff does not claim that she did not receive this information, nor why or how she believes the Committee improperly concluded that she is not entitled to the additional twelve months of service credit. For example, Plaintiff fails to point to a term or condition of the Plan suggesting that the Committee failed to comply with that term or condition in calculating her months of service at United Airlines, Inc. Plaintiff simply disputes the Committee's refusal to provide her with what she calls \"relevant source documents\" so that she can substantiate the reduction. Plaintiff does not advance any substantive argument other than that she believes she is entitled to certain documents that this Court has already held she is not entitled to receive-implying that if she had the documents she could confirm her entitlement. It is the Plan administrator's duty to implement the Plan. It did so here, and the Court finds that the Committee's decision denying Plaintiff's document claim and her contention the calculation may be inaccurate was not\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff claims she is entitled to an additional amount of \"Months of Service\" for her Covia employment. Section 4.01 of the Plan is instructive. It states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Employees who were hired by the Employer from contiguous service with United Air Lines shall be credited with service as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    Participants in Prior Plans of December 31, 1992.\n   </em>\n   If such Employee participated in the Prior Plan and remained an Employee as of January 1, 1993, his service credits under this Plan as of January 1, 1993 shall equal the service standing to his credit for eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual purposes, respectively, under the Prior Plan as of December 31, 1992.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   ( [4.1] \u00a7 4.01). Section 4.01 is modified by Section 6.04 of the Plan, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Any benefits payable under this Plan shall be reduced by any portion of the benefits payable under the UA[L] [ ] Plan to the extent that Months of Service and Final Average Compensation under this Plan are also used to determine such Participant's accrued benefit under the [UAL] [ ] Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   ( [4.1] \u00a7 6.04).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Plaintiff does not once refer to Section 6.04 in her Amended Complaint, and it appears that she asks the Court to consider only Section 4.01 in determining whether she is entitled to the additional credit. Plaintiff conclusorily states that the UAL annuity is irrelevant. ( [16] \u00b6 81). The Committee's Denial Letter states that the Plan provides that \"the UA[L] [ ] Plan is recognized for determining the amount of [Plaintiff's] benefits under the Plan, but overlapping service is offset by the amount of [Plaintiff's] benefits payable under the UA[L] [ ] Plan.\" ( [4.33] at 7). The Denial Letter further states that the Committee determined an \"offset in the amount that is payable to [Plaintiff] under an annuity purchased by United Air Lines to cover accrued benefits as of July 1, 1985.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Considering the entirety of the Plan language, and Plaintiff's failure to allege support for a contrary interpretation, the Court cannot conclude that the Plan language is ambiguous or that the Plan language was unfairly or improperly applied. The Court holds that the Committee's decision was not\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court notes that Plaintiff's allegations challenging the Committee's denial of\n   additional pension benefits are legally and factually deficient. Despite the Plan's plain language, Plaintiff advances only conclusory allegations and immaterial facts, which confuse her arguments. Plaintiff does not dispute the terms or language of the Plan. Plaintiff in fact admits, in her initial communications prior to filing her Claim Letter with the Committee, that TRBC \"cited all of the sections necessary to reach the proper resolution of the question.\" ( [16] \u00b6 86). Plaintiff does not sufficiently allege why she believes the Committee's calculations or interpretations are wrong. Aside from alleging that the Committee's Denial Letter \"totally ignored Plaintiff's alternate demand for additional documents contained in the Claim Letter,\" and that the Committee took additional time to respond to her appeal \"without specifying the grounds,\" Plaintiff does not advance any facts or arguments to support that the Committee's decision was unreasonable, an abuse of discretion, or\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   wrong. Plaintiff's conclusory claim that that \"[t]he foregoing violation was a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   wrong and/or abuse of discretion\" is not enough. ( [16] \u00b6\u00b6 136, 140). Plaintiff focuses only on communications between herself and TRBC employee Jennifer Lansing-McGrath-communications that occurred before she filed her Claim Letter with the Committee for the additional, disputed benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Considering the Amended Complaint and the attached exhibits, the Court does not conclude that the Plan administrator's decisions were\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   wrong. The Committee, as evidenced in its Denial Letter, reviewed a proper set of documents and correspondence to reach its conclusion. ( [4.33] at 3-4). The Committee addressed each of Plaintiff's concerns, referred to those sections of the Plan controlling those concerns, and explained how those sections governed the ultimate calculation of Plaintiff's monthly pension benefit payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Court, taking all of Plaintiff's assertions as true, reviewing the Plan language and the Committee's Denial Letter, end its inquiry here, and finds in favor of the Plan administrator.\n   <em>\n    Melech\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084777\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/663/#p672\">\n    739 F.3d at 672-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
