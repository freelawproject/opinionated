BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Eugene Hudson, Jr. brought this action alleging that he was improperly removed from his position as National Secretary-Treasurer for Defendant American Federation of Government Employees. Although this litigation has featured some twists and turns-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Hudson's reinstatement via preliminary injunction and his subsequent removal after the Order was vacated-AFGE now files a straightforward Motion to Dismiss. The Court will largely grant the Motion, aside from one count alleging retaliatory termination in violation of Plaintiff's statutory free-speech rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court first sets out the conduct for which Hudson was removed and then charts both the Union's procedures and the history of the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At this juncture, the Court, as it must, treats the allegations in the Complaint as true. AFGE is a national labor organization with over 1000 affiliated local unions. Its elected national officers include a National President, National Secretary-Treasurer, and National Vice-President for Women and Fair Practices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Complaint), \u00b6 3. Hudson was elected National Secretary-Treasurer (NST) for consecutive three-year terms in 2012 and 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 6. In August 2016, Plaintiff announced that he would again run for national office at the next Convention, to be held in August 2018. At the time, he did not specify the position he sought, but he clarified in December 2016 that he would run for President.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   One week after the 2016 American presidential election, Plaintiff, using an AFGE computer and email, directed his subordinate to send an email to \"several hundred AFGE officers and members.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11. The recipients included both personal and federal-government email addresses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11. The three-and-a-half-page email did not go through any formal review process before dissemination. It was entitled, \"AFGE, the Trump administration, and the attack on the way,\" and it stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   For many of us, the results of the November 8th election were unexpected. There remains much to analyze about the election[,] ... [b]ut one thing is certain, the new administration and the Republican Congressional majority have a bull's eye planted on the backs of federal workers and the unions that represent them. The question is whether we are ready for this assault....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">\n   Is AFGE prepared for this? [AFGE] President Cox has spoken up on this and has reminded us all of some of the efforts that have been undertaken under the banner of \"Too Big to Fail.\" Such efforts are important to support, though I will suggest that we need to completely rethink the battlefield terrain on which we have been operating....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Trump administration, and their allies in Congress, will claim that they have a \"mandate\" to reconstruct the federal government and workforce. Our response should be \"mandate my...\" There is no mandate. Trump did not even get the majority of the popular vote!\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 1 (November 15 Email) at 1-2. The email then lists four items for consideration: 1) \"Recognize that we must fight; we have no choice\"; 2) \"Rethink the way\n   that we operate as an organization\"; 3) \"We need to build our support within the larger community\"; and 4) \"[T]his is a time for AFGE to join with other unions operating in the federal sector in coordinated responses to the attacks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. According to Hudson, the \"email was not part of [his] campaign for AFGE office\" but rather \"valid commentary on public affairs involving AFGE as an entity and AFGE's members.\" Compl., \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Regardless of its intended purpose, the email rankled several Union officials, including AFGE's General Counsel David Borer. Borer sent a memorandum to Union President David Cox on November 22 regarding potential legal implications of the email.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. 2. The memorandum noted possible liability under the Hatch Act, which restricts the political activity of certain federal employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Borer also suggested that Hudson may have misappropriated Union resources by using its assets \"(the email list, staff time, AFGE email, and AFGE equipment),\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, and also potentially exposed it to liability because AFGE annually certifies to its insurance carrier that its General Counsel's Office reviews all publications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Nearly one month later, National Vice-President Keith Hill filed an internal charge against Hudson, including, among other allegations, an accusation that Plaintiff's dispatch of the November 15 email was \"a supreme case of multiple violations.\" Compl., Exh. 3 at 1. Hill believed that, by assigning an AFGE employee the task of sending the email, Hudson had violated the \"ethical conduct requirements for all NEC members\" and \"exposed AFGE to certain civil and/or administrative liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. \"In addition,\" Hill continued, \"the use of AFGE's e-mail directories for personal use is a violation of the policies on official use of AFGE resources.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He did not, however, cite to any portions of the AFGE Constitution or other Union guidelines that prohibit such activity. The charge also alleged that Hudson had violated the Union's Constitution on three other occasions, not at issue here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Hill did not serve Hudson with a copy of the charge as required by the Constitution, but Borer sent it to him on February 22, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The charge proceedings then followed the relevant AFGE guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. Nos. 4 (AFGE Constitution); 6 (Committee of Investigation Guidelines and Procedures Manual). A three-member Committee of Investigation was appointed and, upon consideration, dismissed all the charges except the one based on the November 15 email. With regard to that, the COI found that \"probable cause exists for the specific charge of malfeasance of office,\" and it cited three sections of the AFGE Constitution that it believed Hudson had violated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. 10 (COI Findings) at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Committee then referred the charge to the National Executive Council, the Union's governing body, which consists of the three national officers as well as the National Vice-Presidents for the twelve AFGE districts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6 3. (Plaintiff did not participate in the NEC's deliberations as he was the accused.) Cox promptly informed Hudson of the Committee's decision and called a special meeting of the NEC for August 8, 2017, to vote on the referred charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exh. 13 (July 19, 2017, Letter from Cox to NEC). The NEC adopted the Committee's report, deliberated, and found Hudson guilty by a vote of 12 to 1 (Cox and Hudson did not vote).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8-1 (August 8 NEC Transcript) at 52-54, 70-72, 82-84. By the same margin, it then voted to remove him from his position as NST but did not restrict his union-membership rights.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94-96. The NEC has not released a written\n   explanation of the decision. Hudson has appealed the ruling to the National Convention, which will take place in August 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 12, 2017, Plaintiff then filed this suit, alleging four ways in which his discharge violated the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). First, he asserted a claim under Section 101(a)(5) of the Act, which safeguards union members against improper disciplinary actions, for a denial of a full and fair hearing. Plaintiff next claimed that AFGE had improperly retaliated against him for exercising free-speech rights guaranteed in Section 101(a)(2). Count III also alleged unlawful retaliation, but was premised on Section 609, which prohibits unions from disciplining members for exercising their LMRDA rights. Hudson's last count invoked Section 301, which allows a union to sue or be sued for certain breaches of contract. Hudson therein alleged that Defendant had violated several provisions of the AFGE Constitution and the COI Manual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Five days after filing the Complaint, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction, asking the Court to order Defendant to reinstate him as NST, process the charges anew, conduct a new hearing without the allegedly biased NEC members, and pay monetary damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 4. After a hearing, the Court granted Hudson's Motion in a written Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson v. Am. Fed. of Gov't Empls.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523554\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/145/\">\n    292 F.Supp.3d 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205449806\">\n    2017 WL 5449806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. Nov. 9, 2017). The Opinion began and ended with Hudson's first count, which alleged that he had been denied a full and fair hearing. Based on the \"historical animosity\" between Hudson and a member of the COI, the Court concluded that \"a reasonable jury would likely find that [the COI member] was biased against Hudson, precluding him from receiving a full and fair hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 155,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205449806\">\n    2017 WL 5449806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. Along with this likely success on the merits, the Court also found that Hudson had satisfied the other three preliminary-injunction factors-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , irreparable harm to him, balance of the equities, and the public interest. Having determined that Plaintiff was entitled to a preliminary injunction based on Count I, the Court reinstated him without addressing the other three causes of action.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205449806\">\n    2017 WL 5449806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. AFGE, as a result, began to reprocess the charges and has called a Special National Executive Council meeting for February 6, 2018, to take action on the new Committee of Investigation Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 (Motion to Stay Briefing), \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   AFGE meanwhile filed this Motion to Dismiss, asserting both that the Court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction and that the Complaint fails to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 21. As to Count I, Defendant argued that the full-and-fair-hearing provisions of LMRDA \u00a7 101(a)(5) do not apply to a union officer's removal from office so long as his\n   <em>\n    membership\n   </em>\n   rights remain intact. AFGE made the same case against Count III. In his Opposition, Plaintiff agreed as to both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 22 (Opposition to Motion to Dismiss) at 17-18. Because the Court had relied entirely on Count I in its Opinion granting the injunction, this concession led it to vacate that injunction and accompanying Opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of Jan. 12, 2018. Given Plaintiff's withdrawal of Counts I and III, the Court here addresses only the remaining two counts below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) provides for the dismissal of an action where a complaint fails \"to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" In evaluating Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the Court must \"treat the complaint's factual\n   allegations as true ... and must grant [P]laintiff 'the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sparrow v.

The only issue, then, is whether some \"reasonable rule\" limited that right. It is here that AFGE's argument falters. While Defendant asserts that \"Plaintiff does not have a protected right to use AFGE's email system and AFGE resources to send a personal or political message,\" MTD at 22, the Court does not see (and in multiple briefs AFGE has not shown) where it has adopted such a rule. The only reasonable inference the Court can draw at this point, therefore, is that one does not exist. In its Reply, Defendant makes a passing reference to its insurance policy, which requires that the General Counsel's Office review certain AFGE publications,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply at 4, but that does not suffice here. First, courts frequently decline to consider arguments raised for the first time in a movant's reply.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Herbert v.

In other words, were the Court to decide that AFGE's\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   hearing improperly disciplined Plaintiff for exercising his free-speech rights, Hudson could obtain a financial recovery.

The Complaint alleges that, in removing Plaintiff from his elected position, AFGE breached two sections of both its Constitution and its Committee of Investigation Manual. In his Opposition, Hudson also argues that Defendant violated the \"implicit premise that internal discipline proceedings be free of bias.\" Opp. at 16. The Court addresses each separately and ultimately finds them all lacking in merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    AFGE Constitution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Article 23 of the AFGE Constitution provides certain procedural rights for accused Union members, including the right to a hearing transcript and a written decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AFGE Constitution, Art. 23, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 8. The Complaint alleges that AFGE violated the Constitution by not delivering either of these to Hudson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 84-98. As to the first, the Court notes that AFGE has since provided him with a transcript of the proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 8, rendering that claim moot. As to his right to a written decision, AFGE argues that Article 23, which governs the processing of internal disciplinary charges for regular members and local officers, is inapplicable to Plaintiff's hearing process. As a\n   <em>\n    national officer\n   </em>\n   , the Union argues, the procedural protections available to Hudson are embodied in Article 13, not Article 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Courts defer to \"an interpretation of a union constitution rendered by officials of a labor organization ... unless the court finds that the interpretation was unreasonable or made in bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Noble v.

Here, the Court finds that AFGE's interpretation is reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, Article 13 states that \"[a]ny officer of the Federation may have a charge filed against him or her for violations of Article 23.\" AFGE Const., Art. 13, \u00a7 7. It then goes on to outline how charges against such officers should be processed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257281\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/306/22/#p26\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257281\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/306/22/#p26\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 7(a)-(d). Article 23, by contrast, plainly states that its \"due process provisions ... shall govern at the council level when a council officer is charged and tried in his or her capacity as a council officer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257281\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/306/22/#p26\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257281\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/306/22/#p26\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Art. 23, \u00a7 1. Implicit in that statement is that any due-process provisions of Article 23 do not attach to charges against national officers like Hudson. Reading these two articles together, AFGE's interpretation-namely that Article 23 details only the\n   <em>\n    offenses\n   </em>\n   for which a national officer can be accused, but the actual hearing\n   <em>\n    process\n   </em>\n   for national officers is fully embodied in Article 13-is reasonable and entitled to deference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, Articles 13 and 23 detail similar, but not identical, charge procedures. For example, charges filed against a national officer \"must be filed in writing with the National President and a copy thereof served by registered mail or personal service upon the officer charged.\" AFGE Const., Art. 13, \u00a7 7(a). Article 23, by contrast, requires a member to file written charges \"with the local of which the accused is a member\" and serve them \"upon the accused by registered or certified mail at his or her last known address[,] and the local of which the accused is a member also shall be served at its office or address of its highest ranking officer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257281\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/306/22/#p26\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9257281\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/306/22/#p26\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Art. 23, \u00a7 3. If Article 23 applied\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   to charges against national officers, it would make little sense for each article to have its own slightly different service provision. The Court thus finds that AFGE's interpretation should be credited, and, as Plaintiff does not suggest this interpretation is made in bad faith, the only procedural protections he can rely on are those contained in Article 13. Because the right to a written decision does not appear there, the Constitution does not support his breach-of-contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Committee of Investigation Manual\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Count IV's second set of claims alleges violations of the Committee of Investigation Guidelines and Procedures Manual, a document prepared by AFGE's GCO and provided to members who have been appointed to a Committee of Investigation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    COI Manual at 1.
