Circuit\"), with instructions to consider whether Plaintiff's lawsuit can go forward under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\"LMRA\"). The gravamen of Plaintiff's Complaint in this case is that he was treated unfairly when his employment as a security guard with the Defendant, AlliedBarton Security Services, LLC (\"AlliedBarton\"), was terminated. He also complains about various other issues both pre- and post-dating his termination. Plaintiff initially brought his case as one for breach of contract under District of Columbia law, which the Court dismissed because it was preempted by the Section 301 of the LMRA. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the Court's decision in-part, in that it agreed that Plaintiff's state law claims were preempted. However, the D.C. Circuit remanded the case for this Court to decide whether Plaintiff's pleadings could be viewed as stating a claim under Section 301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Now before the Court is Defendant's [37] Second Motion to Dismiss. Defendant argues that Plaintiff fails to state a claim under Section 301 because any such claim would be untimely. The Court agrees. Plaintiff's allegations, although somewhat difficult to understand, are best characterized as asserting what is known as a \"hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim.\" A six\n   month statute of limitations applies to such a claim, and Plaintiff's Complaint was filed far outside of this statutory period. Accordingly, upon consideration of the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record for purposes of this motion, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion and once again DISMISSES this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual Allegations in Plaintiff's Pre-Remand Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court begins by recounting the allegations in Plaintiff's pleadings as they existed before the remand in this case. For the purposes of the currently-pending motion, the Court accepts as true the well-pleaded allegations in Plaintiff's Complaint. The Court does \"not accept as true, however, the plaintiff's legal conclusions or inferences that are unsupported by the facts alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Ralls Corp. v.

If a plaintiff's claims\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   assert that his or her employer breached the CBA, and do not also contain a claim about union misconduct, the state law statute of limitations for breach of contracts is presumptively applicable.\n   <em>\n    Cephas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864379,3702756\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/480/\">\n    520 F.3d at 489-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court can see no exception or carve-out from this procedure that would apply to Plaintiff's grievance. In fact, Plaintiff himself sought to vindicate the rights at issue in this lawsuit initially by using the grievance procedure, and the SEIU only declined to arbitrate because it did not see merit in Plaintiff's grievance (not because the grievance procedure was inapplicable for any reason).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl's Supplemental Brief, ECF No. 22.

Accordingly, unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Cephas\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff in this case could be alleging that his union did not fairly or adequately represent him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lever v.

The presence of a grievance procedure and an arbitration clause here implicates a duty of fair representation by the Union.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the entire record in this case, the Court determines that such allegations are in fact part of Plaintiff's lawsuit. As discussed above, Plaintiff has filed a pleading in which he indicates that he took steps to initiate the CBA's grievance procedure with his union, the SEIU, but that the SEIU declined to take his claim to arbitration against AlliedBarton because they determined that it lacked merit. Plaintiff unsuccessfully appealed that decision, and then filed an unsuccessful charge against the SEIU with the NLRB.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cephas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864379,3702756\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/480/\">\n    520 F.3d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing cases that \"involved a claim as to which the union filed but later abandoned a grievance\" where plaintiff \"challenged the result of the grievance procedure,\" and noting that these cases \"likely presented or should have presented a hybrid claim for breaches of both the CBA and the DFR.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition to this procedural history, Plaintiff has made affirmative allegations in this case that he is not satisfied with the SEIU's representation. He states that \"[t]he purpose of a union is to inform its members on what's going on, represent them in grievances and in courts and to settle disputes.\" Pl.'s Suppl. Br., ECF No. 22, at 2. However, Plaintiff alleges, \"I have never received any information regarding what had been done for its members and I can only recall one meeting between 2012\n   and 2013 and it was cancelled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864379,3702756\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/480/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court infers from these allegations that part of Plaintiff's Complaint in this case is that his union did not adequately represent him.

In fact, in his latest pleading, instead of rebutting this interpretation of his Complaint, Plaintiff reinforced the Court's conclusion that his claim is a hybrid one by including an underlined paragraph describing the different theories under which \"[s]uits against union[s] could be brought.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Plaintiff has not named the SEIU as a Defendant in this case, but that does not mean that his claim is not a hybrid one. As the D.C.

Considering the record as a whole, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's case is best described as a \"hybrid \u00a7 301/fair representation claim.\" Accordingly, the statute of limitations in this case is borrowed from Section 10(b) of the NLRA, and is six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Applying this limitations period, the Court concludes that Plaintiff's Complaint is untimely and must be dismissed.

Brief at 8. Plaintiff did not file his Complaint until June 2, 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1-2, far more than 6 months later than these dates. Accordingly that Complaint cannot state a timely Section 301 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Before concluding, the Court briefly addresses several miscellaneous issues. First, to the extent Plaintiff claims that the D.C. public school system violated any laws or committed any torts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s \"The Order of the Court\" at 1 (\"The tortious interference between AlliedBarton and the plaintiff by DC public school was breach of the contract\"), those assertions are misplaced because the D.C. public school system is not a party to this lawsuit. Second, Plaintiff states in one of his pleadings that \"[t]his is an example of Tort law-Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874457\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/961/178/#p184\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To the extent Plaintiff intended to assert a negligent infliction of emotional distress claim in this case, that effort fails. The tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress applies to particular circumstances-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , where a plaintiff is put in danger of physical injury or where there exists a special relationship between the plaintiff and defendant that implicates plaintiff's emotional well-being-that are simply not present in Plaintiff's pleadings, no matter how liberally\n   construed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lesesne v.

Finally, in his latest pleading Plaintiff has made reference to the D.C. False Claims Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Nov. 20, 2017 Letter at 5. Plaintiff has not complied with any of the requirements to bring a civil action as a\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   plaintiff under this Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%202-381.03\">\n    D.C.
