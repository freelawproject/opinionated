For the foregoing reasons, the motion for summary judgment is GRANTED as to Counts I through IV, and the Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Counts V through VII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Sikorsky is a company that designs, manufactures, and services helicopters for commercial, industrial, and military uses. [Dkt. 66-24 (Def. L. R. 56(a)(1) Statement) Dkt. 791 (Pl. L. R. 56(a)(2) Statement) \u00b6 1]. The company has policies that prohibit discrimination and harassment on the basis of color, national origin, and religion. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 3; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 3]. These policies provide a procedure for individuals who believe they are subject to discrimination or harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 3; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 3]. Specifically, the harassment policy states, \"If you have witnessed or been the victim of harassment, you should immediately notify the Company through one or more of the following: (1) your supervisor (unless he/she is the alleged harasser or (2) your EEO representative, Diversity manager or Human Resources representative.\" [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 100; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 100]. The policy also prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports harassment or cooperates in a harassment investigation, and it specifies that an investigation confirming harassment will lead to disciplinary action that may include the employee's termination. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 101; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 101].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Ameti began working for Sikorsky in 2008 as an engineer in the Blades Product Center. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 4; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 4]. He is from Macedonia and Albania and has a darker complexion, which he believes suggests he is from the Middle East. [Dkt. 80 (Opp'n Ex. S, Ameti Dep.) at 70:8-17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Each year Mr. Ameti received a Performance Feedback Tool (\"PFT\"), which was a retrospective assessment of his performance during the previous year. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 11; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 11]. The PFT summary ratings were the following: Unsatisfactory Performance / Improvement Required (\"U\"); Progressing (\"P\"); Fully Competent Performance (\"FC\"); and Exceptional Performance (\"EP\"). [Dkt. 79-3 (Opp'n Ex. F-S, Ex. H; Ameti PFTs) at SIK000693]. He received an overall summary rating of FC every year from 2008 through 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Ameti did not receive the 2013 PFT before he was laid off, but there is an unsigned draft that indicates he received an overall rating of FC for the sixth time. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6\u00b6 16-17].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Caputo's Supervision (2008 Through First Quarter of 2011)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   From November 2008 through the first quarter of 2011, Mr. Ameti was supervised by Frank Caputo. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Ameti testified that in either 2010 or 2011, Mr. Caputo came to his desk and told him \"that he saw some kind of information somewhere about an Albanian tradition where some of the female family members of the family where there was no male party in the family, they were allowed to live their life as a male so they can take care of the family, and that was very strange and primitive thing for nation to do that.\" [Dkt. 80 at 35:15-22].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Ameti attests that he received a \"below average\" raise for the year 2011. [Dkt. 79-3 \u00b6 12]. He does not indicate the value of his raise, against whom he compared his raise, the value of an average raise, and what a raise was based on. His affidavit reads as follows: \"At this time, Plaintiff noticed that Caputo was treating him disparately.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Jones's Supervision (First Quarter of 2011 Through Layoff)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This supervision ended when Mr. Caputo became the Chief Engineer for the Blades Product Center, and at that point Mr. Ameti was transferred to a group led by Corey Jones. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 7; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 7]. Mr. Ameti then began working with another Manufacturing Engineer named Michael Tabone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 153; Dkt. 80 at 87:13-88:10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Tabone's comments constitute the bulk of alleged discriminatory comments. Mr. Ameti testified that Mr. Tabone said, \"This is Pellumb Ameti, and he is Muslim,\" at least five times to other people, including to David Caywood, Kneil Northrop, Mike Liggen, and two others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 80 at 38:2-10; Dkt. 82 (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. S Cont'd, Ameti Dep.) at 262:22-265:15]. He also asked Mr. Jones, \"Do you know that Pellumb is Muslim?\" on another occasion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 80 at 38:11-15]. Mr. Tabone asked Mr. Ameti how many wives he had approximately five times. [Dkt. 82 at 274:14-17]. Mr. Ameti estimates that between two to five times Mr. Tabone told their coworker, Ms. Joanne Pavia, \"Pellumb has three wives and for a Muslim that is normal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n    at 275:24-276:4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. Mr. Ameti also testified that Mr. Tabone referred to Muslims as terrorists between three to five times, and he believes Ms. Pavia heard on one occasion. [Dkt. 82 at 278:21-279:7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 80 at 38:11-16]. Subsequently in mid-2013, Ms. Pavia asked Mr. Ameti if he owned a gun. [Dkt. 82 at 276:5-12]. Mr. Ameti never filed a formal complaint about Mr. Tabone's comments. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 20; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 20]. Although Mr. Ameti approximated the number of times Mr. Tabone said these remarks, he did not provide approximate dates when they occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is undisputed that Mr. Tabone was not a decision-maker with respect to Mr. Ameti's layoff. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 94; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 94]. However, Mr. Ameti describes Mr. Tabone and Mr. Caputo as being very close friends, [Dkt. 80 at 38:3-9], and it is Mr. Ameti's opinion that Mr. Tabone \"spoke directly to Caputo about [his] Muslim religion and background,\" [Dkt. 79-3 (Opp'n Ex. F-S, Ex. F; Ameti Aff.) \u00b6 10]. He does not profess to have heard this alleged conversation, however. Mr. Caputo submitted a declaration in which he stated he was not aware of Mr. Tabone's comments about Mr. Ameti's religion while Mr. Ameti worked for Sikorsky. [Dkt. 66-3 (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1, Caputo Decl.) \u00b6 7].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Ameti also describes comments in which coworker, Kevin Leahy, told Mr. Ameti, \"I see you came from another country; see how we gave you a job; we pay you.\" [Dkt. 80 at 72:15-21, 89:2-90:15]. It is unclear based on the testimony the number of times and when Mr. Leahy made these statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There are some circumstances in which Mr. Ameti claims he did not receive credit for his work. Mr. Ameti claims that another coworker, Carol Perkins, got credit for four to five designs that he created [Dkt. 82-4 at 425:13-21]. He did not complain to anyone about this issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n    at 426:25-27:1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He also complains that his name was left off a patent, but after raising this issue with Mr. Caputo he \"accepted the error\" and his name was added to the patent. [Dkt. 80 at 39:1-40:12]. He believes this example evidences Mr. Caputo's dislike for him because he is Muslim, that leaving him off the patent is part of a \"whole pattern, starting from the comments and different other comments,\" and that the pattern shows he \"was not treated as the rest of the engineers within the group.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Ameti did not provide a date for either issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Reduction in Force (February 2014)\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In February 2014, Sikorsky experienced a decrease in customer demand, which required a company-wide reduction in force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 63; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 63]. This reduction in force aimed to address economic issues, an EBIT gap, and structural issues; it sought to retain the best talent while realigning the business. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 64; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 64]. In order to evaluate who would be laid off, managers were asked to rate and rank salaried employees according to an Employee Assessment Matrix (\"Assessment Matrix\") for which they received a training. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 66; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 66; Dkt. 66-14 (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 12, Sealed)]. According to the Assessor Training and Employee Assessment Guidelines (\"Assessment Guidelines\"), an assessment was to be prospective so as to determine \"the ability of the employee to perform under current and projected business conditions.\" [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6\u00b6 67-68; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6\u00b6 67-68]. These assessments were to be measured on five factors: (1) Achieve Results (1-10); Criticality of Skills (1-10); Qualifications (1-5); Business Orientation (1-5); and Interpersonal Skills (1-5). [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 70; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 70]. Each employee was to be assessed in comparison with other employees who held the same position and labor grade. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 72; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 72]. The Assessment Guidelines also indicated the process was not intended to rely on past performance evaluations such as the PFTs, which were \"retrospective looking and used primarily as development tools and as one of the criteria used to distribute merit increases and other forms of compensation.\" [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 74; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 74].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Caputo used the Assessment Guidelines factors to assess 55 employees in the Blades Product Center, including Mr. Ameti. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 77; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 77]. He testified that he was knowledgeable about the group and relied on assessments he previously received. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6\u00b6 79-80; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6\u00b6 79-80]. In addition, he spoke with Mr. Jones about Mr. Ameti and the other people in Mr. Jones's group. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 81; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 81]. Mr. Jones recalls that he told Mr. Caputo, \"[P]art of the issues with Pellumb was that as an ME you need to spend time on the shop floor, you need to own the process. You need to get involved, and Pellumb as a designer, in my opinion, at this time was that, you know, he wanted to do more Catia work. He was more of a desk person, which is not conducive to ME work.\" [Dkt. 66-6 (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 4, Jones Dep.) at 90:3-11]. Mr. Caputo testified that he felt Mr. Ameti's design engineering skills were lacking, [Dkt. 66-5 (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 3, Caputo Dep.) at 93:8-23], and that Mr. Ameti made mistakes and relied on coworkers to correct them,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2031\">\n    at 136:16-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Out of all 55 employees assessed by Mr. Caputo, Mr. Ameti and another engineer named Marco Salazar received the lowest scores. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 88; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 88].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Michael Ambrose, Vice President of Aircraft Design &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, and Alan Walling, Blades Product Center General Manager, thereafter evaluated the assessments. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 78; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 78]. The exact time frame during which the assessment and reviews were made is murky. On an unspecified date, Mr. Ambrose reviewed Mr. Ameti's assessment and thereafter changed some of the scores. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 91; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 91]. Mr. Caputo believes that Mr. Ambrose would have changed the scores based on input from Mr. Caputo, although he does not remember \"the conversations for the exact number and there results.\" [Dkt. 79-2 at 194:8-15]. Mr. Ameti ultimately received a total credit of 19 points: 6 for Achieve Results, 4 for Criticality of Skills, 3 for Qualifications, 3 for Business Orientation, and 3 for Interpersonal Skills. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 83; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 83].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr.\n   Ambrose scheduled a telecom for February 7, 2014 to review the \"EAP rankings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 89 (Opp'n Sealed Exhibits) at 38]. Mr. Ambrose elected to lay off Mr. Ameti and emailed human resources about his decision on February 11, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 92; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 92; Dkt. 89 at 36]. Mr. Ambrose did not know Mr. Ameti's religion, color, or national origin while Mr. Ameti worked for Sikorsky. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 93; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 93].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ultimately, Mr. Ameti and 17 other engineers from the Blades Product Centers were laid off. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 89; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 89]. Mr. Ambrose submitted a declaration indicating Sikorsky eliminated a total of 250 positions. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 90; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 90; Dkt. 66-18 (Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 16, Ambrose Decl.) \u00b6 7]. He also averred that Sikorsky did not hire a replacement for Mr. Ameti and his remaining colleagues assumed his responsibilities. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6\u00b6 95-96; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6\u00b6 95-96; Dkt. 66-3 \u00b6 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Ameti filed a charge of discrimination with the CHRO on May 27, 2014. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 98; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 98]. Mr. Ameti testified that \"the only difference\" between the other engineers and him was his skin color.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 80 at 70:18-20]. Prior to this, he did not file a complaint while he was at Sikorsky. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 102; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 102]. His reasoning is that he previously filed a complaint with human resources in 2002 or 2003 regarding his boss's treatment, and he was subsequently laid off.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 80 at 80:1-82:12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Summary judgment should be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

In fact, Mr. Ambrose stated in his declaration that he was not aware of Mr. Ameti's \"color, national origin, or religion\" during the time Mr. Ameti worked for Sikorsky. [Dkt. 66-18 \u00b6 8].

First, the statement about Mr. Ameti's ethnicity was made by Mr. Tabone to Mr. Caputo in Mr. Ameti's absence and therefore the statement would not constitute harassment requiring a report unless Mr. Caputo is also Muslim. Second, it is unpersuasive because it is speculative. Mr. Ameti was not present when the alleged conversation between Mr. Tabone and Mr. Caputo occurred.

Mr. Leahy's comment-\"that you see how well we treat you, we give you job, we give you money, when some American can have this job, we give it to you\"-is too remote from the decision-maker to mean anything other than an isolated, albeit off-color, comment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 82-4 (Opp'n Ex.

The Court also finds Mr. Conti's comment that he wanted to file a turnback against Mr. Ameti, [Dkt. 80 at 101:6-13], to be facially unrelated to any protected class; Mr. Ameti's speculation that the comment must be based on his skin color because \"[t]hat was the only difference than the rest of the engineers in that group\" is unpersuasive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70:18-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The most serious comments are said to have been made at unspecified times over a period of years. They are attributed to Mr. Tabone, an individual who held the same position as Mr. Ameti and who was also supervised by Mr. Caputo. Mr. Ameti describes Mr. Caputo and Mr. Tabone as \"very close friends.\" [Dkt. 80 at 38:3-9]. Mr. Ameti testified that Mr. Tabone told others that Mr. Ameti was a Muslim, possibly a terrorist, and that he had multiple wives.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 71:8-24, 87:17-88:6; [Dkt. 82 at 271:17-24]. For example, Mr. Ameti testified that Mr. Tabone told Ms. Pavia that Mr. Ameti was Muslim and might be a terrorist; subsequently, Ms. Pavia asked him whether it was true that he owned a gun. [Dkt. 82 at 272:10-73:7]. Mr. Ameti estimated that Mr. Tabone (1) asked him\n   how many wives he had approximately five times,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   274:14-75:17; (2) referred to Muslims as terrorists between three to five times,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 276:21-279:7, and (3) told other colleagues Mr. Ameti was Muslim at least five times, [Dkt. 80 at 38:2-10; Dkt. 82 at 262:22-265:15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court finds that these comments are nonetheless stray remarks because they were not made by a decision-maker and bear no connection to the layoff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049514\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/134/#p149\">\n    616 F.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, Mr. Ameti has not provided any concrete evidence that Mr. Tabone made these comments to Mr. Caputo at all, let alone at a time close to the layoff. The best Mr. Ameti can do is speculate that Mr. Tabone made these comments to Mr. Caputo simply because they were friends, as he does not allege he personally heard an exchange between the two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 79 at 31; Dkt. 80 at 88:13-15 (indicating Mr. Tabone talked \"to [his] boss about [his] religion and where [he] c[a]me from\"); Dkt. 79-3 (Ex.

Mr. Ameti has not provided the Court with statistics or other information about the race, national origin, and religion of other similarly situated engineers who were not laid off. Mr. Ameti received the lowest score out of the engineers in his category rated by Mr. Caputo. There are myriad reasons other than discrimination why Messrs. Ambrose and Walling selected Plaintiff to be laid off. Engineers were assessed based on their results achieved, criticality of skills, qualifications, business orientation, and interpersonal skills in order to achieve the company's objectives, which included retaining the best talent and align with the current and projected business conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6\u00b6 64-68, 70; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6\u00b6 64-68, 70]. The assessment process included several tiers, with higher levels of management reviewing assessments\n   by lower-level managers. [Dkt. 66-24 \u00b6 69; Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 69]. They also would have received input from other managers in addition to Mr. Caputo, and it therefore cannot be said that Mr. Caputo's advice alone caused Mr. Ambrose to select Ms. Ameti for a layoff. Plaintiff claims he was not assessed fairly. [Dkt. 79-1 \u00b6 70].

Therefore, Defendant's knowledge of the harassment cannot be imputed through Mr. Caputo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Mr. Jones is alleged to have heard Mr. Tabone say, \"Do you know that Pellumb is Muslim?\" on one occasion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 80 at 38:11-15]. Assuming that Mr. Jones did not take any action, the Court finds his response to be reasonable in light of this single, isolated question, which is not on its face discriminatory or harassing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   To the extent that Mr. Ameti did not report the harassment because of his past experience being laid off at UTC after he complained about his supervisor in 2002 or 2003, the Court finds this unpersuasive to impute objectionable conduct. First, Mr. Ameti does not explain in what capacity he worked for UTC and how his position was related at all to his position at Sikorsky. Second, he does not indicate whether there existed any applicable UTC policies comparable to the one issued by Sikorsky. Third, he does not suggest that any of the individuals with and for whom he worked were the same. Fourth, there is more than a decade in between the alleged incidents and Mr. Ameti has not provided any legal basis for the Court to conclude this argument overcomes his failure to establish the imputation of objectionable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Court surmises that Mr. Ameti's failure to report the alleged harassment is more likely attributable to the fact that he did not find the conduct harassing. Indeed, with respect to Mr. Tabone's comments about Mr. Ameti having multiple wives, Mr. Ameti appears able to make light of the remarks. When describing the context in which Mr. Tabone made these comments, Mr. Ameti testified, \"And he will yell from the other side [of the engineer work area], 'Hey, Pellumb, can you tell us how many wives you have? Just to let you know, guys, Pellumb has three wives[,]' [to which Plaintiff quipped,] 'I wish that were true, but it wasn't.\" [Dkt. 82 at 266:13-267:9]. After making this remark, Mr. Ameti's counsel admonished him cautioning, \"Now, now, this is on the record,\" to which Mr. Ameti replied, \"Okay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267:7-10. Although the Court did not consider this comment in arriving at its conclusion, it nonetheless suggests the Court's conclusion is apt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Count V Through VII: State Claims\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In granting summary judgment on all the federal claims and the associated state claims falling under the same analysis, the Court will not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [Dkt. 62].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the above reasons, the Court GRANTS summary judgment as to Counts I through IV.
