On April 21, 2017, Defendants KK Sub II and Pharo moved for summary judgment under\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a). ECF No. 35. Defendant Hammel then filed her own Motion for Summary Judgment on April 25, 2017. ECF No. 36. For the reasons that follow, Defendants KK Sub II and Pharo's Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART, and Defendant Hammel's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 19, 2013, Defendant KK Sub II hired Plaintiff to work as Store Manager of the Subway located at 2200 Penfield Road in Penfield, New York. As District Manager and Human Resources liaison, Defendant Hammel was the one who conducted Plaintiff's interview and decided to hire Plaintiff. Approximately four to five months after Plaintiff started, Defendant Pharo became Plaintiff's Area Manager. As Area Manager, Defendant Pharo visited Plaintiff's store approximately once a week to drop off paychecks and assess the store's conditions in advance of monthly inspections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By Plaintiff's account, Defendant Pharo engaged in inappropriate conduct on at least four occasions: First, on one occasion, Defendant Pharo called Plaintiff a \"bitch\" via text message. Second, Plaintiff alleges that, on another occasion, Defendant Pharo told her, \"[Y]ou look like you're in a good mood, you must have gotten some last night.\" ECF No. 35-6, at 15; ECF No. 40-5, at 2. Third, when Defendant Pharo was once attempting to assist Plaintiff with the cap on a bottle of salad dressing, he remarked on how \"slippery it is\" and that \"he always gets it in the right place.\" ECF No. 35-2, at 2; ECF No. 36-1, at 1; ECF No. 40-5, at 2. Specifically, Plaintiff maintains that Defendant Pharo said, \"[I]t's so slippery, it's so wet, but don't worry, I always get it in, I never miss.\" ECF No. 35-6, at 15, 20; ECF No. 40-5, at 2. Fourth, on August 13, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff's bilateral nipple piercings became a point of conversation among coworkers, and Defendant Pharo \"expressed interest in observing Plaintiff's piercings.\" ECF No. 35-2, at 2; ECF No. 36-1, at 1; ECF No. 40-5, at 1. According to Plaintiff, her coworkers brought up the piercings, and-before she could respond-Defendant Pharo interjected to find out what she had gotten pierced. Plaintiff maintains that, when Defendant Pharo learned that her nipples had been pierced, he responded, \"[O]h, I want to see.... [H]a, ha, no, just kidding, but, no, I really want to see.\" ECF No. 35-6, at 23, 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Later that day, Plaintiff sent Defendant Hammel two text messages asking to speak with her. As of approximately August 15, 2014, Plaintiff had not received a response, so she called Defendant Hammel. When they spoke, Plaintiff recounted\n   what had happened, expressed her discomfort at working with Defendant Pharo, and requested a sit-down conversation. On or about August 25, 2014, Plaintiff sent Defendant Hammel a follow-up letter asking for that same meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The meeting Plaintiff requested did not occur until approximately September 25, 2014. According to Sonia Quinones, one of Plaintiff's coworkers, Defendant Hammel sought updates on Plaintiff's conduct in the interim as part of an investigation \"to see if [Plaintiff] was going to mess up.\" ECF No. 35-10, at 5-6; ECF No. 40-5, at 2. Prior to the meeting, and in preparation to file a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights (\"NYSDHR\"), Plaintiff attempted to solicit a statement from Ms. Quinones about the nipple-piercing incident, but Ms. Quinones refused to confirm Plaintiff's account. When Defendants Hammel and Pharo learned of that exchange, they solicited written statements from Ms. Quinones documenting what she claimed had transpired. Of the three additional coworkers who were present for the nipple-piercing incident, and whom Plaintiff asked for verification of her account, two provided Plaintiff with supporting statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff maintains that, when the requested meeting eventually took place on or about September 25, 2014, Defendant Pharo was present, and Defendant Hammel ultimately informed her that \"this is how it's going to have to be, you guys are both grown adults.\" ECF No. 35-6, at 29. Later that day, Plaintiff filed her complaint of sexual harassment with the NYSDHR. The next day, Plaintiff arrived at work to learn that she had been terminated. Defendants claim that Plaintiff was fired \"for abusing her supervisory position to obtain false statements from employees.\" ECF No. 35-2, at 3; ECF No. 36-1, at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly after her termination, on or about October 2, 2014, Plaintiff filed her complaint of retaliation with the NYSDHR. Pursuant to an investigation, the NYSDHR issued determinations of probable cause for both of Plaintiff's complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both of the resulting cases before the NYSDHR were eventually dismissed for administrative convenience.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is warranted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine\n   dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The Court must take genuinely disputed facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party-here, Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Rather, she focuses on her other claims, explaining that the hostile work environment claim \"was not the only issue raised in the complaint\" and conceding that \"[t]he court may find the defendants' arguments sufficiently weighty to dismiss the causes of action alleging a hostile work environment, but the remaining causes of action must go to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As for Defendant Hammel's position, the attorney affirmation attached to her Motion for Summary Judgment simply states that \"Defendants KK Sub II, LLC and John Pharo filed a motion for summary judgment....

Her Motion for Summary Judgment does not contain a Statement of Undisputed Facts or Memorandum of Law, both of which are required by Local Rules of Civil Procedure 7(a)(2)(A) and 56(a)(1).

With respect to the first protected activity-the phone call to Defendant Hammel-a reasonable jury could determine that Defendant KK Sub II was aware of the conversation. Plaintiff described the alleged harassment to Defendant Hammel in her capacity as Plaintiff's District Manager and HR contact, and Defendant Hammel discussed that conversation with Annie Aggarwal, one of four owners of Defendant KK Sub II. Accordingly, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant KK Sub II knew of Plaintiff's first protected activity prior to her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the second protected activity-Plaintiff's solicitation of supporting statements-a reasonable jury could also conclude that Defendant KK Sub II had knowledge of Plaintiff's efforts. In its own filings, Defendant KK Sub II maintains that it fired Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    based on\n   </em>\n   that activity: it asserts that, upon interviewing the coworker who refused to give a supporting statement, it \"conclud[ed] that the Plaintiff had solicited a false statement[ and] ... terminated her employment.\" ECF No. 35-1, at 8. Apart from any question of veracity, that statement signals that Defendant KK Sub II does not dispute its pre-termination knowledge of Plaintiff's efforts to secure supporting statements. Based on that recognition, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant KK Sub II knew of Plaintiff's second protected activity prior to her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The third protected activity-Plaintiff's complaint of harassment with the NYSDHR-occurred approximately one day before her termination. Even taking all inferences in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, nothing appears to suggest that, within twenty-four hours, Defendant KK Sub II was notified of the formal NYSDHR complaint filed against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, while a reasonable jury may not be able to find that Defendant KK Sub II had knowledge of Plaintiff's actual filing\n   with the NYSDHR, it could find that Defendant KK Sub II had knowledge of either of the other protected activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Retaliatory Harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Some courts in this circuit have questioned whether the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   also broadened the standard for claims of a retaliatory hostile work environment, or whether the severe-and-pervasive standard for substantive hostile work environment claims still applies.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Matthews v. Corning Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250109\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/77/275/\">\n    77 F.Supp.3d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 296-98 &amp; 297 n.7 (W.D.N.Y. 2014) (flagging the issue and applying the standard from\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   ). Under either of those standards, however, Plaintiff fails to satisfy the adverse-action element of her retaliatory harassment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The adverse action alleged for Plaintiff's retaliatory harassment claim would be, by definition, the harassment she claims to have experienced in retaliation for engaging in a protected activity. To determine whether retaliatory harassment took place, a jury would need to use Plaintiff's known engagement in a protected activity as the marker at which to start assessing Defendants' conduct. Of the two activities a jury could construe as both (a) protected, and (b) known by Defendant KK Sub II, the earlier action was Plaintiff's phone call with Defendant Hammel, and the later was Plaintiff's solicitation of supporting statements. Notably, using the later activity as the starting point for assessing any harassment would narrow the timespan at issue, necessarily limiting the scope of conduct that could support Plaintiff's claim. Accordingly, the most favorable treatment for Plaintiff would be to use the phone call as the relevant protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The proper inquiry would thus focus on Defendants' actions\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's phone conversation with Defendant Hammel. In support of her standalone claim of a hostile work environment, Plaintiff points to three main incidents, which allegedly took place in the following order: (1) Defendant Pharo calling her a \"bitch\"; (2) the conversation involving the bottle of salad dressing ; and (3) the exchange regarding Plaintiff's nipple piercings. Plaintiff also claims that, at another point, Defendant Pharo told her that she seemed to be \"in a good mood\" and \"must have gotten some last night.\" Taken together, these episodes formed the basis for Plaintiff's phone call to Defendant Hammel-as the topic of conversation, they necessarily predated that call. ECF No. 35-6, at 23 (describing the piercing incident as \"the last incident that [she] could take\"). The timing of those incidents thus precludes their consideration as evidence of\n   <em>\n    retaliatory\n   </em>\n   harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In the absence of those episodes, no alleged acts remain to support Plaintiff's claim of a retaliatory hostile work environment. Plaintiff fails to offer anything specific regarding her claim of being generally \"demean[ed],\" and the only remaining allegation Plaintiff cites for support is that Defendants failed to reassign her or Defendant Pharo. Under the severe-or-pervasive standard applicable to standard claims of a hostile work environment, this narrow slice of activity is insufficient, particularly when\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Defendants' conduct-taken together-fails to constitute a hostile work environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Even using the broader standard from\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's own conduct defeats the requisite showing for the adverse-action element. Plaintiff filed her complaint of sexual harassment with the NYSDHR on approximately September 25, 2014, the day before her termination. ECF No. 35-2, at 3; ECF No. 40-5, at 2. Defendants' conduct thus did not dissuade Plaintiff from making a charge of discrimination because she did, in fact, file a harassment complaint with the NYSDHR after the time period relevant to her claim of retaliatory harassment-at its earliest, the weeks between Plaintiff's phone call with Defendant Hammel and Plaintiff's ultimate termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250109\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/77/275/\">\n    77 F.Supp.3d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"By Plaintiff's own implied admission, the alleged harassment did not dissuade her from continuing to complain about alleged discrimination.\"). Under either standard, Plaintiff cannot make out the requisite prima facie case. For that reason, summary judgment is GRANTED as to Plaintiff's Title VII and NYSHRL claims of retaliatory harassment against Defendant KK Sub II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Retaliatory Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In the absence of a later rehiring, the complained-of firing in a retaliatory termination claim can typically satisfy the adverse-action requirement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Goffe v. NYU Hosp. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12183098\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/337/#p352\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (E.D.N.Y. 2016). Thus, a reasonable jury could consider Plaintiff's termination a materially adverse action, satisfying the third element of her prima facie case of retaliatory termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Causal Connection\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Second Circuit has consistently held that the causal-connection requirement may be satisfied indirectly via proof of close timing between the protected activity and subsequent adverse action.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Summa v. Hofstra Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541396\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/115/#p126\">\n    708 F.3d 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127-28 (2d Cir. 2013). It has not, however, drawn any \"bright line\" at which a connection becomes too temporally remote to be causal-that inferential assessment is left to the Court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541396\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/115/#p126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541396\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/115/#p126\">\n    at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Retaliatory Harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because Plaintiff fails to satisfy the third element for her requisite prima facie showing of retaliatory harassment, the Court need not-and does not-address the fourth element for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Retaliatory Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Between the two protected activities arguably known to Defendant KK Sub II pre-termination, the earlier-the phone call to Defendant Hammel-still preceded Plaintiff's firing by only one month. The Second Circuit has reasoned that timing within the same range permits an inference of causality.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zann Kwan v. Andalex Grp. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732472\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/834/#p843\">\n    737 F.3d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 845 (2d Cir. 2013) (inferring causation from a span of three weeks). Plaintiff's solicitation of supporting statements did not start until after her call to Defendant Hammel, making them even closer in time to the adverse action. Moreover, the given reasons for Plaintiff's termination could signal clear causality with respect to Plaintiff's solicitation: Plaintiff was purportedly fired specifically because she solicited support for her harassment claim, notwithstanding Defendants' contentions that she did so improperly. Accordingly, a reasonable jury could infer a causal connection between either of those protected activities and Plaintiff's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Legitimate Reason\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Per the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework, a plaintiff's prima facie showing of retaliation shifts the burden to the defendant to offer a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the adverse action.\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    411 U.S. 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10002\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/792/\">\n    36 L.Ed.2d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). With respect to Plaintiff's retaliatory harassment claim,\n   her failure to make out a prima facie case proves fatal, so the Court's analysis under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   continues only for her claim of retaliatory termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Here, the claimed impropriety of Plaintiff's solicitations could constitute a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for her firing. All three Defendants maintain that Plaintiff \"was terminated for abusing her supervisory position to obtain false statements from employees.\" ECF No. 35-2, at 3; ECF No. 36-1, at 1. Specifically, Defendants point to the testimony of Ms. Quinones, who refused to provide Plaintiff with a supporting statement-Ms. Quinones agreed that she had declined Plaintiff's \"efforts to have [her] make a false statement.\" ECF No. 35-1, at 8; ECF No. 35-10, at 12; ECF No. 36-1, at 1. Defendants claim that, pursuant to investigating Ms. Quinones' account, Plaintiff was terminated. ECF No. 35-1, at 8; ECF No. 36-1, at 1. Since Defendant KK Sub II's burden is only one of production, its claim of misconduct is satisfactory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Ms. Quinones explained, \"[Defendant Hammel] said she had an investigation against [Plaintiff].... She was just trying to see if [Plaintiff] was going to mess up....

A reasonable jury could construe Defendant Hammel's instruction as seeking cover for an otherwise-retaliatory firing. Moreover, the close timing between Plaintiff's phone call to Defendant Hammel and Plaintiff's termination could also contribute to a reasonable inference of pretext.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zann Kwan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732472\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/834/#p843\">\n    737 F.3d at 846-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] plaintiff may rely on evidence comprising her prima facie case, including temporal proximity, together with other evidence such as inconsistent employer explanations, to defeat summary judgment at [the pretext] stage.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Ms. Aggarwal's explanations could cast additional doubt on the legitimacy of Defendants' proffered reason for Plaintiff's termination. In her deposition, Ms. Aggarawal cited three reasons, taken together, for the firing: Plaintiff allegedly (1) \"d[id] personal things on the clock\"; (2) \"discuss[ed] piercings ... in [the] business environment\"; and (3) \"solicit[ed] false statements.\" ECF No. 35-8, at 24. Ms. Aggarwal also explained that \"being unfaithful to the clock\" by engaging in personal activities would be \"an automatic reason\" for termination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732472\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/834/#p843\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Although an alternative, \"automatic\" ground for termination could jeopardize Plaintiff's requisite showing of but-for causation, Ms. Aggarwal testified that-in Plaintiff's case-the decision to terminate was \"based off of\" all three reasons.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732472\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/834/#p843\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At base, Plaintiff and Defendants dispute whether the solicited statements were false: Plaintiff maintains that she sought confirmation of the piercing incident, while Defendants challenge the truthfulness of her account. If these factual disputes are construed in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, then Defendants' contention that the solicitations were the basis for Plaintiff's firing directly admits that Plaintiff's efforts to support her complaint were a-if not\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   -but-for cause of her termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants' purported timeline of events could lend further support to this inference. In the Statement of Undisputed Facts submitted with their Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants KK Sub II and Pharo maintain that the sit-down meeting between Defendant Hammel, Defendant Pharo, and Plaintiff occurred \"on or about September 25, 2015 ... after an internal investigation and inquiry was made into the allegations of ... Plaintiff.\" ECF No. 35-2, at 2. In her Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant Hammel agreed with Defendants Pharo and KK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Sub II's account. ECF No. 36-1, at 1. While Plaintiff disputes whether any real inquiry into her claims ever took place, ECF No. 40-5, at 2, Defendants' own sequence of events undercuts their proffered rationale: pursuant to their claimed investigation, they would have already received the September 22, 2014 statements from Ms. Quinones flagging the alleged time-clock violations, soliciting of statements, and piercing discussion prior to the sit-down meeting,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 40-2, at 2; ECF No. 40-3, at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 35-8, at 24, 27. Nevertheless, Defendant Hammel and Ms. Aggarwal each testified that the purpose of that meeting-which the parties agree occurred \"on or about\" the day preceding Plaintiff's termination-was to \"see if [Defendant Pharo and Plaintiff] could work together,\" not to terminate Plaintiff. ECF No. 35-9, at 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 35-8, at 26. As Plaintiff's counsel points out, a reasonable jury could find reconciling this alleged series of events \"inherently confusing\": if Defendants were already aware of their now-claimed grounds for Plaintiff's termination, a reasonable jury could question why they then conducted a conciliatory, sit-down meeting for Plaintiff and Defendant Pharo \"to see if they could work together\" the day before Plaintiff was fired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 35-9, at 22; ECF No. 40-4, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Given the logical inconsistencies, temporal proximity, and instructions to \"watch Plaintiff,\" a reasonable jury could infer that Defendants' proffered reason for Plaintiff's termination was pretextual.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Zann Kwan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732472\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/834/#p843\">\n    737 F.3d at 846-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Based on the discrepancies between the EEOC statement and subsequent testimony, a reasonable juror could infer that the explanation given by the defendant was pretextual, and that, coupled with the textual proximity between the complaint and the termination, the September 3 complaint was a but-for cause of Kwan's termination.\").

While Defendant Hammel's counsel argues that she \"did not make the decision to terminate [Plaintiff]\" and \"merely relayed the decision of Ms. Aggarwal,\" ECF No. 36-1, at 2, parts of the record reflect otherwise. The attorney affirmation attached to Defendant Hammel's motion quotes testimony from Ms. Aggarwal, but-at that same deposition-Ms. Aggarwal called the decision to fire Plaintiff \"a joint decision.\" ECF No. 35-8, at 24. Specifically, Ms. Aggarwal stated that she \"made the decision to terminate [Plaintiff] and so had [Defendant Hammel].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9254549\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/366/138/#p157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Aggarwal continued to reiterate that both she and Defendant Hammel had reached the same conclusion, leading her to explain, \"[W]e thought it was best to terminate...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25. Moreover, Defendant Hammel was the one who actually carried out Plaintiff's termination. ECF No. 35-6, at 34; ECF No. 35-7, at 12-13. Given Defendant Hammel's undisputed firing of Plaintiff and her contested role in the underlying decision, a reasonable jury could find that she \"aided and abetted\" the retaliatory termination by Defendant KK Sub II. Accordingly, summary judgment is DENIED as to Plaintiff's NYSHRL claim of aiding and abetting against Defendant Hammel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   With respect to Defendant Pharo, a reasonable jury could determine that he also \"aided and abetted\" Plaintiff's termination. Plaintiff maintains that, on the morning of her termination, she opened the Penfield store. ECF No. 35-6, at 34. As she recalls, Defendants Pharo and Hammel arrived later-together-and told her to stop working, at which point, Defendant Hammel fired her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At his deposition, Defendant Pharo maintained that, \"when [he] showed up that day, [he] didn't know that [Plaintiff] was even getting fired.\" ECF No. 35-7, at 13. Nevertheless, he confirmed that Defendant Hammel arranged to meet in the Penfield Subway's parking lot, where she explained that Plaintiff was being fired that day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Following that conversation, Defendant Pharo entered the Penfield store and was present when Defendant Hammel fired Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 35-7, at 12. Defendant Pharo also testified that he showed up with Defendant Hammel that day \"[b]ecause [Defendant Hammel] was terminating [Plaintiff], and I had to open the store.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Taking all inferences and factual disputes in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendant Pharo entered the Penfield store that morning to knowingly assist Defendant Hammel with Plaintiff's termination.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pedi v.

Ms. Quinones testified that, after Plaintiff asked her for a supporting statement, she notified Defendant Pharo of the request. ECF No. 35-10, at 7. Per Ms. Quinones' account, Defendant Pharo then called Defendant Hammel asking if \"[he] need[ed] to get a lawyer, because [Plaintiff] want[ed] to sue [him].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4008961\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/691/392/#p401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant Pharo confirmed that he called Defendant Hammel after his conversation with Ms. Quinones, and Defendant Hammel instructed him to obtain written statements from Ms. Quinones.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Those statements then formed the claimed basis for Plaintiff's termination. Taking Plaintiff's factual allegations as true, a reasonable jury could determine that Defendant Pharo's involvement in procuring Ms. Quinones' statements helped to create the pretextual cover for her retaliatory firing-namely, Defendants' claim that Plaintiff was improperly obtaining false statements from her subordinates.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dunson v.
