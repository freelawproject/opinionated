The officer then observed the \u201cwhite male\u201d taking paper money out of his pocket and handing it to LaBoy who took the money and pointed to Anaya who was approximately five to six feet away. The \u201cwhite male\u201d then walked over to defendant who \u201creached down into the front of her pants and pulled out a small object and took a piece from that object and handed it to the white male. And then the white male then walked out of the area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Believing he witnessed a drug transaction, Sattelberger \u201cradioed for the backup unit\u201d to \u201csecure\u201d defendant and LaBoy and for a female officer, since he \u201chad seen the female put something down her pants which [he] suspected was contraband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">When Officer Maureen Daley arrived, Sattelberger told her to \"search\u201d defendant because he felt she possessed \u201ccontraband.\u201d Daley \u201cwent into the hallway of 359 Summer Street and then came out with seven bags of suspected heroin\u201d, (1T15), from \u201c[i]nside the [defendant\u2019s] underwear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Both defendant and LaBoy were placed under arrest, advised of their rights and taken to headquarters. There, Sattelberger strip searched LaBoy and recovered $165.00. He also field tested the glassine packets of white powder which tested positive for heroin. Two of the seven bags subsequently tested positive in the State Police lab, and it was further determined that the seven glassine bags contained .19 grams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>At trial it was determined that 359 Summer Street is situated 245 feet in a straight line measurement from Paterson School No. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">After observing an individual speak to LaBoy and give him money, seeing LaBoy point to defendant and the male approach her after which she reached down the front of her pants, take a small object and give it to the male, the officer had probable cause to take the action he did.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">The constitutional validity of the search in this case, then, must depend upon the constitutional validity of petitioner\u2019s arrest. Whether that arrest was constitutionally valid depends in turn upon whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officers had probable cause to make <em>it\u2014whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d [State v. Contursi, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>422, 429 [209 A.2d 829] (1965) (quoting <em>Beck v. Ohio, </em>379 <em>U.S. </em>89, 91, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>223 [225], 13 L.Ed.2d 142, 145 (1964)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">We believe that the trial court correctly concluded that Sattelberger\u2019s \u201cwell-grounded suspicion or belief,\u201d based on the totality of the circumstances, that a crime had been committed, was reasonable, <em>State v. Bates, </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>416, 423, 495 A.2d 422 (App.Div.1985); <em>see also State v. DeSimone, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>319, 322, 288 A.2d 849 (1972); <em>State v.

McKenna, </em>228 <em>N.J.Super. </em>468, 474-475, 550 A.2d 171 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Q\">Notwithstanding the provisions of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:1-8 or any other provisions of law, a conviction arising under this section <em>shall not merge with </em>a conviction for a violation of subsection a. of <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:35-5 (manufacturing, distributing or dispensing) or <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:35-6 (employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme), (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>In <em>State v. Blow, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>184, 567 A.2d 253 (App.Div.1989), we recently rejected an argument that, notwithstanding the statute, the convictions of possession with intent to distribute, N.J.S.A. <em>2C:3</em>5-5a(1) and -b(3), and possession with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of school property, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a and 2C:35-7, must merge. We adhere to that position, but add the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The New Jersey Double Jeopardy provision, contained in <em>N.J.S.A. Const. </em>(1947) Article 1, \u00b6 11, has been construed to be co-extensive with the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution or is to be interpreted consistent therewith. <em>State v. DeLuca, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>98, 101-102, 527 A.2d 1355 <em>cert. </em>den. <em>sub nom. New Jersey v. DeLuca, </em>484 <em>U.S. </em>944, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>331, 98 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>358 (1987); <em>State v. Barnes, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>362, 370, 420 A.2d 303 (1980); <em>State v. Rechtschaffer, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>395, 404, 360 A.2d 362 (1976). Because the language of our state constitution talks about retrial \u201cafter acquittal,\u201d, as compared with the \u201cbroader provision\u201d of the federal constitution, <em>State v. D'Amato, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>595, 602, n. 1, 528 A.2d 928 (App.Div.1987), certif. den. 110 <em>N.J. </em>170, 540 A.2d 169 (1988), it can properly be said that our constitution \u201caffords a defendant no greater double jeopardy protection than is granted by the federal constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Blow, </em>237 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 189, 567 A.2d 253. In this case defendant\u2019s constitutional attack on the \u201cnon-merger provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7\u201d is based exclusively on the federal and state double jeopardy clauses, Point II, and it is clear that there is no federal constitutional violation. Accordingly, there can be no state constitutional violation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>In <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>359, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983) the United States Supreme Court recently held, \u201c[w]ith respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not more than prevent the sentencing court from prescribing a greater punishment than the legislature intended.\u201d 459 <em>U.S. </em>at 366, 103 S.Ct. at 678, 74 L.Ed.2d at 542. In other words, where multiple sentences are imposed in a single proceeding, legislative intent controls. <em>See Garrett v. United States, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>773, 779, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2407, 2411, 85 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>764, 771 (1985), <em>reh. den. </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>927, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>20, 87 L.Ed.2d 698 (1985). Stated differently, where the Legislature \u201cintended ... to impose multiple punishment, imposition of such sentences does not violate the constitution.\u201d <em>Missouri v. Hunter, supra, </em>368, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 679, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 543, citing <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 <em>U.S. </em>333, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1137, 67 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>275 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The legislative intent of the Comprehensive Drug Act of 1986 (C.D.R.A.) regarding <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 is relatively clear. As recently stated in <em>State v. Morales, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 83, 539 A.2d 769 (Law Div.1987):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">[t]he intent of the Legislature is to provide for stiffer penalties for those who violate <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7. The merger language is intended to ensure that defendants possibly subject to both sections, cannot avoid the mandatory sentencing provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 by arguing that the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 offense merges totally into <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5. It was intended that the convictions for sentencing purposes relating to mandatory minimums were not to be merged. This being the case it becomes clear that the intent of the Legislature was to ensure that for purposes of sentencing the two offenses would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>merge to the exclusion of a mandatory minimum and that a violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7, generally, must result in incarceration. Any other reading of the provisions would allow the clear intent of the Legislature to be subverted. With this analysis the legislative goal is realized and the alleged double jeopardy argument is avoided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Accordingly, the Legislature clearly intended to sanction multiple convictions and punishment upon simultaneous convictions for possession with intent to distribute heroin and for doing it within 1,000 feet of school property, and we uphold that intent. <em>See State v. Blow, supra; compare, State v. Churchdale Leasing, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">We summarily reject defendant\u2019s vagueness contention. <em>See State v. Ogar, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>459, 471-472, 551 A.2d 1037 (App.Div.1989). <em>See also State v. Brown, </em>227 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 547 A.2d 743 (Law Div.1988); <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 542 A.2d 966 (Law Div.1988); <em>State v. Morales, supra, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 78, 539 A.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">We have previously rejected challenges to the C.D.R.A.\u2019s penalty provisions based on equal protection, due process and cruel and unusual punishment claims. <em>See State in the Interest of L.M., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 550 A.2d 1252 (App.Div.1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>certif. den. 114 <em>N.J. </em>485 (1989). We adhere to that decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">While we reject defendant\u2019s sentencing contention, <em>see State v.

Ghertler, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>383, 555 <em>A.2d </em>553 (1989), we note that the same mandatory minimum of three years would have to be served on a four year term as a five year term and that the 18-month parole ineligibility term for possession with intent was made concurrent with the sentence embodying the required three year parole disqualifier. Finally, even though the sentences were concurrent, separate DEDR penalties and lab fees had to be imposed \u201cfor each such offense\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-16, 35-20. <em>See State v.

At some point we may be obligated to reconcile the statement in <em>[Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459, <em>U.S. </em>359, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>673, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>535 (1983)] that multiple punishment may be imposed if the Legislature clearly so intends with a conflicting proposition from our own cases. The conflicting proposition is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the Legislature would exceed its authority if in creating two offenses it simply applied different labels to the same offense. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>69, 80, 342 A.2d 841 (1975).\" <em>See also State v. Newman, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>284, 287-288, 538 A.2d 820 (App.Div.1988). Given the language of our state constitution, we cannot grant greater double jeopardy protection to a defendant in this context than the broader federal protection. Any such additional protection must flow from a different constitutional safeguard. <em>See State v. Churchdale Leasing, supra </em>115 N.J. at 107-108, 557 A.2d 277. No other constitutional provision is advanced in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b69-11\"> We reject defendant\u2019s statutory argument that the non-merger provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 merely prohibits the merger of that offense into an offense embodied in chapters 35 and 36 so as to avoid the mandatory period of parole ineligibility. Reading the provision to authorize merger of 2C:35-5 and 35-6 offenses into 2C:35-7 would require merger of certain more serious offenses into the third degree crime embodied in the latter section. We find no legislative intent supporting the proposition that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-7 permits the merger of offenses, provided that the mandatory minimum is maintained. Rather, we read the legislative intent, with reference to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:l-8, as requiring the entry of separate convictions. The use of the words \u201cshall not merge <em>with\" </em>(emphasis added) in 2C:35-7 supports this conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b70-9\"> We emphasize that we do not herein deal with the nonpayment of a mandatory penalty. <em>See State in Interest of L.M., 229 N.J.Super. </em>at 96, n. 3, 550 A.2d 1252. <em>See also Black v.
