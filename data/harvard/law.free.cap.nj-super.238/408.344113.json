Bruce, Sr., individually and Helen Bruce, guardian <em>ad litem </em>of the minor child, Sherry L. Bruce, appeal from a summary judgment of the Law Division entered in favor of defendants James P. MacLean Firm (MacLean) and Aetna Casualty <em>&amp; </em>Surety Company (Aetna) which dismissed this action for reformation of their insurance policy and damages based on the alleged failure of Aetna and MacLean to make additional uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage available to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">Plaintiffs contend that the judgment should be reversed because (1) an insurance agent has an affirmative duty to offer, explain and advise an insured regarding the correct uninsured and underinsured coverage which cannot be fulfilled by relying upon the mass mailing of the Buyer\u2019s Guide by the insurance carrier and (2) an automobile liability insurance carrier has an affirmative duty to explain uninsured and underinsured coverage to its insureds and to offer such coverage up to the liability limits of the automobile policy, subject to the statutory limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">We have carefully considered the record in light of the arguments presented and are satisfied that the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants in this matter and that all of the issues of law raised are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Accordingly, the summary judgment under review is affirmed substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Klein-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>er in his written opinion reported as <em>James C. Bruce, Sr., et al. v. James P. MacLean Firm, et al., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>501, 570 <em>A.</em>2d 49 (Law Div.1989).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
