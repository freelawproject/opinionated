Geherty alleged that Moore was intoxicated at the time and that prior thereto, he negligently had been served alcoholic beverages by McGuinn\u2019s Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Summary judgment was entered against Moore on the issue of liability. Thereafter, a jury trial was held on the liability issue against McGuinn\u2019s Place and on the issue of damages against both defendants. Geherty\u2019s motion at the conclusion of the evidence, to eliminate the issue of proximate cause as to McGuinn\u2019s Place, was denied. The verdict returned was molded to indicate that McGuinn\u2019s Place was not liable to plaintiff and damages of $80,000.00 were entered against Moore alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">Subsequently, plaintiff moved for a new trial on the issue of liability against McGuinn\u2019s Place. Moore moved for a new trial on the issue of damages. Both motions were denied. Plaintiff filed an appeal from the judgment in favor of McGuinn\u2019s Place and McGuinn\u2019s Place filed a cross-appeal alleging that the award of money damages was excessive. Moore\u2019s motion seeking leave to file a cross-appeal <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">Most of the operative facts involving liability were not disputed at trial. On April 22, 1983, at approximately 10:30 in the morning, Moore drove his 1980 Toyota to Baltimore, Maryland in connection with his work in a research program. Sometime around 1:00 p.m. he had lunch, during which he had \u201cseveral beers.\u201d At about 4:30 in the afternoon he drove back toward his home at 12 Stonicker Drive, in Lawrence Township, New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Jersey. Somewhere above Philadelphia, just before crossing over the bridge to New Jersey, at about 6:00 p.m., Moore stopped at a bar for an hour or so, during which he consumed a \u201ccouple of beers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">He then drove into New Jersey and, at approximately 8:00 p.m., stopped at McGuinn\u2019s Place in Lawrenceville. He had been there on several occasions before. He drank beer while he was there, but could not recall how much. However, it was his \u201chabit and custom\u201d to drink \u201ctwo to three beers per hour.\u201d He did recall that the beer was served in sixteen ounce glasses. Moore did not eat while at McGuinn\u2019s Place, nor did he recall having any conversations with the bartender that evening. At approximately 11:00 p.m., Moore left McGuinn\u2019s Place for home.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Then 19 years old, Geherty and his girlfriend, Susan Berry, arrived at her home at 18 Stonicker Drive sometime around 11:00 p.m. in a 1979 Volkswagen. Geherty parked in front of Susan\u2019s home for two to three minutes without any lights on. As Geherty was about to exit, he noticed Moore\u2019s car coming \u201cquite fast\u201d from the opposite direction. It came over to Geherty\u2019s side of the road and struck his car on the front driver\u2019s side pushing it over the curb, across the sidewalk and onto the lawn of a neighbor's yard. When Geherty went over to Moore, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, he saw that Moore was \u201csort of swaying around a little bit\u201d and smelled of alcohol. Geherty called for help and then suddenly felt as though \u201csomeone hit [him] in the head with a baseball bat.\u201d He sat on the lawn and shortly thereafter the police arrived. At this point he began to \u201cshiver uncontrollably\u201d and was taken to Princeton hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Moore\u2019s deposition was read into evidence and indicated that after turning down Stonicker Drive and traveling about two blocks, Moore was \u201cwide-angling to the left\u201d as he normally does, to pull into the driveway of his house. All of a sudden, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>struck a car parked in a spot where none had ever been parked during the four years that he had lived there.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Lieutenant James Kelley was dispatched to the accident and found Moore standing outside of his vehicle. He appeared to be swaying a bit and Kelley smelled the odor of alcohol on his breath. Kelley asked Moore to perform several sobriety tests. During the finger to the nose test with his right hand, Moore appeared \u201csure\u201d but seemed \u201ca little uncertain\u201d when using his left hand. Although Moore\u2019s speech was slurred and Kelley felt that he was \u201cunder the influence of alcohol,\u201d Moore was not loud, boisterous or rambling. Rather, he was polite, cooperative and appeared calm. However, because Kelley believed that Moore was intoxicated he was taken to police headquarters for a breathalyzer test.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">At headquarters, Moore was given a breathalyzer test by Sergeant Richard Stout who used the Stevenson, model 900, machine. The first breath test, performed at 12:24 a.m., revealed Moore\u2019s blood alcohol content to be .21 percent. Approximately ten minutes later a second test indicated a blood alcohol content of .20 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Plaintiff produced Richard Zylman, who testified without objection as an expert regarding \u201calcohol in the human body and the breathalyzer.\u201d He opined that the beer which Moore had drunk during lunch would have dissipated long before the time of the accident. However, he reached various conclusions by extrapolating the results of the breathalyzer test, Moore\u2019s body weight, the amount of beer consumed and the time over which he had been drinking. He calculated that Moore had drunk approximately 167 ounces of beer, or about 10 sixteen ounce glasses, between 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. He indicated that while drinking at the first bar in Pennsylvania, Moore\u2019s blood alcohol rose from zero to between .02 and .03 percent. After entering McGuinn\u2019s Place his blood alcohol level rose to .10 percent by 9:20 p.m. and to .15 percent by 10:30 p.m. Finally, by the time he left MeGuinn\u2019s at 11:00 p.m., Moore\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>blood alcohol level was up to about .17 percent. Eventually, his blood alcohol level increased to the .21 percent registered by the breathalyzer.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Zylman opined that at that point, Moore was \u201chighly intoxicated.\u201d He concluded with the opinion that when the blood alcohol range of .12 percent was reached, even an \u201cexperienced drinker\u201d would have exhibited effects which would have been \u201cobservable by an ordinary person.\u201d As part of its case, McGuinn\u2019s Place read Moore\u2019s deposition into evidence wherein Moore denied that his ability to drive had been affected by his consumption of alcoholic beverages. Further, David Lester, the expert for McGuinn\u2019s Place, testified that the particular model of breathalyzer machine used by the police to test Moore was subject to operator error, making its readings unreliable. In sum, McGuinn\u2019s Place sought to establish that Moore was not intoxicated that night and that, in any event, he did not exhibit any signs of intoxication while at its establishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">At the conclusion of the evidence, with respect to the liability of McGuinn\u2019s Place, the trial judge charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">Now, in this case, the plaintiff, as I\u2019ve said, seeks damages against the defendant, McGuinns Place, contending that McGuinns Place was negligent by serving alcoholic beverages to defendant Moore while defendant Moore was intoxicated, and that such negligence proximately caused an accident in which the plaintiff was injured. Plaintiff contends that at the time the alcoholic beverages were served, defendant McGuinns Place knew or in the circumstances, should have known that the patron, Mr. Moore, was intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">In this case, I will use the phrase visibly intoxicated to mean a patron who McGuinns Place knew or from the circumstances, should have known was intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">Now, I\u2019ve used the term negligence. Negligence is generally defined as the failure to exercise that degree of care for the safety of others which a reasonably prudent person would exercise in the same or similar circumstances. In determining whether such care has been exercised, you should consider whether the defendant and again now, we\u2019re talking about McGuinns Place only, should have foreseen in the attending circumstances that the natural and proximate consequences of its conduct would have been some accident or injury. For a person to be negligent, it is not necessary that it foresees the particular accident that occurred or the specific injuries which result from the accident. A person or in this case, the tavern owner, is negligent, however, if it does those acts which a reasonably prudent person would not have done, thereby creating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>or contributing to a risk of harm and circumstances where a reasonably prudent person would have foreseen that the probable consequence of its conduct would be some accident or injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Thus, negligence is the doing of an act which a reasonably prudent person would not have done in the same or similar circumstances because that act creates or contributes an unreasonable and foreseeable risk of harm to others. A person is also deemed negligent if it creates or contributes to an unreasonable risk of injury by its conduct when that conduct is combined with the conduct of others which a reasonably prudent person would foresee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">In other words, a tavern owner is deemed negligent if it serves alcoholic beverages to a visibly intoxicated person in circumstances where a reasonably prudent person would foresee that by serving alcoholic beverages to such a person, it is causing or contributing to an unreasonable risk of harm to others that may result thereafter by the conduct of the intoxicated person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">In this connection, you may consider that in current times, traveling by car to and from a tavern is commonplace, and you may consider that the effects of intoxication of a driver may reasonably be foreseen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">Now, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control which is a state agency, pursuant to authority granted by a statute, enacted by our legislature has adopted Regulation 20, Rule 1, which provides in pertinent part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">No licensee shall sell, serve or deliver or allow or permit the sale, service or delivery of any alcoholic beverage directly or indirectly to any person actually intoxicated, or allow or permit the consumption of any alcoholic beverages by any such person in or upon the licensed premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">Now, such a regulation establishes a standard of conduct for tavern owners. The law\u2019s designed to protect not only patrons who are visibly intoxicated, but also to protect members of the public from foreseeable risk of injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">If you find that the defendant McGuinns Place has violated that standard of conduct, such violation is evidence to be considered by you in determining whether negligence, as I\u2019ve defined that term for you, has been established.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">Thus, you may find the tavern owner negligent if you find that the tavern owner served or permitted to be served alcoholic beverages to a person who was intoxicated and that the tavern owner knew or from the circumstances, should have known that the person was intoxicated at the time that he was served.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-13\">Now, a person who is negligent is liable for injuries which are proximately caused by his negligence. And by proximate cause, as I\u2019ve previously defined that for you, we mean a cause which naturally and probably led to the accident and resulting injuries. Where there are two or more causes of an accident, a person whose negligence is a substantial factor in contributing to a cause of the accident, is held liable to a person injured in said accident. If a tavern owner negligently served alcoholic beverages to a patron who was visibly intoxicated, and if such service of alcoholic beverages was a substantia] factor in bringing about an accident, it would make no difference that other causes intervened and contributed to the accident, so long as those other intervening causes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>foreseeable or were natural and probable consequences of the risk of harm created by the sale of liquor to the visibly intoxicated person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">Thus, plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant if plaintiff proves by the preponderance of the evidence, the following elements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">One, that defendant was negligent in serving alcoholic beverages to defendant Moore when defendant Moore was intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">Two, that at the time when the alcoholic beverages were served, defendant McGuinns Place knew or should have known from the circumstances that defendant Moore was intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">And three, that such service of alcoholic beverages was a proximate cause or a substantial factor in causing the accident and injury complained of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">This charge was taken virtually verbatim from the language of Model Jury Charge 5.31. <em>Cf. State v. Concepcion, </em>111 <em>N.J </em>373, 379, 545 A.2d 119 (1988) (commenting on the use of such aids).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">A verdict sheet was also submitted to the jury which contained five interrogatories, the first three of which also followed the language in that same Model Charge and read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">1. Was defendant McGuinn\u2019s Place negligent in serving alcoholic beverages to defendant Richard Moore, when defendant Moore was intoxicated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">2. At the time alcoholic beverages were served, did defendant McGuinn\u2019s Place know, or should defendant McGuinn\u2019s Place have known from the circumstances that defendant Richard J. Moore was intoxicated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-14\">3. If you answered questions 1 and 2 \u201cyes\u201d, was the conduct of defendant McGuinn\u2019s Place a proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-15\">The fourth interrogatory inquired about the defendants\u2019 comparative negligence and the fifth instructed the jury to assess plaintiff\u2019s damages, which it did at $80,000. The jury, by vote of 5 to 1, answered the first question in the negative and, as instructed, did not answer the second or third interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-16\">Geherty contends that this charge was erroneous, confusing and was compounded by the submission of the erroneously phrased interrogatories. He argues that in <em>Thompson v. Victor\u2019s Liquor Store, Inc., </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. 202, </em>523 A.2d 269 (App.Div.1987), we held that the sale or service of alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person constitutes negligence <em>per se, </em>and that the jury may not find otherwise where that is properly established by the proofs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>As noted in <em>Buckley v. Estate of Pirolo, supra. </em>[101 <em>N.J. </em>68, 500 A.2d 703 (1985)] our dram-shop rule is one of common law, emanating from <em>Rappaport v. Nichols. </em>[31 <em>N.J. </em>188, 156 A.2d 1 (1959)] This rule parallels the dram-shop statutes in many other states. We know that a violation of most statutes and administrative regulations is merely evidence of negligence, thus we might consider that a violation of the <em>Rappaport </em>rule or of the administrative regulation be merely such evidence. But the violation of some statutes, when coinciding with established common-law principles of tort liability, has been considered \u2018negligence\u2019 as opposed to just \u2018evidence of negligence.\u2019 See <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 10-11 [258 A.2d 706] (1969). Considering the treatment by the Supreme Court of the ramifications of the sale or service of alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person or a minor in <em>Rappaport vs. Nichols </em>and its progeny, it is fair to hold that such a sale, is negligence <em>per </em>se.... <em>[Id., Thompson, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 210, 523 A.2d 269.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In other words,\" the jury must be clearly instructed, without qualification, that once a plaintiff proves the elements set forth in <em>Rappaport, infra, </em>and <em>Anslinger v. Martinsville Inn, Inc., </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. 525, 532, </em>298 A.2d 84 (App.Div.1972), certif. den., 62 <em>N.J. 334, </em>301 A.2d 449 (1973), it <em>must </em>find the tavern owner to have been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The prerequisites to establish a tavern owner\u2019s negligence are threefold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">(1) The patron must be intoxicated; (2) the tavern owner or its employee must know or should have known he was intoxicated and (3) the tavern owner must serve liquor to the intoxicated person. <em>Anslinger, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 532, 298 A.2d 84.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">This common law liability was first recognized in the landmark case of <em>Rappaport v. Nichols, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>188, 156 A.2d 1 (1959). Applying fundamental negligence principles, the Supreme Court there held that a negligence cause of action would lie against a tavern owner where he serves an intoxicated patron who thereafter proximately causes injuries. In <em>Soronen v. Olde Milford Inn, Inc., </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>582, 218 A.2d 630 (1966), the establishment of this principle was reaffirmed, although the verdict for the plaintiff was reversed because the charge allowed the jury to find the tavern owner to have been negligent without considering whether or not he knew or should have known that the patron was intoxicated. <em>Id. </em>at 593-594, 218 A.2d 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Our examination of this charge and the interrogatories submitted in connection therewith, leads us to conclude that they were erroneous in several respects. The trial judge first generally defined the principles of negligence and then undertook to define the common law negligence cause of action or \u201cdram shop\u201d rule enunciated in <em>Rappaport.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In connection with the latter he cited the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) regulation prohibiting service of alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person and then told the jury that a violation thereof only could be considered as \u201cevidence\u201d of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Our courts have emphasized that such negligence is established where it is proven that a tavern owner served an intoxicated person alcoholic beverages in circumstances where such seller knows or ought to have known that the patron is intoxicated. <em>Anslinger, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 532, 298 A.2d 84. Thus, in order to resolve the question of negligent conduct the jury in this case basically had to determine only whether McGuinn\u2019s Place had sold beer to an intoxicated Moore when it knew or should have known that he was in that condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">However, by injecting the ABC regulation into the case <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:2-23.1 the trial judge unnecessarily confounded that determination. <em>Cf. Thompson, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 205, 523 A.2d 269. It is true that, in <em>Rappaport </em>and <em>Soronen, </em>the Court recognized the existence of such a regulation. But it is equally clear that the <em>Rappaport </em>Court relied upon that regulatory provision primarily to point out the existence of a \u201clegislative policy\u201d which was supportive of its conclusion there that such activity also constitutes common law negligence. Notwithstanding the usual admonition that the violation of such a regulation will constitute only \u201cevidence of ... negligence\u201d <em>(Rappaport, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at page 203, 156 A.2d 1) it is settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the standard of conduct prohibited by the regulation also constitutes negligent behavior, independent of any violation thereof. In <em>Soronen, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>582, 218 A.2d 630 (1966), the Supreme Court recognized this principle when it noted that a tavern owner is subjected to common law liability \u201cdespite the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at page 586, 218 A.2d 630. <em>Thompson, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 210, 523 A.2d 269.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, a jury ordinarily should be charged without reference to any regulation violation (although the terminology of \u201cnegligence <em>per se\u201d </em>is not very helpful to a jury). The facts of this case did not warrant any mention of the regulation especially because of the explanation that a violation was only \u201cevidence of negligence.\u201d The jury might have been misled because evidence of the elements necessary to prove liability against McGuinn\u2019s Place had been produced by plaintiff and therefore there was no need to inject the subject matter of the regulation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Moreover, we are compelled to also express our disapproval of the phrasing of the interrogatories in this case. <em>R. </em>4:39-1 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">The court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact, in which case it may submit to the jury either written questions which can be categorically or briefly answered or written forms of the several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring written findings thereon as it deems appropriate. The court shall instruct the jury concerning the matters submitted as is necessary to enable it to make its findings upon each issue. If in so doing the court omits any issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives his right to a trial by jury of the issues so omitted unless before the jury retires he demands its submission to the jury. The court may make a finding as to an issue omitted without such demand, or, if it fails to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>so, it shall be deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">See the extensive discussion in <em>Bree v. Jalbert, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 209 A.2d 836 (Law Div.1965), aff'd, 91 <em>N.J.Super. </em>38, 219 A.2d 178 (App.Div.1966), in which Judge Botter traced the history of R.4:39-1 and R.4:39-2, authorizing the use of special verdicts and of a general verdict accompanied by answers to inter-rogatories, respectively. <em>See also Nylander v. Rogers, </em>41 <em>N.J. </em>236, 196 A.2d 1 (1963) explaining when such verdicts should be utilized and cautioning that a special verdict under [now] R.4:39-1 requires a \u201cwritten finding upon each issue of fact in the case from which the judge forms and enters the resultant judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at pages 240-241, 196 A.2d 1; <em>Bleeker v. Trickolo, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>502, 215 A.2d 571 (App.Div.1965). The bottom line is that a court must be careful to avoid phrasing such questions inartfully, lest they encourage the return of inconsistent answers or operate to exclude some of the factual hypotheses upon which a general verdict is to be based. <em>Pressler, Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Comment R. 4:39-1 and R.4:39-2. <em>See also </em>5A <em>Moore, Federal Practice, </em>\u00a7 49-02 through \u00a7 49-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">The trial judge prepared the verdict sheet based on the misleading language in the Model Civil Jury Charge 5.31. Instead of asking the jury to determine <em>factually </em>whether Moore was intoxicated and whether McGuinn\u2019s Place knew or ought to have known thereof, he phrased it in terms of whether McGuinn\u2019s Place was \u201cnegligent\u201d in \u201cserving\u201d Moore when he was \u201cintoxicated.\u201d Obviously, the term \u201cnegligence\u201d in such a case necessarily includes <em>all </em>of the <em>Anslinger </em>elements, including that described in the second interrogatory. Since the jury answered only the first, they never went on to consider the elements described in the second one which asked if McGuinn\u2019s Place \u201cknew, or should ... have known ... that ... Moore was intoxicated.\u201d <em>Cf. Soronen, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 585-589, 218 A.2d 630. In other words, by framing the first interrogatory as he did, the trial judge erroneously centered attention on the legal concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>of negligence but only alluded to some of the fact elements of such a cause of action. Again, the jury may have been confused or misled by such. <em>Navarro, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 570-571, 512 A.2d 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We are cognizant of the practice wherein the jury is asked to return a verdict indicating only legal conclusions instead of resolving specific fact issues. For example, the jury may be asked to decide only questions framed in terms of negligence and proximate cause. Such practice is the equivalent of calling for the return of general verdicts. <em>Ball v. N.J. Bell Telephone Co., </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100, 114, 504 A.2d 29 (App.Div.1986), certif. den., 104 <em>N.J. </em>383, 517 A.2d 391 (1986). In this case, had the trial judge framed the interrogatories so as to elicit <em>only </em>the issues of fact as set forth in <em>Anslinger, </em>he could then have molded the consequent determination of \u201cnegligence\u201d or lack thereof, on the part of McGuinn\u2019s Place. Alternatively, he could have instructed them to consider <em>only </em>the legal issues of negligence and proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">However, on this record we are unable to discern the basis for the jury\u2019s determination that McGuinn\u2019s Place was not \u201cnegligent.\u201d Did it find that McGuinn\u2019s Place did not serve Moore at all or, that it did not serve him when he was intoxicated? Moreover, did the jury consider whether McGuinn\u2019s Place knew or should have known of Moore\u2019s intoxication under the circumstances? This factor was included in the Court\u2019s charge as an element of the definition of negligence, however, it was to be separately considered according to the interrogatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">We acknowledge that our responsibility is to examine a charge in its entirety to determine its overall effect. <em>State v. Wilbely, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>420, 422, 307 A.2d 608 (1973), certif. granted, 63 <em>N.J. </em>504, 308 A.2d 669 (1973).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">So long as the law standing alone is stated correctly and intelligently, the ultimate test of the soundness of instructions is, not what the ingenuity of counsel can, at leisure, work out the instructions to mean, but how and in what sense, under the evidence before them and the circumstances of the trial, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ordinary men and jurors understand the instructions as a whole. [Citation omitted].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">The acid test is would che jury be misled. <em>Vadurro v. Yellow Cab Co. of Camden, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>102, 107-108 [77 A.2d 459] (1950).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">In this case, however, there was no direct proof that Moore was visibly intoxicated when he was served at McGuinn\u2019s Place. The only evidence which plaintiff did produce on this point was the extrapolated opinion evidence of the expert, Richard Zylman. On the other hand, the arresting officer testified that while Moore\u2019s speech was slurred, he was not loud, boisterous or rambling and that he was polite, cooperative and calm at the scene. <em>Cf Anslinger, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 533, 298 A.2d 84. Thus, the evidence of Moore\u2019s condition and its noticeability that night was crucial. Therefore, any confusion generated in resolving this issue was critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Geherty also urges that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it \u201cmay\u201d find McGuinn\u2019s Place to be negligent if the <em>Anslinger </em>elements had been found to have been proven. Our concurring colleague accepts this as a contention but disagrees that doing so is erroneous. However, we read that language in <em>Rappaport </em>and <em>Soronen </em>as merely ancillary to the common law policy the Court was adopting. We do not attempt to \u201crewrite\u201d what those cases say but merely interpret them to mean that the Court used the permissive language in an effort to be careful lest anyone believe that a jury was required to find liability even where the proofs did not establish the necessary elements. Without further expounding on this issue, suffice it to say that the errors which we have previously discussed, when viewed with the misleading juxtaposition of the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in the charge, lead us to conclude that this verdict may well have resulted in an unjust result, requiring a new trial concerning the liability of McGuinn\u2019s Place. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2; <em>Jenoff v. Gleason, </em>215 <em>N.J.Super. </em>349, 521 A.2d 1323 (App.Div.1987). We recommend that this model charge be reframed and that such permissive language be located and phrased in such a manner so as to underscore that it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>cautionary only in the sense indicated. We reiterate that if plaintiff demonstrates service to an underage or intoxicated patron and that the tavern owner knew or ought to have known thereof, such conduct constitutes negligence <em>(per </em>se) and the only remaining inquiry should be directed to the proximate cause element of such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In other words, we disagree with McGuinn\u2019s Place\u2019s contention that, even assuming that the charge was erroneous in minor respects, it effectively told the jury that McGuinn\u2019s Place was negligent if it found all of the elements outlined in <em>Anslinger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We also note that, at the argument on the motion for a new trial and at oral argument here, the parties raised the fact that no charge of <em>respondeat superior </em>had been given. Plaintiff even speculated that this may have been the reason for the jury\u2019s determination absolving McGuinn\u2019s Place. However, no request to charge such had ever been made and we prefer not to discuss that question on the merits. Nonetheless, we expect that the concept will be incorporated in the charge at the time of retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Geherty also claims that the trial judge erred in submitting the issue of proximate cause to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While a finding that defendant McGuinn\u2019s Place served Moore when it knew or should have known that he was intoxicated amounts to actionable negligence, the law requires that such negligence also be a proximate cause of the accident. <em>Rappaport, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 203, 156 A.2d 1; <em>Thompson, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 212, 523 A.2d 269. <em>See also Jensen v. Schooley\u2019s Mountain Inn, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 81-82, 522 A.2d 1043 (App.Div.1987), certif. den., <em>108 N.J. </em>181, 528 A.2d 11 (1987). Ordinarily, the question of proximate cause is left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>to the jury for a determination. <em>Rappaport, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 203, 156 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Contrary to plaintiffs assertions here, there was evidence to support a finding by the jury that the accident was not proximately caused by Moore\u2019s alleged intoxication but simply his negligent operation of the car. For example, Moore himself had insisted that the alcohol he had consumed did not influence his ability to drive at the time of the accident. Rather, he attributed the happening of the accident to his \u201cwide-angling\u201d in order to enter his driveway and the fact that the Geherty car was parked without lights in a spot that he did not expect. Moreover, the police indicated that Moore showed only some of the classical signs of impairment from the ingestion of alcoholic beverage. Thus, the issue of proximate cause was preeminently a question for the jury to determine and the trial judge did not err in submitting it to the jury. Parenthetically, we note that the jury never reached the issue of proximate cause in this case. <em>Cf. Allen v. Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>189, 195, 523 A.2d 262 (App.Div.1987), certif. den., 107 <em>N.J. </em>653, 527 A.2d 472 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Plaintiff also claims error regarding the trial judge\u2019s charge on foreseeability (although he apparently did not object to it below). The trial court charged the issue in classical terms. However, it went on to instruct that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">In this connection, you may consider that in current times, traveling by car to and from a tavern is commonplace, and you may consider that the effects of intoxication of a driver may reasonably be foreseen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Thus, it was made clear to the jury that foreseeability was not a serious issue in this case. Accordingly, if there was any deficiency, we see no harmful error. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. <em>Cf. Thompson, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>202, 523 A.2d 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">On its cross-appeal, McGuinn\u2019s Place argues that the jury\u2019s award of $80,000 in favor of plaintiff was clearly excessive. Generally, an award of damages is to be left to the sound discretion of the trier of fact, <em>Endress v. Brookdale Community College, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>109, 142, 364 A.2d 1080 (App.Div.1976), and such awards should be upset for excessiveness only in clear cases. <em>Fritsche v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>55 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>N.J. </em>322, 330, 261 A.2d 657 (1970). In <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 379 <em>A.</em>2d 225 (1977), our Supreme Court cautioned that, \u201c... a trial judge should not interfere with the quantum of damages assessed by a jury unless it is so disproportionate to the injury and resulting disability shown as to shock his conscience and to convince him that to sustain the award would be manifestly unjust.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596, 379 <em>A.</em>2d 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">There was conflicting evidence concerning the extent of plaintiffs injuries here. However, there was no evidence to dispute the contention that he now suffers <em>some </em>mental disability. Further, it was conceded that he had suffered <em>some </em>physical injuries and pain as a result of the accident. He produced evidence to indicate that he had to undergo extensive medical and chiropractic treatment and that he suffers from resultant permanent injuries. Both defendants emphasized the period of time between Geherty\u2019s visits to his various treating physicians and the fact that he has participated in some athletic activity. However, the jury apparently chose to place little weight on such evidence. Finally, the trial judge observed that the award did not shock his judicial conscience and further concluded that the jury had obviously accepted plaintiffs proofs concerning the extent of his injuries. In light of the conflicting evidence, we agree with his conclusions and likewise see no reason to disturb that portion of the verdict. <em>Baxter, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 379 A.2d 225 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In sum, we vacate the judgment in favor of McGuinn\u2019s Place and remand for a new trial on liability only as against it. Naturally that retrial will also implicate the crossclaims filed by both defendants in this case. <em>Greenberg v. Stanley, </em>30 <em>N.J. </em>485, 153 A.2d 833 (1959). However, we affirm the jury\u2019s award of $80,000 on the issue of damages. <em>Cf. Coll v. Sherry, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>166, 148 A.2d 481 (1959).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\"> We question whether such an extensive definition of the general principles of negligence was necessary in the circumstances of this case.

This was error necessitating a new trial as to McGuinn\u2019s Place\u2019s liability. <em>See Soronen v. Olde Milford Inn, Inc., </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>582, 593, 218 A.2d 630 (1966). The same error was included in the judge\u2019s instructions when he attempted, in recapitulation, to re-state the elements of the cause of action against McGuinn\u2019s Place. I find the charge to be otherwise correct and consistent with the principles announced in <em>Rappaport v. Nichols, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>188, 156 A.2d 1 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">If the patron is a minor or is intoxicated when served, the tavern keeper\u2019s sale to him is unlawful; and if the circumstances are such that the tavern keeper knows or should know that the patron is a minor or is intoxicated, his service to him may also constitute common law negligence. In view of the standard of conduct prescribed by the statute and the regulations, a tavern keeper\u2019s sale of alcoholic beverages when he knows or should know that the patron is a minor or intoxicated may readily be found by the jury to be imprudent conduct, [at 202-203, 156 <em>A.2d </em>1]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s attempt to rewrite <em>Rappaport </em>because it is beyond our authority. <em>But see Thompson v.
