His complaint demanded a jury trial. Defendant moved unsuccessfully to strike that demand. We granted defendant\u2019s motion for leave to appeal and now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We regard <em>Shaner v. Horizon Bancorp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>433, 561 A.2d 1130 (1989) to be controlling. <em>Shaner </em>found neither statutory authorization nor any constitutional requirement for jury trial of claims brought under the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-1 <em>et seq. </em>The Court based its holding on a number of considerations, including that an LAD action is \u201cmore in the nature of an equitable than a legal cause of action\u201d <em>(Shaner, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 441, 561 A.2d 1130), that the absence of any reference in the LAD to jury trial is \u201chighly indicative of legislative intent not to confer such a right\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 443, 561 A.2d 1130), that available relief under the LAD \u201cis predominantly equitable in nature\u201d and that LAD claims \u201cdo not supplant claims that might be cognizable by our courts in contract or tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 561 A.2d 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Those considerations are equally applicable here. CEPA makes no reference to jury trial at all. The relief available under CEPA, as set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-5, is predominantly equitable in nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">a. An injunction to restrain continued violation of this act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">b. The reinstatement of the employee to the same position held before the retaliatory action, or to an equivalent position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">c. The reinstatement of full fringe benefits and seniority rights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">d. The compensation for lost wages, benefits and other remuneration;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-13\">e. The payment by the employer of reasonable costs, and attorney\u2019s fees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-14\">f. Punitive damages; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-15\">g. An assessment of a civil fine of not more than $1,000.00 for the first violation of the act and not more than $5,000.00 for each subsequent violation, which shall be paid to the State Treasurer for deposit in the General Fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>And, as specifically provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8, CEPA does not supplant any common law causes of action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">Nothing in this act shall be deemed to diminish the rights, privileges, or remedies of any employee under any other federal or State law or regulation or under any collective bargaining agreement or employment contract; except that the institution of an action in accordance with this act shall be deemed a waiver of the rights and remedies available under any other contract, collective bargaining agreement, State law, rule or regulation or under the common law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\"><em>Shaner </em>also reasoned in part that the LAD judicial cause of action \u201caugments the administrative remedy\u201d <em>(Shaner, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 455, 561 A.2d 1130), that the Division of Civil Rights \u201cis empowered to invoke comprehensive remedies that are commensurate with the [LAD\u2019s] overarching purpose\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 438, 561 A.2d 1130) and that the relief available in LAD judicial actions \u201cis wholly comparable to and is at least as broad and far-reaching as that which is available in administrative actions under the LAD.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446, 561 A.2d 1130. The judicial cause of action provided by CEPA does not augment or parallel any administrative remedy. But that distinction does not render <em>Shaner </em>inapplicable. CEPA, like LAD, establishes a judicial cause of action, essentially equitable in nature, to vindicate wrongs suffered by individuals as a result of legislatively-proscribed acts. That statutory cause of action is separate and distinct from common law causes of action. <em>See Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 417 A.2d 505 (1980). The fact that no administrative procedure is established to enforce CEPA provides no rational basis for concluding that jury trial of CEPA claims is statutorily authorized or constitutionally required.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The order denying defendant\u2019s motion to strike the jury demand is reversed. The matter is remanded to the Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Division for all further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> We note the pendency in the State Senate of two bills (S-466 and S-2234) which would provide for jury trial of \"the validity of any claim\u201d under both CEPA and LAD; the statement attached to each bill asserts that \"[t]he reasoning of <em>Shaner </em>would also bar jury trials for an employee who brings a claim based on a violation of [CEPA].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b636-15\"> Earlier in the trial court proceedings defendant unsuccessfully moved to transfer the case to the Commissioner of Education; no motion for leave to appeal was made. Neither our consideration of the jury trial issue nor our remand to the Law Division should be construed as a determination that jurisdiction of this matter is properly in the Law Division.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
