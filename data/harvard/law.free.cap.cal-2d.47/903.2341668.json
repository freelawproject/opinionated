He was employed on the night shift, and it was customary for him on two or three occasions each night to take a three-wheeled motor scooter to deliver blueprints to the blueprint room, pick up other blueprints, and return them to the toolroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-9\">About 10:40 p.m. on December 11, 1954, he took the motor scooter, went to the blueprint room, picked up blueprints and while returning to the tool booth where he worked he \u201cstruck a bump\u201d in the road which threw him off the motor scooter. As a result of this fall he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>The commission found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-4\">First: The employee was inebriated at the time of the accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-5\">Second: The employee sustained injuries within the course of his employment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">Third: The evidence failed to establish that the employee\u2019s injuries were caused by his intoxication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-7\">This is the question presented for our determination: <em>Was there substantial evidence to sustain the second and third findings of the commission?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-8\"><em>Yes. </em>This conclusion is governed by these rules:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-9\">(1) When a finding of fact of the Industrial Accident Commission is attacked on the' ground that there is not any substantial evidence to sustain it, the power of an appellate court <em>begins </em>and <em>ends </em>with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the finding of fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-10\">The findings of the commission are not subject to review on this ground except insofar as they may have been made without any evidence whatever in their support. <em>(Ethel D. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>219 Cal. 699, 705 [5] [28 P.2d 919]; <em>Cadotte </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>86 Cal.App.2d 754, 757 [194 P.2d 563] ; <em>cf. Primm </em>v. <em>Primm, </em>46 Cal.2d 690, 693 [1] [299 P.2d 231].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-11\">(2) Where the employer or person in authority over a particular employee acquiesces in actions of the employee with knowledge of their character, a finding that the employee was within the scope and course of his employment at the time of an injury is sustained on the basis that the employer has impliedly authorized the employee\u2019s action. <em>(Jimeson </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>23 Cal.App.2d 634, 638 [73 P.2d 1238] ; <em>Department of Public Works </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>128 Cal.App. 128, 131 [16 P.2d 777]; <em>Joshua Hendy Iron Works </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>74 Cal.App.2d 191, 195 [5] [168 P.2d 203] ; <em>Pacific Emp. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Chavez, </em>5 Cal.2d 247, 252 [54 P.2d 701].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-12\">(3) The burden of proving that an injury to an employee arising out of and occurring in the course of his employment was caused by his intoxication rests with the employer asserting such as a matter of defense. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 5705, subd. (b).)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>Applying these rules to the instant ease, the record discloses ample evidence to sustain each of the questioned findings. For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-3\">\n<em>Second Finding</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-4\">Petitioners contend that the employee was injured while engaged in an act not within his assigned duties. It is true that there was evidence to this effect. However, there was uncontradieted evidence that the employee had been on the same job about six months, had regularly gone out on the scooter three or four times each night returning blueprints to the blueprint room and picking up others which he took back to the toolroom. The fact that the employee had performed these services was known to the \u201clead man,\u201d who had passively condoned and approved the practice. Therefore, under rule (2), <em>supra, </em>the record sustains this finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">\n<em>Third Finding</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-6\">Petitioners contend that since the commission found that the employee was inebriated at the time of the accident it necessarily follows that the proximate cause of the accident was his inebriation. This is a non sequitur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">The record discloses there was a conflict in the evidence relative to the employee\u2019s intoxication. Viewing, however, as we must in accordance with rule (1), <em>supra, </em>the evidence most favorable to sustaining the finding of the commission and disregarding conflicting evidence, the record reveals that prior to the accident on the evening in question the employee, during his lunch time (7:30 to 8 p.m.), consumed two or three bottles of beer with a sandwich. Two fellow workers- testified he was not at all intoxicated, that from his appearance there was no indication he had been drinking, and they noted no odor of alcohol about his person. In addition, the \u201clead man\u201d testified he noticed the employee and thought he had had a few drinks but was not going to bother him and left him alone. The employee himself testified that he never drank to the extent of reaching a drowsy stage and that he always quit if he felt drowsiness coming on. He further testified that he was thrown from the scooter when it struck a bump, and there is no evidence to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">In view of the foregoing evidence it is obvious that a question of fact as to whether or not the employer\u2019s defense that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>the inebriation was a proximate cause of the employee\u2019s accident was presented to the commission for its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">It is likewise evident that the evidence sustains the finding of the commission that even though the employee was inebriated at the time of his accident, the extent of such inebriation was not sufficient to impair his ability to ride a scooter and observe the ordinary hazards he might encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The evidence also supports the finding of the commission that the accident was caused, as the employee testified, by his striking a bump in the road rather than by his inebriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Therefore, petitioners failed to sustain the burden of proof resting upon them, and the finding of the commission is binding upon this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">The award is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Carter, J., Traynor, J., Schauer, J., and Spence, J. concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Petitioners\u2019 application for a rehearing was denied March 5, 1957.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-13\">Section 5705 of the Labor Code reads in part as follows: \u201cThe burden of proof rests upon the party holding the affirmative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>issue. The following are affirmative defenses, and the burden of proof rests upon the employer to establish them: . . . (b) Intoxication of an employee causing his injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
