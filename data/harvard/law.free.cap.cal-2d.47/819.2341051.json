(Pen. Code, \u00a7 245.) After a plea of not guilty, defendant waived a jury trial, and it was stipulated that the cause be submitted on the testimony taken at the preliminary hearing, with each side reserving the right to submit further evidence. Both sides introduced additional testimony and defendant testified in his own behalf. He was found guilty as charged. Following the denial of his application for probation and his motion for a new trial, defendant was sentenced to a term of six months in the county jail. He appeals from the judgment and from the order denying the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">Defendant\u2019s sole contention on this appeal is that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a new trial, which motion was based upon the ground of allegedly newly discovered evidence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1181, subd. 8.) After a review of the record, however, we have concluded that defendant\u2019s contention cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">The evidence shows that on the night of November 11, 1955, between 10 and 11 o\u2019clock, the complaining witness James, who operated a shoe shine stand on Central Avenue, in the city of Los Angeles, was struck on the head and arm with a shoe shine form. James and a bystander who saw the assault testified that defendant was the assailant. Defendant had previously owned the shoe shine stand, at which time James had asked for a job there but defendant had told James that he could not afford a helper.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Defendant denied the assault. He testified that he was at home asleep at the time of the alleged offense, and he produced two witnesses to support his alibi. Defendant also called William J. Hartwell, who testified that he was near the scene of the assault at the time it occurred, that he saw somebody run by him, but that defendant was not the man.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Upon this conflicting evidence, the trial court found defendant guilty. Defendant then moved for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1181, subd. 8.) That section provides: \u201cWhen a verdict has been rendered or a finding made against the defendant, the court may, upon his application, grant a new trial, in the following cases only: . . . 8. When new evidence is discovered material to the defendant, and which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In support of his motion for a new trial, defendant filed the affidavit of Hartwell, defendant\u2019s witness at the trial. In that affidavit Hartwell purported to confess that he himself had committed the assault on James, and stated that defendant was innocent and knew nothing of what happened that night because \u201che wasn\u2019t on the scene.\u201d At the time the motion was heard, the court observed at the outset: \u201cWell, the first thing I noticed was the affiant [Hartwell] stating that he told [defendant] about the situation either before the trial or possibly before the preliminary.\u201d The court then asked defendant\u2019s attorney how he could \u201csay it is newly discovered evidence if the defendant knew about it,\u201d and said attorney only answered: \u201cI heard rumbles about it.\u201d Defendant\u2019s attorney then stated that the first time he knew about Hartwell\u2019s affidavit was when he \u201cwas called by the probation officer,\u201d that he did not see it until he \u201ccame up here in court\u201d and that he had \u201cnothing further to add.\u201d The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The granting or denial of a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>46 Cal.2d 278, 282 [294 P.2d 29].)  It is also well settled that such motions are looked upon with disfavor <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yeager, </em>194 Cal. 452, 491 [229 P. 40] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mandell, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 806, 818 [120 P.2d 921]), and that an appellate court will not interfere except upon a clear showing of an abuse of discretion by the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGarry, </em>42 Cal.2d 429, 432-433 [267 P.2d 254]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gompertz, </em>103 Cal.App.2d 153, 163 [229 P.2d 105].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number> Facts that are within the knowledge of the defendant at the time of trial are not newly discovered even though he did not make them known to his counsel until later <em>(People </em>v. <em>English, </em>68 Cal.App.2d 670, 673 [157 P.2d 429]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Farber, </em>19 Cal.App.2d 189, 192 [64 P.2d 1138]); and it must appear that evidence, rather than merely its materiality, be newly discovered in order to support a motion for a new trial on that ground. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beard, supra, </em>p. 282; <em>People </em>v. <em>Urquidas, </em>96 Cal. 239, 242 [31 P. 52].)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">In the light of the foregoing rules it cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion in this case. It appears that if there were any truth in Hartwell\u2019s affidavit concerning his guilt, defendant knew of this \u201csituation\u201d prior to the trial. Nevertheless, defendant used Hartwell as a witness and remained silent while Hartwell gave testimony purporting to implicate some unidentified third person. At the hearing on the motion for a new trial neither defendant nor his attorney presented any affidavit to show that they did not previously know the facts which they now claim to be the true facts. While defendant\u2019s attorney may not have known of the actual existence of Hartwell\u2019s purported confession in affidavit form until after the trial, he admittedly had previously \u201cheard rumbles about it [the confession].\u201d  Knowledge of the facts themselves, rather than knowledge of the precise manner of their recital, is the important factor in determining whether the evidence subsequently presented is evidence which defendant \u201ccould not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1181, subd. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Defendant\u2019s position is not fortified by, his reliance on <em>People </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>14 Cal.App.2d 513 [58 P.2d 970], While there the motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence also involved the presentation of an affidavit of confession, these further factors were present: At the hearing and after seeing the confessing affiant, the complaining witness expressed \u201cdoubt\u201d as to his previous identification of one of the convicted defendants as his assailant; and the deputy district attorney thereupon stated that \u201cin view of the inherent weakness in identification of the original case\u201d and \u201cthe newly discovered evidence,\u201d he would withdraw opposition to the motion for a new trial. (P. 516.)  In contrast here, defendant, the alleged assailant, was unequivocally identified by James, the victim, and by another witness who was present at the scene. The credibility of James\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>identification was strengthened by the fact that some months prior to the assault he had unsuccessfully applied to defendant, the previous owner of the shoe shine stand, for work and thus had previously known the defendant. The trial court, having heard this positive testimony as to identification and having observed Hartwell when he testified, had ample opportunity to gauge the reliability of the opposing witnesses. Moreover, in support of the motion for a new trial in the Shepherd case, the convicted defendants filed affidavits stating that they did not know any of the facts contained in the confessing affiant\u2019s affidavit until after their conviction. Here no such affidavit was produced by defendant, and the above-mentioned colloquy between the court and defendant\u2019s attorney indicated that defendant, and perhaps his counsel, were aware of the Hartwell \u201csituation\u201d prior to the termination of the trial. Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s denial of a new trial does not appear to have been an abuse of discretion and its order will not be disturbed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sing Yow, </em>145 Cal. 1, 4-5 [78 P. 235].)</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Gibson, C.
