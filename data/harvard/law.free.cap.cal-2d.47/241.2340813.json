For convenience, we will refer to plaintiffs-appellants as if they were the original lessors and to defendants-respondents as if they were the original lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The provision of the lease under which lessors seek recovery reads as follows: \u201cif Lessee shall bring any action for any relief against Lessors, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of this lease, and Lessors shall prevail in such action, Lessee agrees to pay Lessors a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee which shall be taxed as part of the costs of such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">Lessors prevailed in the earlier action but they did not in that action secure an award of attorneys\u2019 fees. In such prior action lessors (defendants there) set up a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees as a so-called affirmative defense; at the close of the first trial of the prior action lessors were allowed attorneys\u2019 fees as if they were costs, but on lessee\u2019s motion to tax costs the item for attorneys\u2019 fees was stricken; on the second trial of the prior action lessors, so far as their complaint discloses, over the objection of opposing counsel and without the consent of the court, announced their intention of \u201crequesting this court to proceed in a separate proceeding to, if necessary, hear evidence as to the amount of any attorneys\u2019 fees which should be allowed, or to seek the recovery of that by way of an independent action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">We have concluded that the contract (lease) upon any reasonable construction requires that attorneys\u2019 fees be recovered, if at all, as if they were costs in the prior action. In this connection it is to be observed that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in this action does not allege, and plaintiffs do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>claim, that there is available to them extrinsic evidence which would permit construction of the contract other than according to the normal meaning of its language.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u2022 The- complaint, with the proposed amendment, alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\"><em>The </em>Lease: A photostatie copy of the lease is attached to and made a part of the complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The following provisions of the lease relate to this controversy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">\u2022\u25a0'Lessors agree to furnish janitor service. \u201cNo additional locks shall be placed upon any doors of the premises . . .\u201d ' \u201cLessors shall be in no wise responsible for any loss of or damage to property from the leased premises, however occurring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">\u201cIn case Lessors shall bring suit to recover any rent due hereunder or for breach of any covenant of this lease, or to recover possession of the premises, and shall recover in the suit, or if Lessee shall bring any action for any relief against Lessors, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of this lease, and Lessors shall prevail in such action, Lessee agrees to pay Lessors a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee which shall be taxed as part of the costs of such action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-9\"><em>The Facts Concerning the Prior Action by </em>Lessee: The complaint in the prior action alleged: The premises were leased with the provision that lessee place no additional locks upon the doors. Lessee \u201centrusted\u201d the leased premises and their contents to lessors except when the premises were open for business. Lessors permitted their agents to have keys to the premises. Using these keys the agents wrongfully entered the premises and converted goods of lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Issues were joined by answer of lessors. As a \u201cninth affirmative defense\u201d the answer alleged that the lease contained the above quoted paragraph as to attorneys\u2019 fees and that $7,500 was a reasonable fee for the defense of the action. The answer prayed for recovery of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">In the prior action lessee claimed that lessors\u2019 liability arose out of the landlord-tenant relationship and \u201crelied upon the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">\u201c1. The fact that the lease prohibited the tenants from providing additional locks to their doors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">\u201c2. That under the terms of the lease, the landlord retained keys to the tenant\u2019s premises and such keys were used in,the theft of the tenant\u2019s property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201c3. The duty of a landlord, upon a lease being made, to secure the tenant in the quiet enjoyment of the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201c4. An implied term of the lease that the landlord did not permit the use of keys retained by her to be used in the theft of the tenant\u2019s property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The first trial of the prior action resulted in a judgment of nonsuit. Lessors included in their memorandum of costs and disbursements an item of $7,500 for attorneys\u2019 fees. On lessee\u2019s motion to tax costs that item was stricken. Lessee appealed from the judgment of nonsuit and lessors appealed from the order striking the item for attorneys\u2019 fees. The District Court of Appeal <em>(Maron </em>v. <em>Swig </em>(1952), 115 Cal.App.2d 87, 92 [251 P.2d 770]) reversed the judgment of non-suit; it determined that, because of such reversal, the order granting the motion to tax costs was moot; therefore, it dismissed lessors\u2019 appeal from such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">A second trial of the prior action was had before a jury. Before the matter was submitted to the jury the following occurred in chambers: Lessors\u2019 counsel said, \u201cwe are mindful of this affirmative defense. We are not to be considered as waiving it but have chosen to await the action of the jury in this case either for the purpose of then requesting this court to proceed in a separate proceeding to, if necessary, hear evidence as to the amount of any attorneys\u2019 fees which should be allowed, or to seek the recovery of that by way of an independent action.\u201d Lessee\u2019s counsel replied, \u2018'\u2022\u2018We don\u2019t consent to this procedure. I just want to make it clear that we are not consenting to such a procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">No evidence on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees was offered at the second trial in the prior action, and the question of recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees by lessors was not referred to before the jury. It is alleged that the \u201caffirmative defense\u201d was \u201cin fact withdrawn by . . . [lessors] at the trial of said case.\u201d But there is no allegation whether the trial court made any ruling as to the above quoted (and pleaded) colloquy of counsel, and no allegation as to whether attorneys\u2019 fees were included in lessors\u2019 memorandum of costs at the conclusion of the second trial of the prior action.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The second judgment in the prior action makes no mention of the subject of attorneys\u2019 fees. It is in the usual form of a judgment on a verdict for defendant. Such verdict and judgment in the prior action were for lessors (defendants there). Judgment became final without appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The complaint in the present action further alleges: Lessors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>paid $24,250 attorneys\u2019 fees for defense of the prior action. That is a reasonable sum for the professional services rendered. Under date of \u201cJanuary \u2014, 1955,\u201d lessors made written demand upon lessee for such sum. The complaint shows that January, 1955, was after the judgment in the prior action became final. Lessee has not paid or offered to pay the sum or any part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><em>The Nature of Attorneys\u2019 Fees Recoverable Only by Virtue of Contract: </em>The texts accept the view of those cases which characterize attorneys\u2019 fees recoverable only by virtue of contract (and not as costs either by statute or by case law) as \u201cdamages.\u201d (13 Cal.Jur.2d, Costs, \u00a7 36; 14 Cal.Jur.2d, Damages, \u00a7104; 3 Within, California Procedure (1954), pp. 1914-1915.) Such fees cannot be allowed a successful litigant without pleading and proof (or admission) that there is a contract provision for them. This is so whether the successful party is plaintiff <em>(Brooks </em>v. <em>Forington </em>(1897), 117 Cal. 219, 221 [48 P. 1073] ; <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Grady </em>(1891), 91 Cal. 518, 522 [27 P. 755]; <em>Stubblefield </em>v. <em>Fickle </em>(1954), 123 Cal.App.2d 325, 327 [266 P.2d 808]) or defendant <em>(Techow </em>v. <em>Pollack </em>(1952), 111 Cal.App.2d 556, 558 [244 P.2d 915] ; <em>City Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Pringle </em>(1920), 49 Cal.App. 353, 355 [193 P. 504]).  But attorneys\u2019 fees are not like the usual item of damages, for the court may allow a reasonable attorneys\u2019 fee in the judgment without hearing evidence or making a finding as to the amount of such fee. (See <em>Huber </em>v. <em>Shedoudy </em>(1919), 180 Cal. 311, 313-314 [181 P. 63]; <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Shapona </em>(1954), 123 Cal.App.2d 451, 463-464 [267 P.2d 378]; <em>Pehau </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1952), 112 Cal.App.2d 90, 97 [245 P.2d 692].)</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">It is particularly to be observed that where attorneys\u2019 fees are allowable solely by virtue of contract they <em>cannot </em>be recovered by merely including them in the memorandum of costs <em>(City Investment Co. </em>v. <em>Pringle </em>(1920), <em>supra, </em>49 Cal.App. 353, 355.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, lessors, in the prior action, properly set up their claim for attorneys\u2019 fees before it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>could be known whether there would occur an essential fact (lessors\u2019 prevailing in the prior action) which would give rise to a duty of lessee to pay attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\"><em>The Meaning of the Lease Provision as to Attorneys\u2019 Fees: </em>Lessors argue that despite the provision of the lease that the fees \u201cshall be taxed as costs in such [prior] action,\u201d they can recover such fees in this independent action. In support of this argument lessors cite <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palermo </em>(1954), 124 Cal.App.2d 353 [268 P.2d 799] (hearing denied). That case allows recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees, in a separate action, under the following provision of a lease: \u201cIf either party shall commence any legal proceedings against the other for relief because of any default by the other because of failure to perform any term, covenant or condition of this lease and shall prevail in said action, the party who has commenced and prevailed in said legal proceeding shall recover, in addition, to all court costs a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to be fixed by the Court\u201d (pp. 354-355 of 124 Cal.App.2d). Lessor recovered judgment in unlawful detainer and under a writ of restitution took possession of the leased premises. Lessee appealed and the judgment was reversed. In a subsequent action brought by lessee, lessee recovered attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in prosecution of the appeal. The District Court of Appeal upheld the trial court\u2019s determination that the lessor\u2019s taking possession under the writ of restitution was a default within the meaning of the above quoted provision concerning attorneys\u2019 fees and the lessee\u2019s taking of an appeal was the commencement of legal proceedings for relief because of such default. Adopting the opinion of the trial court, the District Court of Appeal said (pp. 364-365 of 124 Cal.App.2d), \u201cIt has . . . been argued on behalf of Defendant Palermo [lessor] that the attorney\u2019s fee clause in the lease by its very terms requires that the attorney\u2019s fees must be recovered in the same proceeding in which relief is sought for a default. . . . [This argument] seem[s] to be a severe application of the theory of strict construction. In fairness the most that can be drawn from the language of this clause is that the parties contemplated such a procedure would be followed. It should be apparent that the attorney\u2019s fee clause creates a right to recover attorney\u2019s fees under certain circumstances and also describes a remedial procedure. The words of the clause do not designate this to be the solitary and exclusive remedy for the enforcement of this contractual right. If the attorney\u2019s fee clause were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>to be so construed then the result would be that under some circumstances a party would have a right without a remedy. The practical result of such a construction would be a partial invalidity of the attorney\u2019s fee clause. For these reasons this does not seem to be a proper case for the application of the rule \u2018 expressio unius est exelusio alterius.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Lessors urge that here, as in <em>Stockton Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Palermo </em>(1954), <em>supra, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 353, there would be no way for them to recover their attorneys\u2019 fees in the prior action.  It is lessor\u2019s position that when the litigation concluded in their favor in the trial court they could only present evidence of services which had been rendered up to that <em>time; they </em>could <em>not </em>anticipate whether there would be an appeal and what attorneys\u2019 services would be required if there were. There is no such practical difficulty, for when costs are awarded on appeal, the memorandum of costs on appeal is filed and taxed in the trial court (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1034), and if a party is entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal, they can be determined by trial court when it determines the costs on appeal. (See <em>Cirimele </em>v. <em>Shinazy </em>(1954), 124 Cal.App.2d 46, 53 [268 P.2d 210] ; <em>Oakland, Calif. Towel Co. </em>v. <em>Roland </em>(1949), 93 Cal.App.2d 713, 718-719 [209 P.2d 854].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The only \u201creasonable attorney\u2019s fee\u201d which lessee agreed to pay was one \u201cwhich shall be taxed as part of the costs of such [prior] action\u201d; the extent of lessors\u2019 right and lessee\u2019s duty is measured by the terms of their agreement; the agreement manifestly contemplates that the fees should have been recovered in the litigation as to which they were incurred. This conclusion is strengthened by the consideration that the photostatic copy of the lease attached to the complaint shows that it was prepared by lessors and, therefore, should be construed against them. (See <em>Basin Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Baash-Ross Tool Co. </em>(1954), 125 Cal.App.2d 578, 595 [271 P.2d 122].)  It is, of course, to be presumed that plaintiffs have stated their case as favorably to themselves as the facts permit. <em>(Faulkner </em>v. <em>California Toll Bridge Authority </em>(1953), 40 Cal.2d 317, 328 [6] [253 P.2d 659].)</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\"><em>Other Contentions: </em>Lessee argues that it appears on the face of the complaint that the question of attorneys\u2019 fees was res judicata in the prior action and that this action is therefore barred. Lessee further argues that lessors have no right to attorneys\u2019 fees under the lease because the prior action was in tort for conversion and therefore, on lessee\u2019s view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>was not an \u201caction for any relief against Lessors . . . arising out of this lease.\u201d In view of our conclusion that the lease requires that attorneys\u2019 fees be recovered, if at all, by proceeding as if they were costs in the action in which they were incurred, it is unnecessary to discuss lessee\u2019s other arguments above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Plaintiffs purport to appeal from orders denying them leave to file the amendment to the complaint and denying their motion for reconsideration of the sustaining of the demurrer without leave to amend. These orders were made before judgment and are not appealable. The attempted appeals therefrom are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">For the reasons above stated, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Gibson, C. J., Shenk, J., Carter, J., Traynor, J., Spence, J., and McComb, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-14\">Upon its face this photostat shows that the lease was made on a printed form prepared by lessors. The lease provisions quoted herein are printed provisions of the form.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">In <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Shapona </em>(1954), <em>supra, </em>123 Cal.App.2d 451, 454, 463, the contract provided for \u201ca reasonable attorney\u2019s fee which shall be fixed by the court as a part of the costs.\u201d Apparently the contractual provision was pleaded and proved. The trial court first allowed the fee in the main part of the judgment, then amended the judgment to direct that the fee be a part of the costs. The appellate court held that this procedure was proper, but reversed on other grounds. The Wagner ease need not be taken as authority as to what is proper procedure where attorneys\u2019 fees are allowable by contract, since the eases on which it relies are eases where such fees were allowable by statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
