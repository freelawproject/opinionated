The evidence is that Larson\u2019s house, a 16-room house used for rooming purposes, was carried away by a slide caused by a volume of water; that the house was carried down some 50 feet below a trestle and was buried in water and mud; and that Larson was drawn under a pile of lumber when he tried to get out of the wreck. 'Without objection a detailed itemized bill of particulars showing kinds and values of property \u201cclaimed * * * to have been destroyed\u201d was admitted in evidence. Larson testified that it was a correct list and contained valuation of each article. The property consisted of household furniture, some jewelry, musical instruments, and $220 in cash. No cross-examination as to the values was had, and the defendant below introduced no evidence upon that point, and requested no instructions as to proof of value or damage to the personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We hold that there was enough evidence to submit to the jury, and that they could infer therefrom that the property enumerated in the bill of particulars was destroyed and damaged to the extent included in the lists in evidence, and that the court was correct in ruling accordingly.
