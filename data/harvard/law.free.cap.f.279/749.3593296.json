It is enough that the boat went where she did at respondent\u2019s invitation, by respondent\u2019s orders, and for respondent\u2019s service, and that respondent knew of the danger which produced injury, and negligently failed to guard against the plainly probable consequences of obedience to its own orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">Decree affirmed, with interest and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
