Supp. 1919, \u00a7 6287g). \u201cDeck,\u201d in the language of this traffic, means a small quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The second count charged that the sale was made not in pursuance of a written order as required by section 2 of the Act of December 17, 1914 (Comp. St. \u00a7 6287b). It is not disputed that the evidence showed an unlawful sale on November 9, 1920, by Saracina to Napolitano in the absence of Parisi, and the principal question, calling for consideration, is whether certain testimony as to conversations and occurrences on November 10th, were admissible against Parisi as a principal. The testimony may be briefly summarized:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">On the night of November 9, 1920, Napolitano met Saracina and a man known as Frank in Madison street, New York City. Pacetta, a revenue agent, with whom Napolitano was co-operating, remained a short distance away to watch what would happen. Napolitano told Saracina and Frank that he \u201cwanted to buy some dope,\u201d and they said they would sell him some. Napolitano asked for samples, as Saracina and Frank did not have the drugs with them. Thereupon Frank left, and soon entered the premises 35 Madison street, which was defendant Parisi\u2019s home at the time. While Frank was thus absent, Saracina remained with Napolitano. On Frank\u2019s return, he gave Napolitano three \u201cdecks,\u201d one each of morphine, heroin, and cocaine, for which the latter then paid Saracina $3. Arrangements were then made to buy a pound of each drug the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">Napolitano, while observed by Pacetta and other government agents, met Saracina and Frank the next morning, November 10th. They told Napolitano to \u201ccome up to the house and you will get the stuff.\u201d This Napolitano declined to do, whereupon Saracina told Napolitano to wait with Frank until he (Saracina) saw \u201cthe boss.\u201d Saracina then went away, and, returning in about ten minutes, said, \u201cThe boss don\u2019t want to deliver it; if you want it, come over there and get it.\u201d Napolitano then left the two men and joined the revenue agents. Napolitano then returned to Madison street, followed <em>by </em>Pacetta some distance behind. There Napolitano was approached by Parisi, who inquired if he liked the samples \u201cthat Frank and Saracina give you,\u201d and, when answered by Napolitano in the affirmative, Parisi said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">\u201cI am the boss: those fellows are nothing. * * * If you like the stuff, come with me to No. 35 Madison street, and I will show you the stuff.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-11\">Napolitano and Parisi then went to the latter\u2019s home in 35 Madison street, where Parisi exhibited a large amount-of narcotics. He weighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>out a pound of each drug, taking the drugs from bottles, contained in valises and suit cases. After the weighing, Parisi said that there were 48 ounces of \u201cstuff,\u201d which would cost $1,344, and thereupon Napolitano, who had previously told Parisi that he did not have the money with him, said he would be back about a quarter of 4 in the afternoon. Parisi said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\">\u201cIf I am here when yon c-ome back, give me the money; and if I am not hero, give the money to my wife; but I will make sure I am here when you got back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Parisi then told Napolitano, if he wanted more, to write \u201cmacaroni\u201d for morphine, \u201ccheese\u201d for cocaine, and \u201coil\u201d for heroin, and as he said this he wrote in a small memorandum book. About 5 p. m. of the same day, Pacetta, accompanied with several revenue agents and police officers, examined Parisi\u2019s premises, and found a large quantity of morphine, cocaine, and heroin, as well as some smoking opium, with a weighing scale and a complete set of avoirdupois and metric weights. On Parisi\u2019s person was a memorandum book, which he admitted was his, and that the writing in it was his. It contained the words \u201ccheese,\u201d \u201cmacaroni,\u201d and \u201coil,\u201d with the letters \u201cc,\u201d \u201ch,\u201d and \u201cm\u201d written over these words, presumably meaning cocaine, heroin, and morphine.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Defendant took the stand and denied the essential features of the testimony against him, swore he knew nothing about the drugs found on his premises, and attempted to account for them by intimating that it was the property of an elusive boarder, who was never seen after November 10th. Other witnesses were examined on behalf of the prosecution and of the defendant. If the testimony as to the admissions of Parisi on November 10th and the finding of the drugs on his premises was admissible, then the case was obviously one for the jury. Saracina and Parisi were convicted. Frank has disappeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> The theory of the prosecution was that Parisi was a principal in that he had abetted, aided, etc., Saracina and Frank in making the unlawful sale on November 9th. Criminal Code, U. S. \u00a7 332 (Comp. St. \u00a7 10506); Ruthenberg v. United States, 245 U. S. 480, 38 Sup. Ct. 168, 62 L. Ed. 414; Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, 254 U. S. 189, 192, 41 Sup. Ct. 98, 65 L. Ed. 214; Dean v. United States, 246 Fed. 568, 574, 158 C. C. A. 538. That it is not necessary that one who aids and abets the commission of a crime need be present when the crime is committed is no longer arguable. Vane v. United States, 254 Fed. 32, 165 C. C. A. 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> The testimony as to the conversations and events of November 10th was adduced,- not for the purpose of proving the commission of a crime on November 10th, but to show that Parisi w\u00e1s a party to the sale by Saracina and Frank the night before. That admissions or confessions made after the commission of a crime are admissible in evidence, when properly obtained, is too elementary for discussion. So, also, the finding later in defendant\u2019s possession of a quantity of drugs of the* same kind as previously sold is a fact which, with other facts, was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Parisi\u2019s inquiry as to whether Napolitano liked the samples given to him by Saracina and Frank, and his statement that he was \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>boss\u201d and the others were \u201cnothing,\u201d and all the other circumstances showing the connection between him and the sellers, Saracina and Frank, were facts properly submitted to the jury, from which it cquld determine whether or not Parisi had aided in the sale of November 9th, and had thus become a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><bracketnum>[5]</bracketnum> When the prosecution produced testimony that Parisi was \u201cthe boss,\u201d and Saracina and Frank merely his agents, their acts and declarations were binding on Parisi. St. Clair v. United States, 154 U. S. 134, 149, 14 Sup. Ct. 1002, 38 L. Ed. 936; Wiborg v. United States, 163 U. S. 632, 657, 658, 16 Sup. Ct. 1127, 1197, 41 L. Ed. 289; Pennachio v. United States (C. C. A.) 263 Fed. 66, 67. There was thus' no error in the admission against Parisi of the testimony now attacked, and the case was properly sent to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
