On the trial the court directed a verdict of not guilty on- the third count at the conclusion of the government\u2019s evidence. At the close of all of the testimony, the defendant moved for the direction of a verdict of not guilty on the remaining counts, which was overruled. The jury found the defendant guilty on the second count of the indictment only; that is, for making and fermenting a certain mash, wort, or wash elsewhere than at a' duly authorized distillery. The defendant prosecutes this writ of error to reverse the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The several assignments of error need not be separately considered. They really present only the insistence that the court should have directed a verdict of acquittal on defendant\u2019s motion. We think the court erred in not so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">The defendant was acquitted of every charge made, except that of unlawfully making and fermenting a certain mash, wort, or wash fit for the production of distilled spirits. The evidence as to what the defendant had made was that a barrel with a certain quantity of syrup skimmings was found in his possession, alongside of a furnace in which the defendant had been making syrup. There was no dispute that he had been boiling syrup, and a quantity of it was on hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">There was no evidence that the skimmings were other than the usual skimmings which always are made in the manufacture of cane syrup. They were located where skimmings so produced would naturally have been. There was no evidence of any distilling apparatus being on the premises. No worm or pipes were found on the premises, and such articles as were found were quite useful for other purposes, and were useless, taken by themselves, for the production of distilled spirits.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">It is contended by counsel for the defendant that mash, wort, and wash have a settled meaning, and do not include cane skimmings. Without going into this ^discussion, the statute declares, and the indictment charges, the making and fermenting of mash, wort, or wash fit for the production of distilled spirits as the thing prohibited. There is no evidence upon which a finding could be had that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>made any fermented skimmings, or that the skimmings were not merely the residuum lawfully remaining from the conversion of sugar cane into syrup.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed, with directions to grant a new trial in said case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
