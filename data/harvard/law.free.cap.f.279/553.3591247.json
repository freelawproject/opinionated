Ino., the charterer of Sjurso, and awarded libelant $6,053.01 against charterer\u2019s estate in bankruptcy. Tlie amended libel alleged that the master of the Sjurso engaged libelant to perform stevedoring services, and that such services were performed between June 8 and July 10,1919. This allegation was vigorously denied, and the facts support the denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-14\">The Sjurso was a Norwegian bark, and one of the sailing vessels employed by the ITnlied States Shipping Board under the Norwegian sailing vessel agreement, by which this class of tonnage was brought into Allied service during the war. The Shipping Board had power to compel the chartering of the vessel to their nominee, and did compel the owner\u2019s agent in New York, S. O. Stray &amp; Co., Inc. (hereinafter called Stray), to charter the Sjurso on the standard net form charter (under which charterer must pay for stevedoring) to Caravel Steamship Lines, Inc., now bankrupt, although Stray protested that Caravel was not a responsible charterer. The Sjurso was in.Philadelphia when the charter was signed, May 3, 1919, and Stray, in its anxiety to protect the owners, procured from the Caravel Lines a bond securing the payment of tlie charter freight. This was the utmost they could obtain. A copy of the charter party was furnished to the master, and Stray kept him fully advised by correspondence. As soon as he reached New York, the master called on Stray, and almost daily thereafter. The master was thoroughly informed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number><em>to </em>Stray\u2019s opinion of Caravel, and knew that Caravel, under this form of charter party, must be kept responsible for all expenses, including stevedoring. Mr. Thavenot, the secretary and treasurer of Stray, had almost daily conferences with Johnson, the master of the Sjurso, and Johnson never consulted Thavenot as to making any agreement with libelant, nor did he ever mention having been approached by it with a request that the vessel should stand good for the stevedoring. It was well known throughout the stevedoring business in this port that the great number of Norwegian sailing vessels loading here all came under the Norwegian sailing vessel agreement and were fixed on standard net form charter parties.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b573-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>&lt;@nrp\u00a3\u2019or oilier oases see same topic <em>&amp; </em>KEY-NU.MBEIl in all Key-Numbered Digests <em>&amp; </em>Indexes</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Libelant was employed by the officers of Caravel Steamship Lines, Inc., the charterers, to furnish stevedoring and similar services to the Sjurso. The president and general manager of libelant had known these officers for two years, knew they were of no financial standing, had no confidence, financially, in the- Caravel Lines and knew that it owned no ships. He claims that, when he went on board the Sjurso to arrange for the discharge of ballast, he told Capt. Johnson that the Caravel Lines were not financially responsible; that the master thereupon agreed that Caravel Lines were his owner\u2019s agents, never suggested that-they were the charterers of the ship, never mentioned that the owner had the well-known firm of Stray as his agent in this port, and, as soon as reference was made to the irresponsibility of Caravel Lines, said that the ship was responsible, and that he would see that the bills were. paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">The.master denied absolutely that he had been approached by libelant\u2019s president on this subject, or that he had given any assurance whatever as to the payment of the stevedore\u2019s bill. Libelant\u2019s workmen performed services as stevedores, discharging ballast and loading, stowing, and trimming cargo, keeping a lighter on demurrage, and through a subcontracting corporation, watching, tallying, and coopering.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b574-6\">Frederick W.

The District Judge, confronted with the necessity of determining whether the president of libelant ,or the master of the Sjurso had given the correct version as to the circumstances in which the stevedoring was undertaken did not flatly decide the question of credibility, although he plainly intimated that he accepted the master\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">As this appeal is a new trial, it becomes our duty, at the threshold of the case to ascertain what the fact was in respect of 'the stevedoring engagement; for, if we find that libelant has failed to sustain the burdeii of proof as to the making of. the alleged agreement, discussion of the points of law argued at bar will become academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">The testimony of the master was taken by deposition at Norfolk on September 14, 1920, before any other witness was heard. It shows that he was an experienced man, with 23 years\u2019 sea service. He had with him on board his vessel in May and June, 1919, a copy of the charter, dated May 3, 1919, between Stray, as agent, and the Caravel Dines. In answer to a series of questions, he stated in positive language that he had never engaged libelant to- do the stevedoring, and had never been informed that libel\u00e1nt\u2019s services were rendered on the vessel\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Thavenot, whose office was at 11 Broadway, testified that under the charter party the charterers were responsible for all expense in loading and discharging the vessel, and that the master had a copy of the charier. He informed the master o\u00a3 his opinion of the charterer and the master \u201cadopted a very cautious attitude towards the charterers.\u201d The Christianssands Shipping Company of Norway, owner of the Sjnrso, had a credit with Stray, which was \u201cpractically unlimited on ail their ships,\u201d and Stray was in sound financial condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Thavenot knew libelant and its president about January, 1919, and some time after that received a letter from libelant asking for Stray\u2019s business, but that was all. Thavenot told the master to be very careful, because all that Stray \u201chad there was the payment of freight.\u201d Stray had another and responsible charterer waiting, and that fact the master knew. The president of libelant testified, in open court, on October 29, 1920. He stated that he told the master that;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cWe liad quoted the agents of the vessel the prices, and came up to confirm it with him, to see if it was O. K. to go ahead and do the work, as we knew the Caravel * * were \u25a0 not financially responsible. * * * He [Johnson] seemed to think they were all right; that they would pay the bill and the ship would be responsible for it. * *\u2022 \u2022 He said to send the bill to the Caravel Company, and he would see the bills in the Caravel office, and see that they were paid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">He further testified that the master said that the Caravel concern \u201cwere his agents.\u201d The bills were delivered by libelant to the Caravel office. The first time there was any question with the master was after the vessel was loaded, when meeting him in Broad street, he told libel-ant\u2019s president that he was not going to pay the bills, and had been advised he was not responsible for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Every probability and surrounding circumstance confirm the master\u2019s testimony. There was not the slightest reason why he should pledge the credit of the ship and every reason to the contrary. It seems incredible that he should have told libelant\u2019s president that Caravel Tines was his agent, when Stray was his agent, or rather his owner\u2019s agent, and when Stray had an office in New York, and was in funds, and when he had been warned by Thavenot, Stray\u2019s secretary and treasurer, against the charterer. He knew that the charter was net form, under which Caravel Tines had to hire the stevedores and see that their bills were paid. In such circumstances, it would have been strange, to say the least, if he had hired the stevedores and pledged the credit of the ship, without consulting the owner\u2019s agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">Further discussion of the facts seems unnecessary. It is enough to state that on the facts we have no doubt that libelant has failed to prove the agreement alleged to have been made by the master, and that conclusion disposes of the case. .Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., 254 U. S. 1, 12, 41 Sup. Ct. 1, 65 L. Ed. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Decree affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
