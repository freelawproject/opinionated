Some time after that deposit was made, and notice of it was given to the appellee, in a suit in a Louisiana state court by one Bartee against the appellant, in which a writ of attachment was issued, the Citizens\u2019 Bank &amp; Trust Company was cited as a garnishee to declare on oath what property belonging to the appellant it had in its possession, and in what sum it was indebted to the appellant. The answer of the garnishee showed that it held $12,500 under a deposit made in pursuance of the above set out provision of the contract. The suit in which the garnishment issued was withdrawn. The $12,500 has remained in the bank, subject to be paid as provided in the contract. Appellee did not furnish any abstract showing the 600 acres to be deeded without a warranty. The only abstract it furnished was one showing titles down to 1913. Before the above-mentioned garnishment was issued, appellant placed $500 in the hands of his attorney, and that attorney prepared a deed to the land called for by the contract, and the deed of trust and notes to be executed by the appellant, and notified the appellee that appellant was ready and willing to comply with the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-5\">On July 24, 1919, appellee, by its president, sent to the appellant a letter of which, except the address and signature, the following is a copy: \u201cI called at the Citizens\u2019 Bank, this city, to-day, with the deed, and as per agreement entered into between yourself and the Gulf Coast Orchard <em>&amp; </em>Products Company, of which the writer is president, and was advised by Mr. Chas. Th\u00e9ard, the president of the Citizens\u2019 Bank &amp; Trust Company, that the funds deposited by you ($12,500) in escrow had been seized by the civil sheriff for the parish of Orleans in a suit of J. Julian Bartee, receiver for the Great American Oil Company v. Yourself et al.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-6\">On August 25,' 1919, appellee\u2019s lawyers sent to the appellant a letter, of which, except the address and signature, the following is a copy: \u201cMr. Thomas Kracke, president of the Gulf Coast Orchard &amp; Products Company, has called upon us with regard to the transaction he had with you concerning the sale to you of certain lands in Jackson county, Miss., consisting of approximately ten thousand acres. It is now over one month since he gave you notice by registered mail of the seizure of the deposit of twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) made by you with the Citizens\u2019 Bank &amp; Trust Company, of New Orleans, and he waited on you this length of time in order to give you an opportunity to replace this money, and since you have not done so, and have not carried out the contract to purchase these lands- and pay as per agreement, he now calls upon us in behalf of his company and asks that we give you notice, putting you in default and notifying you herewith that he considers the transaction closed with you, and will withdraw from the said Citizens\u2019 Bank &amp; Trust Company all deeds and other papers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-7\">T. W. Kracke, appellee\u2019s president, testified to the following effect: That he called at the Citizens\u2019 Bank &amp; Trust Company on July 24, 1919, and presented a deed to that bank, and that the president, Mr. C. Th\u00e9ard. and Mr. St. Raymond, both stated that there were no documents, trust deed or notes, to be taken up there, and that there were no funds in the bank at that time; that he did not leave with the bank the deed he had, because there were no funds there, the funds having been garnisheed or attached. The just-inentioned testimony was in conflict with that of Charles Th\u00e9ard and Charles St- Raymond, each of whom testified that appellee never presented to the bank any deed as provided for in the contract, and that the $12,500 from the time it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>was deposited remained in the bank, subject to be applied as provided in the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-4\">By the decree appealed from the $12,500 deposited in' the Citizens\u2019 Bank &amp; Trust Company was adjudged to ho the property of the appellant, and the bill was dismissed without prejudice.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-5\">W.

The action of the court in refusing to decree specific performance of the contract is sought to be sustained on the following grounds: (1) That the contract did not sufficiently describe the land which was the subject of it. (2) That appellant did not make the deposit of $12,S00 at the time specified in the contract. (3) That the appellant failed to deposit the additional $500 and the notes and deed of trust at the time he deposited the $12,500. (4) Thai the service and pendency of the garnishment had the effect of preventing the -payment of the $12,500 in pursuance of the contract. (5) That before this suit was brought the contract was canceled by the parties making another contract, containing different provisions and embracing additional land. The grounds mentioned will be considered in the above-stated order.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> 1. There was no insufficiency in the description of the land which the appellee agreed to sell to the appellant. The attached map, colored as above stated, identified it as clearly and completely as if a proper description of it had been set out in the written offer which was accepted. _ .</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">_ [2j 2. The provision of the contract calling for an immediate deposit by the appellant of $12,500 was waived by appellee\u2019s letter of May 24, 1919. 36 Cyc. 716. The making of the deposit by the appellant within the time fixed by that letter had the effect of an estoppel on the appellee to complain of appellant\u2019s failure to make the deposit immediately,</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> 3. Provisions of the contract plainly indicate that appellee was-to furnish an abstract, showing the location of the 600-acre tract which, was to be deeded without a warranty, before the appellant was required to pay the additional $500, and that it was not contemplated that appellant was to execute and deposit the notes and deed of trust provided for prior to the execution and deposit in escrow of appellee\u2019s deed, which was to be executed and deposited in escrow at the time of the making of the deposit of $12,500. Appellant was not put in default by failing to pay the additional $500 and to execute and deposit the notes and deed of trust provided for before appellee furnished any abstract or executed and deposited in escrow any deed, especially when appellant was ready and willing to perform his part of the contract, and notified the appellee to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> 4. By the deposit in bank of the $12,500 in the manner provided for by the contract the appellant parted with all control of that money, and the bank held it in trust, to be applied as provided in the contract. The right of tlie appellee to receive that money on complying with its part of the contract was not subject to be defeated by the garnishment, which was issued in the suit brought by a third party against the appellant. So far as appears, there was not, after the terms of the deposit were disclosed by the answer of the garnishee, any attempt to subject that deposit as property in the bank\u2019s possession belonging to the appellant, or to treat the bank as indebted to the appellant in the amount of the deposit; and the garnishment was discharged without anything , having been done to prevent the money being applied in accordance with the terms of the deposit of it. The deposit having been made by the appellant in accordance with the agreement of the parties, it was not deprived of effect as a performance by the appellant in that regard by the abortive attempt of a third party to subject the money deposited by a garnishment proceeding. Equally ineffective was the attempt of the apoellee to put an end to the contract because of an alleged default of the appellant which never occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">5. As to the claim that the contract sought to be enforced was canceled by the parties making another contract, it is enough to say that the evidence adduced was not such as to warrant a finding that the contract sued on has ceased to exist in the way claimed or in any other way. The pleadings and evidence show that the appellant has performed his part of the contract, except so far as performance has been prevented by conduct of the appellee, and that all along appellant has been willing, ready, and able to do all the contract requires of him. In our opinion the record discloses nothing to warrant a denial of the relief sought. Union Pacific R. Co. v. McAlpine, 129 U. S. 305, 9 Sup. Ct. 286, 32 L. Ed. 673 ; 25 Ruling Case Law, 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">It follows that the decree appealed from should be reversed; and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
