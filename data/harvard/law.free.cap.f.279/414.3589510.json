The elder patent expired pending suit. The subject-matter is the frequently litigated Weber socket. The litigious history of these patents is given in Weber, etc., Co. v. Connecticut, etc., Co. (C. C. A.) 263 Fed. 583. Since the date of that decision, Freeman, etc., Co. v. Weber Electric Co. (C. C. A.) 262 Fed. 769, has been taken to the Supreme Court by certiorari, and there affirmed as Weber Electric Co. v. Freeman Electric Co. (June 6, 1921) 256 U. S. 668, 41 Sup. Ct. 600, 65 <em>L. </em>Ed. 1162. Before this last decision the District Court granted to plaintiff herein decree holding the patent claims in suit valid and infringed, from which decree this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-12\">Robert S. Allyn, of New York City, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-13\">Charles Neave, of New York City, and Frank C. Curtis, of Troy, N. Y., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b434-14\">Before HOUGH, MANTON, and MAYER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-15\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"ARFz\">No question of law is here involved, and the exr piration of the senior and controlling of Weber\u2019s patents takes away from this suit all professional interest, except as it completes a protracted history of litigation. Our only duty is to interpret the patents as the senior patent was interpreted by the Supreme Court, and in so doing correct our own decisions, if correction be needed'.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">Comparison of the \u201cConnecticut\u201d case (263 Fed. 583) with the Freeman Case in the Third Circuit (262 Fed. 769) will, we think, show with entire clearness that it was admitted by everyone that the sleeve and cap of the socket defined by the first and fourth claims of the senior patent must in locking be moved \u201ctelescopically.\u201d This circuit held that infringement existed if the longitudinal sliding movement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Weber had' added to it a rotational movement or component; whereas the Third Circuit held that the word \u201ctelescopically\u201d limited said claims to an arrangement involving a straight sliding movement and nothing else.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The plaintiff here and defendant in the Third Circuit having obtained review of the Freeman decision by certiorari, the Supreme Court held in terms that it fully agreed with the Third Circuit in that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ami\">\u201cthe prior art, the file wrapper and the [junior patent here in suit] required that the expressions in the fourth claim \u2018telescopically received\u2019 and \u2018telescopically applied\u2019 must be restricted to a direct longitudinal movemerit or thrust of the sleeve into the cap, and that for this reason the construction of [Freeman Company] requiring a rotary movement to render it effective, does not infringe that of\u201d the plaintiff herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The highest court also specifically held that Weber had, in order to avoid infringing Kenney\u2019s prior patent,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cvoluntarily restricted himself to a \u2018specific structure\u2019 operative when the sleeve was \u2018simply\u2019 inserted in the cap, without suggesting any rotary movement whatever, but, on the contrary, by his reference to Kenney * * * clearly implying that no such rotary movement was necessary in the adjustment of his socket.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We hold it clear, and counsel agree, that, though different in detail, the Ostrander socket operates according to the same law of being as does that of Freeman, or any other socket whose cap first slides like Weber and then has added to it a bayonet twist or any reasonable equivalent thereof. It is clear that, if Freeman does not infringe, Ostrander cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">We have not overlooked the language of the Supreme Court in speaking of a \u201csupposed conflict\u201d between the two circuits, and in saying that the constructions held in this court to infringe \u201cwere so essentially different from that of\u201d Freeman that \u201cdiscussion of them was quite unnecessary.\u201d How this could have been said of the \u201cConnecticut\u201d device we do not understand, though it is certain that the Ostrander device was not before the Supreme Court. But the application of plaintiff\u2019s patents to it is absolutely controlled by the decision of the highest court, with the result that defendant\u2019s sockets do not infringe.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Decree reversed, and cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill for noninfringement, with costs in both courts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
