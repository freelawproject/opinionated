Judgment for plaintiff, and defendant brings error.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AAlu\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-10\">The parties will be designated \u201cplaintiff\u201d and \u201cdefendant,\u201d as in the court below. The defendant, United Verde Extension Mining Company, was on and for some time prior to June 2, 1920, engaged in operating and conducting smelting and ore reduction works in Yavapai county, state of Arizona. The plant consisted of smelter, mills, shops, works, yards, plants, and factories where steam, electricity, and other mechanical powers were used to operate machinery and appliances in and about the smelter and ore reduction works. The plaintiff on June 2, 1920, was in the employ of. the defendant, working in what is designated in the record as the \u201cbull gang.\u201d He had been working in that gang since the smelter was started on August 1,1919, and did all kinds of work around the yards and the general office, cleaning up, moving machinery, unloading cars, drilling concrete, swinging a jack-hammer, installing machinery \u2014 anything that the boss ordered him to do. At the time the plaintiff was injured he was working upon a concrete pit. This pit was 10 or 11 feet wide and about 8 feet deep. There were three planks laid side by side across the top of the pit. The planks were each 12 feet long, 1 foot in width, and 2 inches thick. The plaintiff and other employees were directed by defendant\u2019s foreman to install certain iron bolts in the-concrete structure, and in accordance with the instructions the plaintiff took one of the iron bolts and walked out on the plank with the iron bolt in his arms, taking it to the place where it was to be installed. The iron bolt was about 4 feet in length and about 2 inches in diameter and weighed 100 pounds. The plank upon which plaintiff walked broke under the weight of the plaintiff and his load, precipitating him to the bottom of the pit. From this fall the plaintiff sustained injuries, resulting in damages which are made the subject of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-11\">The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that the action was brought under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Arizona in such eases made and provided, viz. by virtue of the provisions of chapter 6 of title 14, Revised Statutes of Arizona of 1913,; said chapter 6 aforesaid being entitled \u201cliability of employers for Injuries to Workmen in Dangerous Occupations,\u201d and that plaintiff\u2019s employment at the time of the injury was a dangerous and hazardous occupation, because of risks and hazards which are inherent in such occupations, as defined by the terms and provisions of said chapter 6 of title 14, Revised Statutes of Arizona of 1913. To this complaint the defendant interposed a' demurrer and answer, denying generally the allegations of the complaint, and alleging that if the plaintiff was injured, either as alleged in his complaint or otherwise, his injuries resulted from and were wholly caused by the negligence of plaintiff in failing to take that care and caution which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>man of ordinary prudence would take under similar conditions. The case was tried before a jury, and resulted in a verdict and judgment for $8,000. From tills judgment tbe defendant brings tbe case to this court upon a writ of error.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b244-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>tg=\u00bbPor other cases see same topic <em>&amp; </em>KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests <em>&amp; </em>Indexes</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Favour &amp; Baker, of Prescott, Ariz., for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-5\">O\u2019Sullivan &amp; Morgan, of Prescott, Ariz., for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b245-6\">Before GILBERT, ROSS, and MORROW, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b245-7\">MORROW, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AhI\">(after stating the facts as above). <bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> It is assigned as error that the court overruled certain motions made by the defendant relating to special damages claimed by the plaintiff for loss of time and wages because of his failure to get work between the date of the injury and the date of the trial. The claim for loss of time on the part of the plaintiff as special damages, instead of an element of general damages, may not be in accordance with the practice in Arizona. As to that we are not sufficiently advised; but, however that may be, it does not appear to have affected the substantial rights of the parties, and under section 269 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the Act of Eebruary 26, 1919 (40 Stat. 1181 [Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919, \u00a7 1246]), the objection must be disregarded in this court. The pecuniary value of the time lost by plaintiff in consequence of the injury is a proper element of recovery, where the existence and the amount of the loss is established with the requisite certainty. 17 C. J. \u00a7 106, p. 780; Wade v. Le Roy, 61 U. S. (20 How.) 34, 44, 15 L. Ed. 813; Vicksburg, etc., R. R. Co. v. Putnam, 118 U. S. 545, 554, 7 Sup. Ct. 1, 30 L. Ed. 257; District of Columbia v.

S. 230, 242, 14 Sup. Ct. 579, 38 L. Ed. 422. Damages for loss of time up to the date of the trial may be recovered. 17 C. J. \u00a7 106, p. 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">It is assigned as error that the court overruled defendant\u2019s demurrer, challenging the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s complaint in the particular that it failed to show that the plaintiff was employed in a hazardous occupation at the time of the injury. The same question is raised on a motion for a directed verdict and the refusal to give certain requested instructions as to a hazardous occupation. Paragraphs 3154 and 3155 of the act of the Legislature of Arizona, referred to .in the complaint (Revised Statutes of Arizona of 1913, 1051), provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\u201cPar. 3154. That to protect the safety of employees in all hazardous occupations in mining, smelting, manufacturing, railroad, or street railway transportation, or any other industry, as provided in said section 7 of article XVIII of the state Constitution, any employer, whether individual, association, or cox'pox-ation, shall be liable for the death or injury, caused by any accident due to a condition or conditions of such occupation, of any employee in the service of such employer in such hazardous occupation, in all cases in which such death or injury of such employee shall not have been caused by the negligence of the employee killed or injured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">\u201cPar. 3155. The labor and services of workmen at manual and mechanical labor, in the employment of any person, firm, association, company, or corporation, in tbe occupations enumerated in the next section hereof, are hereby declared and determined to be service in a hazardous occupation within the meaning of the terms of the preceding section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u201cBy reason of the nature arid conditions of, and the means used and provided for doing the work in, said occupations, such service is especially dangerous and hazardous to the workmen therein, because of risks and hazards which are inherent in such occupations and which are unavoidable by the workmen therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Subdivisions 8 and 10 of paragraph 3156 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u201cThe occupations hereby declared and determined to be hazardous within the meaning of this chapter are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\"># * * * #&gt;?****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201c(8) All work in or about * * * open pits, open cuts, * * * ore reduction works and smelters. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201c(10) All work in mills, shops, works, yards, plants and factories where steam, electricity, or any other mechanical power' is used to operate machinery and appliances in and about such premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Paragraph 3158 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">\u201cWhen in the course of work in any of the employments or occupations^ enumerated in the preceding section, personal injury or death by any accident arising out of and in the course of such labor, service and employment, and due to a condition or conditions of such occupation or employment, is caused to or suffered by any workman engaged therein, in all cases in which such injury or death of such employee shall not have been caused by the negligence of the employee killed or injured, then the employer of such employee shall be liable in damages to the employee injured, or, in case death ensues, to the personal representative of the deceased,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Whether the plaintiff at the date of his injury was employed by the defendant in a hazardous occupation, as defined by this Arizona statute, was in its final analysis a question of fact. It was also a question of fact whether the injury was caused by an accident arising out of, and in the course of, such labor, service and employment, and was due to a condition or conditions of such occupation or employment. The plaintiff testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">\u201cOn June 2, 1920, I was working in the bull gang under Mr. Wright as foreman; had been working in this gang since the smelter was started on August 1, 1919. I did all kinds of work, around the yards and the general office, cleaning up, moving machinery, unloading cars, drilling concrete, swinging a jack-hammer, installing machinery \u2014 anything like that, as ordered by the boss. The smelter plant consists of the smelter, sample mill, machine shops, and all those works. * * * We had to run concrete in for putting up the rolls. This concrete construction was an addition to the sample mill. The sample mill was lised to crush ore for the smelter, and the crushers operate with motor power. I had not been working there the day before, but on June 2d five of us were taken over to the sample mill and we jacked up the rolls. Wright then told Clark and Stoven to go below and put the tops on the bolts that go through the concrete to hold it, and told me and the other boys to put in the bolts. I grabbed a bolt and went on the staging, and the plank cracked, and I didn\u2019t know any more until I was getting into the car, helped by two men, to go to the hospital. The bolt was about <em>4 </em>feet long and 2 inches in diameter. I don\u2019t remember falling; I would not say I fell, because I do not know. The concrete pit was about 10 feet wide and 10 feet deep, where the boards crossed it; it was built as a conveyor to run ore from the rolls into the sample mill; that was why the end of the mill was cut out. I had to walk on the planks across the aisle to put in the bolt. There were three planks, side by side, 12 feet by 1 foot by 2 inches. I held the bolt up, the plank broke, and I lost consciousness until I was being put in the automobile to be taken to the company hospital.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>The evidence on behalf of the defendant with respect to this feature of the case was that of a witness who was employed in the same gang with the plaintiff. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">\u201cTills pit was outside the sample mill, at the end of the building. There was no power there. We were working on the construction, putting up the rolls. The planks were put across, so we 'could work hack and forth across the pit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> The defendant contends that this evidence did not show that the plaintiff was engaged in a hazardous occupation in mining or smelling, or where power was used, and that the court should have so instructed the jury. We think it showed.that plaintiff was employed by the defendant in a hazardous occupation within the scope and purpose of the statute; that is to say, he was employed in work \u201cin and about an open pit\u201d in an additional construction to the sample mill, and this sample mill was to be used to crush ore for the smelter, and the evidence showed that the crusher was operated by motor power. The work of construction in which the plaintiff was employed was necessary to enable the defendant to carry on its business of smelling ores, and the work was \u201cin and about an open pit\u201d \u2014 \u201core reducing works and a smelter.\u201d We think the evidence showed that plaintiff was engaged in a hazardous occupation, as described by the statute; but it remained for the jury to determine whether the accident was due to a conditio\u00f1 or conditions of such occupation, and whether the injury was caused by the negligence of the plaintiff. These questions of fact were submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The court instructed the jury, among other things, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-7\">\u201cI charge you, as a matter of law, that all work in and about mines, ore reduction works and smelters is a hazardous occupation within the meaning of the law. Therefore, if yon believe, from a preponderance of the evidence, that the plaintiff, at the time he claims to have been injured, was working in and about opon pits, open cuts, mines, ore reduction works, or smelters, he was at the time engaged in a hazardous occupation and that it comes within the meaning of the Employers\u2019 Liability Law. * * * The first question for you to determine is whether the plaintiff, at the time and place mentioned in the complaint, and while in the service and employment of the defendant, and in the course of his work in such employment, received the injuries, or any of the injuries, described, set forth in his complaint. If you find from the preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff, in the course of his labor and while in the service or employment of the defendant, received the injuries, or any of the injuries complained of, then you will determine whether such injury was due to a condition or conditions of his occupation or employment, as those terms have been, or that term has been defined to you, and whether such injuries were caused by the negligence of the plaintiff. If you come to the conclusion from the evidence that the injuries were caused by his own negligence, of course, you need not go any further in the case; you stop right there and render a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">These instructions are fully supported by authority. \u25a0 In the case of Pellerin v. International Cotton Mills, 248 Fed. 242, 160 C. C. A. 320, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit had before it substantially the same question we have here under consideration. That case arose under the New Hampshire Employers\u2019 Liability Act. Laws of New Hampshire of 1911, c. 163. The act declared it was applicable to workmen engaged in manual or mechanical labor in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>shop, mill, factory, or other place in connection with or in proximity to any hoisting apparatus or any machinery propelled or operated by steam or other mechanical power, in which shop, mill, factory, or other place five or more persons are engaged in manual or mechanical labor. The word \u201cmill\u201d had been construed by the New Hampshire courts as including, not only the buildings wherein the work is done, but everything appurtenant thereto. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that a carpenter, who under the terms of his employment might be engaged in manual labor or in connection with or in proximity to machinery in the mill, and had frequently been so engaged, was within the act, although his injury resulted from a fall from a platform adjoining and appurtenant to, but outside of, the mill buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The court in this decision followed a decision of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire in Boody v. K. &amp; C. Mfg. Co., 77 N. H. 208, 210, 90 Atl. 860, L. R. A. 1916A, 10, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 1280, where the same statute was involved as in the case in the federal court. In the Boody Case the deceased was employed to work around a manufacturing mill. Among other things his duties required him to clean the racks constructed to catch rubbish coming down the mill race or flume to defendant\u2019s mill.- On the morning of the accident he was seen standing on a walk facing the flume and very near to the river, with his back to the river, trying to pull some brush out of the rack in the flume with an ordinary garden rake. Later his body was recovered from the river below the mill, and a broken rake was found in the flume, and a freshly broken rake handle was found in the river.. The inference was that either the rake handle broke or that the brush on which he was pulling gave yyay suddenly, and that he lost his balance, and in falling struck his head on the rocks and was killed. The defendant company was held liable under the statute. The court, in passing upon the question of defendant\u2019s liability, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">\u201cIn th'e final analysis, the defendants\u2019 contention is that the words \u2018workmen engaged in * * * work in any shop, mill, factory, or other place, on, in connection with, or in proximity to\u2019 power-driven machinery, are descriptive of an accident \u2014 not an employment \u2014 which will bring a workman within the operation of the act. or that those words were intended to limit the accidents that will entitle those engaged in such work to the benefits of the act. The act, however, says that it applies \u2018to workmen engaged in manual or mechanical labor in the employments described in this section\u2019 \u2014 not to those who are injured while engaged in any one of those employments by the particular risk which induced the Legislature to include those engaged in it within the operation of the act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The case of Larsen v. Paine Drug Co., 218 N. Y. 252, 112 N. E. 725, in the New York Court of Appeals, was an appeal from an award of compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of New York (Consol. Laws, c. 67). The deceased was employed by a corporation in the capacity of \u201cporter, elevator, and handy man.\u201d The commission found that the corporation was engaged in the business of \u201cmanufacturing and selling drugs and chemicals and medicines and pharmaceutical preparations at both retail and wholesale,\u201d and that while the deceased was employed by the corporation he engaged in the work of building a shelf near the elevator well, and while reaching into the elevator to obtain a board, which he had placed on the. side of the well, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>he lost his balance, fell down the elevator shaft, and was instantly killed. There was some question whether the corporation was engaged in a hazardous employment, as defined by the statute. The question was determined against the corporation. The second question was whether compensation could be recovered for the death of a person who at the time of his death was engaged in an act not immediately connected with the hazardous and characteristic feature of the business of the employer. The court in a lucid opinion held that compensation could be recovered in such cas\u00e9. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">\u201cAppellants\u2019 second proposition means that a person engaged generally in an employment which has been defined as hazardous cannot recover compensation for injuries received while performing some act not immediately connected with what might be deemed the hazardous and characteristic feature of the business, although such act was incident to the employment and necessary in prosecuting and carrying forward the business. To illustrate: In the present case it means that no award cap be made because the employee was injured while building a shelf for use in the business, rather than engaged in the immediate process of manufacturing drugs and chemicals, although such shelf v\u00edas entirely necessary in the prosecution of the business. Wo think this is too narrow a view of the statute, and would lead to limitations upon its application which were not intended or anticipated by the Legislature. It is not necessary to attempt to lay down a final and universal rule on that subject. We feel perfectly secure, however, in holding that where, as in this case, an employee is injured while performing an act which is fairly incidental to the prosecution of a business and appropriate in carrying it forward and providing for its needs, he or his dependents are not to be barred from recovery because such act is not a slop wholly embraced in the precise and characteristic process or operation which has been made the basis of the group in which employment is claimed.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The defendant cites the opinion of this court in New Cornelia Copper Co. v. Espinosa, 268 Fed. 742, as holding that the law does not mean, when it says \u201cin and about mines,\u201d that all men employed by the owner are in a hazardous occupation simply because they happen to be about the surface of a mine within the lines of the owner. In that case the evidence showed that the deceased was employed to work in a mine owned by the defendant, but he was not at work in the mine at the time of the explosion causing his death. He was on the surface, where no mining operations were being carried on by the defendant. The deceased built a fire in some wood on the surface in the morning before his working hours began in the mine. In the wood was powder or dynamite, which exploded, killing the deceased. The building of the fire by the deceased -was his own voluntary act, and against the general instructions of the mine foreman. The accident did not arise out of or in the course of the labor, service, or employment of the deceased, and it was not due to a condition or conditions of such occupation or employment. In the present case the plaintiff was employed by the defendant to do the work he was engaged in doing when he was injured, and he was doing that work under the direction of defendant\u2019s foreman. The work was necessary and appropriate to enable the defendant to carry on its business of smelting ores, and the work was being done \u201cin and about\u201d the defendant\u2019s smelter. The risk attending such work was at common law a liability of the employer for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>negligence in not providing a safe place for the employee to work and existed before the Employers\u2019 Liability Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">In Consolidated Arizona Smelting Co. v. Egich (Ariz.) 199 Pac. 132, the plaintiff was injured while at ,worlc in defendant\u2019s -mine breaking rocks with a hammer. The head of the hammer flew off the handle and struck plaintiff\u2019s right foot, breaking a toe. The suit was to recover damages from the mine owner for this injury. It was contended on behalf of the defendant that the action was to recover for the negligence of defendant in failing to supply the plaintiff with a safe tool, that the Employers\u2019 Liability Act covered only such risks as are inherent in the occupation, and that this limitation excluded accidents due to the employer\u2019s negligence. ,\u00b0To sustain this position the defendant cited a number of cases decided by the Supreme Court of Arizona in which it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201cThe risks and hazards must be inherent in tbe occupation before the employee may recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In the Egich Case the Supreme Court qualified its previous expression in this respect by saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cTbe condition or conditions that cause the accident resulting in injury or death may be inherent in the occupation, or they may arise from the manner in which the business is carried on. The conditions of the occupation in which the employee does his work involves, not only the place he works, but the tools with which he works, the' one as much as the other. He cannot perform his work without tools, nor without being in the place assigned to him. * * * The only thing that will defeat the action and absolve the employer from liability is the negligence of the employee. If the injury or death be not caused by an accident due to a condition or conditions of the occupation, but is caused by the negligence of the employee, he cannot recover, nor can his personal representative or beneficiary. The only risk or hazard the employee assumes is'his own negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\"><bracketnum>[6]</bracketnum> We are of the opinion that the risk of the defendant in the present case arose out of the condition or conditions of its business as it was then being carried on in the necessary and appropriate construction of a concrete addition to the sample mill to be used in crushing ore for the smelter. We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s injury in this case was within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> It is assigned as error that the court overruled defendant\u2019s motion that a mistrial be declared because of the testimony of the plaintiff concerning the company being insured (presumably against injury to employees). The plaintiff was a witness in his own behalf. In the course of his testimony he related a conversation between Mr. Thompson, the claim agent of the company, and himself, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">\u201cThen Mr. Thompson walked over to me, after the doctor got through examining me, and said, \u2018Ifittlojohn,\u2019 he says, T don\u2019t want you to think that I ain\u2019t to do \u2014 that I ain\u2019t going to do fair with you. I have no other orders only to treat the men fair.\u2019 He says: \u2018Mr. Kingdon gives me orders to treat his men all fair. They have them all insured, and just as soon as ever those pictures [X-r,ay pictures] are developed, I will go down and try to settle up with you, and I don\u2019t want you to think \u2014 \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>At this point counsel for defendant objected that \u2014 -</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-3\">\u2018\u2022'This is kind of a garrulous statement of gossip of what took placo and has no bearing on the case. * * * I ask that the witness be questioned as to the issues involved here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">He requested that the statement that the company is insured be stricken out. The court overruled this objection, on the ground that there was no objection until after it was all stated. Counsel replied that he could'not object to that; that it wasn\u2019t in response to any question. After some discussion the court adhered to his ruling. Subsequently the court excluded this testimony, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201cNow all that I exclude because in the first place any discussion by itself with the expectation of the efforts to make a satisfactory and mutual arrangement for settlement is never admissible in the trial of a law suit. People have a right to settle their differences and to make their peace and to avoid litigation, and any statement made by either party while that is in progress is never admissible in a lawsuit, and is no admission of fault or liability on 1lie part of either, and the question as to whether these men were insured is wholly immaterial in this case. You can readily see why that might be so. In the first place, it might be a case where the insurance could never be collected, the insurance company might be insolvent, or they might refuse to pay, many reasons why that is not admissible, and therefore plaintiff\u2019s statement which was not called for by counsel on either side, and I didn\u2019t anticipate it when I permitted him to make a statement with reference to his physical condition, therefore you will not consider it at all for any purpose. Make up your verdict wholly independent of that statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">We think this instruction to the jury before the plaintiff had closed his case removed any prejudicial impression, if any, that may have been made by the witness in his voluntary statement about insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We think the observation of the Supreme Court of California in People v. Northey, 77 Cal. 618, 630, 19 Pac. 865, 870, with respect to an objection to remarks made by the court in the presence of the jury and subsequently struck out, is applicable here. The trial court corrected its mistake in the foliowing instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\"><em>\u201c1 </em>instruct you that it is your duty to ignore in your deliberations the rein arks then made by the court, and that you must deal with the case on the law ns it exists, and as the court states it to you, irrespective of your own opinion or any opinion the court might have as to the wisdom of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">The Supreme Court, commenting upon the sufficiency of the instruction, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">\u201cWe think that these observations to the jury, made to them by the court when giving them directions by which to guide their conduct in the consideration of the case, were sufficient to remove all apprehension that ihe remarks of the court, above referred to, would have any effect on their minds prejudicial to the defendant. To hold otherwise would be to attribute to the jurors a lack of ordinary intelligence, and tills we are bound to presume from their selection to try the cause they possessed. To hold that the members of the jury in whose presence the remarks were made could not lay them aside as something irrelevant to the business they were charged with, and disregard them entirely in the discharge of their functions, would be irrational and incredible. If men of ordinary intellectual endowments are incapable of such a mental operation, trial by jury may justly be regarded as a failure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>In Todd v. Boston Elev. Ry. Co., 208 Mass. 505, 506, 94 N. E. 683, 684 (Ann. Cas. 1912A, 1005), the Supreme Court of Massachusetts stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">\u201cIt is a principle of practice in the trial of causes to a jury that an erroneous ruling- made by the presiding justice either as to evidence or in the charge may be corrected at any stage, and if the ruling as made at last is sound, no exception lies. It must be assumed that the jury acted upon the state of the case finally submitted to them both as to evidence and instructions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> The court admitted in evidence the American Mortality Tables to determine the probable duration of plaintiff\u2019s life. It was objected that there was no evidence that plaintiff\u2019s injury was permanent. Dr. J. B. McNally who examined the plaintiff about four months after his injury testified among other things that he\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cfound a depression on the left side of his head in the posterior region, which was not sore; also noticed a fine or muscular tremor all over his body; his neck muscles were apparently very tender, slightly rigid where attached to the bone. I was not able to account for the tremor; he told me it had followed the injury and I concluded there was probably a concussion of the brain or some part thereof that may have set up the tremor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">He had examined him again within the last week before the trial. His nervous condition was very slightly exaggerated. The witness believed that the cells of the brain were disarranged and their physiological function disturbed. When asked by the defendant\u2019s attorney if that would continue^, or whether it would clear up, the witness replied: <em>\u201cI </em>think it will continue in a man of his age.\u201d There was testimony on the part of the defendant tending to show that the plaintiff was not permanently injured, but was afflicted with premature senility, which may have been produced by some cause other than the injury received from his fall into the concrete pit. We think the question of permanent injury was sufficiently presented by the testimony to make it a question for the jury, and that the mortality tables were properly admissible in that aspect of the case. The court instructed the jury substantially as in the recent case of United Verde Extension Mining Co. v. Koso (C. C. A.) 273 Fed. 369, 372, which instruction this court approved. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\"><bracketnum>[9, 10]</bracketnum> While plaintiff was on'the witness stand he exhibited his head to the jury, showing the injury it had received as it then appeared. On cross-examination the defendant\u2019s counsel requested an examination of plaintiff\u2019s head by its physicians, and also an examination of plaintiff\u2019s physical condition generally because the injury to plaintiff\u2019s head had been placed in evidence. The objection by plaintiff\u2019s attorney to such an examination was properly sustained by the court. Union Pac. Ry. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 11 Sup. Ct. 1000, 35 L. Ed. 734. In the course of plaintiff\u2019s argument to the jury, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201cNow we have asked for $10,000. Yon gentlemen know that $10,000 to-day is not worth as much as $5,000 four or five years ago.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">Counsel for defendant objected to this line of argument. The court sustained the objection, in so far as it contained a statement of fact by counsel, but permitted counsel to argue and to ask the jury to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>termine whether the purchasing power of the dollar was less than formerly. The court stated that the jury might bring to bear their own knowledge and experience in order to determine the question. Jurors may be reminded of what every one else knows, and they may act upon and take notice of those facts which are of such general notoriety as to be matters of common knowledge.
