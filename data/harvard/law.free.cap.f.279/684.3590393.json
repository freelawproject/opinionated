The laden barge, according to tbe libel, \u201csprang a leak and sunk * * * as a result of perils of the sea,\u201d whereby libelant\u2019s cargo became a total loss. Except for the above quotation, the liiel contains nothing that can be called an allegation of fault against the Ciesapeake Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-18\">Libelant did, however, allege that when the lighterage contract was made it was agreed with Chesapeake Company \u201cthat all goods lightered [including, of course, this kainit] while on the lighters of Chesapeake, etc., Company, were to be insured by the [Chesapeake Company] up to the sum of $6,000, provided there was no prior insurance\u201d thereon. In point of fact there was before and at the time when the kainit was laden on Chesapeake Company's barge, and apparently for some months prior to that date, insurance attach-ii g (according to its terms) to said kainit. It was expressed in a policy issued by Federal Insurance Company to the concern which apparently sold the k unit to libelant, and was in favor of said vendor corporation \u201con account of whom it may concern,\u201d and it concerned the libelant apparently as holder of bills of lading for the kainit at the time it was unladen from the Main a id put aboard Chesapeake Company\u2019s barge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b704-19\">This insurance, available to libelant, covered the kainit from the time of shipment on the Main until its delivery at destination, and specifically included \u201call risks of lighterage\u201d; but such general assumption was limited by the following exceptive provision: \u201cWarranted by tbe assured free from any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>liability for merchandise in the possession of any carrier or oilier bailee, who may be liable for any loss or damage thereto, and for merchandise shipped under a bill of lading containing a stipulation that the carrier may have the benefit of any insurance thereon, and that any insurance granted herein s\u00edmil not cover where any carrier or other bailee has insurance (whether prior or subsequent in date to this policy) which would attach if this policy had not been issued.\u201d</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b704-20\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>&lt;\u00a7:unFor other oases see same topic <em>&amp; </em>KEY-NUMBER in ail Key-Numbered Digests &amp; Indexes</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>At and before the time when Chesapeake Company agreed to carry libelant's kainit, it had a policy in the Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, which by its terms covered \u201cmerchandise and property on which the (Chesapeake Company) have agreed with the shippers to provide insurance, also their legal liability in cases where they have not agreed to provide insurance.\u201d This Fireman\u2019s Company policy applied specifically to the barge which carried the kainit, and contained the exceptive provision: \u201cWarranted by the assured that any insurance granted herein shall not cover where the assured or any carrier or other bailee has insurance which would attach if this policy had not been issued.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-6\"><em>Upon </em>the loss of the kainit libelant received from the Federal Company what would have been its loss under that company\u2019s insurance policy, but only \u201cas a loan, and repayable only to the extent of any net recovery [Federal Company! may make from any carrier, bailee, or others on account of loss [of the kainit]. or from any insurance effected by any carrier, bailee or others on said\u201d kainit. The receipt for this loan contained the usual agreement on the part of libelant to prosecute suits as required by Federal Company, but \u201cat <em>the expense </em>and under the exclusive direction and control\u201d of said Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-7\">The; eupoii this action was begun, with allegations as above set forth only against Chesapeake Company, but with an averment that \u201cby reason of the said policy of insurance taken out [with-.Fireman\u2019s Company] said Fireman\u2019s Company is liable to it under and by virtue of the terms of its said policy with\u201d Chesapeake Company. The Chesapeake and Fireman\u2019s Companies appeared by the same proctors, denied the allegation last quoted, but admitted that, when Chesapeake Company agreed to carry said <em>kainit, </em>it further <em>agreed </em>that it \u201cwould be insured by the Chesapeake Company while on its lighters, provided said cargoes were not otherwise insured.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b705-8\">At trial the only evidence beside the two policies of insurance a,nd the receipt for the loan made to libelant by Federal Company was a stipulation that whatever agreement to insure was made by Chesapeake Company was evidenced only by talk between a representative of libelant and of Chesapeake Company, and <em>that </em>if such representatives were called as witnesses each would swear exactly as ihoir respective employers had pleaded. On this record the trial court gave decree to libelant as against the Fireman\u2019s Insurance Company only, but dismissed the libel as\u2019against Chesapeake, etc., Company. Whereupon the Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b705-9\">William Harison, of New York City, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b705-10\">Harrington, Bigham &amp; Englar, of New York City (D.

Whether libelant ever intended to allege any wrong or breach of contract on the part of Chesapeake Company as carrier of the kainit is doubtful; but it is certain that no proof exists of any dereliction by that company in respect of the carriage. Consequently the carrier as such is without negligence, and as no effort was made to charge Chesapeake Company as insurer merely because it carried, the cases from Inman v. Railway Co., 129 U. S. 128, 9 Sup. Ct. 249, 32 L. Ed. 612, through Pennsylvania Co. v. Burr, 130 Fed. 847, 65 C. C. A. 331, and Bradley v. Lehigh, etc., Co., 153 Fed. 350, 82 C. C. A. 426, to Luckenbach v. McCahan, etc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Co., 248 U. S. 139, 39 Sup. Ct 53, 63 L. Ed. 170, 1 A. L. R. 1522, do not apply. It is true that this shipper had the kind of insurance, and pursued the procedure on settlement, followed by the shippers in the cases cited; an insurance and procedure successfully designed to prevent a carrier, liable on his contract of carriage, from escaping liability by a bill of lading agreement whereby such carrier (in effect) obtained tl e benefit of shipper\u2019s insurance. Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Erie, etc., Co., 1 7 U. S. 312, 6 Sup. Ct. 750, 29 L. Ed. 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">But Chesapeake Company is, by a section of decree below whereof no one complains, exonerated, not only from liability as carrier, but fi om all liability whatever. This suit, like all but a negligible fraction o:' admiralty proceedings on the instance side, must rest on either a marine tort or a maritime contract. Tort is eliminated as above shown; tl erefore the suit as against Chesapeake Company must have proceeded on the theory that said company agreed on due consideration to insure \u2014i. e., procure insurance available to \u2014 libelant in respect of the kainit. And acquiescence in discharge of Chesapeake Company, by the lower court must mean that said company (in libelant\u2019s opinion) fulfilled whatever obligation it undertook, by procuring or maintaining the Firerr an\u2019s Fund policy; therefore this suit is by the libelant as one insured by the Fireman\u2019s Company, and on no other ground can it be maintained ir. the admiralty.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The form has been dwelt upon as important, for in substance this li:igation is obviously a sort of case stated by two insurance companies, with a request that the courts decide which of the two has succeeded ir. maneuvering the loss upon the other. Of such an effort it may be said in the recent phrase of Holmes, J., that \u201cneither side would be likely to inspire enthusiasm.\u201d. Oelwerke v. Erlanger, 248 U. S. 521, 39 Sup. Ct. 180, 63 L. Ed. 399, and no court should or can do more than ir quire whether under the pleadings and evidence the libelant has made out a case within the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\"><bracketnum>[ 1 ]</bracketnum> Again libelant must consider that Chesapeake Company fulfilled whatever promise to insure.it ever made; for, if the suit be regarded a; one to recover damages for a failure to insure or procure insurance, admiralty has no jurisdiction; the contract is not maritime. Marquardt v. French (D. C.) 53 Fed. 603, approved United, etc., Co. v. New York &amp; Baltimore, etc., Line, 185 Fed. 386, 390, 107 C. C. A. 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Further it must be regarded, in order to establish jurisdiction, that libelant became the insured under the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy the moment the kainit went on Chesapeake Company\u2019s barge (Southern, etc., Co. v. Merchant\u2019s, etc., Co. (D. C.) 179 Fed. 133, 136, and case c ted), and that as such insured libelant can sue in its own name (The Sidney, 23 Fed. 88, 93), even though the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy specific ally provides, \u201cFoss, if any, payable to\u201d Chesapeake Company. On this last point we express no opinion, but assume it for argument\u2019s sake.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Having thus made the assumptions necessary to admiralty jur.sdiction, we arq clear that libelant as the insured under Fireman\u2019s Fund policy cannot recover, for that policy specifically provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>it does not cover \u201cwhere the assured has insurance which would attach if this policy had not been issued,\u201d and libelant had exactly that kind of insurance under the Federal policy. If, however, the Chesapeake Company be regarded as the insured, and this suit be an effort to get at the Fireman\u2019s Fund over Chesapeake\u2019s shoulder, then (assuming the technical propriety of the attempt) it was wrong to dismiss the libel as against Chesapeake Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">This hrings us to what we think the crux of the case, and on an appeal which is a new trial, we may inquire whether the evidence warranted finding in substance that Chesapeake Company ever agreed to procure or furnish insurance to libelant. Libelant said the promise was to insure \u201cprovided there was no <em>prior </em>insurance,\u201d while Chesapeake Company said it only so agreed if the kainit \u201cwere not <em>otherwise </em>insured.\u201d The two statements are far from meaning the same thing. <em>Prior </em>insurance is a technical term, concerning which much fine-spun arguing can be, and lias been made; but \u201cotherwise insured\u201d is a plain expression, and no one can doubt that, when some agreement was made, libelant was otherwise insured. One oath is as good as the other; the probabilities are. all with Chesapeake Company, if its promising employee had the slightest acquaintance with the intricacies of marine insurance. It is certain that by no fair preponderance of evidence did libelant prove the controverted fact that Chesapeake Company agreed to insure by any form of words that would or could enable shipwr\u2019s insurers to transfer their burden to carrier\u2019s insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Where the carrier is guilty of fault, the cases first above cited (and many others) show just how his insurers (if any there are) can be made to hear the burden of that fault; notwithstanding any effort yet exhibited in the reports, on the carrier\u2019s part and embedded in the contract of carriage, to escape the consequences of fault. This is an endeavor to put on a carrier, who committed no fault, a burden assumable only by express contract. Such contract is (1) not proven; but (2) if the Fireman\u2019s policy be the fruit of the contract, libelant can only sue thereon as the assured \u2014 a legal position which defeats its occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Decree reversed, without costs, and cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the libel, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
