Additionally, petitioner, must consult with the District of Columbia Bar\u2019s Practice Management Advisory Service prior to reentry into private practice. Petitioner shall execute any necessary waivers of confidentiality required for Bar Counsel to obtain information on petitioner\u2019s compliance with the repayment condition. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-20\">FURTHER ORDERED that James W. Beane, Jr., Esquire is hereby reinstated to the Bar of the District of Columbia subject to the conditions outlined above. Failure to fully comply with the above conditions and to fully repay the Client Security Fund within three years may result in revocation of this reinstatement order. See D.C. Bar R.
