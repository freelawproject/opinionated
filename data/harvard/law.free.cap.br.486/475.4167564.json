Parker appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his employment discrimination case against Defendant-Appellee Turner Industries Group, L.L.C. (\u201cTurner\u201d) on the ground of judicial estoppel. Specifically, Parker failed to inform the bankruptcy court in which he and his wife had filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition three weeks before his employment termination that he subsequently filed the instant employment discrimination lawsuit grounded in racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-18\">In a lengthy, well-reasoned Order and Reasons, the district court explained its grant of Turner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissal of Parker\u2019s suit. Our review of the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and the applicable law as explicated therein and by the district court in its Order and Reasons, satisfies us that the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal should be, and therefore is,</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1052-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
