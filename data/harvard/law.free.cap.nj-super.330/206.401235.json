Lovell had been arrested with defendant, and was charged with the same offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to the State\u2019s proofs at trial, on July 30,1997, Somerville patrolman Thomas O\u2019Donnell went to 2 West Main Street, Apartment 6, in Somerville based upon a complaint made by Armel Lashley regarding a dispute he was having with other persons that resided in the apartment building. When they got there, Lashley knocked on the door. An occupant, Margaret Stokes, opened the door. O\u2019Donnell saw that the room was filled with smoke. He saw five persons in the room, including Lovell and defendant. Lovell was seated directly in front of him and had \u201cwhat appealed] to be a homemade crack pipe in his hand, he was raising to his mouth\u201d. Defendant was one of the persons in the room. O\u2019Donnell observed defendant make \u201ca fast move to the left of the apartment towards the bathroom\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">Based upon his observations, O\u2019Donnell entered the apartment. He observed another \u201chomemade pipe\u201d on the stove. He also observed a small dish on the stove \u201cwith chunks and some white powder\u201d which he believed \u201cwas probably crack cocaine\u201d. He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>saw a spoon \u201cwith water and some chunks of the same white substance in the water\u201d. Finally, he saw a small box of baking soda on the counter which \u201cis commonly used to cook the cocaine to a more ... pure form\u201d. The apartment was described as a one room apartment. O\u2019Donnell said he \u201cwasn\u2019t really comfortable with [so many people] in a small room\u201d and ordered two of the occupants, who did not appear to be engaged in the use of any of the controlled dangerous substances, to leave. He then arrested defendant, Stokes and Lovell. He transported defendant and Stokes to police headquarters in his patrol vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">O\u2019Donnell testified that in accordance with standard Somerville police procedure, at the beginning of his shift he had pulled out the rear seat of the patrol car to assure that contraband or weapons had not been left there from the prior shift. He found nothing. Furthermore, again in accordance with Somerville police procedure, he patted down defendant before placing him in the patrol car. Apparently, he found nothing during the pat-down. He handcuffed defendant and Stokes, with their hands behind their backs. He placed Stokes behind the driver\u2019s seat, and defendant behind the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Pursuant to consent given by Lovell, who was the actual tenant, other officers began to search the apartment. O\u2019Donnell was asked by a Lieutenant \u201cto remain for a short while\u201d. While O\u2019Donnell was standing outside the car, he observed defendant \u201csquirming and moving around inside the back seat\u201d. Also, while transporting defendant and Stokes to police headquarters, O\u2019Donnell observed defendant continuing \u201cto move about the back of the vehicle\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">After defendant and Stokes were taken into police headquarters and placed in custody, O\u2019Donnell went back to the vehicle and, again, pursuant to Somerville procedure, \u201cchecked the rear seat\u201d and \u201cjust to the right of where [defendant\u2019s] hands are [sic] was a small, tiny plastic bag that had the white substance in there. It was later tested positive for cocaine\u201d. He found the bag in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>area \u201cwhere the bench seat meets the back of the seat\u201d, near the door.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Lovell testified that defendant and Stokes were living with him. He said they did not pay rent but he permitted them to stay because they had nowhere to live and, in return, defendant supplied him with drugs. He said that when the police arrived he and defendant were \u201cpartying ... doing drugs\u201d. He identified the drugs as \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d which had been supplied by defendant. He acknowledged that he had entered into a plea agreement which required him to \u201ctestify truthfully\u201d against defendant in return for the State\u2019s recommendation for probation. He said that on July 30,1997, defendant had brought the cocaine into the apartment in \u201clittle bags\u201d. He said defendant was \u201ccooking\u201d the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">On cross-examination, in response to a question as to whether the drugs affected Erie\u2019s \u201cmental abilities that day\u201d, he responded that he \u201calready have mental problem\u201d. He said he was on medication for depression. However, he denied that the drugs he had been using on the day of his arrest affected his ability to think clearly.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">Defendant testified. He said he did not use narcotics and denied giving Lovell narcotics in exchange for a place to stay. He also denied purchasing any of the cocaine found in the apartment, and denied using any of that cocaine. He also denied leaving cocaine in the patrol ear. He explained that the reason he was \u201csquirming\u201d in the back seat was because the handcuffs were extremely painful due to a prior fracture to his wrist which had necessitated surgical repair, including a bone graft from his hip. While testifying, defendant acknowledged he had previously been convicted of criminal contempt and terroristic threats in New Jersey and \u201cresisting an officer with violence\u201d in Florida. Moreover, he conceded he was still on probation for the New Jersey offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>The jury deliberated for portions of two days. During the course of its deliberations, the jury asked four separate questions, including a request for a read-back of Lovell\u2019s testimony. Ultimately, as previously noted, the jury found defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Prior to sentence, defendant moved for \u201cjudgment of acquittal notwithstanding the verdict or in the alternative for a new trial\u201d. The bases of that application were defendant\u2019s contentions that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, coupled with counsel\u2019s contention that he should have requested separate jury verdicts regarding the cocaine found in the apartment, and the cocaine found in the car, and (2) the State should have supplied defense counsel with information regarding the nature and extent of Lovell\u2019s mental disabilities and medications he was taking prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">While defendant\u2019s motion was pending, the assistant prosecutor who tried the case, in preparing for Lovell\u2019s sentencing, reviewed the presentence report and discovered that Lovell had a prior conviction for sexual assault. The assistant prosecutor had been unaware of that fact when Lovell testified. She immediately advised defendant\u2019s attorney of Lovell\u2019s prior criminal record representing that \u201c[ajccording to Lovell\u2019s criminal history he has no prior indictable convictions and the State was unaware of any such convictions prior to or at the time of trial\u201d. Based upon that letter, defendant\u2019s attorney supplemented his pending motion seeking a new trial based upon the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The judge initially determined that there had been a <em>Brady </em>violation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. He further concluded that the non-disclosure of Lovell\u2019s prior conviction \u201ccould well undermine confidence in the verdict\u201d. However, in light of the age of Lovell\u2019s conviction, he requested briefs on the issue of the admissibility of the conviction with the understanding that if the conviction was admissible to impeach Lovell\u2019s credibility, defendant\u2019s conviction would be \u201creversed\u201d. The judge also observed that the offense that gave rise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>to Lovell\u2019s conviction occurred on March 21, 1981, but he was not arrested until August 12, 1989, and was not convicted until July 30, 1990. The judge raised the question as to whether the remoteness of Lovell\u2019s conviction should be measured from the date of his offense, or the date of his conviction. The judge ultimately concluded that Lovell\u2019s conviction in 1990, for an offense that occurred in 1981, would not have affected his credibility when he testified at trial in 1998. He observed that, in his opinion, Lovell was \u201ca very unique witness. He ... suffers from a number of impairments. And quite frankly, I think those impairments elevated the level of his credibility at trial\u201d. Accordingly, he denied the motion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-5\">On this appeal, defendant raises the following arguments:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-6\">POINT I DEFENDANT\u2019S MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED BECAUSE THE <em>BRADY </em>VIOLATION INVOLVED MATERIAL EVIDENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">POINT II THE COURT\u2019S JURY INSTRUCTION ON CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION WAS INCOMPLETE, FAILING TO CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF <em>STATE V. BROWN </em>AND <em>STATE V. SHIPP. </em>(Not Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">POINT III DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS EXCESSIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused ... violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution\u201d. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 <em>U.S. </em>83, 87, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1194, 1196-97, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218 (1963). The <em>Brady </em>rule applies even where defendant makes no formal request for <em>Brady </em>material. <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>97, 107, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2392, 2399, 49 L.Ed.2d 342, 351-52 (1976); <em>State v. Martini, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>248, 268, 734 A.2d 257 (1999); <em>State v. Knight, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>233, 245, 678 A.2d 642 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">In order to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation, defendant must show that: (1) the prosecution suppressed evidence; (2) the evidence is favorable to the defense; and (3) the evidence is material <em>Martini, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 268, 734 A.2d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Clearly, the first requirement has been satisfied. Although unintentionally, the prosecution failed to disclose to defendant Lovell\u2019s prior conviction. The trial prosecutor\u2019s lack of knowledge of the conviction is of no consequence. Awareness of the existence of a criminal record, which is peculiarly within the knowledge of law enforcement, is imputable to the trial prosecutor notwithstanding a lack of actual knowledge. <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>419, 437-38, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>1555, 1567-68, 131 L.Ed.2d 490, 508 (1995) (trial prosecutor has a duty to learn of any evidence favorable to defendant known to others acting on government\u2019s behalf); <em>State v. Nelson, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>487, 498-500, 715 A.2d 281 (1998) , <em>cert. denied, </em>525 <em>U.S. </em>1114, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>890, 142 L.Ed.2d 788, (1999) (lack of actual awareness by trial prosecutor does not relieve the State of its <em>Brady </em>obligations). The <em>Brady </em>disclosure rule applies to information of which the prosecution is actually or constructively aware. <em>Ibid. </em>We have no hesitancy in concluding that a trial prosecutor is constructively aware of the existence of a criminal record which is easily ascertainable, as it was in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Moreover, a prior conviction of a State\u2019s witness, particularly one as important as Lovell in this case, is evidence favorable to the defense, thereby satisfying the second <em>Brady </em>requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Next, we must consider whether the evidence was material to the defense, thereby satisfying the third <em>Brady </em>requirement. In determining whether evidence is sufficiently material to require its timely disclosure to defendant, the United States Supreme Court initially held that the standard for determining whether suppressed evidence is material depends on the specificity of defendant\u2019s initial request for the evidence in question. <em>United States v. Agurs, supra, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>at 104-12, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2398-2402, 49 L.Ed.2d at 350-55 (1976). In cases where a specific request was made, reversal was required if the suppressed evidence \u201cmight have affected the outcome of the trial\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2398, 49 L.Ed.2d at 350. On the other hand, if only a general request had been made for <em>Brady </em>material or no request at all, reversal would only have been necessary if the non-disclosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>evidence created a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2402, 49 L.Ed.2d at 355. However, the Court subsequently abandoned that distinction and held that regardless of the specificity of defendant\u2019s request, evidence is material for <em>Brady </em>purposes \u201cif there is a reasonable probability that had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d. <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>667, 682, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>3375, 3383, 87 L.Ed.2d 481, 494 (1985). Stated another way, the question is whether in the absence of the undisclosed evidence did the defendant receive a fair trial which is understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. <em>Kyles v. Whitley, supra, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>at 434, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1566, 131 L.Ed.2d at 506; <em>State v. Nelson, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 500, 715 A.2d 281. Therefore, in order to establish a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different result, defendant need not show that it is more likely than not that he would have received a different verdict with the disclosed evidence. <em>Kyles, supra, </em>at 434, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1566, 131 L.Ed.2d at 506. Rather, a \u201creasonable probability\u201d of a different result is shown when the suppression of the evidence undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial. <em>Ibid.; Bagley, supra, </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>at 678, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3381, 87 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 491; <em>Martini, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 269, 734 A.2d 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It is unclear whether our Supreme Court will apply Bagley\u2019s unitary standard in all cases, or will apply <em>Agurs \u2019 </em>less demanding standard in cases where a specific request had been made. In <em>Martini, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 269, n. 4, 734 A.2d 257, and <em>Knight, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 678 A.2d 642, the question was left open. However, in <em>State v. Marshall, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>89, 156, 690 A.2d 1 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>850, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>140, 139 L.Ed.2d 88 (1997), the Court applied the <em>Bagley </em>test to all of the State\u2019s non-disclosures, including those that related to documents that defendant had specifically requested before trial, observing that it perceived no state-law basis on which to depart from Bagley\u2019s unitary standard. Indeed, the Court has observed that Bagley\u2019s unitary standard is simple to apply and \u201cthe differences in the standards may not be sufficiently substantial to justify retention of two different materi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>ality tests\u201d. <em>Knight, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 247, 678 A.2d 642. Here, defendant represents that he made a specific request for production of the criminal records of the State\u2019s witnesses. Although that request is not set forth in defendant\u2019s appendix, the State has never disputed that contention, and, accordingly, we accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In any event, we readily conclude here that the withheld evidence of Lovell\u2019s prior conviction satisfies <em>Bagley\u2019s </em>unitary standard, as well as the less demanding <em>Agurs </em>standard. In other words, there is a reasonable probability that the withheld evidence would have altered the jury\u2019s perspective of the case. After all, this was a credibility contest, the jury deliberated over two days, and only rendered its verdict after having a read-back of Lovell\u2019s testimony. Obviously, Lovell\u2019s testimony was deemed by the jury to be significant and critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> We recognize that we must give deference to the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the withheld evidence would not have affected the outcome of the trial. Having presided over the trial, ordinarily the judge is in a better position than we to make that determination. However, we also recognize that cross-examination is routinely regarded as the most effective means of challenging the credibility of a witness and thereby discovering the truth. <em>State v. Silva, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>438, 444, 621 A.2d 17 (1993). One of the tools available to the cross-examiner in attempting to impeach the credibility of a witness is the witness\u2019 prior conviction of a crime. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>609. We are concerned here not only with the failure to disclose Lovell\u2019s prior conviction, but also with the fact that defendant was impeached with his prior conviction of a crime. Disclosure of Lovell\u2019s prior conviction may have leveled the playing field. In <em>Kyles, </em>the Supreme Court vacated defendant\u2019s conviction by virtue of the failure of the prosecution to turn over to the defense, among other things, prior statements of prosecution witnesses which contained a number of inconsistencies. <em>Kyles, supra, </em>514 <em>U.S. </em>at 442-45, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1569-71, <em>131 L.Ed.2d </em>at 510-12. Noting that impeachment evidence, as well as exculpa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>tory evidence, falls within the <em>Brady </em>rule, the United State Supreme Court vacated a conviction when the prosecutor failed to disclose evidence that the defense might have used to impeach the Government\u2019s witnesses by showing bias or interest. <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 <em>U.S. </em>at 676-84, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3380-85, 87 L.Ed.2d at 490-95. When the reliability of a witness may well be determinative of guilt or innocence, non-disclosure of evidence affecting credibility justifies a new trial, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>150, 154, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>763, 766, 31 L.Ed.2d 104, 108 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Likewise, our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[sjuppression of evidence favorable or helpfui to a defendant\u2019s cause, even when the evidence concerns only the credibility of a State\u2019s witness against defendant, denies him a fair trial and violates due process\u201d. <em>State v. Vigliano, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>51, 60, 232 A.2d 129 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Although not decided in the context of a <em>Brady </em>violation, in <em>State v. Taylor, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>440, 231 A.2d 212 (1967), our Supreme Court granted defendant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief when defendant learned, after trial, that his co-defendant, who testified against him, had had conversations with the trial prosecutor who agreed to recommend leniency to the judge if he testified against defendant in accordance with his statement. When defense counsel cross-examined the witness and asked if he understood that his sentence could be less than a life sentence, the State\u2019s objection was sustained. The Court held that where one of the considerations for a plea is an agreement by a co-defendant to testify truthfully for the State against another defendant in return for a recommendation of leniency, such promise or understanding should be fully, fairly and honestly disclosed when it comes into question at the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 456, 231 A.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In <em>State v. Spano, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>231, 353 A.2d 97 (1976), a principal State\u2019s witness had been arrested for possession of a controlled dangerous substance. Prior to her testimony, on the recommendation of the State, she was admitted into a supervisory treatment program under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>24:21-27 which, if successfully concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>would result in a dismissal of the charge. At trial, the judge sustained the State\u2019s objection when, on cross-examination, she was asked if she had been arrested for drug possession, stating, unless there was a record of conviction, the question was improper. Even though the trial prosecutor was unaware of the witness\u2019s status, the Court held that he had a responsibility to be aware of that fact and to disclose the conditional discharge to the court and to defense counsel when the inquiry was made. <em>Id. </em>at 235, 353 A.2d 97. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>564, 621 A.2d 532 (App.Div.1993), we reversed defendant\u2019s conviction which was obtained, in part, due to the testimony of his co-defendant who, while testifying on his own behalf, implicated defendant. The trial prosecutor, as well as defendant, was unaware of the fact that the co-defendant had been arrested one week earlier on a charge of possession of a controlled dangerous substance with the intent to distribute. Moreover, the day after defendant was found guilty, the testifying co-defendant entered into a plea agreement with the State. Although no plea discussions had taken place earlier, the co-defendant\u2019s attorney conceded that he advised his client that it would be in his best interest to implicate defendant. We concluded that the State should have informed the defendant about his co-defendant\u2019s pending charge, and that failure deprived the defendant of the opportunity to cross-examine his co-defendant on the motivation for his testimony. Accordingly, we reversed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Finally, in assessing the cumulative effect of multiple instances of non-disclosure by the State, our Supreme Court has held that the suppression of evidence that could have been used to impeach the State\u2019s only eyewitness necessitated reversal. <em>State v. Knight, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 247-48, 678 A.2d 642. In urging the jury to find the witness credible, the assistant prosecutor had argued that the witness had \u201cabsolutely no reason to tell you anything but the truth\u201d. Prior to trial, the witness had pled guilty to a charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>possession of cocaine. The plea agreement called for a jail term of up to 364 days. The State failed to inform the defendant that at the witness\u2019 sentencing hearing a representative from the prosecutor\u2019s office told the sentencing judge that the witness was cooperating with the State in a murder investigation and had enabled the State to secure a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. The witness was. sentenced to time served, plus a small fine. The Court concluded that had counsel known these facts, the ability to impeach the witness\u2019 credibility would have been significantly enhanced and, accordingly, reversed defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Our research has failed to uncover any case in New Jersey considering the impact of the State\u2019s failure to disclose to the defense prior criminal convictions of a State\u2019s proposed witness. Indeed, <em>R. </em>3:13\u20143(c)(7) requires disclosure, during discovery, of any relevant record of prior convictions of persons whom the State knows has relevant evidence or information regarding the crime. In this credibility contest, Lovell had equal access and opportunity to possess the controlled dangerous substances. In those circumstances, we cannot, with any degree of confidence, conclude that defendant\u2019s inability to cross-examine Lovell regarding his prior conviction did not affect the outcome of these proceedings. This is particularly so in light of the critical nature of Lovell\u2019s testimony, coupled with facts that defendant was confronted on cross-examination with his prior convictions, and the length of the jury\u2019s deliberations, including its request for a read-back of Lovell\u2019s testimony. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the trial resulted in a verdict worthy of confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Although not necessary for our decision, for the sake of completeness, we have also considered defendant\u2019s contention that his conviction must be reversed because the State withheld evidence of Lovell\u2019s \u201cmental condition\u201d. The simple answer to that contention is that there is no evidence that the State was aware, actually or constructively, of any mental impairment of Lovell. If evidence of an impairment was obvious, it was equally obvious to defendant. In the absence of evidence that the State was aware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>an impairment, it cannot be held that the evidence was suppressed by the prosecution. Accordingly, the first <em>Brady </em>factor is not present. Moreover, the evidence was heard by the jury since Lovell testified that he was on medication for depression. Defendant has not, on this appeal, established that the evidence would have been favorable to him. There has been no showing that Lovell\u2019s condition affected his ability to perceive, recall or truthfully relate. Of course, on retrial, defendant may seek to establish that Lovell is not competent to testify, <em>State v. Butler, </em>27 <em>N.J. </em>560, 603-05, 143 A.2d 530 (1958), and that his condition or medication affected his ability to perceive, recall or relate. <em>State v.
