The motion judge granted Defense\u2019s motion to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds following amendment of the complaint to substitute Defense for a John Doe defendant after expiration of the statute of limitations but under circumstances where the substituted defendant had received actual notice of the complaint before expiration of the statute of limitations. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">On August 23,1996, Jan Vida died after the Garfield Police used pepper spray to subdue him. On December 2, 1997, a wrongful death action was commenced by Josef Vida, administrator <em>ad prosequendum. </em>The complaint named as defendants the City of Garfield, its police department, four police officers, Mace Security International, Inc. and fictitious individual and corporate defendants as allowed by <em>R. </em>4:26-4. One of the fictitious defendants was described as the manufacturer or distributor of the pepper spray used on the decedent. Plaintiff alleged product defect in design and manufacture of the pepper spray, as well as failure to warn of the dangerous propensities of the spray.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">On August 11, 1998, plaintiffs attorney learned the identity of the manufacturer and distributor of the pepper spray used on decedent. On that day, plaintiffs attorney forwarded a summons naming Defense and the complaint to Defense by certified mail. In his August 11, 1998 cover letter, plaintiffs counsel advised the president of Defense that \u201c[yjour company is being sued in connection with the death of Jan Vida on August 23, 1996----Your company is being substituted as a defendant for Mace International, Inc., since your company was the manufacturer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the pepper spray in question,____ The complaint will shortly be amended, via the \u2018John Doe\u2019 fictional defendants, to name your company as a defendant.\u201d Defense admits that it received the summons and complaint before August 23, 1998, the day the statute of limitations expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">On December 21, 1998, plaintiff moved to amend the complaint to substitute Defense as a defendant. An order permitting the amendment was filed on January 8, 1999. The First Amended Complaint was filed on January 20,1999. Defense filed its motion to dismiss and on September 2, 1999, an order was entered dismissing the amended complaint against Defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In his August 31, 1999, written opinion, the motion judge found that \u201cplaintiff did not act with reasonable diligence to ascertain the correct identity of the manufacturer/distributer.\u201d He noted that the location of the canister was never in question and the identity of the manufacturer/distributer could have been easily ascertained by a physical inspection of the cannister. The motion judge also reasoned that plaintiff should have filed a motion to amend the complaint on an emergent basis once plaintiff learned the identity of the manufacturer/distributer. In addition, the motion judge found that Defense \u201cwould be prejudiced by being at risk for punitive damages that would not be covered by its insurance policy.\u201d Finally, the motion judge held that a wrongful death action must be commenced within two years of the death of plaintiffs decedent and service of a summons and an unamended complaint prior to the expiration of the limitations period did not satisfy the requirements of the Wrongful Death Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-1 to -5 or constitute substantial compliance with the filing requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:31-3 provides that a wrongful death action must be commenced within two years of the death of the decedent and not thereafter. This limitation period has been considered a substantive statute of limitations. <em>Marshall v. Geo. M. Brewster &amp; Son, Inc., </em>68 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 403, 172 A.2d 458 (App.Div.1961), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>37 <em>N.J. </em>176, 180 A.2d 129 (1962). A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>substantive statute of limitations conditions not only the remedy but also the right. <em>Negron v. Llarena, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>296, 300, 716 A.2d 1158 (1998); <em>see 22A Am.Jur.2d Death </em>\u00a7\u00a7 57, 76 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">As a substantive statute of limitations, the limitation period of the Wrongful Death Act has been applied strictly. <em>Kaczmarek v. New Jersey Turnpike Auth., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>329, 339, 390 A.2d 597 (1978); <em>White v. Violent Crimes Compensation Bd., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>368, 374, 388 A.2d 206 (1978). On the other hand, the fictitious name practice allowed by <em>R. 4:26-4 </em>is permissible in a wrongful death action. <em>Brown v. Kennedy Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 587-88, 711 A.2d 1370 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>426, 719 A.2d 1024 (1998). Moreover, the Court has also held that there is nothing in the terms <em>of </em>the Wrongful Death Act which precludes application of the doctrine of substantial compliance. <em>Negron, supra, </em>15 <em>6 N.J. </em>at 304, 716 A.2d 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">In <em>Negron, </em>decedent\u2019s administratrix <em>ad prosequendum </em>commenced a timely wrongful death action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Christ Hospital, which is located in Jersey City. Jurisdiction was predicated on diversity of citizenship. 28 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1332. The matter was transferred to the federal court for the District of New Jersey. Soon thereafter, plaintiff filed a timely amended complaint naming two physicians, both residents of New Jersey. On November 28, 1994, the federal case was voluntarily dismissed due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the federal court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 16, 1995, four years and three weeks after decedent\u2019s death and two years and three weeks after the expiration of the statute of limitations, the complaint was re-filed in the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">'The Court rejected the argument that the action filed in the Law Division was time-barred. Justice Handler held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>doctrine of substantial compliance allows the flexible application of a statute in appropriate circumstances. <em>Negron, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 716 A.2d 1158. Specifically addressing the facts in <em>Negron, </em>Justice Handler stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">In the circumstances of this case where an action, though later dismissed, was filed within the time prescribed by the statute of limitations, we can turn initially to that doctrine [substantial compliance] to determine whether the condition implicit in the statute of limitations may be deemed to have been satisfied and whether plaintiffs complaint was timely filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">[ 156 <em>N.J. </em>at 304, 716 A.2d 1158 ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Ultimately, the Court concluded that application of the doctrine of substantial compliance was appropriate because the filing in federal court was timely, the filing in the Law Division was shortly after the dismissal in federal court, and defendant was not prejudiced because the case had been investigated and actively defended since its filing in federal court. Defendant was undeniably informed of the nature and substance of plaintiffs claim. <em>Id. </em>at 305, 716 A.2d 1158.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Applying the principles set forth in <em>Negron, </em>we conclude that the circumstances in this case warrant application of the doctrine of substantial compliance and require a reversal of the order dismissing the complaint against Defense. Statutes of limitations, whether substantive or procedural in nature, are designed to encourage the litigation of fresh complaints and to provide a defendant with prompt notice of a claim in order to prepare a defense to the claim. <em>Ochs v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>108, 112, 447 A.2d 163 (1982); <em>Galligan v. Westfield Centre Serv., Inc., </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>188, 191-92, 412 A.2d 122 (1980); <em>Staub v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 49-50, 726 A.2d 955 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>334, 736 A.2d 527 (1999). That was accomplished in this case. Twelve days before the expiration\u201d of the statute of limitations, Defense was informed of the existence and nature of plaintiffs claim against it. Defense cannot claim prejudice due to plaintiffs failure to file the necessary motion to amend the complaint quicker than it did; it knew within the time required by statute of the claim. Furthermore, plaintiffs reliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>on the efforts of the City\u2019s attorney to obtain the information concerning the identity of the manufacturer and distributor of the pepper spray was not altogether unreasonable. Both plaintiff and the City had an interest in identifying this party. Moreover, the information was received within the limitations period and plaintiff immediately took action to notify Defense of the existence of the claim. Under these unique circumstances, we hesitate to bar an action based on a technical defect. <em>Negron, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 305, 716 A.2d 1158; <em>Bernstein v. Board of Trustees of Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>71, 78, 376 A.2d 563 (App.Div.1977). The September 2, 1999 order dismissing the first amended complaint against Defense is reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> The amendment of the complaint adding the individual physicians destroyed the complete diversity of citizenship required for subject matter jurisdiction. No other basis existed to support subject matter jurisdiction in the federal court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
