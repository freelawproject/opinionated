Pierce was convicted of murder, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:113a(1)(count one); possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4a (count two); unlawful possession of a weapon, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:39-5b (count three); and first degree robbery, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1 (count four). The sentencing judge imposed an aggregate term of life imprisonment with a thirty-year period of parole disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">The incident giving rise to the defendant\u2019s conviction was an attempted robbery and murder of James Spencer on Southeast Avenue in Vineland at about 11:30 p.m. on Valentine\u2019s Day, February 14,1997. The State\u2019s proofs were that on February 14, 1997, at about 10:00 p.m. Iesha Barriente picked up her boyfriend, James Spencer, in her mother\u2019s car to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day. After dinner at about 11:30 p.m., they drove to an apartment in Millville to visit Spencer\u2019s brother, his cousin and Rasholi Woodard. After a few minutes, Spencer, Barriente and Woodard left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Spencer drove along Southeast Avenue with B amento in the passenger seat and Woodard in the rear. Spencer decided to make a phone call to his brother so he pulled over about eight feet from a phone booth near the Florence Park apartments. When Spencer walked to the phone booth, Barriente and Woodard saw a car park on the opposite side of the street and a man dressed in a black hooded sweatshirt or jacket walk to the phone booth next to the one used by Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">After Spencer finished his call, he walked toward the car when the other man spoke to him. Spencer continued walking and knocked on the passenger-side window. Barriente rolled down the window, and Spencer asked her the time. She told him it was about midnight. As Barriente rolled up her window, she heard the other man demand money from Spencer and Spencer respond that he had no money. The two men began to struggle next to the passenger side door. There was a gunshot. Both Barriente and Woodard saw the man point a handgun at Spencer\u2019s chest. After a second shot, Woodard saw feathers fly from the chest of Spencer\u2019s jacket. The two witnesses heard three or four gunshots in all.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Patrolman Nicholas Yuhas of the Vineland Police Department received a radio call of a shooting, arriving at the scene about a minute later. Yuhas tried to speak with Spencer who was lying on the pavement but did not get any response. Spencer was later pronounced dead as a result of two bullet wounds in his chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Woodard described the assailant as a Puerto Rican male, approximately six feet, one to two inches in height, 200 pounds and wearing a large hooded black coat. He said the man drove a bluish-green two-door hatchback, possibly a Hyundai. The police were never able to locate the vehicle fitting Woodard\u2019s description. A search of the crime scene revealed four bullet casings, but the handgun was never found.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">At the scene Barriente was unable to provide a description of the shooter. After she was taken to the Vineland police station, she gave a statement to Detective Louis Negron in which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>described the man as light-skinned, heavyset and having a \u201cchunky\u201d face. She did not notice any facial hair, but did observe that the man wore glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Detective John Brunetta interviewed Barriente in order to complete a composite sketch. She said that the assailant was six to ten feet from her, describing him as heavyset with a round face. She did not mention facial hair. Detective Brunetta completed a composite sketch that Barriente confirmed was a fair resemblance of the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Later that morning Sergeant Richard Calareso prepared and showed Barriente an array of six photographs including one of defendant taken on February 17, 1994, showing him with facial hair. Barriente did not select any of the six photographs. She testified at the trial that she believed one of the photographs resembled the assailant but did not make an identification at that time because the facial and head hair made her uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Barriente was also shown photographs within files maintained by Vineland police that were organized into sections for Hispanic and black males. She looked through about half of the Hispanic group before requesting to be excused at 4:30 a.m. because she was exhausted. On February 19, 1997, Barriente returned to the police station and completed reviewing all of the photographs in the Hispanic and black sections of the Vineland police files. Three photographs of defendant were contained in the files, but Barriente made no identification. She later testified at trial that one of the photographs she viewed resembled the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">The following day, February 20, 1997, Barriente reviewed another photographic array, which included a picture of defendant that was taken four days earlier. All of the photographs in this array had facial hair and were light skinned. This time Barriente chose defendant\u2019s photograph as depicting the person who shot Spencer. She told Detective Negron that she had seen defendant\u2019s face in the first array and in the file photographs, but did not say anything because she was unsure and still upset about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>At trial Barriente testified that on the night of the shooting she looked at the assailant for a couple of seconds and noticed that he wore glasses and that his face was chunky and light-skinned. She could not see any facial hair since a hood covered his head. She described the man as taller than Spencer, who was six feet, two inches tall, and heavyset, weighing about 200 pounds. She made an in-court identification of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Woodard testified that he knew the defendant and could not identify him as the shooter because he never saw the assailant\u2019s face. He said that the killer was light-skinned, possibly a Hispanic male, taller than Spencer and weighed about 200 pounds. Woodard did not observe any facial hair.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Defendant is a six foot, one inch tall Afro-American. At the time of his arrest, he weighed 286 pounds and had a beard.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The defense was alibi. Defendant\u2019s friend, Thomas Moore, testified that on February 14, 1997, at 9 p.m., defendant asked to meet him later that evening at the apartment of his sister, Yvonne Pierce. According to Moore, he arrived at the apartment at approximately 11:00 p.m., and defendant arrived a few minutes later. Moore said that when he left the apartment an hour later, defendant was still present.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Yvonne Pierce testified that defendant came to her apartment between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m. that evening. He left a few minutes before Moore arrived at 11:00 p.m. to get something from their mother\u2019s house and returned within ten to fifteen minutes. After Moore left at about midnight, defendant stayed at the apartment overnight. Yvonne testified that between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. she received a phone call from a Vineland police officer who told her that the police were looking for her brother. Although defendant was asleep on her couch, she told the officer that she did not know his whereabouts. She awoke defendant after the call and told him that the police were looking for him. When the police came to the apartment the next morning, Yvonne said again she did not know her brother\u2019s location.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Defendant testified that he arrived at his sister\u2019s apartment at approximately 6:30 p.m. He said he left the apartment at 10:45 p.m. to go to his mother\u2019s house and returned in fifteen to twenty minutes. He confirmed that his sister awakened him to tell him that the police called asking about him.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The State presented rebuttal testimony by Detective Negron who said that defendant called him on March 10, 1997, and asked to speak with him. Detective Negron met with defendant who told him that on February 14th he arrived at his sister\u2019s house at about 6:00 or 7:00 p.m. and stayed there the entire night. He did not say that he left to go to his mother\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Defendant sets forth the following arguments on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">I. THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO CHARGE THE LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF AGGRAVATED MANSLAUGHTER CONSTITUTED REVERSIBLE ERROR AND TRIAL COUNSEL\u2019S ACQUIESCENCE IN THIS REGARD DEPRIVED MR.

(Partially Raised Below.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">X. THE TRIAL COURT IMPOSED AN UNDULY HARSH AND MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE SENTENCE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">XI. THE VERDICT WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE AND VIOLATES THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">We conclude that the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury on identification was inadequate and constituted plain error (point II) and that the prosecutor made impermissible comments in summation regarding defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence (point IX).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">Identification was the key issue to be determined by the jury, and it also went to the heart of the alibi defense. Barriento\u2019s in-court and out-of-court identifications of defendant were based on a brief late night street encounter. There were inconsistencies between her initial description and the defendant\u2019s actual appearance. She was unable to make an identification of defendant as the assailant until the fifth time she viewed a photograph of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">Since there was no specific request to charge on the issue of identification and no objection to the instruction to the jury on that issue, defendant\u2019s arguments must be subject to the plain error rule. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>R. </em>1:8-7(a); <em>State v. Timmendequas, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>515, 576, 737 A.2d 55 (1999); <em>State v. Bogus, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 419, 538 A.2d 1278 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number><em>N.J. </em>567, 546 A.2d 497 (1988). Defendant must establish not only that there was error but that it was clearly capable of producing an unjust result. <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971). In the instance of a charging error, the qualitative assessment under the plain error rule is different than where other forms of judicial error are assigned since the clear capacity to produce an unjust result is more likely in the case of an erroneous or insufficient instruction to the jury. <em>State v. Vick, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>288, 289, 566 A.2d 531 (1989)(charging errors are usually considered \u201cpoor candidates\u201d for an appellate finding of harmless error); <em>see also State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2,15, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990); <em>State v. Warren, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579, 518 A.2d 218 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In a case in which eyewitness identification is a significant issue, a jury is not properly instructed as to the evaluation of such testimony by a general charge on credibility. <em>State v. Green, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>281, 290, 430 A.2d 914 (1981). A special charge is necessary because \u201c[t]he vagaries of eyewitness identification are well known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.\u201d <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>218, 228, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1926, 1933, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1158 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">In <em>Green </em>the Supreme Court held that under circumstances where identification is the key issue, a trial judge\u2019s failure to give a specific instruction to assist the jury\u2019s evaluation of eyewitness identification constituted reversible error. <em>State v. Green, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 293, 430 A.2d 914. An appropriate charge in such a ease would state that the State\u2019s burden of proof on the issue of identification is beyond a reasonable doubt and set forth the respective factual contentions relating to witness descriptions and identifications. <em>Ibid. </em>The Model Jury Charge on identification was considered suitable as a guide. <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Malloy, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>525, 534-36, 736 A.2d 532 (App.Div.1999). The Model Charge in this instance is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">In order to meet its burden with respect to the identification of the culprit the State has presented the testimony of the witness__You will recall that this witness identified the defendant in court as the person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>committed the offense. According to the witness, (his/her) identification of the defendant in court is based upon the observations and perceptions which (he/she) made of the defendant on the scene at the time the offense was being committed. It is your function as jurors to determine what weight, if any, to give to this testimony. You must decide whether it is sufficiently reliable evidence upon which to conclude that this defendant is the person who committed the offense charged. In going about your task you should consider the testimony of the witness in the light of the customary criteria concerning credibility as I have explained them to you. It is particularly appropriate that you consider the capacity or the ability of the witness to make observations or perceptions as you gauge it to be and that you consider the opportunity which the witness had at the time and under all of the attendant circumstances for seeing that which (he/she) says (he/she) saw or that which (he/she) says (he/she) perceived with regard to (his/her) identification of the person who committed the alleged offense. <em>(Here consider briefly reviewing the conflicting contentions of the State and the defendants relating to the above.) </em>Unless the in-eourt identification results from the observations or perceptions of the defendant by the witness during the commission of the crime rather than being the product of an impression gained at the out-of-court identification procedure it should be afforded no weight. Thus the ultimate issue of the trustworthiness of an in-court identification is for you to decide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">If, after a consideration of all of the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the defendant as the person present at the time and place of the crime you must acquit (him/her). If) however, after a consideration of all of the evidence you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s presence at the scene you will then consider whether the State has proved each and every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">Model Jury Charges (Criminal), \u201cIdentification\u201d (1990)(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">The identification charge given by the trial judge in the instant case was the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">Now, as you\u2019re certainly well aware of in this case, of prime consideration is the issue of identification. Defendant as part of his general denial of guilt contends that the State has not presented sufficient, reliable evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he is the person who committed the alleged offense. Where the identity of the person who committed the crime is an issue, the burden of proving that identity is upon the State. The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant is the person who committed the crime. The defendant has neither the burden nor the duty to show that the crime, if committed, was committed by someone else, or to prove the identity of that person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-10\">You must determine, therefore, not only whether the State has proven each and every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt that this is the defendant\u2014that this defendant is the person who committed it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">This truncated version of the Model Charge is insufficient to focus the jury on the particular credibility issue of eyewitness identification central to the proper determination of this case. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>State v. Green, supra, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>at 292, 430 A.2d 914; <em>State v. Malloy, supra, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 536-37, 736 A.2d 532; <em>State v. Edmonds, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>113, 118, 679 A.2d 725 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>148 <em>N.J. </em>459, 690 A.2d 606 (1997). It is not always necessary to supplement the special charge approved by <em>State v. Green, supra, </em>or the Model Charge with particularized comments on inconsistencies or contradictions within the State\u2019s identification testimony, particularly when the issue is raised as plain error. <em>State v. Swint, </em>328 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 259-60, 745 A.2d 570 (App.Div.2000); <em>State v. Walker, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 547-50, 731 A.2d 545 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>487, 744 A.2d 1209 (1999); <em>but see, State v. Edmonds, supra, </em>293 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 118, 679 A.2d 725 (victim\u2019s in-eourt and out-of-court identifications were \u201cglaringly inconsistent,\u201d requiring trial judge to tailor the charge to the facts of the ease). However, after consideration of the entire record including the direct and cross-examinations of Iesha Barriente and Rasholi Woodard as well as the summation of counsel, we find that the abbreviated identification charge submitted to the jury in this case failed to satisfy the minimum requirement of <em>State v. Green </em>and was therefore plain error requiring reversal. <em>See State v. Walker, supra, </em>322 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 547, 731 A.2d 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Further trial error resulted from the comments of the prosecutor concerning defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence. Defendant was arrested on other charges on February 16, 1997, and was served on February 20, 1997, with the complaint related to the homicide. On March 10, 1997, defendant called the Vineland Police Department and subsequently advised them that on the night of the murder, February 14, 1997, he spent the night at his sister\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant included the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">Q: Now, on March the 10th of 1997 you contacted Detective Negron and requested to speak with him; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">A: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Q: And of that date you told Detective Negron that you had been at your sister, Yvonne\u2019s, apartment the night of February the 14th of 1997, and you didn\u2019t go out at all during that entire evening; isn\u2019t that what you told Detective Negron?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">A: I don\u2019t recall the statement unless I see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">Q: <em>You hadn\u2019t told Detective Negron, or for that matter any member of the Vineland Police Department, until March the 10th of1997 where you were on the evening of February Hth; is that correct sir?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\"><em>A: </em>That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">No objection was taken to this line of questioning on cross-examination. The prosecutor re-called Detective Negron as a rebuttal witness and elicited that neither he nor any member of the Vineland Police Department had been told of defendant\u2019s whereabouts on February 14, 1997, until his interview with defendant on March 10, 1997. No objection was taken to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">In summation, the prosecutor commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\"><em>And let\u2019s remember what the testimony was. Not until March the 10th of 1997 did Carl Pierce indicate to Detective Negron or any other member of the Vineland Police Department that he couldn\u2019t have committed this crime because he was at the home of his sister\u2014the apartment of his sister on the night of February Hth. </em>How reliable is that information, given the fact of the time lapse between February the 16lh and March 10th when the decision was made to arrest Carl Pierce? You\u2019re talking about close to three weeks, 18 days. How reliable is that testimony that comes out almost three weeks later?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">You know, common sense. Wouldn\u2019t common sense dictate to you that the first thing you would say to the Vineland Police is, \u201cOh, wait a minute. I couldn\u2019t have done it. February 14th. No. No, I was at my sister\u2019s house all that evening. And here\u2019s who else was there.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t common sense dictate to you that that\u2019s the first thing you would say? And not wait three weeks to bring\u2014or is it more reasonable, more logical, to suggest that the three-week period, the three-week hiatus, was necessary in order to come up with an alibi that would make sense? Let\u2019s think about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-15\">No objection was taken to these comments by the prosecutor. No curative instruction was requested, and none was given by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>No inculpatory inference may be permissibly drawn from a defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent following his arrest. <em>Doyle v.

Hyde, </em>292 <em>N.J.Super </em>159, 160, 678 A.2d 717 (App.Div.1996), that \u201csilence will carry no penalty,\u201d and our Supreme Court held over two decades ago that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">a defendant is under no obligation to volunteer to the authorities at the first opportunity the exculpatory story he later tells at his trial and cannot be penalized directly or indirectly if he does not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\"><em>[State v. Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 115, 358 A.2d 163.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The State argues that the comments of the prosecutor were proper in that they were directed to assert that defendant\u2019s alibi defense was a fabrication. This argument was specifically rejected by us in <em>State v. Aceta, supra, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 31-32, 537 A.2d 1317. A defendant\u2019s right of silence is of constitutional dimension. No direct testimony or cross-examination is permitted to erode this right. A prosecutor may not comment as to defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence to impeach his exculpatory story at trial. <em>State v. Deatore, supra, </em>70 <em>N.J. </em>at 115-16, 358 A.2d 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The comments by the prosecutor cannot be considered harmless error. This was a close case with substantial reliance upon identification testimony by an eyewitness who had a brief and traumatic encounter with the assailant and showed uncertainty in her description and identification. The claim of alibi was at the very heart of the defense case. This unfair broadside attack of the prosecutor taken together with the absence of any curative instruction was clearly capable of producing an unjust result and was, therefore, plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">We deem it unnecessary to comment on the other issues raised in light of our determination that the trial errors discovered require reversal and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
