Both appeals project the same issue and we consolidate them for purposes of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-15\">Both defendants pled guilty to conspiracy to commit robbery <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2) and robbery <em>(N.J.S.A </em>2C:15\u20141); in addition, defendant Pierre pled guilty to unlawful possession of a weapon <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-5d) and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-4d). Both had been indicted for first degree robbery but the State agreed, as part of the plea bargain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>to recommend that each be sentenced as a second degree offender. For DeVeaux, the State agreed to recommend a sentence of five years in prison, for Pierre, seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">While DeVeaux served as lookout, Pierre approached a man in the lobby of an apartment building and demanded money. Pierre held a small knife, wrapped in a T-shirt. His purpose in wrapping the knife in that manner, Pierre said when entering his guilty plea, was \u201cto conceal the knife so that\u2014looked as if it was a gun.\u201d The knife, estimated at some three inches in length, had to be manually opened; it remained closed during the entire incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The State took the position that each defendant was subject to the No Early Release Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7.2, and each defendant, when he pled guilty, reserved the right to contest that issue at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">At sentencing, after argument on that issue, the trial court agreed with defendants and ruled that the concealed knife used in this incident did not constitute a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d. The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred and was required to impose the parole disqualifications of <em>N.J.S.A </em>20:43-7.2 upon these defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The trial court\u2019s conclusion that the concealed knife was not a deadly weapon within the purview of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d is in accord with recent decisions. <em>See, e.g., State v. Burford, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>16, 746 A.2d 998 (2000) (defendant\u2019s use of a stolen automobile to elude police and his reckless striking of another automobile during the chase did not make the stolen automobile a deadly weapon under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-7.2d); <em>State v. Grawe, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 744 A.2d 246 (App.Div.2000) (hammer used to break a display case during the course of a robbery not a deadly weapon for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">We affirm, substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Harriet Klein in her written opinion, <em>State v. Pierre, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>588, 748 A.2d 654 (Law Div.1999).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
