The waiver was accepted by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Defendant was found guilty at the ensuing bench trial. He was sentenced to a five-year term concurrent with sentences aggregating fifteen years of incarceration with six years of parole ineligibility imposed with respect to four other pending indictments. Defendant had pled guilty to the other four indictments pursuant to the terms of a plea bargain agreement made with the county prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Factually, defendant\u2019s indictment for possession of CDS was scheduled for trial on March 26, 1997. Defendant did not appear for trial on that date. In a pretrial colloquy between the judge and counsel, defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the judge proceeding with the case without defendant\u2019s presence. According to defendant\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">I can .. not say that I have had any contact -with Mr. Mazza to confirm or deny or give any information to the court about whether his absence here is voluntary or not. However, Judge, I am going to put an objection on the record to proceeding in his absence. When these matters were cutoff, the March 24 date was set. However, it was made clear to Mr. Mazza in my discussions with him that I expected to be trying the arson case first, not the drug case. Unfortunately or fortunately for Mr. Mazza the plea form that was filled out on ... December 3rd doesn\u2019t specifically refer to the fact that the trial can be tried without him if he did not appear, and I have no notes or recollection that that was ever said to Mr. Mazza.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">The judge denied defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request to adjourn the proceedings stating that \u201cit appears for all intents and purposes with no communication from Mr. Mazza that his not appearing here is an effort on his part to avoid prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">Immediately after the judge\u2019s denial of the adjournment, defendant\u2019s counsel requested a trial without a jury. According to defendant\u2019s counsel, a bench trial was requested because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>... I\u2019m going to be making dozens of decisions that I would normally be consulting-my client about, and the decision to proceed without a jury is one of those decisions. If he was here I would be consulting him about it and I would most likely be recommending to proceed without a jury. There\u2019s no way for me to know what his decision would be concerning that, but I believe that under the circumstances of you making a decision [that] we can proceed without him and that he\u2019s voluntarily absented himself that he\u2019s basically allowing me to make those decisions for him. I believe this ease should proceed without a jury, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m requesting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In granting the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s request for a bench trial, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">The rule certainly does provide that with respect to waiver of a jury trial that the\u2014\u2022 if a defendant is here he must waive it freely and voluntarily, and the waiver must be in writing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">We do not have the defendant here, and counsel for the defendant has stated that were the defendant here she would have recommended to him that he be tried without a jury. She is now in a position where she must make decisions alone, and I don\u2019t believe there are any cases at least in this state that deal with this issue as to whether a defendant who\u2019s going to be tried in absentia can be tried without a jury on an indictable charge, but under the circumstances here, the court will grant the application and the case will be tried without a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">At the bench trial the prosecution presented two witnesses. The defense presented none. After the presentation of the case, the judge stated that he \u201cconclud[ed] beyond a reasonable doubt that [defendant was] guilty of possessing both the heroin and the cocaine.\u201d The judge did not set a date for sentencing because defendant was yet to be apprehended. When subsequently apprehended, defendant\u2019s sentence was imposed as stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Defendant argues that his counsel\u2019s waiver of his right to a trial by jury violated his constitutional rights and contravened <em>R. </em>1:8-1(a). According to the State, \u201cDefendant\u2019s argument should fail as he voluntarily absented himself from the trial process and thereby relinquished all trial decisions to his attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">Both the Federal and State Constitutions grant to an accused the right to public trial by an impartial jury. <em>U.S. Const. </em>amend. VI; <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, \u00b6 10. Under certain circumstances, the right is waivable. While a defendant has the absolute right to be present at every stage of the trial, <em>U.S. Const, </em>amend. VI; <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, \u00b6 10; <em>R. </em>3:16, a court may try the defendant <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>absentia </em>where it finds that defendant voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to be present during the trial and that his absence was inexcusable. <em>State v. Ellis, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 447, 691 A.2d 403 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>74, 697 A.2d 546 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In relevant part, <em>R. </em>l:8-l(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">Criminal actions required to be tried by a jury shall be so tried unless the defendant, in writing and with approval of the court, after notice to the prosecuting attorney and an opportunity to be heard, waives a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">A fundamental requirement for waiver of the right to a jury trial is that it \u201cbe knowing and intelligent.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 550, 640 A.2d 863 (App.Div.1994), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>450, 663 A.2d 1358 (1995); <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>218, 237, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2041, 2053, 36 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>854, 868-69 (1973) (citing <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 <em>U.S. </em>269, 63 <em>S.Ct. </em>236, 87 <em>L.Ed. </em>268 (1942)) (defendant\u2019s waiver of jury trial must be express, intelligent and competent); <em>Patton v. United States, </em>281 <em>U.S. </em>276, 312, 50 <em>S.Ct. </em>253, 263, 74 <em>L.Ed. </em>854, 870 (1930) (defendant\u2019s consent to waiver of jury trial must be \u201cexpress and intelligent\u201d). \u201cWhether a waiver is given knowingly \u2018depends upon whether the totality of the circumstances supports that conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson, supra, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 550, 640 A.2d 863 (quoting <em>State v. Koedatich, </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>225, 328, 548 A.2d 939 (1988) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 <em>U.S. </em>1017, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>813, 102 L.Ed.2d 803 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">In <em>State v. Wyman, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>565, 557 A.2d 1043 (App.Div.1989), this Court set forth what would constitute a valid waiver of the right to a jury trial where the defendant had not expressly articulated in writing his desire for a bench trial. In <em>Wyman, </em>we determined that the mere fact that waiver of a jury trial was not in writing would not fatally taint a subsequent bench trial. <em>Id. </em>at 568, 557 A.2d 1043. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">The requirement of R. 3 :S\u20141(a) that a defendant\u2019s waiver of a jury trial be in writing is not jurisdictional and the failure to comply therewith will not constitute a fatal defect in the conviction where the defendant in open court expressly and understandingly personally waives Ms right to a jury trial. <em>See State v. Paolino, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>284, 285, 265 A.2d 398 (App.Div.1970), <em>certif. denied, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>127, 270 A.2d 30 (1970). <em>See also United States v. Saadya, </em>750 F.2d 1419, 1420 (9th Cir.1985). <em>Cf. State v. Ciniglio, </em>57 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 404-406, 154 A.2d 845 (App.Div.1959), <em>certif. denied </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>295, 157 A.2d 364 (1960). A defendant\u2019s mere acquiescence in proceeding without a jury, however, is not sufficient to constitute a waiver of his right to a jury trial. <em>See Landry v. Hoepfner, </em>818 F.2d 1169, 1178 (5th Cir.1987), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds on reh\u2019g en bane, </em>840 <em>F.2d </em>1201 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert denied </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>1083, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>1540, 103 L.Ed.2d 844 (1989).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Thus, we concluded in <em>Wyman </em>that waiver by a defendant of a trial by jury must either be in writing as required by <em>R. </em>1:8-1(a) or expressly and understanding^ made by the defendant on the court record. <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Jackson, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 550, 640 A.2d 863 (App.Div.1994) (citing <em>Wyman, supra, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 568, 557 A.2d 1043, and agreeing that either a written request or a clear statement on the trial court record will suffice to waive a jury trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The State contends that when defendant absented himself, he \u201crelinquished to his attorney the responsibility to make the decision whether to try the case with or without a jury.\u201d This perspective is at odds with <em>Wyman\u2019s </em>statement that \u201ctrial courts and prosecutors should make certain that a waiver of a jury trial be in writing and signed by the defendant as required by <em>R. </em>1:8-1(a), or that the defendant personally place on the record in open court an express and understanding waiver of his or her right to such a trial.\u201d <em>Wyman, supra, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 568, 557 A.2d 1043.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Under the circumstances, in the absence of defendant\u2019s presence in open court, his counsel had no right to waive his constitutional right to trial by jury. Consequently, his conviction for possession of CDS under the Monmouth County Grand Jury indictment is reversed. We need not address defendant\u2019s remaining argument that the sentence rendered was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
