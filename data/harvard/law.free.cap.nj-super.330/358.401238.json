Plaintiffs unsuccessfully sought to challenge the constitutionality of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-193b, which exempted existing LOSAPs from the requirement that the creation of such programs be submitted to the district voters on a referendum basis, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-185c. In effect, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-193 grandfathered existing programs at the time of the enactment of the \u201cEmergency Services Volunteer Length of Service Award Program Act,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-183 <em>et seq. </em>(L. 1997, c. 388, effective January 19, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Plaintiffs argue that (1) the trial judge erred in improperly applying a rational basis test; (2) the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-193b ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>emption of preexisting LOSAPs from the referendum requirement violated due process and equal protection requirements under the federal and state constitutions; (3) the judge erred in holding that the statute was not unconstitutional special legislation prohibited by <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. IV, \u00a7 7, \u00b6 7 and 9(8); and (4) the judge erred in holding that the grandfather clause in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40A:14-193 was enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We have considered plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in light of the record and are satisfied that the Law Division\u2019s disposition of the matter was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed in Judge Serpentelli\u2019s written opinion, reported at 320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>132, 726 A.2d 1004 (Law Div.1998).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
