It involves the death of an innocent motorist killed in an automobile crash with defendant while he was fleeing from the police. The critical and interesting issues before us, together with numerous other claims also raised, deal with whether the chase was sufficiently related to felonious conduct so as to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction for felony murder. We conclude that there was enough evidence before the jury to sustain both defendant\u2019s convictions for robbery and for felony murder because the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>occurred during the \u201cimmediate\u201d flight from one of those robberies. We further conclude that, while a charge on the crime of manslaughter by eluding, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:11-4b(3), should have been given as a lesser included offense to felony murder and aggravated manslaughter if requested, the absence of such a request precludes reversal of the surviving felony murder conviction. We also merge some of the convictions and reject defendant\u2019s other claims without prejudice to a petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Defendant was indicted for felony murder, <em>N.J.SA. </em>2C:11-3a(3) (count one), aggravated manslaughter, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4a (count two), resisting arrest, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:29-2 (count three), eluding a police officer, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b (count seven), seven counts of aggravated assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-1b (counts four, five, six, eight, nine and eleven), three counts of robbery, <em>N.J.SA. </em>2C:15-1 (counts ten, twelve and thirteen), burglary and theft of an automobile, <em>N.J.SA. </em>2C:18-2 and 20:20-3 (counts fourteen and fifteen), and theft of a credit card, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:21-6c (count sixteen). Defendant was convicted on all charges except counts eight and nine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judge merged counts seven (eluding in a manner creating the risk of death), ten and eleven (robbery and aggravated assault of Gloria Miskerik) into count one (the felony murder conviction), and also merged the conviction on count three for resisting arrest into the conviction for aggravated assault on Police Officer Skinner (count four). Defendant was sentenced to fifty years in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, with thirty years to be served before parole eligibility on the felony murder and to concurrent sentences on the other convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Defendant raises numerous arguments on this appeal. The contentions are listed in their entirety in appendix A. However, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>find that only the following discussion is necessary with respect to the issues raised. <em>R. </em>2:ll\u2018-3(e)(2). With respect to others, suffice it to say that our rejection of some of the following arguments concerning the trial, proceedings can also be related to the contentions concerning the grand jury and indictment, and that we find no basis on which to dismiss the indictment or any count even assuming a timely challenge thereto. <em>R. </em>3:10-2(c). <em>See, e.g., State v. Hogan, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>216, 235-39, 676 A.2d 533 (1996); <em>State v. New Jersey Trade Waste Ass\u2019n, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>8, 18-19, 472 A.2d 1050 (1984); <em>State v. Ball, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 119-20, 632 A.2d 1222 (App.Div.1993), aff<em>'d, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>142, 661 A.2d 251 (1995); <em>State v. Holsten, </em>223 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 583-85, 539 A.2d 325 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence that he committed robberies, as opposed to thefts from the person. He further contends that, even if there was sufficient proof to sustain a robbery conviction, the proofs were insufficient to relate any robbery to the subsequent police chase, so as to provide the necessary nexus between the felony of robbery and the victim\u2019s death. Stated differently, defendant indicates that there was insufficient proof that the automobile crash occurred during the immediate flight from a robbery. However, there is no dispute that felony murder \u201cis committed when the actor ... is engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or <em>flight after committing </em>or attempting to commit robbery ..., and in the course of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, any person causes the death of a person other than one of the participants .... \u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(3) (emphasis added). Independently, a robbery occurs if \u201cin the course of committing a theft,\u201d the actor \u201cinflicts bodily injury\u201d (or threatens or puts the victim in fear of such injury) or \u201cuses force upon another,\u201d and if such force or injury occurs during the \u201cimmediate flight after the attempt or commission\u201d of the theft, that itself constitutes a robbery. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1a. <em>See also State v. Mirault, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>492, 497-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>501, 457 A.2d 455 (1983) (upholding robbery conviction where the injury was to a third-party arresting police officer). The parties focus on whether there was sufficient proof that the thefts involved force or injury sufficient to sustain a conviction for robbery and, if so, whether the police chase and the ultimate death of the victim were sufficiently related to a robbery for purposes of the felony murder statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">This appeal involves the breaking into and theft of a car followed by three separate thefts/robberies by a perpetrator in that car, and the ensuing pursuit of defendant that resulted in the death of a third-party. At approximately 10:30 a.m. on June 18, 1996, Charles McHarris dropped off his 1991 Ford Explorer for servicing at Joe and Joe\u2019s Service Station in Riverdale. McHarris parked the car on the side of the lot, left the keys in the car, and informed the service station attendant, Sam Gonzalez, of its presence. Gonzalez responded that it was \u201cfine.\u201d At around 2:15 p.m. Gonzalez left the station for lunch, at which time he noticed that McHarris\u2019 vehicle was still on the lot. However, when Gonzalez returned to the station at about 2:45 p.m. McHarris\u2019 car was missing. When Gonzalez could not reach McHarris to ask him about the car, he feared that the car had been stolen, and called the Riverdale Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The police arrived at the service station at around 3:00 p.m. to fill out a report, and were also able to contact Mrs. McHarris, who told the police that she would get in contact with her husband. In responding to a page from his wife, McHarris called the Riverdale Police, at which time he was informed that his vehicle was missing. McHarris then went to the police station to speak to a detective about his vehicle. While at the police station, McHarris heard his name announced over the State Police Emergency Network (\u201cSPEN\u201d) radio, indicating that he was involved in a purse snatching in Clifton. McHarris, of course, immediately reported that he was not involved in any purse snatching since, as they could see, he was in the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The first purse snatching occurred after 4:00 in the afternoon of June 18. Vera Rattansingh got off work at that time and drove to the Bradlees store in Clifton. As she was walking toward the store, a vehicle described as a black Ford Explorer pulled beside her and the driver asked her for directions to Main Street in Nutley. Rattansingh responded that she was not sure, but she would look on a map for him as long as he would move his car so that he would not block traffic. While Rattansingh looked for the street on a map, she realized that the man in the vehicle was attempting to take the purse off her shoulder. According to Rattansingh, \u201che pulled with so much force that he got the bag off my shoulder and I fell to the ground.\u201d The car ran over Rattansingh\u2019s left instep of her foot, and her arm and buttocks were bruised.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Shortly thereafter, the Clifton Police Department received a telephone call from an unidentified person who gave the license plate number of the vehicle involved. The number was then entered into the National Crime Information Center computer as a vehicle involved in a robbery. The following day, Rattansingh was called to police headquarters to view a photo lihe-up. She identified defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Shortly after the theft of Rattansingh\u2019s purse, at around 5:00 p.m. on June 18, Diane Dorry walked in the parking lot of the Paramus Park Mall. As Dorry was walking from her vehicle to the mall she heard a man say \u201cexcuse me.\u201d She turned around and a man in a black Explorer asked her for directions to the Garden State Parkway. Dorry walked up to the car window and began giving him directions when he grabbed the handle of her purse and accelerated the vehicle. She let go of the purse in fear that she might be dragged by the moving ear. She described that force was used because of the \u201cpull on [her] shoulder ... at the tim\u00e9 he was accelerating the gas.\u201d Dorry was not injured. Dorry then ran through the parking lot yelling for \u201chelp\u201d and \u201cpolice.\u201d Dorry eventually found the mall police, but was unable to find or identify the ear. She went to the Paramus Police Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>around 10:00 p.m. to give a statement of what had occurred. Dorry also identified a photo of defendant as the man in the car who stole her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The third incident also occurred on the same day, while seventy-four year old Gloria Miskerik was shopping with her friend at Lord &amp; Taylor\u2019s in the Fashion Center Mall, also in Paramus. The women finished shopping at around 5:00 p.m., when they began walking back to their car. A car, described by Miskerik as a dark van, approached the women and stopped to ask for directions to the Garden State Parkway. While the two women were conversing about who was to give him directions, the man reached out of the car window, grabbed Miskerik\u2019s purse and \u201cfloored\u201d the vehicle. Miskerik did not let go of the purse. She ran with the accelerating car until eventually she fell to the ground and was forced to let go of her purse. Miskerik was seriously injured by the moving car, leaving her with severe cuts to her head and shoulder, and a blood clot in her left hip.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The police eventually spoke to Miskerik in the hospital where she and her friend identified defendant from a photograph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">While defendant was stealing Miskerik\u2019s purse, an off-duty police officer, Albert Maas, was parking his car. He witnessed the entire event. Maas immediately directed another shopper to call 9-1-1 while he attended to the injured Miskerik. He then spoke to Paramus Police on the phone to give the dispatcher additional information regarding what he characterized as a \u201crobbery.\u201d Eventually an ambulance and the police arrived, at which point Maas described the event again, although he was unable to provide the police with a license plate number.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">At 5:36 p.m., Patrolman Richard Skinner of the Washington Township Police Department heard over the SPEN radio a broadcast from the Paramus Police Department that \u201ca second purse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>snatching with injuries\u201d had just occurred, and the broadcast described the vehicle used in the incidents as a black Ford Explorer. Officer Skinner also indicated that the license plate number was broadcast and stuck in his head because of the unusual beginning, \u201cA-A-A.\u201d At this point he recalled the earlier Clifton alarm that also identified a black Ford Explorer involved in a purse snatching and containing a license plate number beginning with \u201cA-A-A.\u201d Skinner testified that he \u201crecognized the vehicle just because the A-A-A stood out in my mind and also that it was a black Ford Explorer. I myself drove a black Ford Explorer so it kind of stuck in my head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Officer Skinner was then instructed by his tour commander, Patrolman John Ryan Smith, to \u201ccheck Linwood Avenue to see if, you know, the vehicle might come off the highway out of Paramus and that he would go to East Glen Avenue.\u201d As Skinner approached Linwood Avenue he observed a black Ford Explorer with license plates matching the SPEN dispatch stopped at a traffic light. Skinner knew \u201cthat the vehicle might contain the perpetrator who the police were looking for in purse snatches.\u201d As Skinner approached the car, he was able to identify the driver of the vehicle as matching the broadcast description of the man involved in the purse snatchings.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">At this point, Officer Skinner verified the license plate on his mobile computer terminal and turned his vehicle around to follow defendant. Thereupon defendant \u201cpassed the vehicles on the right side and then just shot through the stop sign.\u201d Skinner then activated his overhead lights and sirens, radioed headquarters to alert them that he found defendant, and continued to follow the vehicle south on Paseack Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">At about 5:40 p.m., Mariana Hickson was also driving south on Paseack Road in Paramus when she heard police sirens and was then unexpectedly hit in the rear passenger side of her vehicle by what she described as a \u201cdark colored large vehicle.\u201d Defendant continued \u201caround\u201d Hickson\u2019s vehicle, while she pulled over to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>inspect her car. Hickson observed two police cars speed after the fleeing defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Since traffic was heavy at the intersection of Oradell Avenue, thereby preventing defendant from turning right, he pulled into a Texaco Gas Station. Officer Skinner followed. Defendant then attempted to exit the gas station through another exit, but Skinner blocked that exit with his vehicle. As Skinner began to exit his car, defendant \u201crammed\u201d the right front fender of the patrol car, causing Officer Skinner to hit his head on the ear door jamb. Defendant was then able to exit the gas station and started to head north on Pascack Road. Officer Skinner drew his weapon, ran toward the defendant\u2019s car, and ordered him to stop. Defendant nonetheless continued to head north on Pascack Road, Officer Skinner returned to his car and attempted to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">At this point, Officer Skinner lost sight of defendant, but he noticed a man on the side of the road yelling, \u201che went down that way, he went down that way,\u201d pointing down Bedford Court. Skinner radioed to headquarters the location where defendant was heading, and turned down Bedford Court where he noticed the black Ford Explorer parked next to the curb on Rutgers Place. As Skinner approached the vehicle, defendant took off again, and Skinner followed him back onto Pascack Road. At this point, Officer Skinner described that defendant \u201cwas driving fast and recklessly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">In the interim, Officer Smith had the traffic stopped at the intersection of Pascack Road and Oradell Avenue, so as to block defendant from continuing down Pascack Road. However, defendant avoided Smith, and turned left down Oradell Avenue while Skinner followed close behind. At this point, other police vehicles joined the chase.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">As defendant approached and continued through the intersection of Oradell Avenue and Kinderkamack Road, Officer Skinner was \u201closing ground,\u201d although his lights and sirens were on. He watched defendant \u201cswerve back and forth\u201d and drive on the wrong side of the street going \u201cin the wrong lane of traffic.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>According to Skinner, \u201c[u]p ahead I could see that there was some type of accident, it looked like the Ford Explorer impacted with something however, I couldn\u2019t tell what had happened or what it had hit.\u201d As he approached, Skinner saw a red Chevrolet Blazer pushed \u201cup on the curb on the other side of a tree,\u201d and that defendant\u2019s vehicle had come to a stop. As Skinner was arriving, defendant exited the Ford Explorer and started running down the street. Skinner followed him on foot while other police cars arrived at the accident scene. Officer Albert Lepera of the Paramus Police Department joined Officer Skinner in the chase on foot. Meanwhile Lieutenant Richard Kuiters pulled his car in front of defendant to block his path, and Lepera was able to tackle defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The medical examiner declared the driver of the red Blazer, Stephanie Carroll, dead at the scene. He attributed the cause of death to \u201cmultiple fractures and injuries\u201d from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">On cross-examination of Officer Skinner, the following was developed concerning the reasons Officer Skinner chased defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">Q: Now you\u2019re aware that at this time you\u2019re chasing him for three purse snatches, one of which is with injury although you don\u2019t know how great an injury, correct? In part that\u2019s why you\u2019re chasing.him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">A: I\u2019m chasing him for three robberies with an injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">Q: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">A: Purse snatchings is how they came over the radio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">Q: Right. They came over as purse snatches, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\">Q: They didn\u2019t use the word robbery, did they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-14\">A: They did not use the word robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">Q: These are fellow police officers who you assume are conversant with the legal term robbery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-16\">A: I would say they are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-17\">Q: But they didn\u2019t choose to use the term robbery? You never heard the term robbery, you heard purse snatches? 0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-18\">A: I heard purse snatching. I know that taking somebody\u2019s\u2014depriving somebody of their property with the use of force is a robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Q: Other than the fact that you heard that there was an injury you did not know that there was force used in these three purse snatches, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">A; Other than the fact there was an injury, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">Q: You didn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">A; I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">Q: And the injury, you had no idea how severe or how minimal it was, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">A: I didn\u2019t know the extent of the injury, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">Q: You also knew that the person driving that vehicle ahead of you and you were pursuing was driving a stolen motor vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-12\">A: I knew that, that\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">Q: So you had three purse snatches, one with injuries that\u2014of a degree you don\u2019t know, a stolen five year old car, and you made the decision on Oradell Avenue when this man who had already had a gun pointed at him, who had repeatedly driven head-on into traffic, again went into\u2014head-on into traffic, you made the decision to continue the pursuit? Is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-14\">A: Based on three purse snatchings, in your words, an injury, a stolen vehicle and the fact that he rammed my police car I felt that he was that dangerous and that I should follow him until he stops and exits the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-15\">Q. Let me ask you a question, Officer; why did you think he was driving so fast and so recklessly if it wasn\u2019t to get away from you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-16\">A. I never disputed the fact he was trying to get away from me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-17\">Officer Lepera testified that he believed the radio transmission indicated that there were two strong arm robberies within about 15 minutes of each other in Paramus and \u201cthat Clifton has also had a strong arm robbery with a vehicle matching the same description.\u201d Lepera joined the pursuit when he saw the Ford Explorer and Skinner\u2019s police car pass through the intersection of Oradell and Forest Avenues.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-18\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-19\">We are satisfied that the proofs warranted the three convictions of robbery, <em>State v. Sein, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>209, 590 A.2d 665 (1991), and that there was no reversible error in the jury charge relating to the robberies of Rattansingh and Dorry and the first degree robbery of Miskerik. The purses of Dorry and Rattansingh were taken by defendant while driving a moving vehicle, thereby dragging or pulling the victims. With respect to Miskerik, defendant was convicted of second-degree aggravated assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>during the incident, thus elevating the offense to a first-degree robbery. However, given the merger of the Miskerik robbery into the felony murder, the degree of robbery is insignificant. A robbery in the first or second degree can be a predicate felony for felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In his jury instructions, the judge charged that to convict for robbery, the State \u201cmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that while in the course of committing [the] theft the defendant knowingly inflicted bodily injury or used force upon another or he purposely put ... that person in fear of immediate bodily injury.\u201d He repeated that \u201c[i]n addition to proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in the course of committing a theft, the State must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that while in the course of committing that theft the defendant knowingly inflicted bodily injury or he used force upon another.\u201d <em>See State v. Sewell, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>133, 148-49, 603 A.2d 21 (1992). He specified that force had to be applied to the victim herself, and must have been \u201cgreater than that necessary ... merely to snatch the object from the victim\u2019s grasp or the victim\u2019s person.\u201d The judge mentioned that in a purse-snatching \u201cthere may be no force or there may be force,\u201d so a purse-snatching would not be a robbery if there were no bodily injury and \u201c[i]f you find that the force that was used does not raise it to the level of robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The court also defined \u201cknowing\u201d conduct and defined \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d The judge informed the jury that the incident involving Miskerik would be first-degree robbery if it found the requisite theft, and in addition found that \u201cthe robber purposely inflicted or attempt[ed] to inflict serious bodily injury.\u201d However, he also noted that if \u201cthere\u2019s no force and there\u2019s [sic] no injuries,\u201d then defendant would only be guilty of third-degree theft. The jury was instructed to consider theft from the person as lesser-included offenses to each robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">With respect to felony murder, the court explained that the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant \u201cwas engaged in the immediate flight after committing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>crime of robbery\u201d; that defendant caused Carroll\u2019s death; and that defendant caused Carroll\u2019s death \u201cat some time within the course of the commission of that crime including its aftermath of flight and concealment efforts.\u201d The judge advised the jury that it had to find defendant guilty \u201cof at least one of those counts of robbery\u201d before it could consider him guilty of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The jury was further instructed to consider several factors \u201cin determining whether the defendant was in immediate flight from the robbery at the time of the commission of the acts which resulted in\u201d Carroll\u2019s death:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-7\">First, the distance from the scene of the robbery that the death occurs, the time between the commission of the robbery and the death of [the victim], whether the police were in close pursuit of the defendant\u2019s vehicle, whether the defendant had reached a place of temporary safety prior to the acts which culminated in the death of [the victim]. You can consider whether the defendant was still in possession of the fruits of the crime committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The court also defined the term \u201cimmediate\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">The term immediate is not a term that requires a precise tick of the clock or measured distance along the escape route. It\u2019s a term that can be taken to mean, quote, this is right from the law, \u201ca reasonable time in view of the particular facts and the circumstances. No individual factor is necessarily controlling. It is the combination of several factors that must be considered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The judge thereafter told the jury that the State also had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe victim\u2019s death was a probabl[e] consequence of the flight after committing robbery\u201d and that \u201cto be a probable consequence of the robbery the death must not have been too remote or too accidental in its occurrence or dependent on another\u2019s volitional acts to have a just bearing on the defendant\u2019s liability or the gravity of the offense.\u201d The jury was told the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat under all the circumstances the death did not occur in such an unexpected or unusual manner that it would be unjust to find the defendant responsible for the death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">The court also illustrated felony murder with two contrasting examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">On the one hand, and I\u2019ll mention it again, a bank robber would not be liable for felony murder if at the moment a bank robber stepped into the bank the employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>pushing the button for a burglar alarm was electrocuted because of a short. On the other hand, it is in the robbery of a store for example, in which the store keeper fires at the robber but instead he kills an innocent bystander. The death would not be too remote for the defendant to be guilty of felony murder, that is the robber.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The jury was further instructed that \u201c[t]he key issue is whether the death is foreseeable. It need not be probable.\u201d The court finished by noting that the prosecution contended that Carroll\u2019s death, \u201cwhile committed recklessly, unintentionally and accidentally, was a foreseeable consequence of\u2019 the flight and therefore \u201cwas a probable consequence of the defendant\u2019s conduct,\u201d whereas defendant contended that the death was unforeseeable because \u201cit was too dependent upon the volitional conduct of another, it was too remote and too accidental for a just verdict of\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We find no basis in the proofs or the jury instructions, taken as a whole, to reverse the felony murder conviction. As the police dispatch related to a report concerning one or more of what the jury found to be robberies, the police chase was sufficiently related to a robbery, and if the death of Stephanie Carroll occurred during the immediate flight from a robbery, the conviction for felony murder must be sustained.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Felony murder requires the actor to commit or attempt to commit robbery or another felony named in the statute, and to cause the death of any person, other than a \u201cparticipant\u201d in the felony, \u201cin the course of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(3). It is a strict-liability crime in the sense that it does not require any intent for the homicide, but the State must still prove causation. <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2, 20, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990). The underlying felony or the immediate flight from it must have been a but-for cause of the victim\u2019s death, and the death must have been a \u201cprobable consequence\u201d of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>actor\u2019s conduct during the felony or immediate flight. <em>Ibid.; N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">With respect to the \u201cprobable consequence\u201d threshold, \u201ca defendant should be exculpated [from liability for felony murder] only when a death occurs in a manner that is so unexpected or unusual that he or she could not justly be found culpable for the result.\u201d <em>Martin, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 33, 573 A.2d 1359. In other words, death is the \u201cprobable consequence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct unless it \u201cwas \u2018too remote, accidental in its occurrence, or too dependent on another\u2019s volitional act to have a just bearing on the defendant\u2019s culpability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-3e.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Defendant argues that but-for causation did not exist because the pursuit did not immediately follow the robberies, and that the victim\u2019s death was not the \u201cprobable consequence\u201d of his own conduct because it arose instead from police misconduct during the pursuit. The pursuit occurred for a period of between two minutes, forty-eight seconds, and five minutes, eighteen seconds, there being a dispute among the experts with respect to the time and speeds. Defendant contends that an improper chase in violation of the State Police Pursuit Guidelines could not have been foreseen as a likely consequence of his actions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the issue of remoteness is fact sensitive. <em>Cf. State v. Mauricio, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>402, 415, 568 A.2d 879 (1990) (whether the defendant had sufficient time to \u201ccool down\u201d between the provocation and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>homicide for purposes of passion-provocation manslaughter was a jury question).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">There were no proofs that defendant had found a refuge between the last robbery and the beginning of the pursuit, and whether defendant was attempting to elude the police while still fleeing from the robbery was an issue for the jury to decide. Moreover, the fact that one or more police officers may have deviated from the guidelines for a safe pursuit, or otherwise proceeded unsafely through heavy traffic, cannot excuse defendant\u2019s conduct or his statutory responsibility. That police may deviate from preferred practice is neither a remote possibility nor a basis on which the Legislature sought to avoid strict liability for causing the death of a non-participant during the flight from a robbery. <em>See Canico v. Hurtado, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>361, 366, 676 A.2d 1083 (1996) (police officer immune from suit due to accident occurring during his negligent response to crime scene; \u201c[t]he response to reports of crimes-in-progress, are fraught with danger and often require split-second judgments\u201d); <em>Tice v.

Whatever his reason, the resulting fatal accident cannot be deemed too remote, dependent on the police\u2019s conduct, or otherwise so unexpected or unusual that it would have been unjust to hold defendant responsible for Carroll\u2019s death. <em>Martin, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 33, 573 A.2d 1359.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Defendant also contends that the proofs reflect that the pursuit did not \u201cimmediately\u201d follow the robberies, as <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(3) requires. However, immediacy refers to \u201ca reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>able time in view of the particular facts and circumstances of the case,\u201d <em>State in re J.R., </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>388, 394, 560 A.2d 1279 (Ch.Div.1988), and felony murder is established \u201cwhen the initial crime and the murder are closely connected in point of time, place, and causal connection and are integral parts of one continuous transaction,\u201d <em>State v. Mirault, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>492, 500, 457 A.2d 455 (1983). <em>Accord, State in re J.R., supra, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 388, 560 A.2d 1279 (the question is whether \u201c[t]he [felony], flight and death in this ease represent a continuous, indivisible transaction\u201d; juvenile transferred to Law Division for felony murder prosecution where death occurred following chase from the scene of a burglary).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In <em>Mirault, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 500-01, 457 A.2d 455, the Supreme Court, in relating the flight component of a robbery to the \u201canalogous\u201d concept of felony murder, made clear that \u201c[t]he question in each felony murder case related to robbery is one of fact: whether the offender, before inflicting the injury that causes death, has reached a point of at least temporary safety ... or become subject to \u2018complete custody.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also State v. Spencer, </em>319 <em>N.J.Super. </em>284, 308-09, 725 A.2d 106 (App.Div.1999) (noting that the predicate offense and the homicide must be \u201cclosely connected in point of time, place and causal connection [so as to constitute] integral parts of one continuous transaction,\u201d but that reaching point of \u201ctemporary safety\u201d does not <em>per se </em>prevent a finding of the requisite nexus); <em>State v. Smith, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>43, 47-48, 509 A.2d 206 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>582, 523 A.2d 210 (1986) (evidence sufficient to sustain felony murder on appropriate instructions where, after committing armed robbery, the defendant drove away, ran through the stop sign at the end of the street and hit another car, whose driver had a heart attack and later died).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In this case the chase took between about three to five minutes, and commenced approximately twenty or twenty-five minutes after the last robbery. There is no basis for finding as a matter of law that in spending less than twenty-five minutes in rush-hour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>traffic defendant \u201creached a point of at least temporary safety,\u201d <em>Mirault, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 501, 457 A.2d 455, or otherwise severed the connection between the last robbery and the pursuit that began while defendant was still on the road. In short, this record did not preclude the jury from finding that the robbery and the flight resulting in Carroll\u2019s death were part of a \u201ccontinuous transaction.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">However, the jury was not asked by special verdict to indicate from which robbery or robberies defendant was fleeing when the accident occurred, and the judge instructed the jury that if the death occurred during the flight of any one robbery, defendant could be convicted of felony murder. As a result, the judge should have merged all the robbery convictions into the felony murder as the record reflects no finding as to which constituted the underlying felony, and the jury may have concluded that it was all three. <em>See State v. Diaz, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>628, 643, 677 A.2d 1120 (1996); <em>State v.

A court may charge the jury on a lesser-ineluded offense when the facts provide \u201ca rational basis for a verdict convicting the defendant of the included offense\u201d instead of the offense charged in the indictment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8e. In order to charge a lesserineluded offense, there must be a basis for finding the defendant not guilty of the greater offense, as well as guilty of the lesser offense. <em>State v.

Furthermore, the court\u2019s failure to give such a charge <em>on its own </em>is <em>not error if </em>the defendant might have had a strategic reason for declining to request instructions on a lesserineluded offense, such as here where there was an evidentiary basis for the jury to acquit of felony murder and aggravated manslaughter and convict only of death by auto. <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Perry, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>128, 162, 590 A.2d 624 (1991) (finding that lack of <em>sua sponte </em>charge on self-defense is not plain error when the unrequested charge would be incompatible with the defense strategy); <em>State v.

Dixon, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>223, 257, 593 A.2d 266 (1991); <em>State v. Sloane, supra, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>at 303, 544 A.2d 826. <em>Compare State v.

Thus, for example, because of the additional element of culpability (reckless conduct), reckless manslaughter should not be charged as a lesser-included offense to felony murder. <em>See State v.

As already noted, felony murder \u201cis committed when the actor ... is engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit robbery [or another named felony], and in the course of such crime or of immediate flight therefrom, ... causes [a] death ...,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3a(3), whereas manslaughter while eluding is committed when the actor causes a death \u201cwhile fleeing or attempting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>to elude a law enforcement officer in violation of subsection b. of N.J.S. 2C:29-2,\u201d for which the actor \u201cshall be strictly liable,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4b(3). A violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-2b requires the actor to engage in flight after having received a signal from a police officer to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Operating a vehicle and eluding are, of course, distinct elements that are not part of felony murder. However, the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8d(1) definition of lesser-included offenses requires an analysis of whether the lesser offense is to \u201cbe established by proof of the same or less than all the \u2018facts,\u2019 not \u2018elements,\u2019 required to establish the commission of the offense charged.\u201d <em>State v.

Accordingly, where, as here, the fatal accident can be seen as occurring during a police chase as part of the flight from the predicate felony, manslaughter while eluding should be charged as a lesser-included offense to felony murder. <em>State v.

If, in addition to the hostile entry, the intended offense is committed, then the offense itself is separately punishable. <em>Id. </em>at 504, 495 A.2d 467. The legislature considered and specifically rejected a recommendation that a person could not be convicted both for burglary and for the offense it was his purpose to commit after the entry. <em>See Cannel, Title 2C, New Jersey Criminal Code Annotated, </em>1992-1993 edition, comments one and seven and <em>State v. Pyron, supra, </em>at 504, 495 A.2d 467.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\"><em>[Martes, supra, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 121, 628 A.2d 817.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The fact that the ear was in fact taken and a theft was completed does not change the rationale that entry and theft are two separate offenses. While <em>State v. Subin, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>227, 236, 536 A.2d 758 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>580, 546 A.2d 506 (1988), held that there was no merger of burglary and attempted theft of a car when the defendant intended only to take property from the vehicle rather than the car itself, it also made clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>burglary and the theft offense involved separate criminal activity. <em>See Martes, supra, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 122-23, 628 A.2d 817. The issue before us is not whether consecutive sentences can be imposed for burglary and theft of the burglarized vehicle; that would involve a very different question than the one involved in this case. Here, concurrent sentences were imposed, and given the fact that merger (to the extent that it flows from double jeopardy considerations) turns on legislative intent with respect to multiple punishment imposed in the same prosecution, <em>see State v. Dillihay, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>42, 601 A.2d 1149 (1992); <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>462, 588 A.2d 816 (1991); <em>State v. Graham, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>257, 584 A.2d 878 (App.Div.), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>310, 598 A.2d 874 (1991); <em>State v. Anaya, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 36-39, 568 A.2d 1208 (App.Div.1990) (outdated on the merger issue by <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>and <em>Dillihay, supra), </em>the Legislature\u2019s silence and inaction for a decade following the decisions with respect to the non-merger <em>of </em>burglary and theft support our view that burglary and theft of the burglarized motor vehicle do not merge.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In sum, we affirm the felony murder conviction and sentence imposed thereon. We direct the merger of the aggravated manslaughter and all the robbery convictions therein. We otherwise affirm the judgment and concurrent sentences imposed for those crimes, and remand for a corrected judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">APPENDIX <em>\u201cA\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">DEFENDANT\u2019S LEGAL ARGUMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">POINT I DISMISSAL OF INDICTMENT AS TO FELONY MURDER, ROBBERY AND AGGRAVATED MANSLAUGHTER IS MANDATED AND DOUBLE JE[OMA]KDY PRECLUDES RETRIAL WHERE GRAND JURY WAS UNAWARE OF N.J.S.A. 2C:ll-4(b)(3) AND THE PROSECUTION DID NOT DISCLOSE TO THE GRAND JURY THAT THE DEFENDANT\u2019S CULPABILITY OF COMMITTING THEFTS WAS CONSIDERED BY THE PROSECUTION TO ONLY RISE TO THE LEVEL OF MERE RECKLESSNESS AND THUS INSUFFICIENT AS A MATTER OF LAW TO CONSTITUTE ROB[B]ERY OR THAT THE SUBSEQUENT CHASE WAS INITIATED BY POLICE OFFICER COMING UPON THE DEFEN<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>DANT, WAITING HIS TURN IN TRAFFIC, AND REINITIATED THE CHASE TWICE, ONCE AFTER HAVING DRAWN A WEAPON ON THE DEFENDANT.
