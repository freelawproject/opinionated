This court gave notice to the parties to appear and be heard on whether the defendant\u2019s appeal should not be dismissed for lack of a final judgment. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s order was not a final judgment and that this appeal should therefore be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">Because the trial court\u2019s order was rendered before the defendant\u2019s conviction and sentencing, the order is interlocutory and its appealability is governed by the rules set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). As <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>200 Conn. 323, 332, 512 A.2d 140 (1986), demonstrates, the order satisfies neither part of the <em>Curcio </em>test. <em>Mitchell </em>holds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>(p. 332) that a probable cause hearing constitutes an integral part of a criminal prosecution; accordingly, the present order does not \u201c[terminate] a separate and distinct proceeeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra. <em>Mitchell </em>also holds (p. 331) that the merits of a finding of probable cause are reviewable after conviction and sentencing; accordingly, the present order does not \u201cso [conclude] the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
