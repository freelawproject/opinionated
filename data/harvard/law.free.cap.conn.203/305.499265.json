Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AShs\">On March 14, 1985, the plaintiff, Angelo Izzo, brought an action for a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court. On April 7,1986, the parties, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3133,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>motion to reserve questions of law for the advice of the Appellate Court. The parties sought to reserve the following questions: (1) \u201cWhether Plaintiff . . . is a separate \u2018person\u2019 entitled to an independent \u2018per person\u2019 recovery for the injury of loss of consortium within the higher \u2018per occurrence\u2019 limit under the Defendant Alice J. McGee\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy with Defendant, Colonial Penn Insurance Company\u201d; (2) \u201cWhether Plaintiff\u2019s claim for loss of consortium is a claim for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 by a person within the meaning of Defendant Alice J. McGee\u2019s automobile liability policy with Defendant, Colonial Penn Insurance Company\u201d; and (3) \u201cWhether Connecticut\u2019s Financial Responsibility Act, [General Statutes \u00a7] 14-122 super-cedes the automobile liability policy issued by Defendant, Colonial Penn Insurance Company.\u201d On April 9, 1986, the court, <em>O\u2019Brien, J., </em>granted the motion. On April 22, 1986, this court transferred the reservation to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The underlying facts are stipulated as follows: On January 12, 1983, Olympia Izzo, wife of the plaintiff, was struck by a motor vehicle owned and operated by the defendant, Alice J. McGee. As a result of the accident, Olympia Izzo suffered permanent and disabling injuries, including the loss of her right leg, which was amputated above the knee. The plaintiff was not involved in the accident but, as a result of the injuries to his wife, suffered a loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>At the time of the accident, McGee was an insured of the named defendant, Colonial Penn Insurance Company (Colonial Penn). The Colonial Penn policy in effect at the time of the accident included liability coverage limits applicable to bodily injury coverage of $100,000 \u201cper person\u201d and $300,000 \u201cper occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">On March 7,1984, the plaintiff and his wife brought suit against the defendants. In February, 1985, the case was settled in favor of Olympia Izzo only, for the \u201cper person\u201d policy limit of $100,000 and the case was withdrawn by her and the plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As part of the settlement, the parties valued the plaintiffs loss of consortium claim at $50,000. As an additional part of the settlement, the defendants reserved the right to contest whether there was coverage under the insurance policy for the loss of consortium claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">We begin our analysis, as we must, with the applicable language of the insurance policy in effect at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>of the accident. The policy then in effect stated that Colonial Penn \u201cwill pay all sums that the insured under this coverage is legally required to pay as damages for bodily injury. . . .\u201d The \u201cLimits of Coverage\u201d portion of the policy stated that \u201c[t]here are two limits of coverage for Bodily Injury Liability. The amount shown on your Declarations Page for \u2018Each Person\u2019 [$100,000] is the most We\u2019ll pay for damages because of <em>bodily injury </em>to one person caused by any one <em>occurrence. </em>The amount shown on your Declarations Page for \u2018Each Occurrence\u2019 [$300,000] is the most we\u2019ll pay for all damages as a result of any one occurrence, no matter how many people are injured.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cBodily Injury,\u201d as defined in the policy, \u201cmeans injury to a person\u2019s body, sickness or disease, and death that results from any of these.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Given this language of the policy, the critical question which must be addressed is whether the plaintiff\u2019s claim for loss of consortium falls within the limits of liability for \u201cbodily injury to one person caused by any one occurrence.\u201d In other words, does the plaintiff\u2019s claim arise out of bodily injury sustained by \u201cone person\u201d so as to make the \u201cper person\u201d limit applicable, or is the plaintiff\u2019s claim a claim for bodily injury to a second person such as to invoke the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limit. The rule in Connecticut is that an insurance policy, like any other contract, must be given a reasonable interpretation and the words used are to be given their common, ordinary and customary meaning. <em>Gottesman </em>v. <em>Aetna Ins. Co., </em>177 Conn. 631, 634, 418 A.2d 944 (1979); <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>140 Conn. 304, 307, 99 A.2d 141 (1953). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ambiguities are to be construed against the insurer, when the language is plain, no such construction is to be applied. <em>Gottesman v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Smedley Co. v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co., </em>143 Conn. 510, 513, 123 A.2d 755 (1956). Applying the clear language of the policy to the facts of this case, and despite the plaintiff\u2019s statutory claims discussed below, we conclude that the $100,000 limit of liability \u201cbecause of bodily injury to one person caused by any one occurrence\u201d applies in this case. The plaintiff, therefore, is unable to avail himself of the higher \u201cper occurrence\u201d liability limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Connecticut has only recently recognized the right to recover for loss of consortium. <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>Saint Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>176 Conn. 485, 408 A.2d 260 (1979). This court has not yet considered the issue of whether a provision in an insurance policy which limits the amount of an insurer\u2019s liability because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d to one person applies to a claim for loss of consortium. An examination of cases from other jurisdictions, where loss of consortium has enjoyed recognition for a longer period of time, however, reveals that the majority of jurisdictions follow the principle that damages for loss of consortium, resulting from bodily injury to one person, are subject to the \u201cper person\u201d limitation. See, <em>e.g., Reid v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 577 (5th Cir. 1986); <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Farmers Ins. Group, </em>585 F. Sup. 618 (S.D. Ind. 1984); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., </em>252 Ark. 57, 477 S.W.2d 186 (1972); <em>State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Ball, </em>127 Cal. App. 3d 568, 179 Cal. Rptr. 644 (1981); <em>United Services Auto Assn. </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>64 Cal. App. 3d 957, 135 Cal. Rptr. 34 (1976); <em>State Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>221 Ga. 355, 144 S.E.2d 723 (1965); <em>Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Cornelsen, </em>272 Md. 48, 321 A.2d 149 (1974); <em>New Hampshire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bisson, </em>122 N.H. 747, 449 A.2d 1226 (1982); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>Farm Mutual Auto Ins. Co., </em>99 N.J. Super. 377, 240 A.2d 35 (1968); see also annot., 13 A.L.R.3d 1228, \u00a7 4 (1967 &amp; Sup. 1986); 8A J. &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice (1981) \u00a7 4893, p. 60;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 15A G. Couch, Insurance (2d Ed.) \u00a7 56:47; but cf. <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 467 N.E.2d 137 (1984). Although in these cases the specific policy language is not always identical to the language in the insurance policy at issue in this case, these cases hold that the \u201cper person\u201d limit is applicable to all claims of damage flowing from bodily injury to one person and, therefore, it is immaterial that some part of the damages may be claimed by a person other than the one suffering the bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">An often cited reason for holding that a spouse\u2019s claim for loss of consortium is included within the \u201cper person\u201d limit of liability for damages because of bodily injury to one person is that the term \u201cone person\u201d repeatedly has been construed to refer to the person injured directly and the words \u201ceach occurrence\u201d to include the injuries of several persons, regardless of how many persons may suffer loss. See, e.g., <em>United Services Auto Assn. </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>supra, 963. The limitation applies to all damages sustained by all persons as a result of bodily injury to one person. This construction does not render the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limit a nullity because that provision applies to situations where more than \u201cone person\u201d suffers \u201cbodily injury\u201d in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>single occurrence. See, e.g., <em>Gass </em>v. <em>Carducci, </em>52 Ill. App. 2d 394, 402a, 202 N.E.2d 73 (1964). It has been said that this \u201cprinciple comports with sound logic and common sense.\u201d <em>United Services Auto Assn. </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>supra. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">On the stipulated facts before us, it is obvious that the plaintiff would not have a claim under this policy for damages for loss of consortium but for the bodily injury his wife sustained in the accident with McGee. A cause of action for loss of consortium does not arise out of a bodily injury to the spouse suffering the loss of consortium; it arises out of the bodily injury to the spouse who can no longer perform the spousal functions. <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>Saint Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>supra, 494; <em>United Services Auto Assn. </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>supra, 964; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Grange Ins. Assn., </em>34 Wash. App. 151, 161-62, 660 P.2d 307 (1983). We recognized <em>in Hopson </em>that although loss of consortium is a separate cause of action, it is an \u201caction [which] is derivative of the injured spouse\u2019s cause of action.\u201d <em>Hopson </em>v. <em>Saint Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>supra. Loss of consortium, although a separate cause of action, is not truly independent, but rather derivative and inextricably attached to the claim of the injured spouse. The plaintiff\u2019s loss of consortium claim, therefore, clearly fits within the \u201cper person\u201d limit as it is a loss sustained \u201cbecause of bodily injury to one person caused by any one occurrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Although ambiguities or uncertainties in an insurance policy must be resolved against the insurer, nevertheless, the policy must be given a reasonable interpretation and the words used given their common, ordinary and customary meaning. <em>Horak </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>181 Conn. 614, 616, 436 A.2d 783 (1980); <em>United Services Auto Assn. </em>v. <em>Warner, </em>supra. In our opinion, the language setting forth the limits of liability is clear and free from ambiguity. The \u201cper person\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>limit applies to all damages resulting from bodily injury to one person, including a claim for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In jurisdictions where, for purposes of the limits of dollar liability clause, a loss of consortium claim is treated separately from the claim for direct physical injury, thus allowing each claimant to recover under the higher \u201cper occurrence\u201d limit, the courts often have based their decisions on the language contained in the policy. In those cases, the policies spoke in terms of a limitation on damages payable because of \u201cpersonal injury\u201d to one person caused by one occurrence as opposed to damages payable because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d to one person. See, e.g., <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>151 Fla. 144, 9 So. 2d 275 (1942); <em>Gaouette </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>253 App. Div. 388, 2 N.Y.S.2d 497 (1938); <em>Sheffield </em>v. <em>American Indemnity Co., </em>245 S.C. 389, 140 S.E.2d 787 (1965). In these cases, the respective courts recognized that the phrases \u201cbodily injuries\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury\u201d are not synonymous. In <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>supra, 149, the court stated that the policy term \u201cpersonal injuries\u201d is \u201cbroader, more comprehensive and significant\u201d than the term \u201cbodily injury.\u201d See <em>Gaouette </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>supra, 389-90; see also 45 C.J.S., Insurance \u00a7 827, p. 880. The term \u201cpersonal injury\u201d is broad enough to encompass a claim for injury which is personal to the claimant, although flowing from the physical injury of another. It has been said that the term \u201cbodily injury,\u201d however, is narrower in that it connotes an element of personal contact. <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>supra; see <em>Gaouette </em>v. <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>supra; <em>Bakker v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., </em>148 Misc. 162, 169, 265 N.Y.S. 231 (1933). These cases, therefore, are distinguishable from this case in that the policy issued by Colonial Penn speaks in terms of a maximum recovery for damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d to one person. A claim of loss of consortium, although a \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d is not a \u201cbodily injury\u201d to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The plaintiff, while conceding in his brief that a claim for loss of consortium is not a claim for \u201cbodily injury,\u201d argues that, because of General Statutes \u00a7 14-112, the policy should be construed to cover \u201cpersonal injury\u201d claims and not merely \u201cbodily injury\u201d claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The plaintiff argues that because General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requires that if a person violates certain other statutory sections, they must provide \u201cproof of financial responsibility to satisfy any claim for damages by reason of <em>personal injury </em>to . . . any one person, of twenty thousand dollars, or by reason of <em>personal injury </em>to . . . more than one person on account of any accident of at least forty thousand dollars,\u201d the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d in the Colonial Penn policy must be expanded to encompass \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In support of this argument, the plaintiff quotes that portion of the policy which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>vides: \u201cIf your home state increases the liability coverage required under its financial responsibility law, [w]e\u2019ll automatically increase the limits of your liability coverage.\u201d The plaintiff therefore argues that because our financial responsibility laws require greater coverage than that otherwise made available in the policy and \u201calthough the Colonial [Penn] policy expressly covers \u2018bodily injury\u2019 [the policy] must be read to comply with the financial responsibility statute and [so] must cover \u2018personal injuries\u2019 as well.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff argues that because the policy provides coverage for \u201cbodily injury,\u201d while \u00a7 14-112 requires coverage for \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d the terms of the policy are in conflict with the statute and the statute must take precedence over the language of the policy. We are unpersuaded by the plaintiff\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 14-112 (a) by its terms only applies upon the violation of certain statutes. These statutes are \u00a7\u00a7 14-222 (reckless driving), 14-224 (evasion of responsibility in operation of a motor vehicle and rac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ing) and 14-227a (a) (operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs). There has been no allegation by the plaintiff that any of these sections were involved in the accident of January 12, 1983.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Despite the plaintiffs assertion to the contrary, it is General Statutes \u00a7 38-175b (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which establishes the minimum coverages that must be provided. Section 38-175b (a) specifically states that \u201c[e]very such policy shall provide insurance in accordance with such regulations against loss resulting from the liability imposed by law, with <em>limits </em>not less than those specified in subsection (a) of section 14-112, for damages because of bodily injury or death of any person . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) While \u00a7 38-175b (a) refers to \u00a7 14-112 (a) for the \u201climits\u201d of coverage, i.e., the dollar amount of coverage which must be afforded an insured, \u00a7 38-175b (a) requires the insurer to afford this minimum coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d not \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d We also note that \u00a7 38-175b (a) speaks to regulations enacted under \u00a7 38-175a. That section, in turn, which authorizes the insurance commissioner to adopt regulations with respect to minimum provisions in automobile liability policies, also uses the term \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The Colonial Penn policy providing coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d is not in conflict with our statutes. In fact, the defendant\u2019s policy provides coverage limits of $100,000 \u201cper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>person\u201d and $300,000 \u201cper occurrence,\u201d amounts well above the required minimum limits of $20,000 \u201cper person\u201d and $40,000 \u201cper occurrence\u201d mandated by \u00a7\u00a7 38-175b (a) and 14-112 (a). Because there is no conflict between our statutes and the language of the Colonial Penn policy, the policy must be read to provide coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201d not \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The answer to each of the three questions reserved is \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-15\"> Practice Book \u00a7 3133 (now \u00a7 4147) provides in part: \u201cwhen entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">\u201cThe supreme court will not entertain a reservation for its advice upon questions of law arising in an action which is not ready for final judgment, unless the question or questions presented are such as are, in the opinion of the court, reasonably certain to enter into the decision of the case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>it appears that their present determination would be in the interest of simplicity, directness and economy of judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">\u201cAll questions presented for advice shall be specific and shall be phrased so as to require a Yes or No answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">\u201cA reservation shall be taken to the supreme court from those cases in which an appeal could have been taken directly to the supreme court had judgment been rendered.

McGee, with the Colonial Penn Insurance Company, in which case, the said Defendant\u2019s FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($15,000.00) (excluding interest earned thereon which, in any event, will be retained by Angelo Izzo) will be returned to her and The Colonial Penn Insurance Company, will pay the Plaintiff, Angelo Izzo, the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($50,000.00) in addition to the interest earned on said account in full satisfaction of his claim for loss of consortium.
