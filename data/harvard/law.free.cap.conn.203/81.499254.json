Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALB\">The defendant, Victor Cubano, was charged by substitute information with the crimes of robbery in the first degree in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and of being a persistent dangerous felony offender in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 23, 1985, the jury found the defendant guilty of the charge of robbery in the first degree. On October 28,1985, after a separate trial, the same jury found the defendant guilty of being a persistent dangerous felony offender. The court sentenced the defendant to a term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>imprisonment of twenty years. The defendant appealed, claiming that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions for a mistrial and for a new trial deprived him of his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution. The defendant also claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the out-of-court and in-court identifications of the defendant made by Peter DiNello.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following background facts: On May 3, 1984, DiNello was employed by the Kwik Stop store in Southington, working the 4 p.m. to midnight shift. At approximately 10:15 p.m., DiNello, who was working alone at the time, was seated behind the counter when a man with a nylon stocking over his face entered the store and pointed a \u201cbluish\u201d colored revolver at him. The man, later identified as the defendant, directed DiNello to put money into a paper bag he was holding. DiNello complied with the request. The man directed DiNello to \u201clay face first on the floor\u201d and then left the store. After a few minutes, DiNello got off the floor and telephoned the police. Approximately three or four minutes had elapsed from the time the man came into the store until the time that DiNello called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">On May 6, 1984, three days after the robbery, Newington police detective Robert Seiler stopped a car which was occupied by the defendant and another male. On the floor of the car was a Smith and Wesson snub nose revolver with a two-inch barrel. The revolver was \u201cdark blue\u201d in color. On that same day, a state\u2019s witness, Gregory Capobianco, saw the defendant with a brown nylon stocking mask in his possession. The gun and the mask seen in the defendant\u2019s possession on May 6,1984, were similar to those used by the robber on May 3, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error is that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions for a mistrial and for a new trial deprived him of his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Following summations by both counsel and before the court had given the jury instructions, one of the members of the jury requested a meeting with the trial judge. During this meeting in chambers, both counsel and the court reporter were present. At the meeting, the juror indicated that she had, on that day, noticed Domingo Astirazan, a friend of hers, in the courtroom. She related that Astirazan\u2019s family and her family were very close, that she and Astirazan worked together but not in the same building, and that he was a person whom she knew \u201cvery well.\u201d She stated that she had concluded from her observations of Astirazan in the courtroom that he- was a friend of the defendant and that she was \u201cshocked\u201d at that thought.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>to Astirazan, the juror stated: \u201cI am a little bit confused at this point because, I mean, in my sense, if that person\u2014I cannot associate this person that I\u2019m talking\u2014I cannot associate this person to not a good person.\u201d When asked by the court if she could decide the case fairly despite her friend\u2019s apparent acquaintance with the defendant, the juror stated that she could do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court instructed the juror to refrain from discussing the matter with the other jurors and excused her from chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>After the juror had left chambers, defense counsel indicated that he felt that the juror had already formed an adverse opinion of the defendant. After consultation with his client, defense counsel, in the absence of the jury, moved for a mistrial, claiming that the juror had \u201calready arrived at a fixed opinion as to the guilt of my client.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court denied the motion, finding that the juror had not made up her mind as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant and that even if she had, she had stated that her friend\u2019s acquaintance with the defendant \u201cwould in no way affect her deliberations in this case for or against the defendant . . . .\u201d Defense counsel took an exception. On October 28, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>1985, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial which alleged, inter alia, that the defendant had been denied a fair and impartial jury. The defendant claims that the denial of these motions constitutes reversible error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The defendant argues that from the moment the juror saw her friend in the courtroom during summation, she formed an adverse opinion about the defendant and that the juror\u2019s \u201crepeated\u201d expressions of the \u201cshock\u201d she had experienced, upon realizing that the two men were acquainted, clearly indicated her adverse feelings about the defendant. The defendant also contends that any instruction relating to the premature formation of an opinion would be futile given \u201cthis particular juror\u2019s obvious inability to abide by the court\u2019s twice given admonition not to think about the merits of the case until after the court instructed the jury on the law . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant argues, therefore, that although his motion for a mistrial had been made after the substantial investment of valuable resources in a trial that was near conclusion, \u201c \u2018 \u201cthe right to an impartial jury . . . dominated all other considerations\u201d \u2019 \u201d and thus the court erred in failing to declare a mistrial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u201c \u2018[T]he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, \u201cindifferent\u201d jurors.\u2019 <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 722, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>197 Conn. 60, 64, 495 A.2d 1050 (1985);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> see <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 542, 442 A.2d 927 (1982). \u201c \u2018Impartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of this mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the [constitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is not chained to any ancient and artificial formula.\u2019 \u201d <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>supra, 724-25, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>299 U.S. 123, 145-46, 57 S. Ct. 177, 81 L. Ed. 78 (1936). The trial court is vested with wide discretion in determining the competency of jurors to serve, and that judgment will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>be disturbed absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tegzes, </em>715 F.2d 505, 509 (11th Cir. 1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carlin, </em>698 F.2d 1133, 1135 (11th Cir.), reh. denied, 705 F.2d 471, cert. denied, 461 U.S. 958, 103 S. Ct. 2431, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1317 (1983); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sears, </em>663 F.2d 896, 900 (9th Cir. 1981), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Werner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>455 U.S. 1027, 102 S. Ct. 1731, 72 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra. In exercising this discretion the trial court must zealously protect the rights of the accused. <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 429-30, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d 841 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">This court has recognized that a defendant may lose the benefit of his right to a fair and impartial jury where the jury has been instructed that it may discuss the case prior to the time the case is submitted to it for deliberation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 433, 481 A.2d 56 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>182 Conn. 419, 424-25, 438 A.2d 1144 (1980). Similarly, this court has held that where a potential juror has such a fixed and settled opinion in a case that he cannot judge impartially the guilt of the defendant, he should not be selected to sit on the panel. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra, 66; <em>State </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>18 Conn. 166, 174-75 (1846); see also <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1984). This court has also stated that \u201c \u2018[t]o succeed on a claim of bias the defendant must raise his contention of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of fact.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>189 Conn. 303, 313, 455 A.2d 1326 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>167 Conn. 526, 532, 356 A.2d 162 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra, 65; see also <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>339 U.S. 162, 168, 70 S. Ct. 519, 94 L. Ed. 734, reh. denied, 339 U.S. 950, 70 S. Ct. 799, 94 L. Ed. 1364 (1950). With these principles in mind, we address the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>In challenging the competency of the juror to remain on the panel it was the defendant\u2019s burden to prove actual bias on behalf of the juror. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>supra, 532. While the juror was in chambers, the court inquired whether the relationship between her friend and the defendant would affect her decision on guilt or innocence. The juror stated that it would not and that she could decide the case impartially irrespective of the fact that her friend was an acquaintance of the defendant. After the juror had been excused from chambers, defense counsel argued that the \u201cshock\u201d she had expressed was a result of the fact that the juror had already formed an adverse opinion as to the innocence of the defendant. At this time, however, defense counsel admitted that the opinion was \u201csomewhat oblique\u201d and \u201cnot clearly stated.\u201d The court asked defense counsel whether he wanted the court to call the juror back to \u201csatisfy you as to whether or not she has formed any pre-opinion at this time . . . as to the innocence or guilt of the accused.\u201d Rather than take advantage of this opportunity to question the juror as to the nature and effect of her alleged \u201copinion,\u201d defense counsel left chambers to confer with the defendant and he did not return. When court reconvened, defense counsel moved for a mistrial without seeking any further inquiry of the juror. The court denied the motion, specifically finding that the juror had not \u201cindicated that she [had] made up her mind by anything that she said in chambers.\u201d The court also noted that the juror had stated that the fact that her friend might be \u201cacquainted with the defendant would in no way affect her deliberation in this case for or against the defendant . . . .\u201d Given the \u201coblique\u201d nature of the juror\u2019s statement, the failure of defense counsel to examine the juror to establish bias or premature formation of an opinion, which is his burden, and the court\u2019s finding that the juror had not \u201cindicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>that she [had] made up her mind by anything she said in chambers,\u201d we conclude that the defendant has failed to \u201craise his contention of bias from the realm of speculation to the realm of fact.\u201d The denial of the motions for mistrial and for a new trial was within the reasonable exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Almeda, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>187 Conn. 73, 77, 444 A.2d 896 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Even if we assume, arguendo, that the defendant had established that the juror\u2019s statements amounted to an expression of a premature opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt, that by itself would not be enough to establish error in the court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mistrial. Not every incident of juror misconduct requires a new trial. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klee, </em>494 F.2d 394, 396 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 835, 95 S. Ct. 62, 42 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1974), and cases there cited; <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 736, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985). The test for a new trial is \u201c \u2018whether or not the misconduct has prejudiced the defendant to the extent that he has not received a fair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>supra, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klee, </em>supra; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hendrix, </em>549 F.2d 1225 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 818, 98 S. Ct. 58, 54 L. Ed. 2d 74, reh. denied, 434 U.S. 960, 98 S. Ct. 493, 54 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1977). In <em>State </em>v. <em>McCall, </em>supra, 81, we said: \u201cMere expression of opinion, as opposed to positive expression of facts, does not warrant a mistrial.\u201d Even where a juror has formed some preconceived opinion as to the guilt of an accused, a juror is sufficiently impartial if he or she can set aside that opinion and render a verdict based on evidence in the case. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moon, </em>718 F.2d 1210, 1218-19 (2d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 971, 104 S. Ct. 2344, 80 L. Ed. 2d 818 (1984). \u201cOnly where a juror has indicated a refusal to consider testimony and displayed evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of a closed mind concerning [the] defendant\u2019s innocence can it be said that [the court] abused its discretion in refusing to [remove] a juror [from the panel].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>748 F.2d 1091, 1092 (6th Cir. 1984). It is enough if a juror is able to set aside any preconceived notions and decide the case on the evidence presented and the instructions given by the court. <em>Patton </em>v. <em>Yount, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Zeil, </em>supra; see also <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>supra, 723. While we recognize that a juror\u2019s assurances that he or she is equal to the task are not dispositive of the rights of an accused; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>supra, 800; we are aware of the broad discretion of a trial judge which includes his determination of the credibility to be given a juror\u2019s statement in this context. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>744 F.2d 1065, 1068 (4th Cir. 1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra, 65; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowen, </em>supra, 533; see <em>Rosales-Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 188-89, 101 S. Ct. 1629, 68 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Our review of the transcript of the in camera and in-court colloquy between the trial judge, the juror and counsel leads us to conclude that the defendant has failed to establish that the alleged \u201cjuror misconduct\u201d violated his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury. Even if we assume that the statements made by the juror amounted to an expression of a premature opinion of guilt, the record does not support a finding that the opinion was irrevocable and could not be set aside. To the contrary, the record does support the trial court\u2019s finding that the juror\u2019s friend\u2019s acquaintance with the \u201cdefendant would in no way affect her deliberation in this case for or against the defendant . . . .\u201d When asked whether her decision as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant would be influenced, she said that it would not and that she could \u201cdecide this case irrespective of the fact that [she thought her] friend . . . may be a friend of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>ant.\u201d Moreover, the determination of the trial court, which was based on actual observation and conversation with the juror, is entitled to reasonable deference. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hohman, </em>138 Vt. 502, 512, 420 A.2d 852 (1980). Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its broad discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial and motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the out-of-court and in-court identifications of the defendant made by Peter DiNello.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cA defendant who moves to suppress identification evidence bears the initial burden of proving that the identification resulted from an unconstitutional procedure.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>196 Conn. 289, 293, 493 A.2d 836 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 244, 476 A.2d 550 (1984). In order to succeed, \u2018the defendant must prove (1) that the identification procedures were unnecessarily suggestive, and (2) that the resulting identification was not reliable in the totality of circumstances.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>198 Conn. 68, 73, 502 A.2d 368 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>197 Conn. 595, 598, 500 A.2d 551 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 292-93.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>199 Conn. 308, 310, 507 A.2d 99 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress all identification testimony. At the suppression hearing, Detective Sergeant William Ludecke of the Southington police department testified that after the robbery of the Kwik Stop on May 3, 1984, he learned that a similar robbery had occurred in Newington and the description of the perpetrator fit the description of the individual involved in the Southington robbery. Ludecke requested that DiNello accompany him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Newington for the purpose of having DiNello view a photographic array. Ludecke told DiNello that a man fitting the description he had provided had been arrested for a \u201cvery similar robbery\u201d in Newington. When shown the pictures of six persons, DiNello positively identified the defendant as the individual who had robbed the Southington Kwik Stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">At the suppression hearing, the six photographs were introduced into evidence. In each photograph, the individual was pictured wearing a Newington police department arrest placard clearly displaying the date of his arrest. DiNello testified that at the time he viewed the photographs he was under the impression that the Neydngton robbery had occurred after the Kwik Stop robbery. DiNello correctly interpreted the numbers on the placards as representative of dates. Four of the six placards showed dates of March 23, 1977, November 25,1973, August 14,1969, and May 15,1976. The placards in the remaining two photographs showed the date of May 6, 1984. One of these two photographs depicted an individual with a thick moustache. The individual who had robbed the Kwik Stop just three days prior to the date on the placard had been described by DiNello as not having a moustache.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The defendant argues that when DiNello viewed the photographs at the Newington police department, he was aware that subsequent to the Kwik Stop robbery, the Newington police had arrested a similar looking individual for a similar robbery. The dates in the photographs indicated that only two of the individuals pictured had been arrested during this time frame and that of these two individuals, one of them did not fit the description DiNello had supplied to the police. The defendant therefore argues that the identification procedure employed in this case was unnecessarily suggestive and that the resulting identification was not reliable in the totality of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Although the state concedes that the identification procedures employed in this case were unnecessarily suggestive, it argues, nonetheless, that the evidence presented at the suppression hearing was more than sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the identification in this case was reliable under the \u201ctotality of circumstances.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">In determining whether an identification is reliable in the \u201ctotality of circumstances,\u201d the corruptive influence of the suggestive procedure is weighed against \u201cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>supra, 311 n.3; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Under the totality of the circumstances, DiNello\u2019s identification of the defendant was reliable. DiNello had the opportunity to view the defendant when for several minutes he was within two or three feet of the defendant. \u201cWe have said of identification that <em>\u2018a </em>good hard look will pass muster even if it occurs during a fleeting glance.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>[185 Conn. 607, 615, 441 A.2d 595 (1981)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 296. DiNello testified that although a nylon stocking covered the perpetrator\u2019s head above his bottom lip, he was able to see the defendant\u2019s face through the stocking. DiNello\u2019s degree of attention was very good and his description accurate. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>supra, 311-12. In addition to giving a general description of his clothing (\u201cdark clothing\u201d) and an approximation as to age (\u201cin his . . . early 40\u2019s\u201d), height (5\u20194\u201d) and weight (\u201cbetween 145-163 pounds\u201d), DiNello also noticed that the man had a \u201ctan complexion\u201d and a \u201cround face\u201d and appeared to need a shave. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Additionally, only nine days elapsed between the crime and the identification and DiNello stated that he was \u201cpositive\u201d of the identification. Moreover, DiNello testified that he attached no special significance to the dates on the placards depicted in the photographs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that under the circumstances of this case, the suggestive procedures did not corrupt the overall reliability of DiNello\u2019s identification and that the trial court was justified in admitting the identification under the \u201ctotality of circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>supra, 312-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) provides: \u201crobbery in the first degree: CLASS B felony, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime or immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime: (1) Causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; (2) is armed with a deadly weapon; or (3) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or (4) displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm, except that in any prosecution under this subdivision, it is an affirmative defense that such pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm was not a weapon from which a shot could be discharged.

The only time you will think about this case insofar as deciding the case is when the six of you that are going to deliberate are in the jury room after you have heard the instructions of law that I will give you.\u201d Four days later, after all the evidence had been presented, the court instructed the jury: \u201cSo please don\u2019t think about the case, even though you have heard all the evidence. Don\u2019t give it any thought until you hear the law that I give to you which applies to this case. And after you have heard the law then you will deliberate in the jury room.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\"> Initially, the state argues that this court cannot overturn the jury\u2019s verdict and grant a new trial in this case because of the \u201cfirmly established\u201d rule that evidence of juror misconduct or mistake cannot be received from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>a juror to vitiate the verdict. See Practice Book \u00a7 871. We disagree for two reasons. First, the state has treated the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial as an attempt to impeach the jury\u2019s verdict. This characterization of the defendant\u2019s claim is inappropriate because at the time the defendant moved for a mistrial, there did not exist a verdict per se, which is the subject of this appeal. Second, although Practice Book \u00a7 871 prohibits receiving evidence concerning the mental processes by which a verdict was determined, the rule does allow evidence of juror misconduct. \u201c \u2018The question is whether the misconduct is of such a nature that it probably rendered the juror unfair or partial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 437, 481 A.2d 56 (1984). Therefore, it would be proper to inquire whether the juror had reached a fixed opinion on the evidence; however, \u201c[a]ny inquiry into the content of the opinion or the impact it had on the juror is clearly impermissible. <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>State, </em>[168 Conn. 541, 551-52, 363 A.2d 49 (1975)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b102-14\"> The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in part: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed. . . .\u201d This guaranty has been made applicable to the states by incorporation into the fourteenth amendment. See <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444, 20 L. Ed. 2d 491, reh. denied, 392 U.S. 947, 88 S. Ct. 2270, 20 L.

The defendant argues that \u201calthough DiNello testified that he could see through the stocking, his view was necessarily significantly impaired.\u201d The defendant acknowledges that many factors \u201ccertainly weigh in a finding of a reliable identification.\u201d He argues, however, that \u201cin light of the fact that most of the robber\u2019s face was masked during the incident, the overall weight of these factors is lessened to the extent that they are outweighed by the corrupting effect of the suggestive procedure.\u201d We disagree. As the state correctly points out in its brief, there is nothing talismanic about the fact that a masked criminal, by virtue of his criminal preparations, has sought to impair a witness\u2019 opportunity to view the criminal. This court has held an identification of a masked criminal to be reliable under the \u201ctotality of circumstances.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Boucino, </em>199 Conn. 207, 221, 506 A.2d 125 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\"> Because of our conclusion that the out-of-court identification was reliable under the totality of the circumstances, we need not address the issue of the reliability of the in-court identification.
