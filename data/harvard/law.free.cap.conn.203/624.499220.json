J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALFo\">The principal issue in this case is the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 31-120,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which bans all residential picketing except labor picketing conducted at a residence located at the situs of a labor dispute. The plaintiff, Gary W. French, the president of Colt Industries/Firearms Division, filed an application in the Superior Court for a temporary injunction to prohibit the defendants, Amalgamated Local Union 376, UAW and other affiliated labor organizations, from continuing to picket on the street in front of his residence in Vernon. Determining that the three labor demonstrations previously held by the defendants at the plaintiffs home were proscribed by \u00a7 31-120, and that the defendants would continue to hold such demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>strations unless enjoined from doing so, the trial court issued a temporary injunction that prohibits the defendants from any further picketing at the plaintiffs home.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 appeal from that injunction has been transferred to this court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that \u00a7 31-120 is a constitutionally impermissible regulation of speech that violates the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, and that the trial court\u2019s order enjoining the defendants\u2019 picketing is therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The temporary injunction was based on the following facts. After working without a contract since March, 1985, the members of Amalgamated Local Union 376, UAW, in January, 1986, organized a strike at Colt Industries/Firearms Division. Subsequently, during the summer and early fall of 1986, the defendants held three peaceful demonstrations on the street outside the plaintiff\u2019s residence. The stated purpose of the demonstrations was to make the plaintiff aware of the personal hardship suffered by the families of the strikers and to encourage him to address the strikers\u2019 concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">The first demonstration occurred on July 1,1986, at about 3:30 p.m., when approximately thirty adults and thirty-five children marched along the street in front of the French residence, chanting and carrying placards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>with messages related to the labor dispute. The second demonstration was held on August 27, 1986, at approximately 7:30 p.m. Between 200 and 250 adults marched in front of the French residence, singing and wearing buttons. On that occasion, however, the demonstrators did not carry placards. At the defendants\u2019 request, the Vernon Chief of Police, James Thomas, arranged to have two representatives of the defendants deliver a letter to the plaintiff during that demonstration. The third demonstration, which involved approximately the same number of people as the second, took place on September 9, 1986, at about 7:30 p.m. It was similar to the second demonstration, except that some demonstrators carried candles and no letter was delivered to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Following the third demonstration, the plaintiff filed in the Superior Court a verified complaint and application for a temporary restraining order and/or temporary and permanent injunction. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that the defendants\u2019 actions on the above three occasions constituted unlawful conduct in direct violation of \u00a7 31-120.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After ordering the defendants to show cause why a temporary injunction should not be issued, the trial court held a hearing at which both parties appeared. Rejecting the defendants\u2019 claim that \u00a7 31-120 violated their rights to free speech and equal protection of the law under the state and federal constitutions, the court granted the plaintiff a temporary injunction. The court found that unless the defendants were temporarily enjoined from demonstrating at the plaintiff\u2019s residence, which the court deemed \u201cunlawful\u201d conduct in violation of \u00a7 31-120, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the plaintiff would suffer \u201cimmediate substantial and irreparable injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In their appeal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the defendants renew their claim that \u00a7 31-120 is unenforceable becauses it deprives them of their constitutional rights. Because we agree with their contention that, on its face, the statute violates their rights of free speech and equal protection of the law guaranteed to them by the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution, we find error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Our analysis of the constitutionality of \u00a7 31-120 must begin with an examination of the language of the statute so that we may determine the scope of the conduct that it intends to regulate. Section 31-120 expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>bans all \u201cpicketing before or about the home or residence of any individual <em>unless </em>such home or residence is adjacent to or in the same building or on the same premises in which such person was employed and which employment is involved in a labor dispute.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Read literally, the statute prohibits all residential picketing except labor picketing conducted at a residence located at the situs of a labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Residential picketing statutes such as \u00a7 31-120 restrict the fundamental right to freedom of speech and thus implicate both the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution. Indeed, peaceful picketing has generally been recognized as a constitutionally protected activity. <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 98, 92 S. Ct. 2286, 33 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972); <em>Shuttlesworth </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147, 155, 89 S. Ct. 935, 22 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1969); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 536, 546, 85 S. Ct. 453, 13 L. Ed. 2d 471 (1965); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S. Ct. 680, 9 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1963); <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 100-101, 60 S. Ct. 736, 84 L. Ed. 1093 (1940). What has not always been entirely clear, however, is the extent to which picketing of private residences enjoys constitutional protection, because such picketing potentially infringes upon the individual\u2019s right to privacy in his home. See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>447 U.S. 455, 471, 100 S. Ct. 2286, 65 L. Ed. 2d 263 (1980); <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>394 U.S. 111, 125, 89 S. Ct. 946, 22 L. Ed. 2d 134 (1969) (Black, J., concurring). The constitutional right to picket must be weighed against the interest of the state, acting under its police power, in promoting the well-being of the community and in preserving residential privacy. See <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>336 U.S. 77, 83, 69 S. Ct. 448, 93 L. Ed. 513 (1949); <em>Euclid </em>v. <em>Ambler Co., </em>272 U.S. 365, 392, 47 S. Ct. 114, 71 L. Ed. 303 (1926). Legislation restricting residential picketing therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>points up the inherent conflict between the individual\u2019s right to picket under the free speech and equal protection guarantees of our federal constitution, and the state\u2019s authority to maintain the sanctity of the home in order to protect individual privacy interests. This conflict has been resolved, by the United States Supreme Court, by subjecting restrictions on residential picketing to strict judicial scrutiny to insure that they are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest and that they do not unduly impinge upon constitutionally protected speech. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 463; <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>supra; see also <em>Renton </em>v. <em>Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>475 U.S. 41, 46-47, 106 S. Ct. 925, 89 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Federal and state precedents make it clear that the defendants in this case are entitled to raise constitutional concerns that transcend the particular circumstances of their case. In order to avoid the significant compromise of recognized first amendment protections of parties not before the court, litigants are allowed to challenge the validity of a law on first amendment grounds where the law would be invalid as applied to others, even if the law were to be deemed constitutional as applied to the litigant. <em>Aptheker </em>v. <em>Secretary of State, </em>378 U.S. 500, 516, 84 S. Ct. 1659, 12 L. Ed. 2d 992 (1964); <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 432-33, 83 S. Ct. 328, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1963); <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>supra, 97\u201498; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 57-58 n.3, 428 A.2d 322 (1980). Accordingly, the plaintiff has raised no question about the defendants\u2019 standing to seek our review of the full panoply of constitutional questions that are implicated by the trial court\u2019s issuance of an injunction pursuant to \u00a7 31-120.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Under first amendment doctrine, any statute that impairs rights to free speech will be invalid unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>serves a substantial state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. Applying that standard to \u00a7 31-120 would, at a minimum, raise serious doubts about its constitutional viability. Independent consideration of this issue is, however, essentially foreclosed because \u00a7 31-120, on its face, is virtually identical to an Illinois statute declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Much like \u00a7 31-120, the Illinois statute under attack in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown </em>imposed a broad ban on residential picketing, declaring in part that \u201c[i]t is unlawful to picket before or about the residence or dwelling of any person, except when the residence or dwelling is used as a place of business.\u201d Ill. Ann. Stat., c. 38 \u00a7 21.1-2 (1977). Significantly, the Illinois statute, again much like our own, provided an exception for, inter alia, \u201cthe peaceful picketing of a place of employment involved in a labor dispute.\u201d Ill. Ann. Stat., c. 38 \u00a7 21.1-2 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In determining that the Illinois statute was constitutionally unacceptable, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown </em>undertook a three step analysis. It determined first that it would accept the construction of the Illinois statute adopted by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the court construed the express terms of the Illinois statute to permit residential picketing only at \u201cplaces of employment involved in labor disputes,\u201d and to forbid picketing at \u201call other residences and dwellings.\u201d <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 461 n.5. The court then inquired whether such a statute vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>lated the free speech and equal protection guarantees of our federal constitution, and concluded that it did so. Finally, the court considered and rejected the claim of the statute\u2019s proponents that the statute had been finely tailored to serve substantial governmental interests that outweighed the statute\u2019s impact on constitutionally protected interests. Because, in one form or another, each part of this analysis has been put into question in the present challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 31-120, we must review carefully how the United States Supreme Court arrived at its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">As a matter of statutory construction, we will first consider the constitutionality of \u00a7 31-120 as it appears on its face. We can discern no significant distinction between the terms of \u00a7 31-120, on its face, and those of the Illinois statute found constitutionally wanting in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We next consider whether the statute satisfies the mandates of free speech and equal protection law. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown </em>determined that a statute like \u00a7 31-120, which permits some labor residential picketing and prohibits all nonlabor residential picketing, violates the free speech and equal protection guarantees of our federal constitution. A statute that \u201cdescribes permissible picketing in terms of its subject matter\u201d violates a fundamental tenet of the first amendment, \u201cthat government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.\u201d <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>supra, 95; <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 463; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California, </em>403 U.S. 15, 24, 91 S. Ct. 1780, 29 L. Ed. 2d 284 (1971); <em>Street </em>v. <em>New York, </em>394 U.S. 576, 594, 89 S. Ct. 1354, 22 L. Ed. 2d 572 (1969); <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 269-70, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1964). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Moreover, as the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>supra, and reaffirmed in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, any restriction on expressive activity because of its content completely undermines the \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide-open . . . .\u201d <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>supra, 270. By banning all residential picketing that does not relate to an ongoing labor dispute, \u00a7 31-120 serves to stifle the very debate on issues of public concern which the first amendment is intended to promote.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In addition to contravening the first amendment, the Illinois statute in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>and \u00a7 31-120 by analogy, contain a further defect implicating the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. They selectively exclude speakers from a public forum based upon the content of their speech. Underlying the public forum doctrine first enunciated in <em>Hague </em>v. <em>CIO, </em>307 U.S. 496, 515, 59 S. Ct. 954, 83 L. Ed. 1423 (1939), is the recognition that streets, sidewalks, parks and certain other public places are held in trust for the public and have long been associated with the exercise of first amendment rights of speech and assembly. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 460; <em>Hudgens </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>424 U.S. 507, 515, 96 S. Ct. 1029, 47 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1976); <em>Food Employees </em>v. <em>Logan Valley Plaza, </em>391 U.S. 308, 315, 88 S. Ct. 1601, 20 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1968). This doctrine mandates that the government may not pick and choose among viewpoints in providing access to a public forum, by granting access to those whose views it finds acceptable and denying access to those whose views it deems unacceptable. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>supra, 98; see <em>Hudgens </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>supra, 520; <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 209, 215, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1975); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>supra, 581. Therefore, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>government enacts a regulation that \u201cdiscriminate[s] among speech-related activities in a public forum,\u201d the equal protection clause requires that the regulation be narrowly tailored to serve substantial state interests, and that the justifications offered for any content-based distinctions contained in the regulation be carefully scrutinized. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 461; <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>supra, 98-99; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 343-44, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1972); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>393 U.S. 23, 30-31, 89 S. Ct. 5, 21 L. Ed. 2d 24 (1968); <em>United States </em>v. <em>O'Brien, </em>391 U.S. 367, 376-77, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672 (1968). Just as the application of that two part test in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 463, rendered the Illinois statute invalid, it likewise renders \u00a7 31-120 constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">If the preferential treatment accorded to labor picketing rendered the Illinois statute invalid under the first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution; <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 471; then \u00a7 31-120 is equally unconstitutional unless the statute serves some substantial governmental interest in an appropriately narrowly tailored fashion. This issue too was raised in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>where the appellants attempted to justify the statute\u2019s content-based distinction on the same two grounds that the plaintiff advances in this case: that the statute was carefully fashioned to promote residential privacy and to provide special protection for labor protests. The United States Supreme Court fully considered and rejected both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">With respect to the residential privacy rationale, <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 464, acknowledged the legitimacy of the state\u2019s interest in preserving residential privacy, but it considered that interest to be an insufficient justification for the content-based distinction between labor and nonlabor picketing drawn by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>the Illinois statute. In the court\u2019s view, the statute\u2019s total ban on nonlabor residential picketing was over-inclusive because it failed to distinguish among different types of nonlabor picketing and was not finely tailored to reflect the fact that some nonlabor pickets are more detrimental to privacy interests than others. Id. The court also determined that the statute was underinclusive because it permitted labor picketing at certain residences, thereby authorizing activity that undoubtedly would intrude on the very privacy the state allegedly sought to protect. Id. Furthermore, the court concluded that the statute\u2019s broad ban on nonlabor residential picketing could not be justified on the ground that it protected residential privacy because there had been no factual showing that the distinction between labor and nonlabor residential picketing had any bearing whatsoever on privacy interests. Id., 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The <em>Carey </em>court was similarly unpersuaded by the claim that labor demonstrations, in contrast to other types of demonstrations, are uniquely deserving of special constitutional protection. The court specifically rejected the proposition that \u201clabor picketing is more deserving of First Amendment protection than are public protests over other\u201d matters involving significant economic, political and social issues. Id.; cf. T. Emerson, The System of Freedom of Expression (1970) pp. 444-49. In addition, the court, sua sponte, considered and rejected the argument that a state may be obligated to provide a statutory exception for situs-related residential picketing in order to protect the right of employees to engage in peaceful picketing at the workplace, a right guaranteed by the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157; <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 467 n.10; see <em>Machinists </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Relations Commission, </em>427 U.S. 132, 136 and n.2, 96 S. Ct. 2548, 49 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1976). Declining to carve out a constitutional exception for labor picketing, the court instead affirmed that public-issue picketing, which encompasses the entire spectrum of issues subject to public debate, is firmly positioned on the \u201chighest rung of the hierarchy of First Amendment values.\u201d <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>South Carolina, </em>372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S. Ct. 680, 9 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Adhering to the federal precedents established in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown </em>and <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>we hold that \u00a7 31-120, on its face, is unconstitutional. Until such time as the United States Supreme Court chooses to depart from the holdings of these recent cases, they necessarily furnish the guidelines for our present review of legislation that infringes on constitutionally protected speech.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">The conclusion that \u00a7 31-120 is unconstitutional on its face requires us to consider whether an alternate construction of \u00a7 31-120 would save it from constitutional demise. The ordinary rules of statutory construction do not apply when \u201ca literal reading places a statute in constitutional jeopardy. We are bound to assume that the legislature intended, in enacting a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ticular law, to achieve its purpose in a manner which is both effective and constitutional. <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>170 Conn. 668, 674, 368 A.2d 20 (1976); <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>167 Conn. 499, 507-508, 356 A.2d 139 (1975); <em>Amsel </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>141 Conn. 288, 295, 106 A.2d 152, appeal dismissed, 348 U.S. 880, 75 S. Ct. 125, 99 L. Ed. 693 (1954).\u201d <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">To that end, the plaintiff vigorously urges us to adopt the construction of \u00a7 31-120 set forth by the Connecticut Circuit Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1971-2), </em>6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 372, 274 A.2d 897 (1971). <em>See DeGregory </em>v. <em>Giesing, </em>427 F. Sup. 910, 912 and n.2 (D. Conn. 1977). Departing from a literal reading of the statute, <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1971-2), </em>supra, construed \u00a7 31-120 to be entirely inapplicable to nonlabor picketing, which continued to be permissible. With respect to labor picketing, all such picketing was forbidden in residential areas, but for the narrow exception for situs labor picketing. Id., 377-78.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Admittedly, such a reading of \u00a7 31-120 results in a more narrowly tailored regulation of picketing than does the far-reaching restriction that results from a literal construction of its terms. The question that remains is whether \u00a7 31-120, even as construed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1971-2), </em>is constitutionally permissible. The plaintiff insists that the <em>Anonymous </em>interpretation purges the statute of its constitutional infirmities. He argues that \u00a7 31-120, as construed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1971-2), </em>is distinguishable from the Illinois statute invalidated in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown </em>because it permits all residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>picketing with the exception of labor picketing that is <em>not </em>conducted at a residence \u201cadjacent to or in the same building or on the same premises in which such person was employed and which employment is involved in a labor dispute.\u201d According to the plaintiff, the statute thereby furthers the state\u2019s interest in protecting residential privacy, by limiting the secondary effects of labor picketing, without offending the constitutional underpinnings of free speech doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In our view, although the statute, as narrowly construed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1971-2), </em>no longer imposes a sweeping ban on nonlabor residential picketing, it nonetheless remains constitutionally objectionable because it contains the same content-based distinction between labor and nonlabor picketing expressly rejected in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown. </em>Whereas the Illinois statute involved in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown </em>favored labor picketing over nonlabor picketing, the Connecticut statute, as interpreted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1971-2), </em>would have the reverse effect, favoring nonlabor picketing over labor picketing. The <em>Anonymous </em>interpretation thus leads to the same unconstitutional result. Section 31-120 would still impermissibly discriminate against speech based upon its content.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>even adoption of the <em>Anonymous </em>court\u2019s strained interpretation of the language of the statute leaves \u00a7 31-120 in constitutional difficulty. Whether \u00a7 31-120 is read to accord preferential treatment to labor or nonlabor picketing, absent a narrowly tailored justification for the unequal treatment of speech on the basis of its content, which the record before us lacks, neither our construction of the statute nor the <em>Anonymous </em>interpretation renders it constitutional. See <em>Niemotko </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>340 U.S. 268, 272-73, 71 S. Ct. 325, 95 L. Ed. 267 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Our decision that \u00a7 31-120 is unconstitutional under both the first amendment and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution should not be understood to foreclose any and all regulation of residential picketing. Rather, the principles of the first amendment must be weighed against the state\u2019s longstanding and legitimate interest in preserving the sanctity of the home and the privacy that it affords. See generally comment, \u201cPicketers at the Doorstep,\u201d 9 Harv. Civ. Rights-Civ. Lib. L. Rev. 95, 105-109 (1974). Indeed, we recognize that despite the broad reach of the first amendment in protecting the rights of free speech, the first amendment \u201cdoes not guarantee the right to communicate one\u2019s views at all times and places or in any manner that may be desired.\u201d <em>Heffron </em>v. <em>International Society for Krishna Consciousness, </em>452 U.S. 640, 647, 101 S. Ct. 2559, 69 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1981); <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 471; <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>supra, 98. Although a content-based restriction on speech like that contained in \u00a7 31-120 is impermissible, a state or municipality may strike a proper balance between competing first amendment principles and residential privacy concerns by enacting reasonable time, place and manner regulations that apply to all speech regardless of its content. <em>Carey </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number><em>Brown, </em>supra; <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>supra, 209; see, e.g., <em>Kovacs </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>336 U.S. 77, 69 S.

In order to pass constitutional muster, however, such time, place and manner regulations must be narrowly drafted to serve a substantial governmental interest and must allow for reasonable alternative avenues of communication.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Renton </em>v. <em>Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>supra, 928; <em>Husti </em>v. <em>Zuckerman Property Enterprises, Ltd., </em>199 Conn. 575, 581, 508 A.2d 735 (1986); see also <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 U.S. 288, 293, 104 S.

The defendants in this case, however, are entitled to appeal the temporary injunction because immediate review of a temporary injunction in a case arising out of a labor dispute is specifically authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 31-118. Section 31-118 provides in relevant part: \u201cappeal.

He urges us to conclude, alternatively, that the injunction is valid because it can be grounded upon the claim of tortious invasion of privacy alleged in the second count of his complaint and application for a temporary injunction. The trial court, however, granted the injunction solely on the ground that the defendants' conduct violated General Statutes \u00a7 31-120, and made no findings regarding the allegation of tortious invasion of privacy. In the absence of an appropriate factual record, we decline to consider whether the injunction can be upheld on this alternate ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b651-6\"> Although General Statutes \u00a7 31-120 does not expressly indicate that it applies solely to labor picketing, the <em>Anonymous </em>court apparently adopted that interpretation based upon its view that the statute was enacted in 1947 in direct response to several widely publicized labor disputes in progress at that time. <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1971-2), </em>6 Conn. Cir. Ct. 372, 378 n.3, 274 A.2d 897 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\"> The plaintiff contends that, under his interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 31-120, the statute constitutes a permissible content-neutral regulation of the location of labor picketing. As one commentator has observed, however, many statutes that can be characterized as time, place and manner regulations, such as the statutes invalidated in <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>408 U.S. 92, 92 S. Ct. 2286, 33 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972), and <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1975), in fact depend upon the content of expression. M. Redish, \u201cThe Content Distinction in First Amendment Analysis,\u201d 34 Stan. L. Rev. 113, 114-15 (1981).'Moreover, the plaintiff is foreclosed from pursuing this claim because the <em>Carey </em>court determined that the Illinois statute did not constitute a reasonable time, place and manner regulation applicable to residential picketing. <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>447 U.S. 455, 471, 100 S. Ct. 2268, 65 L. Ed. 2d 263 (1980). Therefore, our own statute cannot be treated as a permissible time, place and manner regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b654-6\"> We further note that General Statutes \u00a7 31-120 is not the only means available to the state to curtail certain residential picketing. For example, although the record before us does not indicate whether the activities of the defendants constituted unlawful conduct in violation of other criminal laws, residential picketing involving an entry on private property may be proscribed by our criminal trespass statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-107 through 53a-109. Such conduct may also be enjoined in the proper circumstances pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-114 and 31-115.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
