Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMb\">The sole issue on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in denying the plaintiffs challenge for cause of a juror who allegedly had expressed actual bias, prejudice and partiality in his voir dire testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In January, 1986, the plaintiff, Carl E. Johnson, individually and in his capacity as administrator of his wife\u2019s estate, brought this action for medical malpractice against the following defendants: New Britain General Hospital; Dr. David Mucci, a resident intern; Dr. George H. Bray; and the New Britain Surgical Group, Inc., Bray\u2019s professional corporation. The plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint alleged negligence on the part of the defendants in the postoperative care given to the plaintiff\u2019s deceased spouse, Donna Johnson. The first three counts alleged an action for wrongful death, and counts four, five and six sought recovery for medical expenses incurred by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">At trial, numerous expert witnesses testified for both parties and presented their views as to both the cause of the decedent\u2019s death and the quality of the postoperative care which had been given to her. After hearing the testimony and the judge\u2019s instructions on the applicable law, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">In this appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in overruling and denying his challenge for cause of a juror who, according to the plaintiff, had expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>actual bias, prejudice and partiality in his voir dire testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The record reveals the following underlying facts: On January 17, 1986, after five jurors had already been selected and after the plaintiff had exhausted all of his peremptory challenges juror number 3707 was questioned by counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The juror was first questioned by the defendants\u2019 attorneys. After establishing that the juror was a retired dentist who had practiced for thirty years, the defendants\u2019 counsel asked the juror what his general feelings were with respect to malpractice litigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The juror answered: \u201cI think I would have to say that after thirty years of practice, I probably as most of my cohorts, would have an antagonism against malpractice suits and awards.\u201d The juror stated that his \u201cantagonism\u201d is based on the fact that unjustified claims have been made. The juror went on to acknowledge, however, that some claims are justified and that he could make a fair and impartial judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>issues presented by the evidence in this particular case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The juror said that he never had been involved in any litigation involving malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>The juror was next questioned by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. In response to the attorney\u2019s questions, the juror again indicated that he was antagonistic toward malpractice suits and awards. He told the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, however, that his attitude was general and not specific.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He also said that he believed that in certain situations hospitals or doctors render care that is less than the accepted standard and that \u201cdespite [his] general view,\u201d he recognized that \u201csome of these suits can be meritorious.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When asked if he would be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>be fair and impartial in making an assessment of damages, he stated: \u201cI think I would be fair. You might not think so.\u201d Upon further examination, he stated: \u201cMy general opinion is that many cases are frivolous. . . . Many awards are exorbitant.\u201d When asked by the plaintiffs counsel whether his general feeling about malpractice cases would affect him in this particular case, the juror stated: \u201cI think in specific cases, I could accept any testimony and come out with a conclusion about it.\u201d When asked whether, if he found one of the doctors at fault, he could render a verdict on behalf of the plaintiff, he stated: \u201cI believe I would not hestitate.\u201d When asked if he \u201cwould in any way favor the defendants with respect to the award or damages that might be awarded, if [the jury] found for the plaintiff,\u201d he stated: \u201cI do not think so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The court also questioned the juror. In response to the court\u2019s question as to whether he would approve of himself sitting on the jury if he were the plaintiff, he initially indicated to the court, \u201c[p]robably not.\u201d In response to further questioning, however, the juror indicated that he misunderstood the court\u2019s question and stated that he would consider himself to be a \u201cfair and impartial juror.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>After the court permitted each party the opportunity for further questioning, the plaintiffs counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>requested that the juror be excused for cause. The court denied the request. In denying the request, the court emphasized that the plaintiffs position lacked legal support.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, the court found that the juror was unbiased and that he was capable of rendering a fair and impartial verdict.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After explaining its reasons for denying the plaintiffs challenge, the court cautioned the juror not to be influenced by evidence originating from outside the courtroom and to decide the case \u201csolely upon the basis of the law which I am going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>instruct you on at the conclusion of this case.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, the court, in its opening remarks to the jury, explained that the jury was not to discuss the case and that it was not to \u201ctry to find out anything about the case from any other source except from what you hear in court.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Initially, we must determine whether the claim of the plaintiff was adequately raised in the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 4185 provides in part that \u201c[t]he supreme court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial . . . . \u201d The defendants, New Britain General Hospital and David Mucci, argue that the claim raised on appeal was not \u201cdistinctly\u201d raised below and, therefore, does not warrant appellate review. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">At the time the plaintiff moved to excuse this juror for cause, he specifically mentioned that one of the bases for removal was that the juror was biased. The plaintiffs counsel stated, inter alia, \u201cI think that his answers have indicated that this is a bias, which would prejudice the plaintiff in the case. . . . I am arguing, that this juror would be a biased juror . . . [t]his juror said he is antagonistic towards malpractice cases and awards. It is more than that. This is prejudice, this is a bias, this is a partiality. This is more prejudice, partiality or bias, than I have seen in any of the prospective jurors. This is the real thing. This is why I am asking the court to entertain the discretion it has to keep the jury pure and without bias.\u201d On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the plaintiff adequately has preserved this claim for review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The plaintiff claims that the voir dire testimony of the juror indicates actual bias on his part and that because actual bias had been established, the plaintiffs challenge for cause should have been granted. Specifically, the plaintiff relies in his brief on the following characterization of the juror\u2019s voir dire testimony as establishing actual bias or prejudice: \u201c[H]is opinion after thirty years of practice as a D.D.S. is that he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>an antagonism against malpractice suits and awards . . . that [the] antagonism is based upon unjustified claims having been made . . . he is generally against malpractice cases and awards too because he thinks they are becoming a social burden because of [the dollar] amounts ... he has formed the opinion that he is generally against such claims and actually has a distaste for them ... his general opinion that many cases are frivolous and many awards exorbitant . . . his antagonism is based upon his view that malpractice cases are frivolous, brought frivolously and awards\u2014exorbitant awards . . . that he did not know whether his views would spill over into this case if he were chosen to sit as a juror . . . and his scale of justice is tipped in favor of the defendants at the outset.\u201d The plaintiff argues that \u201c[i]t makes no difference that [the juror] during his voir dire testimony with much equivocation indicated that he could be fair and impartial.\u201d The plaintiff maintains that \u201c[s]uch equivocation coupled with his admissions of actual bias or prejudice . . . called for the trial court ... to sustain the plaintiffs challenge for cause.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In Connecticut, the disqualification of a juror may be based upon the General Statutes or upon the rules of the common law. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-217 (a), 51-240; <em>McCarten </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>103 Conn. 537, 542, 131 A. 505 (1925).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In this appeal, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>does not claim that the juror is disqualified by the General Statutes but does claim that the juror should be disqualified under the common law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">At common law, a challenge to an individual juror for bias or prejudice can be either a principal challenge or a challenge to the favor. <em>McCarten </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>supra. A principal challenge may arise when the connection between the prospective juror and either party is of so close a nature that, when the facts concerning the relationship or interest are proven or when the prospective juror \u201chas formed or expressed an opinion on the question at issue,\u201d the disqualification is conclusively presumed. Id.; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Kokoszka, </em>123 Conn. 161, 164, 193 A. 210 (1937). A challenge to the favor, on the other hand, is one where the connection, being more remote, tends to show bias but does not create a conclusive presumption of bias. <em>McCarten </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>supra, 542-43. \u201cIn such cases, if the court [has] reason to think that bias or prejudice in fact [exists] to such an extent that the juror could not give the parties a fair trial, the juror [should] be held disqualified . . . .\u201d Id., 543. The decision as to the competency of a juror to serve lies in the broad discretion of the trial judge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>203 Conn. 81, 88-89, 523 A.2d 495 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>197 Conn. 60, 65, 495 A.2d 1050 (1985); <em>McCarten </em>v. <em>Connecticut Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">In challenging the competency of this juror to sit on the panel, the plaintiff had the burden of raising his claim of actual bias from \u201c \u2018the realm of speculation to the realm of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>supra, 90-91; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra, 65. In proving actual juror bias, the party challenging for cause must also show that the juror\u2019s state of mind is fixed and settled and not a mere impression. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ziel, </em>supra, 66; <em>State </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>18 Conn. 166, 174-75 (1846). A mere impression of the case when no fixed opinion has been drawn is an insufficient ground to excuse a juror for cause. <em>State </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>supra. It is not required that the jurors chosen to deliberate be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved in the case. As the United States Supreme Court has said, \u201c[t]o hold that the mere existence of [a] preconceived notion . . . is sufficient to rebut the presumption of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality would be to establish an impossible standard. It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>366 U.S. 717, 723, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961); accord <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 799-800, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975); cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Oddy, </em>16 App. Div. 2d 585, 229 N.Y.S.2d 983 (1962).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cA general, abstract bias or prej<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>udice which a juror may entertain to a class of litigation will not of itself disqualify [a juror] from trying a cause, when it appears that he can set that feeling aside and can and will fairly and impartially decide the particular case solely upon the evidence and the instructions of the court; however, where such bias or prejudice is a fixed and abiding one ... he is disqualified as a juror with respect to an action falling in such class.\u201d 31 Am. Jur., Jury \u00a7 183; <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Archbishop, </em>217 Md. 595, 605, 143 A.2d 627 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Greenview Hospital, Inc., </em>587 S.W.2d 249 (Ky. 1979), is instructive on the issue before us. In <em>Mackey, </em>a malpractice action against a hospital and physicians, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky found no error in the trial court\u2019s failure to sustain certain challenges for cause during the voir dire. In sustaining the trial court, the court stated: \u201cThe juror . . . indicated his general antipathy toward medical malpractice actions. He felt that many doctors had been abused in such suits. However, [the juror] was very careful to state that his views on malpractice litigation would have nothing to do with the case being tried. He affirmed that doctors should pay for their mistakes. There is nothing to suggest that [the juror] had any preconceived notion regarding the merits of this case. Likewise, the record does not suggest that [the juror\u2019s] admitted aver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>sion to malpractice litigation would affect his impartiality in weighing the factual issues to be tried. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Grigsby, </em>451 S.W.2d 632, 634 (Ky. 1970).\u201d <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Greenview Hospital, Inc., </em>supra, 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Although this is admittedly a difficult case, we disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s characterization of the juror\u2019s voir dire testimony. While it is true that the juror expressed some antipathy as to both the nature of certain malpractice suits that have been brought in recent years and the size of the awards, the juror did make clear that this antagonism was a generalized opinion held in the abstract and that it would not enter into his consideration of this specific case. The juror never indicated any antagonism toward this particular plaintiff. In fact, the juror stated that \u201cin specific cases, I could accept any testimony and come out with a conclusion about it.\u201d While the juror opined that he believed that many malpractice suits are frivolous and without valid grounds, he also recognized that some malpractice claims are justified and that sometimes plaintiffs with meritorious claims are not adequately compensated. In addition, the juror repeatedly stated that he could be fair and impartial. \u201cWhile we recognize that a juror\u2019s assurances that he or she is equal to the task are not dispositive ... we are aware of the broad discretion of a trial judge which includes his determination of the credibility to be given a juror\u2019s statement in this context.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>supra, 92. The determination as to a potential juror\u2019s impartiality, in which demeanor plays an important part, is particularly within the province of the trial judge and the trial judge has broad discretion in deciding whether to excuse a juror for cause. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>United States, </em>466 A.2d 829, 836 (D.C. App. 1983); <em>Rease </em>v. <em>United States, </em>403 A.2d 322, 325 (D.C. App. 1979), <em>quoting Rideau </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>373 U.S. 723, 733, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>83 S. Ct. 1417, 10 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1963) (Clark, J., dissenting); see <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Greenview Hospital, Inc., </em>supra. Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the plaintiffs challenge for cause.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-6\"> After the jury returned with a defendants\u2019 verdict, the plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the verdict and a motion for an evidentiary hearing because of juror bias, partiality and prejudice. Both motions were denied by the trial court. In this appeal, the plaintiff\u2019s only claim of error is the trial court\u2019s ruling on the challenge for cause. The plaintiff has not raised any issue concerning the trial court\u2019s rulings on his postverdict motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> At the start of the voir dire examination of this juror, the trial judge was in chambers and not present on the bench. Early in the examination, however, the trial judge returned to the bench at the request of counsel. Outside the presence of the juror, the parties referred the judge to the preceding questions and answers. The immediately preceding questions and answers were read back to the trial judge and the voir dire examination continued in his presence. Addressing counsel, the trial judge said: \u201cI am going to let you all ask as many questions as you want.\u201d Cf. <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>202 Conn. 158, 520 A.2d 190 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>197 Conn. 314, 497 A.2d 387 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>196 Conn. 667, 495 A.2d 699 (1985). The trial judge remained on the bench throughout the remainder of the voir dire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-8\"> One defense attorney asked the following question: \u201cAs you come here, do you have any preformed opinion or prejudice one way or another with respect to malpractice litigation?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b587-5\"> The colloquy disclosed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">\u201c[Attorney FitzGerald]: Now, I take it your antagonism is based on unjustified claims having been made; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\u201c[Juror]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">\u201c[Attorney FitzGerald]: Now, do you recognize however that there are instances where a claim is justified?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">\u201c[Juror]: Of course.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">\u201c[Attorney FitzGerald]: Now, the case that is about to be tried is a case of that type, that is where a patient is suing a hospital and a doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-11\">\u201cI would like to ask you this: Do you think that in sitting on a case of this nature, you could make a fair and impartial judgment of the issues presented by the evidence in the particular case without regard to any feeling which you might have generally about the kind of litigation involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-12\">\u201c[Juror]: I would like to hope so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-13\">\u201c[Attorney FitzGerald]: And I do not mean to press you, sir, but I need a little more definite answer for our record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-14\">\u201cCan you give us assurance that if you are selected to sit, you could and would be fair and impartial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-15\">\u201c[Juror]: I believe I would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-16\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-17\">\u201c[Attorney FitzGerald]: So you are telling me that you could sit in the case and fairly and impartially judge the case on the basis of the evidence that is heard in court and the law that the judge says applies to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-18\">\u201c[Juror]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-19\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-20\">\u201c[Attorney Tillinghast]: [A]s we were discussing, with respect to your general opinion on the malpractice suits, suits against hospitals and doctors, is it your opinion that that general distaste or antagonism for that type of case will not in any way enter into the deliberation of this case in your assessment of the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-21\">\u201c[Juror]: I believe this is so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-22\">\u201c[Attorney Tillinghast]: And, you can assure us then that you are able to take the general opinion that you have of these cases, and completely divorce it from the facts in this particular case?

In <em>Oddy, </em>the defendants were on trial for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>felony murder for killing a prison guard. In that case, the court held that the trial court erred in refusing to excuse for cause a juror who expressed concern that his employment experience might interfere with his judgment in the case despite his statement that he \u201cwould try to go by the evidence, to be as honest as [he] could be.\u201d Id., 586. The juror, on the voir dire, said that he had been a deputy sheriff for nine years and a prison guard at Attica state prison for thirty years.

During oral argument, the plaintiff placed great emphasis on the following colloquy between the plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the juror:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">\u201c[Attorney Tillinghast]: Would not the scale be just slightly tipped in the favor of the defendant? Just slightly because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">\u201c[Juror]: Until I heard the evidence and when I heard the evidence, I think I would make an objective conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">\u201c[Attorney Tillinghast]: Until you hear the evidence then, you start off just slightly tipped, is what you are saying? When you hear the evidence, it might balance out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">\u201c[Juror]: I suspect that is the right answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">\u201c[Attorney Tillinghast]: Is that a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">\u201c[Juror]: Sure..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-14\">\u201c[Attorney Tillinghast]: And that slight unbalance, if we cab call it that, is formed by your general opinion that such suits are not liked by you basically; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-15\">\u201c[Juror]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-16\">\u201c[Attorney Tillinghast]: That is a fair statement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-17\">\u201c[Juror]: Sure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">Considering, as we must, the entire far-ranging voir dire which included, inter alia, the close questioning by the trial judge as well as counsel, and the juror\u2019s repeated assertions that his views were general and not specific, and that in an individual case he could be fair and impartial, we disagree that the juror\u2019s general opinion was so fixed as to change the plaintiffs burden of proof. Moreover, the trial judge was present during the voir dire and in a far better position than this court to evaluate the credibility of the juror. Rather than considering this isolated portion of the voir dire in vacuo, he considered all of the testimony. The trial judge did not err in denying the plaintiff\u2019s challenge for cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
