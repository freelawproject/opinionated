We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The underlying facts that led to the charges against the defendant are undisputed. As reported in <em>Garrison I, </em>supra, 385-86, and in the trial court\u2019s three memoranda of decision, the defendant, on January 2, 1982, was visiting at his sister\u2019s Hartford apartment, when the victim, Jeremiah Sharp, arrived on the premises. The victim had been living with the defendant\u2019s sister intermittently for the past four years, and had his clothes in the apartment, but they had recently quarreled anew. The victim arrived intoxicated, and immediately got into an argument with the defendant\u2019s sister, which the defendant tried to stop. The defendant\u2019s sister went to her bedroom, but the argument continued between the defendant and the victim, with the defendant urging the victim to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">In the course of the argument between the defendant and the victim, the victim reached inside his jacket and the defendant noticed that the victim had a pistol in his waistband. Although the victim was the larger man, the defendant was younger, alert and sober, while the victim was drunk, staggering and not in full control of himself. The defendant disarmed the victim by removing the pistol from his waistband. The victim then armed himself with a steak knife and advanced toward the defendant with the knife held high. The defendant backed up, and fired a shot, hitting the victim in the left ankle. Instead of backing up further into an adjacent room, the defendant fired a second shot which caused a fatal injury to the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">On these facts, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal of manslaughter for three reasons. He urged the trial court to conclude that the state had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the defendant knew he could avoid using deadly physical force with complete safety by retreating; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19; (2) the defendant was not acting to prevent an attempt by a criminal trespasser to commit a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>crime of violence on the premises; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-20; and (3) the defendant had the requisite intent to cause serious physical injury. The trial court denied this motion and found the defendant guilty as charged. On appeal, the defendant continues to maintain that the state did not meet its burden of proof on the first two of these claims of justification, self-defense and defense of premises. We will address these claims separately. We find neither to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">A person is justified in using deadly physical force, under the self-defense statute, \u00a7 53a-19 (a), only when he reasonably believes such force to be necessary because he \u201creasonably believes that [his attacker] is (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm.\u201d Even then, under \u00a7 53a-19 (b), with exceptions not applicable here, \u201ca person is not justified in using deadly physical force upon another person if he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety ... by retreating . . . .\u201d As we noted in <em>Garrison I, </em>supra, 387, \u00a7 53a-19 \u201cpresents a question of fact about what the defendant himself reasonably believed about his exposure to jeopardy under the circumstances. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 389, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Viewing the evidence from this perspective, the defendant maintains that the trial court was in error in its conclusion that his use of deadly physical force was not justified. The trial court determined that \u201c[t]he defendant could not have reasonably believed the use of deadly physical force was necessary if he reasonably believed he could have disarmed the decedent.\u201d The court relied on the defendant\u2019s prior disarming of the victim of his pistol, and on the defendant\u2019s sobriety and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>alertness in contrast to the victim\u2019s staggering inebriation, in further concluding that \u201cthe defendant could have thrown the decedent off balance, disarmed him of his knife, and avoided the use of deadly physical force.\u201d Therefore, according to the court, the defendant\u2019s use of force was excessive. The defendant criticizes these conclusions because they are not based on a finding that the defendant himself knew or believed that he might have been able to avoid using deadly force by disarming his attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The state replies that the trial court was entitled, as the trier of fact, to make a determination about the circumstances as they appeared to the defendant. Such a determination required the court to draw inferences from the facts that had been placed in evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gabriel, </em>192 Conn. 405, 425, 473 A.2d 300 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Scielzo, </em>190 Conn. 191, 198-99, 460 A.2d 951 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Iasevoli, </em>188 Conn. 325, 332-33, 449 A.2d 996 (1982). Inferentially, the court could find that the defendant in fact knew that he could have disarmed the victim and that the defendant was therefore unreasonable in believing that deadly force was necessary. Accordingly, his use of such deadly force was unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The difficulty with the state\u2019s reply is that the trial court did not make the precise finding upon which the state would have us rely. The court found that the defendant could have disarmed the victim without expressly finding that the defendant knew or believed he could have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">We need not decide how to resolve this difficulty because the court was explicit in its alternate finding with regard to the applicability of the defense of self-defense. Under \u00a7 53a-19 (b), the use of deadly force that might otherwise have been justifiable is not warranted if someone \u201cknows that he can avoid the necessity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>using such force with complete safety . . . byretreating . . . .\u201d The trial court expressly found that the defendant in this case \u201cknew he could retreat with complete safety.\u201d The court based this finding on the defendant\u2019s familiarity with his sister\u2019s apartment, which he had frequently visited, and on the defendant\u2019s position, at the time of the shooting, near the doorway to an adjacent room. Despite the defendant\u2019s claims to the contrary, these were findings that the trial court could appropriately make to sustain its conclusion that the state had met its burden of proof with respect to justification as a matter of self-defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Braxton, </em>196 Conn. 685, 691-92, 495 A.2d 273 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>195 Conn. 166, 173-74, 487 A.2d 177 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Justification for the use of deadly force may also be found in the provisions of \u00a7 53a-20 dealing with defense of premises. The defendant in this case relied on that portion of \u00a7 53a-20 which permits the use of deadly force by a person who is privileged to be on the premises and who \u201creasonably believes [such force] is necessary to prevent an attempt by the [criminal] trespasser to commit arson or any crime of violence . . . .\u2019\u2019In order for this section to apply in this case, the defendant would have had to be privileged to be on the premises, and the trial court so found. In addition, the victim Sharp would have had to be a criminal trespasser. The court concluded, to the contrary, that the victim was not on the premises as a criminal trespasser.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The court\u2019s conclusion that the victim was not a criminal trespasser was based upon its factual findings about the nature of the relationship between the victim and the defendant\u2019s sister. Noting that the victim and the defendant\u2019s sister had lived together in her apartment on and off for approximately four years, the court found that their relationship had been marked by a long history of periodic quarrels and reunions: \u201cThat the decedent\u2019s visit was to be reinstated or to remove his belongings was standard procedure.\u201d After breaking up a heated argument between his sister and the victim, the defendant himself asked the victim to leave and come back another time. In light of these circumstances, the court concluded that the victim\u2019s conduct did not constitute criminal trespass, which requires, at a minimum, that a person enter or remain on the premises of another person, \u201cknowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-107, 53a-108, 53a-109.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>The defendant maintains that this conclusion is in error because, despite the couple\u2019s protracted and stormy relationship, the defendant\u2019s sister had the legal right to protect herself and her apartment from the violence threatened by the victim. <em>Thurman </em>v. <em>Torrington, </em>595 F. Sup. 1521, 1528 (D. Conn. 1984). That right does not come into issue, however, unless it is exercised in some manifest fashion. As the defendant acknowledges in his brief, the trial court apparently decided that the defendant\u2019s sister had \u201ccried wolf\u2019 too often in the past to give credibility to her actions on the day in question. The court did not find that, because of the history of the couple\u2019s relationship, she lacked the authority to change it for the future. Instead, the court found that, in view of this history and her own intoxication, her order to the victim to leave was simply a part of the couple\u2019s ongoing relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The actor\u2019s knowledge that he is not privileged or licensed to enter or to remain on the premises is a requirement of criminal trespass. <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>35 Conn. Sup. 555, 563-64, 398 A.2d 1197 (1978); 2 Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1980) \u00a7 221.2, comment 2 (a). Bearing in mind this requirement of scienter, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination that the victim was not a criminal trespasser finds support in the subordinate facts that it found.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) provides: \u201cmanslaughter in the first degree: class b felony, (a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-55a. manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm: class b felony: one year not suspendable.

(2) Was the defendant\u2019s use of force excessive because he knew that he could retreat with complete safety? (3) Was the decedent on the premises as a criminal trespasser?
