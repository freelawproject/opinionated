He also claims that the majority of the three judge panel erred in failing to find him not guilty of felony murder by reason of insanity as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The underlying facts are as follows:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On December 1, 1980, the defendant burglarized and stole various items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>from two summer residences on Bay Road in East Hampton. These residences were unoccupied at the time. On the same date, the defendant also burglarized the home of the victim. The victim, who had been home at the time of the burglary, was killed by the defendant during the course of that crime. The defendant stole the victim\u2019s motor vehicle, storing the articles he had taken during the three burglaries in the trunk. The defendant then drove to Michigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On December 4,1980, Officer Gaylord Schurr of the Kent County sheriff\u2019s department in Grand Rapids, Michigan, was alerted to be on the lookout for a Connecticut registered motor vehicle which had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>involved in a hit-and-run accident. Additionally, he was told that the vehicle had been reported stolen and had belonged to the victim of a homicide. Schurr observed the vehicle and, with the help of other officers, apprehended the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">While in custody for the felonious possession of a stolen motor vehicle and after having been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the defendant, on December 4, 1980, gave a tape recorded statement to the Michigan police, fully describing the burglaries and the homicide in Connecticut. Subsequently, on December 5,1980, the defendant, while still held in Michigan, gave a second incriminating statement, this time to the Connecticut state police.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>The majority opinion found that the two statements as to what had occurred in Connecticut were \u201csubstantially and materially consistent with each other.\u201d It also found that the two versions of what had occurred, however, were \u201cnot substantially and materially consistent\u201d with that given to the two psychiatrists, Walter A. Borden and Colin C.J. Angliker, both of whom testified for the defendant at the trial. Additionally, the majority opinion found that the defendant \u201cunderstood and appreciated that it was wrong and against the law to commit burglary and larceny, and [that the defendant] was not driven by any inner \u2018compulsion\u2019 to perpetrate said crimes.\u201d The majority concluded that the defendant had been capable of forming an intent to commit burglary and larceny and was \u201cfree of any compulsion to do so by reason of a mental disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">We address first the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements in violation of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to the assistance of counsel under the fifth, sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The defendant claims that his statements, given to the Michigan police on December 4, 1980, and to the Connecticut state trooper on December 5, 1980, were erroneously admitted into evidence because both were made without a valid voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights. In addition to the claim of a lack of a valid waiver, he claims that the statement of December 5,1980, was \u201ctainted\u201d by the constitutional violations of the December 4,1980 statement. The invalidity of the second statement, he argues, goes beyond the \u201cletting the cat out of the bag\u201d rationale. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bayer, </em>331 U.S. 532, 67 S. Ct. 1394, 91 L. Ed. 1654 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The state maintains that the trial court properly admitted into evidence the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements. The state essentially argues that after the defendant first informed the police of his desire for a lawyer, interrogation ceased and that it was only after the defendant had initiated discussion with the police and validly waived the constitutional rights that he had previously invoked, that he made the inculpatory statement of December 4,1980. According to the state, the December 5,1980 statement was made after an explicit and valid waiver of his rights and there was no \u201ctaint\u201d from the earlier statement. The state maintains, therefore, that both statements were obtained after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>defendant\u2019s constitutional rights had been fully-respected. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Certain background circumstances will be helpful in the discussion of this issue. Immediately after leaving the victim\u2019s home, the defendant loaded the items taken in the three burglaries into the victim\u2019s car and drove to Michigan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At approximately 10:50 a.m. on December 4,1980, Schurr was alerted on his police car radio to be on the lookout for a dark blue Plymouth car with Connecticut license plate 3121 that had been involved in a hit-and-run accident at a shopping mall in North Kent. Schurr sighted the Connecticut car at approximately 11:47 a.m., radioed for assistance, and, with the help of additional police, apprehended the defendant. About ten to fifteen minutes after Schurr had initially observed the car, he handcuffed the defendant and they proceeded to the Kent County sheriff\u2019s department in Grand Rapids.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">At 1:09 p.m., Detective Sergeant Larry French of the Kent County sheriff\u2019s department first saw the defendant in an interview room at the sheriff\u2019s department in Grand Rapids. Present with him was Detective Sergeant Clara Kidder. French removed the handcuffs from the defendant, who at the time was quietly sitting in a chair. Immediately after he removed the handcuffs, French asked the defendant \u201cif he had any idea why he was at the police department?\u201d The defendant replied, stating that \u201cno, he didn\u2019t care.\u201d After French remarked that the defendant must be curious as to why the police were holding him, the defendant said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t care to know.\u201d French informed the defendant of why he had been apprehended, introduced Kidder and advised the defendant of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Prior to interviewing the defendant, French had spoken to a lieutenant of the Connecticut state police department. During this discussion, which occurred at approximately 12:40 p.m., French advised the Connecticut police \u201cessentially\u201d that they had a person in custody who had been driving a vehicle wanted by Connecticut as stolen and that that person had no identification on him. French also informed the Connecticut police that this person fit the description of a person who earlier that day had been involved in an accident in Kent County. The Connecticut lieutenant told French at that time that the vehicle was believed to have been taken from a residence in Connecticut where a woman had been found dead in her home, that \u201cthey had [as a suspect] an individual [named] John Evans\u201d who lived within one mile of the victim, that Evans had been missing since December 1, 1980, and that Evans\u2019 whereabouts were then unknown. At that time, French did not know that the person they then admittedly had in custody for the Michigan felony of possession of a stolen motor vehicle was actually John Evans. He was not in custody for any other reason at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">When French gave the defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he advised the defendant that if he decided to answer questions, he could stop at any time and request an attorney and that an attorney would be appointed for him if he could not afford one. Although the defendant refused to sign the rights form proffered by French, he did indicate that he understood his rights and that he did not have any question as to what his rights were. He then stated that he wanted an attorney. Although the Michigan police did not contact an attorney at that time, French informed the defendant that \u201cwe would see that he got an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">At that time, Kidder told the defendant that there was \u201can identification form\u201d that had to be filled out as he was to be locked up in jail. The information sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>included such things as his name, address, date of birth, height, weight, color of eyes, driver\u2019s license number, social security number and nearest relative. The defendant, although nervous, appeared alert and was responsive to the questions, none of which had anything to do with why he was arrested. The information was obtained by use of a form which is customarily used by the county sheriff\u2019s department for booking purposes in all cases of this kind. Kidder left the interview at approximately 1:30 p.m. in order to obtain a search warrant for examination of the defendant\u2019s bodily substances and clothes.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">After Kidder left, French returned to the interview room and proceeded with the paper work involved in processing the defendant for booking. As French did this, he noticed that the defendant began crying and mumbled several times. A number of times French asked, \u201cDid you say something?\u201d The defendant responded by telling French that \u201cit was none of his business.\u201d Again, when the defendant mumbled under his breath, French asked, \u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cYou are not going to understand it anyway.\u201d This pattern of conversation continued for about one and one-half hours. During this time, French noticed that Evans\u2019 face was red, that he was \u201csniffing\u201d a lot and that he had smoked five or six cigarettes which had been given to him by French.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">At the end of this time, the defendant told French that he had \u201cbetter get a lot of paper and some tapes.\u201d French sent for Schurr and when he arrived told Schurr that the defendant wanted \u201cto talk to us\u201d and that he was requesting that paper and \u201ctape recording tapes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>be brought into the interview room. French arranged to have a tape placed in a recording machine. French again informed him of his constitutional rights, reminding the defendant of his prior request to have an attorney present during questioning. The defendant then waived his constitutional rights and French began to interrogate him. Approximately ten or fifteen minutes later,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> French noticed that the tape recorder had not recorded any of their discussion. French then told the defendant that they would have to start over again, to which the defendant responded, \u201cDo we have to go through this whole thing again?\u201d Thereafter, the defendant gave an inculpatory statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">At trial, when the state introduced the tape recording into evidence, the defendant objected, claiming that the statement had been taken in violation of his constitutional rights. After the voir dire examination on the admission of the confession to the Michigan police, the three judge panel ruled that the recorded statement was admissible. In doing so, it found that \u201cthe rights of counsel were knowingly and voluntarily waived based on the totality of the circumstances as testified to by [French].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Settled principles of law control the role of police during custodial interrogations. See, e.g., <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 106 S. Ct. 1135, 89 L. Ed. 2d 410 (1986); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>469 U.S. 91, 105 S. Ct. 490, 83 L.

Ed. 2d 297 (1980); <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 99 S. Ct. 1755, 60 L. Ed. 2d 286 (1979); <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 512 A.2d 189 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Derrico, </em>181 Conn. 151, 434 A.2d 356, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1064, 101 S. Ct. 789, 66 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1980). If a suspect indicates that he wishes to remain silent, \u201cthe interrogation must cease\u201d and if he requests counsel, \u201cthe interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 474; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 482. <em>Miranda </em>also holds that \u201c[t]he defendant may waive effectuation\u201d of the rights conveyed in the warnings, \u201cprovided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 444; see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938). Once a suspect has invoked his right to counsel, he is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made available to him \u201cunless the accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police\u201d; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 484-85; <em>and </em>he has knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel which he has previously invoked. <em>Connecticut </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>479 U.S. 523, 107 S. Ct. 828, 93 L. Ed. 2d 920 (1987); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>supra. Waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights must, of course, be voluntary. <em>Moran </em>v. <em>Burbine, </em>supra, 421. \u201cOnly if the \u2018totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u2019 reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">There is no real debate but that the defendant, while in custody, invoked his right to counsel at approximately 1:09 p.m. on December 4, 1980. The issues which must be addressed, however, are: (1) whether the questions posed by the \u201cidentification form,\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>which the defendant responded, violated his <em>Miranda </em>rights; and (2) whether, after invoking his right to an attorney, <em>he </em>\u201cinitiated\u201d discussions with the police and validly waived his earlier-invoked constitutional right to counsel. The three judge panel ruled that he did and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Our first inquiry is whether the questioning of the defendant after he had been informed of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and had requested the opportunity to speak with an attorney violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. At the outset, we recognize that after a suspect has invoked his right to speak with an attorney, <em>Miranda </em>does not prohibit <em>all </em>communication between the suspect and law enforcement officers. Instead, <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny proscribe continued <em>interrogation </em>of the suspect. The issue that must be resolved, therefore, is whether the questioning concerning the \u201cidentification form\u201d that concededly took place between 1:09 p.m., when the defendant invoked his right to speak with an attorney, and the time when the defendant subsequently waived that right, amounted to \u201cinterrogation\u201d of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>supra, the United States Supreme Court considered what sorts of words or conduct on the part of police constitute \u201cinterrogation.\u201d That court held that interrogation may be \u201ceither express questioning or its functional equivalent\u201d; id., 300-301; and defined the latter to include any statements or actions \u201cthat the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d Id., 301. Although the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion appears to assume that direct questioning of a suspect in custody always constitutes interrogation, courts which have addressed the issue after <em>Innis </em>have held that the reasoning which supports <em>Innis </em>and the purpose behind <em>Miranda </em>itself, compel the conclusion that not every express question posed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>in a custodial setting is equivalent to \u201cinterrogation.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Percy, </em>738 F.2d 214, 219 (7th Cir. 1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>719 F.2d 375, 378 (11th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1034, 104 S. Ct. 1304, 79 L. Ed. 2d 703 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Avery, </em>717 F.2d 1020, 1024-25 (6th Cir. 1983), reh. denied, 466 U.S. 905, 104 S. Ct. 1683, 80 L. Ed. 2d 157 (1984); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>669 F.2d 1231, 1237 (9th Cir. 1981). Rather, the test is whether, under all the circumstances involved in a given case, the questions asked are \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The test as to whether a particular question is \u201clikely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d is objective; the subjective intent of the police officer is relevant but not conclusive and the relationship of the questions asked to the crime committed is \u201chighly relevant.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mata-Abundiz, </em>717 F.2d 1277, 1280 (9th Cir. 1983), citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra, 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u201cOrdinarily, the routine gathering of background, biographical data will not constitute interrogation.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mata-Abundiz, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra; see <em>United States ex rel. Hines </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>521 F.2d 1109, 1113 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1090, 96 S. Ct. 884, 47 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1976); see also W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.7. We-are aware, however, that \u201c[a] person\u2019s name, age, address, marital status and similar data, while usually non-incriminatory in character, may in a particular context provide the missing link required to convict.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Hines </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>supra, 1112; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mata-Abundiz, </em>supra. Cognizant of the <em>Miranda </em>jurisprudence, \u201cwe recognize the potential for abuse by law enforcement officers who might, under the guise of seeking \u2018objective\u2019 or \u2018neutral\u2019 information, deliberately elicit an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>incriminating statement from a suspect.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>665 F.2d 404, 407 (1st Cir. 1981). A balance must be struck between information legitimately required by law enforcement to facilitate booking,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> arraignment, bail or permitting relatives of a defendant to confer with him and the protection of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hinckley, </em>672 F.2d 115, 125 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <em>United States ex rel. Hines </em>v. <em>LaVallee, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Since the determination as to whether a particular question constituted interrogation is essentially factual, we apply the clearly erroneous standard; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>supra; and conclude that the three judge panel was not clearly erroneous in finding that the questions asked of the defendant, under the circumstances of this case, did not constitute \u201cinterrogation.\u201d In this case, the questions which were asked consisted of routine \u201cbooking\u201d questions which were part of a standard processing procedure which was essentially administrative in nature and \u201cnot likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d These routine, noninvestigatory questions were unrelated to the crime and were objectively neutral. Additionally, there is nothing in the record to suggest an improper motive on the part of the Michigan police. Although we need not decide the scope of possible questions that may be posed to a suspect as part of a routine booking procedure, we conclude that there was no error in the finding of the three judge panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Our next inquiry is whether the defendant, having invoked his right to counsel and to remain silent, did <em>initiate </em>\u201cfurther communications, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 485. In the <em>Edwards </em>context, the United States Supreme Court eschewed the building of \u201ca superstructure of legal refinements around the word \u2018initiate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>462 U.S. 1039, 1045, 103 S. Ct. 2830, 77 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1983). In doing so, it recognized that there are undoubtedly situations where a bare inquiry by either a defendant, such as a request for a glass of water or a request to use a telephone, or by a police officer should not be held to initiate any conversation or dialogue. Id. Such inquiries or statements, \u201crelating to routine incidents of the custodial relationship\u201d will not generally \u201cinitiate\u201d a conversation as that word was used in <em>Edwards. Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>supra. \u201c[T]hey cannot be fairly said to represent a desire on the part of an accused to open up a more generalized discussion relating directly or indirectly to the investigation.\u201d Id.; see <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>141 Ariz. 141, 144-45, 685 P.2d 1293 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In our view, the defendant did \u201cinitiate\u201d the discussion, resulting in his inculpatory statement, as required by <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 482. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>supra, 464; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 480. When the defendant told French that the latter \u201c[had] better get a lot of paper and some tapes,\u201d this \u201cwas not merely a necessary inquiry arising out of the incidents of the custodial relationship,\u201d but could \u201creasonably have been interpreted by [French] as relating generally to the investigation.\u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>supra, 1046; <em>McCree </em>v. <em>Housewright, </em>689 F.2d 797, 802 (8th Cir. 1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brezee, </em>66 Hawaii 162, 164-65, 657 P.2d 1044 (1983). The defendant\u2019s request to obtain paper and tapes can fairly be characterized as representing \u201ca desire [on the defendant\u2019s part] to open up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>a more generalized discussion relating directly or indirectly to the investigation.\u201d <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Bradshaw, </em>supra, 1045. That French understood this to be the case is apparent from the fact that not only did he again advise the defendant of his constitutional rights but also specifically discussed with him his earlier request for an attorney. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the defendant \u201cinitiated\u201d discussion with the Michigan police officers and that the principle of <em>Edwards </em>was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">We also conclude that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to counsel he had previously invoked. The record indicates that once the defendant \u201cinitiated\u201d the conversation, French again advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. French specifically reminded the defendant of his earlier request for an attorney because, \u201cbefore going further,\u201d French wanted \u201cto make sure in his own mind\u201d that the defendant wanted to revoke his earlier request for an attorney. The defendant\u2019s conduct in proceeding to discuss the events in Connecticut clearly indicated that he gave up his right to have an attorney present during the interview. On the voir dire, the panel had before it evidence from French, the sole witness on the voir dire, that while the defendant seemed normal, he was nervous and that he had no reason to believe that the defendant was of very low intelligence. Aside from those occasions on which the defendant was mumbling, French had no difficulty in understanding the defendant. During the time that the defendant was in the presence of French, he did not indicate or manifest that he was injured in any way nor did he give French any reason to believe that he was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The defendant did not appear to be \u201cignorant of the process\u201d and in fact had told Kidder that he had been arrested before. Actually, the defendant in the past had waived his rights in writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ing when he had given a sworn statement in connection with an April, 1978 charge of burglary and larceny in East Hampton. The defendant was capable of understanding and appeared to understand his constitutional rights throughout his time with French and Schurr. There was a valid waiver of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 163-67, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra; <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 475-76. There was no error in admitting into evidence the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statement of December 4, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We turn now to the defendant\u2019s claim that his tape recorded inculpatory statement given at approximately 11:40 a.m. on December 5, 1980, to Connecticut state trooper Jonathan Schweitzer had been tainted by the constitutional violations surrounding his statement of the preceding day to the Michigan police. This statement, he claims, not only goes beyond the rationale of \u201cletting the cat out of the bag\u201d but also that the facts surrounding it clearly fail to show a \u201cknowing and intelligent waiver\u201d of his fifth and sixth amendment rights. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">From what we have already determined, there is no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>December 5,1980, was constitutionally tainted by the earlier statement; the \u201ccat out of the bag\u201d rationale is inapplicable. In addition, it is of significance that when the statement was given to Schweitzer, about eighteen hours had elapsed since the statement of the preceding day, and also that prior to taking the statement, Schweitzer again advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and the defendant explicitly waived those rights. While not controlling, it is relevant that prior to giving the statement to Schweitzer, the defendant had signed the <em>Miranda </em>rights form which Schweitzer had read to him. There was no error in admitting the statement of December 5, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The defendant next claims that the majority of the three judge panel committed reversible error in failing to find him not guilty of felony murder by reason of insanity as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13. The defendant claims that the opinions offered by his expert witnesses, Walter Borden and Colin Angliker, both psychiatrists, constituted \u201csubstantial evidence tending to prove insanity,\u201d thereby requiring the state to prove his sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He contends that \u201cconsidering the detailed and uncontroverted testimony as to [his] long history of severe psychiatric illness right up to the time of the incident and even up to the time of the trial, and the absence of relevant and competent testimony in rebuttal,\u201d the state has failed in its burden of proof. He also argues that the majority made \u201cvirtually contradictory findings\u201d which in turn were not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">To analyze this claim properly, certain additional circumstances should be set out in some detail. The state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>did not produce any expert witnesses to testify in its case-in-chief. It did, however, produce French and Schweitzer, the two police officers who were present when the defendant gave his statements. Their observations, recollections and opinions concerning the conduct and condition of the defendant, as already set out, were developed both on direct and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Dr. Borden, whose qualifications were conceded by the state, was the first expert who testified for the defense. On direct examination, he testified, inter alia, as follows: that he had examined the defendant for approximately one hour on April 21,1981, at the Hartford Correctional Center and that he had reviewed certain hospital records that had been made available to him concerning the defendant\u2019s prior mental history. He stated that he knew of other institutional admissions for which he did not have the records.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> His review of the records, which \u201cwere fairly clear cut,\u201d described \u201csevere paranoid schizophrenia with delusions of persecution; delusions of grandeur, auditory hallucinations; severe thought disorder with associated and disorganized thinking.\u201d Borden related that the defendant \u201cwas found from the record to be impulsive, violent . . . assaultive at times, uncontrolled and unpredictable.\u201d He referred to a notation in a January 14,1980 hospital record which stated, \u201che plans to commit murder and go undetected and become famous as a fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ure.\u201d Borden\u2019s examination disclosed that the defendant was able to communicate, was still delusional and was able to give a good account of what had happened in Connecticut. It was Borden\u2019s opinion that at the time of his examination, the defendant \u201cwas severely mentally ill [and] . . . potentially suicidal.\u201d Borden related that in the fall of 1980, the defendant believed that he was \u201ca \u2018Ninja,\u2019 a Japanese assassin,\u201d that he \u201cfelt he had to kill somebody, and [that] he selected his neighbor woman and he knew he had a fairly good relationship with [her] on a realistic basis. He in a sense knew he would kill her sometime before this.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">After having Borden look at a copy of the statute on the insanity defense, defense counsel also asked him if he had an opinion. Borden replied, inter alia, that the defendant \u201cdid suffer from mental disease, that being schizophrenia paranoid type, and that as a result of that disease, he had a substantial impairment in his capacity, both to appreciate the wrongfulness of his behavior and to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">On cross-examination, which was extensive, Borden testified, inter alia, as follows: The defendant was aware that Borden came to the jail to do a psychiatric examination of him. Borden found there were psychotic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>delusions, fresh signs of psychosis and that the clinical data from Hartford Hospital and Connecticut Valley Hospital \u201creally were consistent with the crime.\u201d He testified that from the January, 1980 hospital data, the defendant \u201ccouldn\u2019t have given a clearer warning, and that was quite consistent with his account as recollected as [to] what happened just preceding the time of the crime.\u201d Although there \u201cmay be some embellishment [by the defendant],\u201d Borden thought that the evidence indicated that the defendant was giving \u201ca fairly accurate account\u201d of what had occurred. Borden candidly admitted that he was not aware of what the defendant had said at the time of either of the statements to the police, as he did not have those statements available and had not heard them. He did admit, however, that the tape recordings of the statements would have been helpful in getting a more accurate picture of the defendant\u2019s feelings at the time of the crime. Although he felt that the defendant was psychotic all during the course of the day of December 1, 1980, it was not his opinion that all his actions on that day were influenced by his psychosis. He conceded that just because a person commits a serious crime and may be seriously ill, it does not necessarily follow that the crime was the result of the mental illness from which he was suffering. He had no opinion whether the defendant was \u201clegally insane\u201d at the time he committed the other two burglaries. Borden could not \u201celicit\u201d any clear auditory hallucinations in the defendant on December 1,1980. Borden stated that it would not surprise him if the defendant had not told the police about such things as being compelled to kill because, according to Borden, \u201cI think you have to know what to ask.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The account Borden received from the defendant when he inquired about the specifics of what had happened, was that the defendant did not go to the vie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>tim\u2019s house to steal, to burglarize and try to get away, but that \u201che went in to kill.\u201d In his examination, Borden tried to determine \u201cwhat really was motivating him\u201d and \u201cthe major emphasis in the account [Borden] got from [the defendant] was that [the defendant had been] really struggling for a long time with both suicidal and homicidal impulses. The stealing behavior [Borden thought] was relatively recent and a relatively minor issue.\u201d Borden also testified that if the defendant had indicated to the police that he had killed the victim to cover up the crime, that in and of itself did not imply a psychosis. Borden opined that the defendant realized that the law prohibited not only his stealing but also his breaking into the victim\u2019s home when he did. In addition, Borden testified that the defendant \u201cknew\u201d at the time he had committed the murder that the law prohibited it, but that the defendant could not really appreciate that fact, nor could he conform his conduct to the requirements of law at the time he had committed the crime. The defendant \u201cfelt compelled that he had to do [the homicide],\u201d a \u201creal compulsion\u201d that went back one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">On redirect, Borden stated that the defendant appeared to be of average intelligence although not well educated. Although no person ever gives \u201ca really precise entirely objective account,\u201d Borden felt that even if the defendant had tried to embellish it, he was \u201cschizophrenic severely and sick all the ways mentioned and the findings of the examination and the account [the defendant] gave [were] consistent with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Dr. Angliker, whose qualifications were also conceded by the state and who had examined the defendant at the state\u2019s request, testified for the defense. He had seen the defendant on October 9 and 10,1981, and had spoken to him in jail for approximately six hours. The state had furnished him certain materials, including a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>transcript of the defendant\u2019s confession.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Angliker did not have any hospital records. Angliker had read Borden\u2019s report which referred to several hospitalizations and had no \u201cspecial disagreement\u201d with anything in that report. As a result of his examination, Angliker concluded that the defendant was suffering from \u201ca long standing mental illness, dating back many years [to] early adolescence.\u201d That illness was paranoid schizophrenia, and as part of that illness the defendant suffered from hallucinations and delusions of persecution for many years. These were among the symptoms that the defendant, who was then twenty-four years of age, manifested during Angliker\u2019s examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Angliker testified that the statement of the defendant in January, 1980, referred to in the Connecticut Valley Hospital record that he would \u201ckill someone,\u201d should have served as a warning. Given his view of the length of the defendant\u2019s mental illness over the years and what had occurred on December 1,1980, the \u201ckill someone\u201d notation was consistent with his mental disease. Even after examining the defendant and considering \u201ca long statement\u201d given by the defendant at the sheriff\u2019s office in Michigan, Angliker concluded that the defendant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia on December 1,1980. The defendant told Angliker about his being a \u201cNinja\u201d and his lying in wait, but Angliker did not \u201cgo into it in too great detail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Angliker was familiar with the statutory test for insanity. As a result of his examination, it was his opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>ion that, at the time of the homicide, the defendant \u201cwas, in fact, suffering from a mental disease and did lack substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to [conform] his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The defendant argues that the panel erred in not finding him not guilty by reason of insanity. We disagree. \u201c \u2018The state has a right, in the first instance, to rely on the presumption that the defendant was sane at the time of the offenses alleged in the indictment, and thereupon it becomes the privilege of the accused to offer such evidence as he desires upon the subject of his mental condition. As soon as <em>substantial evidence </em>tending to prove insanity comes into the case, <em>the presumption loses all operative effect. </em>The state may then rebut this evidence if it desires or submit the issue to the court upon the evidence offered. In either case, the issue having been raised, the burden rests upon the state, as it does in all other essential elements in the case, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was legally sane and responsible at the time the offenses were committed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Conte, </em>157 Conn. 209, 212, 251 A.2d 81, cert. denied, 396 U.S. 964, 90 S.

In discharging this burden, the state is under no obligation to produce expert testimony of sanity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ontra, </em>supra, 484-85; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vennard, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kenyon, </em>supra, 48-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Turning to our standard of review, we have repeatedly stated that our review of the conclusions of the trier of fact, whether it be a judge, a panel of judges or a jury, is limited. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 459, 442 A.2d 906 (1982); <em>State v. D'Antuono, </em>186 Conn. 414, 421, 441 A.2d 846 (1982); <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 9268), </em>184 Conn. 157, 169, 439 A.2d 958 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 606. \u201cThis court will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s [judgment] and will affirm the conclusion of the trier of fact if it is reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom. . . . The probative force of direct and circumstantial evidence is the same.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Antuono, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>194 Conn. 198, 206, 479 A.2d 237 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 391, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 607 (1981). The weight to be given both the opinion evidence of expert witnesses and the lay evidence of sanity is for the trier of fact to determine and a trier may disbelieve all or any portion of the evidence tending to prove insanity or may construe such evidence contrary from the parties\u2019 assertions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>185 Conn. 402, 409, 441 A.2d 119 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Conn. 63, 73-74, 441 A.2d 84 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ontra, </em>supra, 484. The credibility of expert witnesses is a matter to be determined by the trier of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 610; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofone, </em>164 Conn. 162, 165, 319 A.2d 381 (1972). \u201cIn its consideration of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>of an expert witness, the trial court might weigh, as it sees fit, the expert\u2019s \u2018expertise, his opportunity to observe the defendant and to form an opinion, and his thoroughness. It might consider also the reasonableness of his judgments about the underlying facts and of the conclusions which he drew from them.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 610.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 9268), </em>supra, 170. After applying these principles to our review of the record, we conclude that the majority of the three judge panel did not err in ultimately concluding that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of felony murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c. This determination also properly included their conclusion that on December 1, 1980, the defendant broke into the victim\u2019s home \u201cwith the intent and for the purpose of burglarizing it\u201d and that he killed the victim \u201cwhile in the course of committing a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Having already set out at some length certain evidence that was before the three judge panel, we examine the majority\u2019s memorandum of decision which sets out its subordinate facts and conclusions. We look first to those portions of the memorandum where the defendant claims that the majority made \u201cvirtually contradictory findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The panel properly found that the defendant \u201cvoluntarily gave a full statement of his criminal activities in Connecticut to the Michigan police and the Connecticut state police, independently, and on two separate days.\u201d Here we note that not only did the three judge panel hear and observe French and Schweitzer as they testified at length on the voir dire and at trial, but that the panel also played the tape recordings of each statement.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The majority of the panel found that the defendant\u2019s two versions of what had occurred in Connecticut relevant to the aforesaid criminal activity were substantially and materially consistent with each other. At this point, it will be helpful to consider these determinations together. The first statement given in Michigan on December 4, 1980, was much longer than that given the following day.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A close examination of the two statements justifies the majority\u2019s finding that they were substantially and materially consistent with each other. As to his criminal activity, the two statements evidence a steady continuity throughout, inter sese, and they are essentially similar in legal character. This is not to say that they are absolutely consistent, but they are substantially and materially consistent. Briefly, and only by way of illustration, each indicates that he had intended, unemployed and without money as he was, to break into the victim\u2019s house and steal her money as well as her car keys. Each indicates that he had thought a long time about breaking into that house and taking her car. Each indicates that he had hoped that he could get in and get out, without her hearing him. Each indicates that he had known that she was deaf and was watching television that night on the first floor. Each indicates that he had gone through the house selecting items he thought might have value, had put them in one of the victim\u2019s suitcases and had driven to Michigan with them in the stolen car. Each indicates that he had taken money from her purse. Each indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>cates that, as the victim lay at the bottom of the stairs, the defendant sat on her with his hand on her throat.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The defendant contests the finding that the statements that he gave to the police were substantially and materially inconsistent with those given to Borden and Angliker who examined him some months later and especially as concerns his intent and motivation. We disagree. Despite the defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary, the evidence of his long psychiatric history was not uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The three judge panel had before it evidence, referred to above, which the majority could have credited that demonstrated not only that he had not been wholly candid in the account he gave to the two doctors but which objectively indicated a planned development and execution of the crimes of which he was found guilty.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In that connection, the defendant himself told the police that he had thought a lot about breaking into the victim\u2019s home, that as he crouched outside that night before going in, he pushed leaves over the shiny part of his boots, and that he was wearing an army jacket together with the hood of a wet suit and a black scarf covering his face. Additionally, he stated that after he broke in and smoked a cigarette upstairs, he was careful to put the unsmoked portion in his pocket, that he wore gloves and never took them off until he left the house, that he pulled out the telephone jack and put it in another room to get it away from the victim. He went on to say that he went through the house looking for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>items of value and put them in a suitcase, that he went through the victim\u2019s pocketbook and took approximately eighty-five dollars in cash, that after he left the victim\u2019s house, he also put in her car items he had taken from the other two burglaries, and that while he spent at face value some of the coins he stole from the victim, he chose not to go to a coin collector\u2019s shop he passed to sell any as they might be traced. We also note that there was evidence that, as the defendant talked to the police, he was coherent, understood the questions, had a good recollection of the details of the crime and there was no suggestion that he was of low intelligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Thus, from the evidence presented, together with reasonable inferences drawn from it, the majority could reasonably have concluded that the defendant\u2019s versions to the psychiatrists, as set out above, were substantially and materially inconsistent with those given to the police, and, as the majority found, especially as to his intent and motivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">It was the panel\u2019s function to consider, sift and weigh all the evidence including a determination as to whether any opinions given concerning the defendant\u2019s sanity were undercut or attenuated under all the circumstances. See, e.g., <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 9268), </em>supra, 170; <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 610. While expert testimony is of great assistance, the ultimate issue of sanity, including intent, is decided by the trier of fact. <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Docket No. 9268), </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kenyon, </em>supra; <em>People </em>v. <em>Denton, </em>138 Mich. App. 568, 572, 360 N.W.2d 245 (1984). The discharge of this function by the majority was not, as we have shown, a summary rejection of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s experts as he appears to claim.

In effect, it was a combination of both suicidal and homicidal acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The defendant also said to Borden: \u201cI tried to kill myself so many times ...

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArT\">dissenting. I agree that the defendant\u2019s statements were admissible, in light of <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986), and the defendant\u2019s failure to present any reasoned argument that the Connecticut constitution affords him greater rights than those available to him under the United States constitution. I do not agree, however, that the state has sustained its burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was legally sane when he committed the acts of which he stands convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>As the majority opinion acknowledges, both of the experts who testified at the defendant\u2019s trial were unconditionally of the view that the defendant then was, and for many years had been, a severely paranoid schizophrenic with delusions of persecution and marked thought disorders. Arguably, the testimony of Dr. Walter A. Borden might have been discredited by the trial court because this psychiatrist saw the defendant only briefly and did not have access to the tape recordings of the defendant\u2019s statements to the police at the time of his arrest. No such infirmities undermine the testimony of Dr. Colin C. J. Angliker, the psychiatrist who initially examined the defendant at the request of the state but ultimately testified on behalf of the defendant. Dr. Angliker examined the defendant for approximately six hours, and had before him a transcript of the defendant\u2019s confession and a copy of Dr. Borden\u2019s report, which contained detailed references to the defendant\u2019s prior history of psychiatric hospitalization. During the defendant\u2019s hospitalization in January, 1980, well before the occurrence of the crime of which he was convicted, the defendant had warned that he would \u201ckill someone\u201d and that he believed himself to be a \u201cNinja\u201d who had to kill. Both of these psychiatrists stated that, in their expert opinion, the defendant, because of his paranoid schizophrenia, lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his behavior at the time of the crime or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">To rebut this massive evidence of prolonged and severe mental impairment, the state relied primarily on the accuracy of the defendant\u2019s voluntary statements to the police. Even taking these statements at face value, they prove only that the defendant\u2019s conduct was intentional, not that his intentional conduct was not substantially derived from his mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Under our governing statutes, mental illness may affect criminal liability in one of two ways, either to diminish the degree of criminal culpability or to avoid criminal reponsibility entirely. In some circumstances, an extreme emotional disturbance, a mental disease, a mental defect or other mental abnormality may cause a defendant to be incapable of having the specific intent required for culpability of first degree or felony murder. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a, such a defendant may, despite his mental impairment, be guilty of a lesser crime such as manslaughter. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 729-33, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985). In other circumstances, however, as delineated by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13, the legal consequence of a mental disability is much more far reaching. A defendant who, as a result of mental disease or defect, lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform that conduct to the requirements of the law is technically labeled guilty but is absolved of all criminal responsibility for his behavior. This distinction between diminished capacity and lack of criminal responsibility is well recognized in scholarly writings about the role of insanity in our criminal law. See, e.g., 1 P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses (1984) \u00a7 64 (a), p. 273; W. LaFave &amp; A. Scott, Criminal Law (1972) pp. 325-27; A. Goldstein, The Insanity Defense (1967) pp. 193-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">As I read the record before the trial court in the present case, I would agree that the defendant\u2019s own statements, if credited by the trier of fact, would sufficiently evidence that his conduct was intentional for the purposes of \u00a7 53a-54a. Those statements in no way demonstrate, however, that his conduct met the requirements of \u00a7 53a-13. To my mind, the lay observations of the police officers who took the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>statements do not suffice to fill this evidentiary gap. Nothing in their testimony persuades me that they were able to discern whether the defendant\u2019s intentional misconduct was the result of sane and criminal miscreancy or insane and legally excused delusion. What they could not discern, the state has not proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Accordingly, like Judge L. Dorsey in the trial court, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
