The defendants, Anthony Proto and Dominick Redente, were separately charged by information with multiple counts of receiving cash contributions to promote the success of a political party in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7\u00a7 9-348k (9) and 9-348l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Proto was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>also charged with illegally acting as his own campaign treasurer, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 9-348b (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with failing to deposit contributions in his campaign account, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 9-348d,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and with failing to file itemized accountings of campaign contributions, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 9-348h (a) (1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both defendants were also charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>multiple counts of larceny in the sixth degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-119 (1) and 53a-125b.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants moved for dismissal of the counts charging violations of the campaign financing act; the defendant Proto moved to dismiss the larceny charges as well. The trial court granted with prejudice the defendants\u2019 motions with respect to the charges of violations of the campaign financing act. In a memorandum of decision on Proto\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court concluded that the provisions of the campaign financing act under which Proto was charged were impermissibly vague, in violation of the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The state appealed to this court from the judgments in both cases. We find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The charges against the defendants arose from events surrounding the defendant Proto\u2019s campaign for re-election as mayor of East Haven in the fall of 1983. According to an affidavit supporting the warrant for Proto\u2019s arrest, in the months preceding the November 4,1983 election, Proto received from several individuals cash contributions in excess of fifty dollars, ostensibly to benefit his re-election campaign, and deposited them in a personal bank account. Neither the names of these contributors, nor their addresses and the amounts of their contributions, were submitted to the state elections commission. In an amended information filed on February 2, 1985, Proto was charged with nine counts of campaign financing act violations and three counts of larceny in the sixth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The defendant Redente was East Haven\u2019s director of public works at the time of Proto\u2019s 1983 re-election campaign. According to an affidavit supporting the warrant for Redente\u2019s arrest, Redente received cash contributions in excess of fifty dollars, ostensibly to benefit the Proto re-election campaign, and deposited them with his personal funds. In an information filed on November 30,1984, Redente was charged with four counts of illegally receiving campaign contributions, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 9-348k (9), three counts of larceny in the sixth degree, and one count of larceny in the fifth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">On December 14,1984, Proto moved to dismiss all of the charges against him. On May 6,1985, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision granting Proto\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice, but only with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>to the counts charging him with violations of the campaign financing act. The trial court noted that under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 14, 96 S. Ct. 612, 46 L. Ed. 2d 659 (1976), Connecticut\u2019s statutory regulation of campaign financing implicated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the first amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court noted further that, under <em>Buckley, </em>there is a \u201ccritical constitutional distinction\u201d between political contributions and political expenditures, the latter being entitled to significantly greater constitutional protection than the former. Turning to the relevant Connecticut statutes, however, the court determined that the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d contained in General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 9-335 (14) and (15)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were virtually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>indistinguishable. Although the proscriptions in the statutes under which the defendants were charged applied exclusively to the receipt and disposition of contributions, the court concluded that the lack of an ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>tamable statutory distinction between a contribution and an expenditure meant that \u201cpersons of ordinary intelligence\u201d lacked fair warning of what conduct was illegal and what was permitted. For this reason, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>court held that the campaign financing act provisions<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> under which Proto was charged were impermissibly vague, in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">On May 17,1985, Redente moved to dismiss the four counts of the information charging him with violations of the campaign financing act, citing the disposition of Proto\u2019s motion to dismiss as authority. On July 12, 1985, the trial court granted Redente\u2019s motion with prejudice. Although it did not file a memorandum explaining its decision, we presume, as do the parties, that the reasons were identical to those advanced in the Proto memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">With the permission of the trial court, the state appealed to this court from the judgments of dismissal in both cases. Proto cross appealed, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the larceny charges against him. Proto has since withdrawn his cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The state has briefed identical claims of error on its appeals from the judgments in both cases. The state\u2019s two principal claims on appeal are that the trial court erred in: (1) striking down the applicable campaign financing act provisions for vagueness even though, as applied to the defendants, these provisions were not unconstitutionally vague; and (2) concluding that the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 9-335 (14) and (15) were unconstitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ally vague. The state also raises two additional claims of error, challenging what it characterizes as the trial court\u2019s \u201calternative\u201d holdings in the Proto memorandum of decision: (1) that the requirement of General Statutes \u00a7 9-348l that violations of the campaign financing act be committed \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d was unconstitutionally vague; and (2) that the language of General Statutes \u00a7 9-348k (9) prohibiting the receiving of cash contributions \u201cto promote the success or defeat of any political party [or] candidate\u201d was unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court erred in determining that the campaign financing act provisions under which the defendants were charged violated constitutional standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The first and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution protect the rights of political expression and association. <em>Citizens Against Rent Control </em>v. <em>Berkeley, </em>454 U.S. 290, 295, 102 S. Ct. 434, 70 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1981); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 15; see generally <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 460, 78 S. Ct. 1163, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1488 (1958). Legislative restrictions on these rights, such as those imposed by Connecticut\u2019s campaign financing act, are permissible only \u201cif the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgement of associational freedoms.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 25; <em>Federal Election Commission </em>v. <em>National Right to Work Committee, </em>459 U.S. 197, 207, 103 S. Ct. 552, 74 L. Ed. 2d 364 (1982); <em>First National </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>Bank </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U.S. 765, 786, 98 S. Ct. 1407, 55 L. Ed. 2d 707, reh. denied, 438 U.S. 707, 98 S. Ct. 2126, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1150 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The permissible scope of statutory restrictions on campaign financing varies according to the type of financing restricted. In this respect, the United States Supreme Court has formulated a distinction between the regulation of contributions, which generally is constitutionally permissible, and the regulation of expenditures, which generally is not. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 25-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\"><em>Buckley </em>involved a challenge to the Federal Election Campaign Act, which, as amended in 1974, created a comprehensive statutory scheme of regulation of contributions and expenditures in federal election campaigns. See Pub. L. No. 93-443, \u00a7 101 (c), 88 Stat. 1264-65 (1974). In striking down the act\u2019s limitations on expenditures, while sustaining the contribution limitations, the <em>Buckley </em>court fashioned a distinction between these two types of statutory restrictions. The court held that the regulation of expenditures imposed a greater infringement on protected political expression than the regulation of contributions. The court held that restrictions on expenditures, made by individuals and groups to further their own political views, \u201cimpose direct and substantial restraints on the quantity of political speech.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 39. Regarding contributions, however, the court held that, \u201ca limitation upon the amount that any one person or group may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor\u2019s ability to engage in free communication. . . . [Such a limitation] permits the symbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribution but does not in any way infringe the contributor\u2019s freedom to discuss candidates and issues. While contributions may result in political expression if spent by a candidate or an association to present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor.\u201d Id., 20-21. The <em>Buckley </em>court concluded that, while the federal act\u2019s limitations on expenditures could not be constitutionally justified, its limitations on campaign contributions furthered important governmental interests by preventing corruption, and the appearance of corruption, in elective politics. Id., 26-29; see also <em>Federal Election Commission </em>v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Committee, </em>470 U.S. 480, 497, 105 S. Ct. 1459, 84 L. Ed. 2d 455 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Before the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, Connecticut\u2019s campaign financing act, like the federal act challenged in <em>Buckley, </em>regulated campaign expenditures as well as contributions. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7\u00a7 9-348r through 9-348aa. Following the <em>Buckley </em>decision, however, the legislature dramatically revised the campaign financing act. Most significantly, the legislature repealed the statutory ceiling on expenditures and enacted a new law providing that any individual could make unlimited expenditures in connection with a political campaign. Public Acts 1976, No. 76-275, \u00a7\u00a7 3 (c), 8 (P.A. No. 76-275).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> P.A. No. 76-275 was entitled, \u201cAn Act Conforming Chapter 150 to the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Court Decision Concerning Campaign Financing.\u201d This title, and the legislative history of P.A. No. 76-275, make it clear that the act was intended as a direct response to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Buckley. </em>19 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1976 Sess., pp. 1250-54; 19 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 1976 Sess., pp. 2953-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In 1981, the legislature repealed the then existing definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d and substituted new definitions. Public Acts 1981, No. 81-395, \u00a7 1 (P.A. No. 81-395). The legislative history of P.A. No. 81-395 shows that the revised definitions were intended to bring Connecticut\u2019s campaign financing act into further compliance with <em>Buckley </em>by eliminating \u201cexpenditures when made by persons other than individuals\u201d from the ambit of the definition of \u201ccontribution.\u201d 24 S. Proc., Pt. 9, 1981 Sess., p. 2835; 24 H.R. Proc., Pt. 25, 1981 Sess., p. 8421.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The revised definitions, as subsequently codified, are the definitions that the trial court held to be unconstitutionally vague in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">We now consider the state\u2019s first claim of error, that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard in concluding that the statutes under which the defendants were charged were unconstitutionally vague. The state argues that, even if the statutes might suffer from some peripheral vagueness, they were not vague with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>respect to the defendants, whose conduct was \u201cclearly proscribed.\u201d The state argues that the trial court erroneously failed to consider whether the statutes were vague <em>as applied </em>to the defendants. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">As a matter of the due process of law required by our federal and state constitutions, \u201ca penal statute must be sufficiently definite to enable a person to know what conduct he must avoid.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>180 Conn. 54, 59-60, 428 A.2d 322 (1980); <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 77; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harriss, </em>347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S. Ct. 808, 98 L. Ed. 989 (1954); <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 46, 470 A.2d 688 (1984). The void for vagueness doctrine \u201crequires legislatures to set reasonably clear guidelines for law enforcement officials and triers of fact in order to prevent \u2018arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 572-73, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Where penal statutes, such as the ones at issue in this case, implicate rights protected by the first amendment, their meaning must be capable of precise ascertainment in order to repel a vagueness challenge. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>supra, 573; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>333 U.S. 507, 509-10, 68 S. Ct. 665, 92 L. Ed. 840 (1948). Where first amendment rights are at stake, vague laws may cause citizens to avoid constitutionally protected conduct for fear of incurring criminal prosecution. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 41 n.48; <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>377 U.S. 360, 372, 84 S. Ct. 1316, 12 L. Ed. 2d 377 (1964); <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button, </em>371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S. Ct. 328, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">It is true, as the state claims, that in non-first amendment contexts, \u201cthe constitutionality of a statutory provision being attacked as void for vagueness is determined by the statute\u2019s applicability to the particular facts at issue.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 57; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>423 U.S. 87, 92, 96 S. Ct. 316, 46 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Ed. 2d 228 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harriss, </em>supra. \u201cDue to this \u2018chilling effect\u2019 which vague statutes can exert on first amendment liberties, [however,] when those freedoms are at stake, the statute\u2019s constitutionality is tested for vagueness on its face.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 58 n.3; <em>Grayned </em>v. <em>Rockford, </em>408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1972); <em>Aptheker </em>v. <em>Secretary of State, </em>378 U.S. 500, 516, 84 S. Ct. 1659, 12 L. Ed. 2d 992 (1964). In this case, then, the defendants \u201cmay challenge the validity of a statute\u2019s application to marginal situations even though [their] own conduct may clearly fall within the statute\u2019s proscriptions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra; <em>Aptheker </em>v. <em>Secretary of State, </em>supra, 517; <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button, </em>supra, 432-33.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We hold that the trial court did not err in failing to limit its consideration to whether the applicable statutes, as applied to the defendants, were unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The state\u2019s second claim of error challenges the trial court\u2019s disposition of the defendants\u2019 cases on the merits. The defendants argue, and the trial court held, that the lack of a clear distinction between the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d in \u00a7 9-335 (14) and (15) renders the statutes under which the defendants were charged void for vagueness. We agree with the trial court that the applicable definitions are not paragons of clarity. We disagree, however, with the trial court\u2019s implicit conclusion that these definitions cannot be clarified and harmonized with constitutional standards through reasoned and principled statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Ambiguity is, unfortunately, a common statutory ailment. A degree of vagueness is endemic in many statutes. <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>423 U.S. 48, 49-50, 96 S. Ct. 243, 46 L. Ed. 2d 185 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 62. Clearly, this court lacks the authority to reshape public policy by construing a statute in a manner that alters its inherent meaning. See, e.g., <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Rizzi, </em>400 U.S. 410, 419, 91 S. Ct. 423, 27 L. Ed. 2d 498 (1971); <em>Shuttlesworth </em>v. <em>Birmingham, </em>394 U.S. 147, 153, 89 S. Ct. 935, 22 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1969). If the meaning of a statute can fairly be ascertained through judicial construction, however, it need not be stricken for vagueness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra. \u201c[A]uthoritative constructions sufficiently illuminating the contours of an otherwise vague prohibition\u201d may be used to remedy the chilling effect of vague statutory language in areas affecting first amendment rights. <em>Dombrowski </em>v. <em>Pfister, </em>380 U.S. 479, 490-91, 85 S. Ct. 1116, 14 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1965); <em>Baggett </em>v. <em>Bullitt, </em>supra, 376-77 n.13; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 510; see also <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>supra, 573; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harriss, </em>supra, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>The meaning of unclear statutes affecting first amendment rights may be divined through recognized methods of statutory construction. \u201cReferences to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Pickering, </em>supra, 62-63; <em>State </em>v. <em>Eason, </em>supra, 46. Another appropriate means of elucidation is to consider the commonly accepted meanings, if any, of the terms the statutes employ, which, unlike more arcane methods of construction, may be readily accessible to the lay persons whose conduct the statute may affect. See generally <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 23 n.24; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harriss, </em>supra, 620-21; <em>Parcell </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>468 F. Sup. 1274, 1280 (D. Kan. 1979), aff\u2019d, 639 F.2d 628 (10th Cir. 1980); <em>New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, </em>82 N.J. 57, 76-78, 411 A.2d 168 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, which established a clear distinction between contributions and expenditures for purposes of federal campaign financing, is a uniquely applicable guide to construction of the statutes at issue in these appeals. We recognize that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the applicable federal statutes in <em>Buckley </em>does not control our construction of Connecticut\u2019s campaign financing act. See, e.g., <em>Golf Digest/Tennis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>203 Conn. 455, 462, 525 A.2d 106 (1987). In this case, however, the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d in the federal statutes construed in <em>Buckley, </em>are similar in significant respects to the definitions contained in \u00a7 9-335 (14) and (15) of the Connecticut General Statutes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As discussed in part I of this opinion, the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>lative history of Connecticut\u2019s campaign financing act clearly shows that the General Assembly intended the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d in Connecticut\u2019s campaign financing act to incorporate the distinctions enumerated in <em>Buckley. </em>Since our goal is to clarify statutory ambiguities in a manner consistent with legislative intent; <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 553, 522 A.2d 753 (1987); <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986); we may appropriately refer to <em>Buckley </em>as a guide to resolving the distinction between expenditures and contributions under Connecticut law.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cexpend\u201d as \u201cto pay out or distribute.\u201d This definition, without more, does little to clarify the meaning of the term \u201cexpenditure\u201d as defined in \u00a7 9-335 (15). In <em>Buckley, </em>however, the United States Supreme Court made clear that, for purposes of federal campaign financing law, an \u201cexpenditure\u201d is an outlay that <em>directly </em>furthers the spender\u2019s political speech and is made <em>independently </em>of a particular candidate or campaign organization. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 20-21, 46 n.53, 79-80; see also <em>Parcell </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>supra, 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201ccontribute\u201d in the following manner: \u201cto give a part to a common fund or store\u201d; to \u201clend assistance or aid to a common purpose.\u201d In <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 24 n.24, the United States Supreme Court recognized that a political \u201ccontribution,\u201d as commonly understood, encompasses two general categories: (1) \u201cFunds <em>provided to a candidate or political party or campaign committee </em>either directly or indirectly through an intermediary\u201d; and (2) \u201cdollars <em>given to another person or organization </em>that are earmarked for political purposes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While a contribution may incidentally further the contributor\u2019s political speech, such benefit, if any, is <em>indirect, </em>and depends upon the use to which the contribution is put by the candidate or political organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Under <em>Buckley, </em>not all expenditures are entitled to heightened constitutional protection. Expenditures \u201cplaced in cooperation with or with the consent of a candidate, his agents, or an authorized committee of the candidate ...\u201d may properly be considered contributions for purposes of statutory regulation of campaign financing. Id., 47 n.53. Such expenditures, like contributions, further the spender\u2019s political speech only indirectly. The state\u2019s interest in regulating such expenditures coincides with its interest in regulating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>contributions: to avoid corruption, or the appearance of corruption, in elective politics by \u201calleviating] the danger that expenditures will be given as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for improper commitments from the candidate.\u201d Id., 47; <em>Federal Election Commission </em>v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Committee, </em>supra, 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Under \u00a7 9-335 (14) (A) (iv), a \u201ccontribution\u201d includes \u201can expenditure . . . when made by a person with the cooperation of or in consultation with any candidate, candidate committee or agent of such candidate . . . .\u201d The trial court cited this pro vision as evidence that the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d are indistinguishable. The quoted provision, however, merely codifies the distinction, explicitly recognized in <em>Buckley, </em>between independent, or direct expenditures, and indirect expenditures made in cooperation with a candidate or his organization. An \u201cexpenditure,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 9-335 (15), is limited to the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">As refined by <em>Buckley, </em>the definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d under \u00a7 9-335 (14) excludes from its ambit some hypothetical scenarios that, if included, would render the restrictions on contributions under the campaign financing act unconstitutional. For example, a candidate who spends money to ensure his re-election does not make a contribution, since such spending directly furthers his own right to political speech. For the same reason, a person who purchases an advertisement to champion his own political views, independent of a candidate or political organization, does not make a contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Our construction of the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d in Connecticut\u2019s campaign financing act incorporates the linguistic distinctions elaborated in <em>Buckley. </em>So construed, the scope of these definitions, and the statutes that incorporate them by reference, are not unconstitutionally vague. See <em>Parcell </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>supra, 1280-81; see generally <em>New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, </em>supra, 78-80; but cf. <em>Labor\u2019s Educational &amp; Political Club\u2014Independent </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>561 S.W.2d 339, 346-47 (Mo. 1977). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in holding that the campaign financing act provisions under which the defendants were charged were void for vagueness for failing clearly to distinguish contributions from expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">The state\u2019s remaining claims of error challenge two additional grounds advanced by the trial court in support of its conclusion that the statutes under which the defendants were charged were unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">The state first claims that the trial court erred in concluding that the requirement of \u00a7 <em>9-348l </em>that violations of the campaign financing act be committed \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d was unconstitutionally vague. We agree that this conclusion of the trial court was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Section 9-348l provides that \u201c[a]ny person who knowingly and wilfully violates any provision of [the campaign financing act] shall be\u201d subject to criminal penalties. Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (12), \u201ca person acts \u2018knowingly\u2019 with respect to conduct . . . described by a statute . . . when he is aware that his conduct is of such nature . . . A person acts \u201cwilfully\u201d when he performs an act in a manner that is \u201cintentional, wrongful and without just cause or excuse.\u201d <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Doody, </em>119 Conn. 532, 534, 178 A. 51 (1935); <em>Mingachos </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 91, 102, 491 A.2d 368 (1985); <em>Soucy </em>v. <em>Wysocki, </em>139 Conn. 622, 628, 96 A.2d 225 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The defendants\u2019 argument that the phrase \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d is vague is based on a comparison of \u00a7 <em>9-348l </em>with \u00a7 9-348k. The preamble to the latter section provides: \u201cThe following persons <em>shall be guilty </em>of corrupt practices and shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of section <em>9-348l . . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendants claim that this language creates uncertainty as to whether \u00a7 9-348k imposes criminal sanctions independent of \u00a7 <em>9-348l, </em>or whether, by virtue of \u00a7 <em>9-348l, </em>only knowing and wilful violations of \u00a7 9-348k generate criminal liability. This is a spurious argument. By its terms, \u00a7 <em>9-348l </em>applies to <em>all </em>of the provisions of the campaign financing act. Thus, with reference to \u00a7 9-348k, \u00a7 <em>9-348l </em>makes criminal liability contingent upon proof that the defendant \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d committed all of the elements of the charged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The defendants argue that the phrase \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d is ambiguous because it is unclear whether it sets forth a subjective or objective standard to determine whether the required mental state exists for the commission of a crime. We disagree. The phrase \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d invariably denotes a specific intent, or subjective state of mind. See <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U.S. 91, 101, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1945). Accordingly, we conclude that the phrase, in its context, is not unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>The state\u2019s next claim is that the trial court erred, in the court\u2019s words, in finding \u201cmerit\u201d in the defendant Proto\u2019s claim that \u00a7 9-348k (9), which prohibits the receiving of cash contributions over fifty dollars \u201cto promote the success or defeat of any political party [or] candidate,\u201d was unconstitutionally vague. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The trial court did not elaborate on why it found vagueness in the phrase \u201cto promote the success or defeat of any political party [or] candidate.\u201d On appeal, however, the defendants argue that it is not clear from the statute whether the <em>donor </em>or the <em>recipient </em>must intend for the contribution \u201cto promote the success or defeat of any political party [or] candidate.\u201d This argument requires little discussion. Section 9-348k (9), in its entirety, prohibits both the offer and receipt of cash contributions that come under the purview of the statute. The quoted language imposes a scienter requirement, the application of which varies according to whether the offeror or recipient is charged under the statute. In this case, the defendants are accused of having illegally received contributions. Accordingly, their liability under \u00a7 9-348k (9) is contingent upon the state\u2019s proving that they received these contributions \u201cto promote the success or defeat of any political party [or] candidate.\u201d Additionally, as discussed above, for the defendants to be subject to criminal sanctions for their conduct, they must be shown to have violated \u00a7 9-348k (9) \u201cknowingly and wilfully.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The trial court, in its memorandum of decision, relied solely on vagueness in determining that the campaign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>financing act provisions under which the defendants were charged were unconstitutional. The court did not explicitly consider the issue of whether these provisions were also unconstitutionally overbroad, as the defendants had alleged in their motions to dismiss and supporting memoranda. On appeal, however, the defendants renew their argument that the applicable statutes are both vague and overbroad. Although the defendants have not properly briefed their overbreadth claims as alternate grounds upon which to uphold the judgment,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we nonetheless address the question of overbreadth for two reasons. First, if the applicable statutes do indeed suffer from overbreadth, this court is authorized to sustain the trial court\u2019s judgment on alternate grounds notwithstanding any procedural default by the parties. <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>203 Conn. 281, 292, 524 A.2d 629 (1987); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, 202 </em>Conn. 453, 461, 521 A.2d 1040 (1987). Second, because the doctrines of vagueness and overbreadth are so closely related that \u201c[s]ometimes the two are functionally indistinguishable\u201d; note, \u201cThe First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine,\u201d 83 Harv. L. Rev. 844, 845 n.5 (1970); it is understandable that the trial court might have merged aspects of the two doctrines in reaching its conclusion that the applicable statutes were unconstitutional. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>supra, 577 n.20; <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Button, </em>supra, 432-33. We conclude, however, that the dispositive provisions of the campaign financing act do not suffer from overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>The essence of an overbreadth challenge is that a statute that proscribes certain conduct, even though it may have some permissible applications, sweeps within its proscription conduct protected by the first amendment. <em>Secretary of State </em>v. <em>J. H. Munson Co., </em>467 U.S. 947, 968, 104 S. Ct. 2839, 81 L. Ed. 2d 786 (1984); <em>City Council </em>v. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 U.S. 789, 798-801, 104 S. Ct. 2118, 80 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1984); <em>Husti </em>v. <em>Zuckerman Property Enterprises, Ltd., </em>199 Conn. 575, 587, 508 A.2d 735, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. , 107 S. Ct. 43, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). Overbroad statutes, like vague ones, inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected conduct. <em>Husti </em>v. <em>Zuckerman Property Enterprises, Ltd., </em>supra. A party has standing to raise an overbreadth claim, however, \u201conly if \u2018there [is] a realistic danger that the statute will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court . . . <em>.\u2019Members of the City Council of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>[supra, 801] . . . .\u201d Id.; see also <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 613-15, 93 S. Ct. 2908, 37 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">We note at the outset that the penal sanctions of the campaign financing act contain a built-in check against their overbroad application. Section 9-348l makes the application of criminal sanctions for violations of the act contingent upon their commission \u201cknowingly and wilfully.\u201d This scienter requirement narrows the scope of possible prosecutions under the campaign financing act, and reduces the possibility that constitutionally protected conduct will be inhibited. See <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 101-103; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ragen, </em>314 U.S. 513, 524, 62 S. Ct. 374, 86 L. Ed. 383 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">We turn now to the defendants\u2019 particularized claims of overbreadth. These claims, for the most part, are closely related to their claims of statutory vagueness, which we have considered fully in parts III and IV of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>this opinion. The core of the defendants\u2019 arguments is that the relevant statutes are so vague that it is <em>possible </em>to interpret them as proscribing constitutionally protected conduct. They do not argue that the statutes <em>unequivocally </em>abrogate rights protected by the first amendment; if so, the statutes would be unconstitutional not for their vagueness, but for their clarity. Accordingly, we may appropriately apply the narrowing constructions of the relevant statutes that we adopted in part III to address the defendants\u2019 over-breadth claims. While these constructions would not save the challenged statutes if they <em>plainly </em>proscribed constitutionally protected conduct; <em>Erznoznik </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em>422 U.S. 205, 213-14, 95 S. Ct. 2268, 45 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1975); <em>Aptheker </em>v. <em>Secretary of State, </em>supra, 515-16; we conclude that the statutes in question \u201cpermissibly bear a construction that renders [them] free from constitutional defects.\u201d <em>Aptheker </em>v. <em>Secretary of State, </em>supra, 515.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The defendants\u2019 first claim that the definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d in \u00a7 9-335 (14) is unconstitutionally over-broad. To the extent that the defendants\u2019 argument is based on the purported ambiguity of the definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d in \u00a7 9-335 (14) and (15), respectively, our narrowing constructions of those terms, detailed in part III of this opinion, insulate the \u201ccontribution\u201d definition from an overbreadth challenge. In addition, however, the defendants\u2019 claim that the portion of \u00a7 9-335 (14) which requires a contribution to be \u201cmade for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person\u201d is overbroad. As authority for this proposition, the defendants rely on <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, which noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>that a similar phrase in the Federal Election Campaign Act has \u201cthe same potential for encompassing both issue discussion and advocacy of a political result.\u201d Id., 79.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The <em>Buckley </em>court, however, construed the phrase narrowly: \u201cTo insure that the reach of [the federal statute] is not impermissibly broad, we construe [the statute] . . . to reach only funds used for communications that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.\u201d Id., 80. The defendants advance no convincing reasons why this court, like the court in <em>Buckley, </em>cannot invoke a similar narrowing construction of the relevant language in \u00a7 9-335 (14). Under such a construction, which we now adopt, the definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d is not unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The defendants\u2019 next claim is that \u00a7 9-348k (9), which proscribes certain cash contributions \u201cto promote the success or defeat of any political party [or] candidate,\u201d is unconstitutionally overbroad. The defendants do not elaborate their grounds for making this claim.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> To the extent, however, that the quoted language could be interpreted as encompassing within its proscription political advocacy protected by the first amendment, a narrowing construction is again appropriate. Accordingly, we construe the quoted language to encompass contributions which otherwise fall within the ambit of \u00a7 9-348k (9) only if such contributions are made for the direct, specific, and intentional purpose of aiding a clearly identified political party or candidate. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 80; <em>New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, </em>supra, 79. So construed, the quoted language renders \u00a7 9-348k (9) narrowly tailored to the compelling state interest of preventing political corruption, and is not unconstitutionally overbroad. See <em>Federal Election Commission </em>v. <em>National Conservative Political Action Committee, </em>supra, 497; <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>supra, 26-29.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">There is error, the judgments are set aside and the cases are remanded with direction for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 9-348k (9) provides: \u201cacts prohibited as corrupt practices.

That decision, however, is not dispositive of these appeals. <em>Federal Election Commission </em>primarily concerned an overbreadth challenge to a federal election law statute, and dealt with the question of vagueness only summarily in a single paragraph at the end of the opinion. While the relevant portion of the opinion does suggest, albeit indirectly, that the court\u2019s review of the vagueness challenge considers the applicable statutes as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the only citation given is <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U.S. 601, 93 S.

The isolated, ambiguous language in <em>Federal Election Commission </em>on which the state relies hardly suggests the United States Supreme Court\u2019s intention to overrule its earlier decisions permitting parties to challenge statutes affecting first amendment rights for vagueness without regard to whether the statutes, as applied to the parties\u2019 conduct, were clear and in accord with constitutional standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"> The applicable federal definitions at the time of <em>Buckley, </em>contained in 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 591 (e) and (f), provided in relevant part: \u201c(e) \u2018contribution\u2019\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">\u201c(1) means a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value (except a loan of money by a national or State bank made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>in accordance with the applicable banking laws and regulations and in the ordinary course of business, which shall be considered a loan by each endorser or guarantor, in that proportion of the unpaid balance thereof that each endorser or guarantor bears to the total number of endorsers or guarantors), made for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office or for the purpose of influencing the results of a primary held for the selection of delegates to a national nominating convention of a political party or for the expression of a preference for the nomination of persons for election to the office of President of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">\u201c(2) means a contract, promise, or agreement, express or implied, whether or not legally enforceable, to make a contribution for such purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201c(3) means funds received by a political committee which are transferred to such committee from another political committee or other source;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u201c(4) means the payment, by any person other than a candidate or a political committee, of compensation for the personal services of another person which are rendered to such candidate or political committee without charge for any such purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">\u201c(f) \u2018expenditure\u2019\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">\u201c(1) means a purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of money or anything of value (except a loan of money by a national or State bank made in accordance with the applicable banking laws and regulations and in the ordinary course of business), made for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person to Federal office or for the purpose of influencing the results of a primary held for the selection of delegates to a national nominating convention of a political party or for the expression of a preference for the nomination of persons for election to the office of President of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">\u201c(2) means a contract, promise, or agreement, express or implied, whether or not legally enforceable, to make any expenditure; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIb\">\u201c(3) means the transfer of funds by a political committee to another political committee.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> The defendants also argue that General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 9-348k (9) is unconstitutionally vague because that statute\u2019s requirement that contributions be \u201cto promote the success or defeat of any political party [or] candidate\u201d overlaps with the definition of a contribution itself, which provides that a contribution must be \u201cmade for the purpose of influencing the nomination for election, or election, of any person . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 9-335 (14).

To the contrary, the restrictive definition of contribution narrows the scope of potential prosecutions under the statute. For example, assume that a defendant is charged, under \u00a7 9-348k (9) and General Statutes \u00a7 9-348l, with illegally receiving contri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>buttons to promote the success of a candidate. In addition to establishing the required scienter element under \u00a7 9-348k (9), and proving, under \u00a7 9-348l, that the violation was knowing and wilful, the state would also have to establish, as part of its proof, that the contribution was <em>\u201cmade for </em>the purpose\u201d of influencing the candidate\u2019s nomination or election, as required by \u00a7 9-335 (14).

Furthermore, neither defendant\u2019s brief sets forth arguments clearly addressed to the issue of overbreadth; rather, the briefs merely mention the issue in topic headings and provide little further elaboration.
