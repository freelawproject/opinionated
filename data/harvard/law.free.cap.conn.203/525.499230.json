Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVZ\">The plaintiff is Robin B. Huck, the owner of a tract of land comprising 2.691 acres,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> zoned for residential use and located on the westerly side of Stamwich Road in Greenwich. The defendant is the inland wetlands and watercourses agency of the town of Greenwich (agency), which was created pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">On May 22,1978, the plaintiff filed an application for a permit to construct a single-family dwelling on her property which is adjacent to Frye Lake, a regulated watercourse. On January 7, 1980, the agency held a public hearing on that application. At an agency meeting on February 25, 1980, on a motion made and seconded to approve the application on certain conditions, the vote of the agency was three in favor, three opposed and one abstention. The agency issued a writing dated March 3,1980, signed by the secretary of the agency stating that the application was denied. That writing set out the agency\u2019s reasons for denying the plaintiff\u2019s application. On March 11, 1980, a notice to that effect was published in a Greenwich newspaper. By letter dated March 20, 1980, the plaintiff made demand upon the agency to issue the permit, maintaining that issuance of the permit was mandated by \u00a7 6.2<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>of the agency\u2019s regulations. This section requires, inter alia, that agency action by way of granting, granting with conditions, or denying an application be taken within 65 days of a public hearing. The agency did not issue the permit. The plaintiff, alleging that she was aggrieved by the conduct of the agency, took an appeal to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that appeal, the plaintiff asked the court to: (1) reverse the action of the agency and declare it to be null and void; (2) direct the agency to approve the permit; and (3) grant such other and further relief as the court deemed just and equitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">On appeal, the trial court found that the plaintiff was aggrieved and that the \u201cmembers, or member, who did not attend the public hearing but acquainted themselves with the issues properly voted.\u201d Turning to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u201cno action [by the agency]\u201d was taken within 65 days of the hearing, the court adverted both to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u00a7 6.2 of the agency\u2019s regulations. After a brief reference to our decision in <em>Merlo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 676, 495 A.2d 268 (1985), the trial court said that the \u201cparliamentary posture after <em>Merlo </em>... is that we have a technical denial with no reasons stated.\u201d This conclusion came after the court queried the basis and the reasons for the agency\u2019s disapproval. Referring to the reasons of denial, dated February 25,1980, the trial court opined that \u201c[i]t is hard to believe that on a 3 to 3 vote with one abstention on a motion to permit, the agency would have its reasons for denial unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>[it] had prejudged the February 25, 1980 vote.\u201d Noting that General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (d) requires that \u201c[i]n granting, denying or limiting any permit for a regulated activity the inland wetlands agency . . . shall state upon the record the reason for its decision,\u201d the trial court stated that the agency failed to meet these requirements. The court reasoned, therefore, that all that was before it was <em>\u201ca </em>technical denial [under Merlo] with no reasons stated\u201d and that the record was \u201cbarren as to what each commissioner believed were the reasons for denial . . . . \u201d Finding that there were no reasons for denial \u201cproperly before the court,\u201d although the statute mandated that the agency state its reasons, the trial court then determined that it would \u201csearch the record for reasons to support the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Citing the agency\u2019s statement of reasons dated February 25, 1980, the trial court stated: \u201cThe mood of the agency which appears from the return of record is as follows: \u2018Common sense would suggest that the proposed development would result in the degradation of water quality in Frye Lake.\u2019 \u201d It also observed that its review of the return of record showed that the plaintiff had \u201cmade every effort to comply with the demands of the agency\u201d and that while the agency stated that there were alternatives, it did not \u201carticulate the alternatives to the plaintiff.\u201d The court stated that \u201cthe intent of the agency . . . considering the totality of circumstances [was] to have the land remain in its natural state\u201d and also said that it could not \u201cconceive of any reasonable use which the plaintiff could make of the property in its natural state.\u201d The trial court then found that the plaintiff had \u201cbeen finally deprived by the agency of the reasonable and proper use of the property and that there had been an unconstitutional taking without just compensation.\u201d Citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 22a-43a,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court sustained the appeal, set aside the \u201caction\u201d of the agency and remanded the matter to the agency for action not inconsistent with its decision. The agency has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">On appeal, the agency essentially<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claims that the trial court erred in: (1) finding that the plaintiff was aggrieved; (2) rejecting the reasons stated in the record for its decision on the application; and (3) finding that there had been an unconstitutional taking of the plaintiff\u2019s property. The plaintiff, on the other hand, has urged alternate grounds for affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment. See Practice Book \u00a7 4013 (a) (1) (formerly \u00a7 3012). These are: (1) the agency\u2019s decision was rendered on unlawful procedure in that its decision was rendered upon the vote of a member who had not been present at the public hearing, had not read the transcript of the public hearing and had not apprised himself of the evidence before voting against the application; (2) the plaintiff\u2019s application was approved by operation of law because the agency took no action on it within 65 days of the public hearing; (3) the agency\u2019s failure to grant the application was against the reliable probative and substantial evidence in the record; and (4) the agency\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious and characterized by an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>We first address the agency\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in finding that the plaintiff was aggrieved. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, \u2018the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that this specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u2019 . . . \u201d \u2019 <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984). \u2018Aggrievement is established if \u201cthere is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660 (1953).\u2019 <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>181 Conn. 442, 445, 435 A.2d 975 (1980).\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 299-300, 524 A.2d 636 (1987). A person does not become aggrieved, however, until the agency has acted. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>supra, 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s status as owner of the property establishes that she has \u201ca specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision.\u201d The fact that the agency\u2019s decision resulted in the denial to the plaintiff of the ability to use this property as proposed establishes that \u201cthis specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected.\u201d The court correctly concluded that the plaintiff was aggrieved by the agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The agency claims that the plaintiff was not \u201caggrieved\u201d because the case had become \u201cmoot\u201d between the time of the agency\u2019s decision and the hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ing on aggrievement in the trial court. The agency\u2019s argument is based on the fact that there had been a change in the state health code and the Greenwich health code with regard to septic systems so that the particular septic system proposed by the plaintiff in the application filed with the agency had become \u201cillegal.\u201d The agency maintains that because there is no longer a legal right to install the proposed septic system, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal is therefore \u201cmoot.\u201d We disagree. The agency\u2019s argument overlooks the testimony before the trial court that a person may apply for variances for septic system permits. Thus, if the plaintiff prevails on the merits of this appeal, she will then have the opportunity to acquire a variance from the state and local health codes and, if successful, construct the residence as planned. The trial court, therefore, correctly concluded that the plaintiff was aggrieved. Our decision in <em>McCallum </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>196 Conn. 218, 492 A.2d 508 (1985), does not require a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The agency next claims that the trial court erred in rejecting the reasons stated in the record for the agency\u2019s decision on the application. Although the agency sets out some fifteen subsets of this broad claim, the issues basically distill out as follows: The trial court erred in rejecting the valid reasons stated in the record for its decision and in substituting its own judgment of the record; the trial court erred in its analysis of the nature and effect of the vote of the agency in which six of its members properly participated; and the trial court erred in not concluding that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the agency\u2019s denial of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We must first determine whether the trial court correctly analyzed the matter of the agency\u2019s vote of February 25,1980, and its legal consequences because the court\u2019s determination of this issue was the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>for its decision to embark upon its own evaluation of the record without seriously considering the agency\u2019s stated reasons. The trial court decided to search the record for support of the agency\u2019s denial because it had interpreted the 3 to 3 vote on the motion to approve with conditions with no further motion either to permit or to deny with reasons as amounting, under Merlo, to a technical denial with no reasons stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We do not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the agency\u2019s decision was \u201cillegal\u201d because Frank E. Wolf, who voted against the application, had not been present at the public hearing, had not read the transcript of the public hearing and had not apprised himself of the evidence before voting. The trial court specifically found that \u201c[t]he members, or member, who did not attend the public hearing but acquainted themselves with the issues properly voted.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> While the plaintiff implicitly argues that this was not a finding by the trial court, fairly read, it constitutes a finding. Significantly, if the plaintiff had any question that it was not, she could have requested an articulation which we note was not done. Practice Book \u00a7 4051 (formerly \u00a7 3082).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">With this, we come to the question of whether the vote constituted \u201caction\u201d by the agency and, if it did, what was its basis, reasons and consequences. The statutes and the agency\u2019s regulations require that the agency take \u201caction\u201d on an application \u201cwithin sixty-five [65] days after the completion of a public hearing . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (c); Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Regulations \u00a7 6.2; Greenwich Municipal Code \u00a7 6.227 (b). Under its regulations, the agency is permitted to act in only three ways: it may grant a permit, it may grant a permit with conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>or it may deny a permit. The agency contends that it took \u201caction\u201d and denied the application stating its reasons. The plaintiff claims that the agency did not take any of the permitted courses of action. We agree with the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The circumstance that the vote of the agency on the application was upon a motion to <em>approve with conditions </em>which resulted in a 3-3 tie vote and that there was no further motion to deny, or for that matter any further motion, does not warrant an extended discussion. See <em>Merlo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 682-83. In <em>Merlo, </em>we pointed out that \u201cthe failure of an application to garner enough votes for its approval amounts to a rejection of the application. <em>Lupinacci </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>153 Conn. 694, 696, 220 A.2d 274 (1966); <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>153 Conn. 574, 576, 219 A.2d 445 (1966).\u201d <em>Merlo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 683.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>case, the motion to grant the application with conditions did not receive the majority vote necessary for approval and the records of the agency of February 25, 1980, stated the \u201cdenial\u201d of \u201cApplication #78-70\u201d (the plaintiffs application). This constituted \u201caction\u201d by the agency within the 65 day period required. Moreover, the agency accompanied its \u201caction\u201d with reasons stated in the record for such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">We next consider the circumstance that the motion to approve the application included certain conditions not contained in the application as submitted. Practically speaking, the tie vote on the application as modified by the conditions fairly indicates that the original application, without such conditions, would also have failed to have received a majority vote. Likewise, if any agency member favored approval of the application without the conditions and believed that a majority might be similarly inclined, we may fairly presume that such a motion would have been made. No such motion, however, was made. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the trial court could characterize the denial as \u201ctechnical\u201d as opposed to a denial that was \u201csubstantive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The requirement that the agency take \u201caction\u201d within the prescribed 65 day period is to insure prompt and expeditious action for the protection of the applicant. See <em>Merlo </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 683; <em>Finn </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 540, 544, 244 A.2d 391 (1968). The object of this requirement is furthered by informing the applicants with certainty that the agency has acted so as to trigger the option of taking an appeal. In this case, the plaintiff alleged in her complaint that \u201cthe AGENCY issued a writing dated March 3, 1980, stating that Application No. 78-70 for a permit was denied, and caused a notice to be published to that effect on March 11,1980, in a newspaper, Greenwich Time.\u201d See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (d). The plaintiff does not contend that she was not timely notified by mail of the agency\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We note also that because the agency itself regarded its vote of February 25,1980, as a denial of the application for the requested permit and the newspaper notice so informed the plaintiff and the public, the application was effectively denied on that date which was well within the time for it to act. Moreover, as in <em>Merlo, </em>the agency fulfilled its duty both under the statute and its own regulations by timely taking one of the courses of action prescribed therein. The agency did not, despite the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the contrary, fail to take \u201caction\u201d within 65 days of the public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">We next discuss the reasons given by the agency for the denial of February 25,1980. The trial court determined that although General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (d) requires that \u201cin denying [or granting or limiting] any permit . . . [the agency] \u2018shall state upon the record the reason for its decision,\u2019 \u201d the agency did not do so. The court stated that \u201c[a]ll we have is a technical denial under <em>Merlo </em>[v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission], supra, and no further motions.\u201d The court did not accept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>reasons of denial given by the agency dated February 25, 1980, stating that \u201c[i]t is hard to believe that on a 3 to 3 vote with one abstention on a motion to permit, the agency would have its reasons for denial unless the agency had prejudged the February 25,1980 vote.\u201d It then went on to decide that since there are \u201cno reasons for denial properly before the court . . . even though the statute mandates that the agency state its reasons for denial, the court will search the record for reasons to support the agency\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Initially, the comment concerning the agency\u2019s prejudgment must be addressed. In all its proceedings, a regulatory agency \u201c \u2018must act strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations, and in a lawful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fusco-Amatruda Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>168 Conn. 597, 604, 362 A.2d 847 (1975). Hearings before administrative agencies, such as this agency, although informal and conducted without regard to the strict rules of evidence, \u201cmust be conducted so as not to violate the fundamental rules of natural justice.\u201d <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 249, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984); see <em>Pizzola </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>167 Conn. 202, 207, 355 A.2d 21 (1974). \u201cDue process of law requires not only that there be due notice of the hearing but that at the hearing the parties involved have a right to produce relevant evidence, and an opportunity to know the facts on which the agency is asked to act, to cross-examine witnesses and to offer rebuttal evidence.\u201d <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra; see <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>158 Conn. 208, 212-13, 257 A.2d 795 (1969). There is no question that the plaintiff was also entitled to have her application heard and determined by an impartial and unbiased agency. What we said in <em>Obeda </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>180 Conn. 521, 523-24, 429 A.2d 956 (1980), bears repeating: \u201cWhile it is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>that neutrality and impartiality of members of administrative boards and commissions are essential to the fair and proper operation of these authorities ... a charge of bias must be supported by some evidence proving probability of bias before an official can be faulted . . . . \u201d Because public officers, acting in their official capacities, are presumed, until the contrary appears, to have acted legally and properly; <em>Brookfield </em>v. <em>Candlewood Shores Estates, Inc., </em>201 Conn. 1, 7, 513 A.2d 1218 (1986); <em>Balch Pontiac-Buick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 559, 568, 345 A.2d 520 (1973); <em>Hills </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>139 Conn. 603, 608, 96 A.2d 212 (1953); the burden on such a claim rests upon the person asserting it. See, e.g., <em>Obeda </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>supra; <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>179 Conn. 650, 654, 427 A.2d 1346 (1980). On a review of the record, we cannot agree with the trial court that given the vote which resulted in denial, \u201c[i]t is hard to believe that on a 3 to 3 vote with one abstention on a motion to permit, the agency would have its reasons for denial unless the agency had prejudged the February 25,1980 vote.\u201d The necessary prejudgment has not been shown. The trial court should have considered the reasons given by the agency rather than disregard them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">In referring to the reasons given, the agency claims that extensive and substantial evidence supports many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>of the reasons for the denial. The plaintiff claims, in attacking the reasons given, that \u201c[e]ach and every reason published by the [agency] for its denial of plaintiff\u2019s application is against the substantial weight of the evidence on the whole record\u201d and that the denial \u201cwas against the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d Arguing that the reasons given were in conformity with matters to be considered under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (d),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the agency claims that the evidence supports the denial and that the court should not have substituted its judgment and discretion for that of the agency to come to a different conclusion. The plaintiff, on the other hand, maintains that four experts from four different fields provided substantial testimony that the proposed dwelling would have no adverse effect on the adjacent Frye Lake and that the agency did not offer any expert testimony to \u201crebut any of the evidence\u201d offered by those four experts. She also claims that the agency\u2019s own staff field report referred to at the hearing is \u201csubstantially in accord\u201d with the evidence she presented at the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>hearing and that it is clear from the record that the agency \u201ctotally disregarded the overwhelming, reliable and probative evidence\u201d that she presented. The agency points to evidence, including some relied upon by the plaintiff, in arguing that the denial was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The denial of February 25, 1980, contained a number of reasons.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The agency\u2019s decision must be sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>tained if an examination of the record discloses evidence that supports any one of the reasons given. See <em>Daviau </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>174 Conn. 354, 358, 387 A.2d 562 (1978); <em>Nicoli </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>171 Conn. 89, 94, 368 A.2d 24 (1976); <em>First Hartford Realty Corporation </em>v. <em>Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>165 Conn. 533, 543, 338 A.2d 490 (1973); see <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>178 Conn. 657, 662-63, 425 A.2d 100 (1979). The evidence, however, to support any such reason must be substantial; \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he credibility of witnesses and the determination of factual issues are matters within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>province of the administrative agency.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Feinson v. Conservation Commission, </em>180 Conn. 421, 425-26, 429 A.2d 910 (1980), quoting <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 708, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977), and cases there cited. \u201cThis so-called substantial evidence rule is similar to the \u2018sufficiency of the evidence\u2019 standard applied in judicial review of jury verdicts, and evidence is sufficient to sustain an agency finding if it affords \u2018a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred. . . . [I]t must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u2019... \u2018The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d rule is a compromise between opposing theories of broad or de novo review and restricted review or complete abstention. It is broad enough and capable of sufficient flexibility in its application to enable the reviewing court to correct whatever ascertainable abuses may arise in administrative adjudication. On the other hand, it is review of such breadth as is entirely consistent with effective administration. . . . [It] imposes an important limitation on the power of the courts to overturn a decision of an administrative agency . . . and to provide a more restrictive standard of review than standards embodying review of \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d or \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d action. . . . \u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 713-14; <em>Persico </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>191 Conn. 384, 409, 465 A.2d 308 (1983). The United States Supreme Court, in defining \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in the \u201cdirected verdict\u201d formulation, has said that it \u201cis something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Consolo </em>v. <em>Federal Maritime Commission, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S.

Nothing appears to demonstrate that the four hour hearing of January 7, 1980, was anything but fundamentally fair. It can hardly be claimed that the agency, as did the conservation commission in <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 428-29, \u201crelying on its own knowledge and experience, acted in a manner which placed its data base beyond the [plaintiff\u2019s] scrutiny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Among the reasons given by the agency for its denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application are the following: \u201c3. Potential adverse environmental impacts associated with the proposed activities include [inter alia]: a. [S]evere sedimentation, erosion and downstream siltation into Frye Lake because sedimentation and erosion controls proposed can be expected to be only partially effective because of the steep slopes and shallow soils. All eroded material by-passing the controls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>will impact Frye Lake. b. [Potential water pollution<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> problems from the installation of the proposed septic system . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It is true that the plaintiff made efforts through her counsel and other professional avenues to advance a proposal, after consultation with staff of the agency and others, that endeavored to meet the requirements for the issuance of a permit. A careful examination of the record, however, discloses that there is substantial evidence to support these reasons. In accordance with the principles set out, we need not address any other reason given for the denial as one is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Testifying at the public hearing on behalf of the plaintiff were: Donald M. Breismeister,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a professional architect and one of the potential contract purchasers from the plaintiff; Joseph F. Risoli, a licensed professional engineer; and Dr. Eric Walle, an environmental scientist and professor of ecology and limnology. At the end of the hearing, Frank Singleton, who directs the environmental health office in Greenwich, was asked for his comments by the agency chair and spoke favorably on the plaintiffs application. In addition to the presence of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, there was also present an attorney who represented a number of the neighbors around Frye Lake.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The transcript of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>hearing also discloses active and probing participation by agency members in questioning these experts concerning the background and input of their proposals and opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The testimony and other evidence presented by the experts Breismeister, Risoli and Walle was subjected to close questioning by agency members and at times by counsel for both the plaintiff and neighbors. Breismeister, after discussing the size and nature of the proposed house,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was asked by the agency how many baths were involved \u201cthat relate to the septic field.\u201d He said probably three baths but, as he understood the matter, \u201cthe septic field . . . limits the house to a three bedroom house and it doesn\u2019t limit the house to the number of baths.\u201d The agency, however, indicated its interest in the number of baths. This seems quite appropriate given the nature of the septic system as proposed and discussed, especially since the regulated area involved consists of the shore line and surface of Frye Lake, and when concededly approximately 80 percent of the lot itself was in Frye Lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Singleton, while favoring the application, conceded that \u201cbecause of the uniqueness in the contour of this lot, the fact that it is so narrow, there are a lot of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>environmental problems associated with it . . . . \u201d Singleton felt that \u201cthe siltation problem, not the septic system, is the major problem because of pollution of the lake.\u201d Breismeister\u2019s presentation of his proposed erosion control plan with other evidence concerning erosion, siltation and sedimentation, and including but not limited to the steep slopes, shallow soil, drainage pattern and the like, furnish a fair basis for the agency\u2019s stated view on its denial. The disturbance of the slope, the grade of which Breismeister did not know,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> by construction and merely walking on it also was a concern of the agency. The matter of the fill over the septic field which admittedly changed the drainage pattern of the lot was questioned. When queried that he did not have a drainage plan for the property proposed at the time of the hearing, Breismeister maintained that a drainage plan was not needed given the draining off the roof and driveway directly into the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In addition, there was evidence that in July, 1979, Randy May of the state department of environmental protection wrote Singleton and said in part that he felt that \u201ca septic system could be installed on this site and the ground water discharge of that system would probably not cause pollution.\u201d He said this after saying in the same letter that \u201c[t]his small lot, steep slope and immediate proximity to a lake make it very difficult to institute any program to prevent siltation.\u201d After opining that a septic system could be installed, he also said: \u201cThe construction difficulties of building that system might well result in system malfunction. The magnitude of construction on this site could easily result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>in serious siltation problems with resultant action by this unit [state department of environmental protection].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Risoli, the plaintiff\u2019s engineer, who designed the proposed septic system, pointed out the input received and the care which had been exercised in designing the system, noting that \u201c[o]bviously if anyone has seen the lot, it is a rather difficult piece of land to construct a septic system on . . . .\u2019\u2019When asked if he could comment on the erosion and sedimentation control plan Breismeister had described, he said: \u201cI think that it is probably the best you can do for the site.\u201d The agency later asked Risoli: \u201cYou think [the erosion and sedimentation control plan presented by Breismeister] is adequate?\u201d Risoli said: \u201c100 [percent]?\u201d The agency then asked: \u201cNo, I said adequate,\u201d and Risoli answered: \u201cYes, I think it is. . . . \u201d Risoli was questioned at length not only concerning his own opinions but those of others in the record, some of the inquiry calling into question the efficacy of proposals and statements he made. Very candidly, he said, \u201cI would honestly state that this particular project in the hands of a contractor would be scary\u201d but that it was a \u201cdifferent situation here, we have professionals who have a lot to lose in this town if this thing isn\u2019t done right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Walle had performed a limnological<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> evaluation of Frye Lake and made a written report. He agreed upon questions from the agency that \u201cthe general thrust of [his] testimony . . . was that in this body of water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>which really is the cove [of Frye Lake adjacent to the locus in quo] ... a condition already existed that would not be terribly worsened by anything that would happen from the property [in question] . . . .\u201d Walle, in commenting on the septic system designed for the lot in question, said that the impact on Frye Lake would be minimal and nonmeasurable <em>assuming </em>that the septic system functioned as intended and as it was described to function. Even if the system failed, he said that depending upon the time of year involved and if nutrients did get into the lake, the impact \u201con the total lake\u201d would be \u201ca very, very minimal amount.\u201d The reason for that was, he said, because there was \u201ca tremendous amount of terrain for that septic effluent to traverse above surface and a lot of it would be taken up and used by the grass and by the bushes and low growing shrubs . . . . \u201d Fairly viewed, such evidence involved not only the septic system itself, but the nature of the lot, including its soils and the proposed fill, the contours of the lot, and the proposals of both Breismeister and Risoli, both of whom testified extensively before Walle testified. The agency appeared knowledgeable of the locus itself. During the course of the hearing, the agency chair said of the locus, in speaking of the \u201cdelicate slope\u201d: \u201cWe have all walked down there and looked at it.\u201d Knowledge obtained through personal observations of the locus may properly be considered by the agency in arriving at reasons given for its denial. See <em>Manor Development Corporation </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 701; <em>Mrowka </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>134 Conn. 149, 154, 55 A.2d 909 (1947). As Walle testified, there was talk of \u201ceutrophication\u201d of Frye Lake which Walle said meant \u201cthe process of a lake aging.\u201d The import of this and its implications engendered questions by the agency and the attorney for the neighbors. Walle, in his testimony, endeavored to point out that it was not a \u201cnegative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>term.\u201d He testified that \u201c[n]utrients do not migrate laterally on a body of water on their own\u201d so that nutrients entering the cove of the lake would remain there unless somehow transported to another portion of the lake. A doctor who lived on Frye Lake for sixteen years and had been active in participating in its care for fifteen years, disagreed with Walle\u2019s opinion as to \u201clateral migration.\u201d Walle pointed out that while the water samples of the lake discussed were significant as to the cove area because \u201cif you [want] to determine the impact on that cove you don\u2019t sample at the other end of the lake, you sample right there because the impact is not going to extend to the other end of this lake.\u201d Therefore, he frankly stated his opinion did not and could not reflect all the qualities of water in the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">The environmental engineering consulting report, commissioned by the neighbors and dated October 23, 1979, pointed out that <em>\u201c[assuming satisfactory func</em>tion[ing] <em>of the [septic] system </em>its use should not result in an increase of nutrients to the lake exceeding several percent. Once fully assimilated by dilution and mixing this minor increment will probably be undetectable by analytical means and have minimal effect on <em>overall </em>lake water quality.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) It also pointed out that \u201c[d]ue to the shallow bedrock and extreme slopes on the property a system located there has an elevated risk of failure over a less difficult site.\u201d That report also remarked on the unsuitability of one area of the proposed system \u201cdue to the insufficient nitrate dilution and extreme grading difficulties.\u201d The same report refers to \u201ca continuous layer of permeable soil\u201d at one location.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">We also note that at the very start of the hearing Michael A. Aurelia, administrator of the agency, made a statement during which he commented that \u201cif the activities are authorized by the [a]gency [he] believe[d] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>strict conditions should be prescribed to insure not only the proper construction of the septic system but, also, the implementation of necessary sedimentation and erosion controls . ...\u201d In addition, staff reports from agency experts, Aurelia, who holds a degree in geology and geological science, and Mark W. Lubbers, who holds a degree in biology, could be used to contribute to the substantial evidence supporting the denial. One lake resident, referring to a model of the proposed building at the public hearing, said that the edge of the deck of the proposed house was so close to the lake itself that a cigarette dropped from that deck would go \u201cright down to the [lake] water.\u201d Although the plaintiff claims that the evidence shows that no pollution would result from the proposed activity, the record does contain evidence that there could be pollution. Evidence from the experts tended to show a potential of pollution. Evidence from a senior sanitary engineer of the water compliance section of the state department of environmental protection and from a consulting environmental engineering firm are examples. The plaintiffs professional engineer, Risoli, stated that he felt that the latter\u2019s report was \u201ca very good report\u201d and that \u201cI think he knows what he\u2019s talking about . . . .\u201d Moreover, Lubbers wrote a November, 1979 memo to agency members recommending a public hearing. In that memo, he not only indicated \u201cthat it appears that the proposals will not be adequate in preventing siltation of the watercourse,\u201d but given the nature of the lot as he described it, that with the prior existence of \u201csome question that the [septic] system can be properly constructed . . . there is also the possibility of bedrock infiltration and contamination of ground water.\u201d In the memo, which referred to nine items which had been added to complete the application, including the Preiss-Breismeister erosion control plan, Walle\u2019s limnological evaluation of Frye Lake and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the consulting environmental engineer\u2019s report commissioned for the Frye Lake Association, Lubbers concluded that \u201c[i]t is apparent from review of all the materials that the proposed development may well result in a significant impact or major effect on the regulated areas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Sometime before the public hearing, the plaintiff forwarded, inter alia, a water quality report concerning Frye Lake. This report was to include not only a limnological description of that lake and certain water quality data, but an evaluation of the impact of the proposed activities on the water quality of the lake. The letter requesting the report specifically stated that \u201c[consideration should also be given to impacts of activities associated with living on the site (to include potential discharge of effluent from the Septic System).\u201d This latter item, which is referred to in the agency\u2019s denial, was discussed at the hearing and evidence existed to support this. Of course, the agency also had the benefit of a view of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Without setting out everything in the record, we conclude that the record contained substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s reasons to which we have referred. In <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 538, 441 A.2d 30 (1981), in speaking to the statutory scheme covering wetlands and watercourses, we said that \u201c[a] statute should be interpreted according to the policy which the legislation seeks to serve.\u201d See also <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 57, 441 A.2d 68 (1981). In <em>Aaron, </em>we addressed the policies and purposes of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45 at some length and pointed out that \u201c[i]n order to carry out [the] legislative concerns, [this legislation] expressly allows municipal regulation of wetlands and water courses\u201d and that \u201cthe statutory scheme . . . envisages its adaptability to infinitely variable conditions for the effectuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>of the purposes of these statutes.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 539, 541. In order \u201cto achieve the broader purposes of this [legislation],\u201d the local wetlands agencies \u201c \u2018shall serve as the sole agent for the licensing of <em>regulated activities\u2019 . . . </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 552; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-42 (c), 22a-38 (13).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The legislative finding contained in General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36 provides, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he inland wetlands and watercourses of the state of Connecticut are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed. . . . The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses . . . is in the public interest .... It is, therefore, the purpose of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and watercourses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution . . . preventing damage from erosion, turbidity or siltation . . . deterring and inhibiting the danger of . . . pollution; protecting the quality of wetlands and watercourses ... by providing an orderly process to balance the need for the economic growth of the state and the use of its land with the need to protect its environment and ecology in order to forever guarantee to the people of the state, the safety of such natural resources for their benefit and enjoyment and for the benefit and enjoyment of generations yet unborn.\u201d This is a broad declaration of legislative purpose. Local inland wetlands bodies must look, inter alia, to this declaration in weighing their actions in any given case in which they may properly act. Applications such as that presented to the agency by the plaintiff illustrate the interrelationship of the specific regulations and statutes with the broad charter set by this legislative finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>The discharge of the statutory responsibilities by local wetlands commissions may require commission members to reject \u201can otherwise acceptable application\u201d because of its impact on the environment. <em>Obeda </em>v. <em>Board of Selectmen, </em>supra, 524. In this case, we need not go that far because there is substantial evidence to support the denial and the agency did not, as the plaintiff claims, \u201cwhimsically ignore substantial expert testimony\u201d nor was its action \u201cthe result of the prejudicial desire of the [agency] to have [the] plaintiff\u2019s land remain in a natural state.\u201d It is important to remember that \u201c[a]gainst [the] laudable state policy [of such legislation] must be balanced the interests of the private landowner who wishes to make productive use of his wetland.\u201d <em>Brecciaroli </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>168 Conn. 349, 354, 362 A.2d 948 (1975). Local inland wetland bodies \u201care not little environmental protection agencies\u201d as they have no authority to regulate any activity outside their jurisdictional limits. <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 250. This agency did not act in such a fashion but reasonably resolved fairly debatable questions based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u201c[A]n inland wetland agency is limited to considering only environmental matters which impact on inland wetlands.\u201d Id. Judicial review of the administrative process is designed to assure that administrative agencies act in a manner consistent with fundamental fairness. See <em>Feinson </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 429. This agency, unlike the commission in <em>Feinson, </em>so acted and it did not act arbitrarily on its own experience nor in disregard of contrary expert evidence. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The plaintiff also claims that the agency\u2019s action resulted in the unconstitutional taking of her land. We do point out that, with reference to the taking claim, it is not clear from the record that there is not any other reasonable alternative residential use of this property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>other than the proposed residence that was the subject of this application. The application that was denied was for a three-story, three-bedroom house with a two-car garage. The denied application, the plaintiff claims, was the \u201cpresentation of the <em>only feasible plan for residential use of the property. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It is not clear from the record that this is so. The trial court said that the agency \u201cstates there are alternatives, but [did not] articulate the alternatives to the plaintiff.\u201d Under the circumstances of this case, the trial court was in error here insofar as it placed the burden on the agency to demonstrate that there were alternatives in this case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In <em>Shorehaven Golf Club, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Resources Commission, </em>146 Conn. 619, 625, 153 A.2d 444 (1959), we upheld an agency denial of an application seeking a channel designation in tidal waters and to remove materials from that channel. What we said there bears repeating here: \u201cThe [applicants] asked for the designation of a <em>specific </em>channel as described in their application. It does not appear that they suggested or sought any alteration of the proposed channel whatsoever. They urged their plan as the only one feasible under all the circumstances. The commission denied it. The commission was not under a duty to make suggested changes or to grant a rehearing for that purpose. ... It has simply denied access in the manner suggested in the application. The reason was a cogent one.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.; see also <em>Thompson v. Water Resources Commission, </em>159 Conn. 82, 90, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>267 A.2d 434 (1970). Here the agency denied <em>the </em>application<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> presented and for cogent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">There is error, and the matter is remanded to the trial court with direction to set aside its judgment and to affirm the decision of the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\"> At the January 7,1980 public hearing on the plaintiffs application, the plaintiffs counsel conceded that a \u201c[v]ery substantial percentage\u201d of the 2.6 acres was \u201cin the lake\u201d and, when estimating the percentage of the property that was under water, he agreed with a commission member \u201cthat it would appear to be in the neighborhood of 80 [percent].\u201d In its February 25, 1980 decision, the agency specifically found that \u201c[although the lot area including the Lake surface and upland measures 2.691 acres, only .484 acres is dryland.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\"> Section 6.227 (b) of the Greenwich Municipal Code, which is Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency Regulations \u00a7 6.2, provides in part: \u201cThe Agency shall inform the applicant of its decision in granting, with or without conditions, or in denying a permit. . . .

The plaintiff argues, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>pointing to the Appellate Court decision which we reversed, that where \u201can applicant is applying to change or vary legislation, such as a change of zone, it is reasonable that unless a majority votes for the change, the existing legislation remains unaltered [and] [t]he status quo is preserved.\u201d In contrast, however, she argues that here \u201cthere is no status quo to be preserved when an administrative agency [here the wetlands agency] acting in a quasi-judicial function fails to affirmatively determine whether a site plan conforms to the applicable statutes or regulations.\u201d In urging us to apply this distinction in this case, the plaintiff has not cited any applicable statute or Connecticut case or parliamentary law that reasonably supports this argument. Our decision in <em>Merlo II </em>does not so distinguish <em>Lupinacci </em>or <em>Hall. </em>Moreover, there is authority for the proposition that \u201c[u]nder common law or parliamentary law, an affirmative resolution or action which is the subject of a tie vote fails of adoption.\u201d 59 Am. Jur. 2d, Parliamentary Law \u00a7 11, p. 326.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\"> In a somewhat anomalous fashion, the trial court, after deciding there were \u201cno reasons for denial properly before the court\u201d and determining to search the record for reasons to support the agency\u2019s decision, nevertheless concluded that \u201c[t]he mood of the agency which appears from the return of record is as follows: \u2018Common sense would suggest that the proposed development would result in a degradation of water quality in Frye Lake.\u2019 \u201d This was <em>one </em>of the reasons that the agency gave for denying the application.

No natural buffer areas can be preserved between residential activities and Frye Lake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201c8.
