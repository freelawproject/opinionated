We hold that there was no such mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. In <em>Beloff </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>Docket No. 12827, Wayne Beloff was operating a motorcycle on October 26,1982, when he was struck and seriously injured by another motor vehicle. At the time of the accident, Beloff lived at home with his mother, who had insured two motorcycles, including the one Beloff was riding, with Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (Progressive).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Upon settlement of the liability claim with the party responsible for the accident for his full policy limit of $20,000, Beloff sought to recover additional benefits from Progressive, claiming that he was entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under the two motorcycle policies. Each policy contained a provision for uninsured motorist coverage, conditioned on the payment of additional premiums.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Beloff s mother, however, had not paid for uninsured motorist protection. Progressive denied Beloff s claim and refused to submit the matter to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Beloff brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-175a through 38-175e mandated that all insurance policies provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, and that Progressive must submit all the coverage issues to arbitration. Both Beloff and Progressive filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court, <em>McDonald, J., </em>reasoned that motorcycle insurance policies were required, as a matter of law, to provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, and thus, there was no genuine issue of any material fact. Accordingly, the court granted Beloff\u2019s motion. After the court\u2019s decision, Beloff filed a motion to compel Progressive to submit to binding arbitration on all issues of coverage, liability and damages. The court granted this motion, and Progressive appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DiGangi, </em>Docket No. 12841, James Lawrence was killed on April 11, 1980, when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. At the time of the accident, Lawrence possessed two insurance policies: an automobile policy issued by Criterion Insurance Company, which provided unin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>sured motorist coverage in the amount of $20,000, and a motorcycle policy, which also provided for optional uninsured motorist benefits, issued by Progressive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Lawrence had paid a premium for uninsured motorist benefits provided under the Progressive policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The operator of the other motor vehicle paid the Lawrence estate his policy limit of $20,000, and thereafter, Marion Lawrence DiGangi, as administratrix of the Lawrence estate, submitted a claim for underinsured motorist benefits under the two policies. Progressive refused the claim and filed an action for declaratory judgment to determine whether underinsured motorist benefits were afforded by its motorcycle policy with Lawrence, and, in the event coverage existed, to determine the order of priority between its policy and the automobile policy issued by Criterion Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">DiGangi moved to dismiss the action claiming that, under General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c, the issues raised by Progressive\u2019s action had to be decided by arbitration. The trial court, <em>Vasington, J., </em>granted DiGangi\u2019s motion and held that, because Progressive sought to resolve issues involving coverage and because Progressive\u2019s policy contained a binding arbitration clause, \u00a7 38-175c mandated that the parties arbitrate the dispute. Upon appeal, the Appellate Court sustained the trial court\u2019s determination, reasoning that Progressive sought to have the issue of coverage decided by the declaratory judgment, and that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c clearly mandated that such issues be determined by arbitration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number><em>DiGangi, </em>4 Conn. App. 137, 139, 492 A.2d 548 (1985). Upon the granting of certification, Progressive appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The third case consolidated on appeal, <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>Docket No. 12881, involves a similar factual situation. William Vogel was insured under a motorcycle insurance policy issued by Progressive.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This policy contained a provision for uninsured motorist coverage for which Vogel paid an additional premium, and a binding arbitration provision for liability and damage disputes. The policy did not, however, contain a provision for underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On July 19,1984, Vogel was seriously injured when the motorcycle he was operating was struck by another motor vehicle. Vogel collected the liability policy limit of $25,000 from the operator of the other motor vehicle and then submitted a claim for underinsured motorist benefits under the Progressive policy. Progressive denied the claim and Vogel filed a motion to compel arbitration of his claim. The trial court, <em>Berdon, J., </em>dismissed Vogel\u2019s motion, holding that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c, which mandates binding arbitration of automobile liability insurance policies, did not apply to this case because the insurance policy at issue was a motorcycle policy. Vogel appealed the trial court\u2019s determination. After the <em>Beloff </em>and <em>Vogel </em>appeals were transferred to this court, these appeals were consolidated pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3002 (now \u00a7 4004).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Beloff, DiGangi and Vogel (hereinafter insureds) now contend that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-175a through 38-175e applied to Progressive\u2019s motorcycle insurance policies at the time of their respective accidents so as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>to mandate the inclusion of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, and to mandate the submission of all coverage issues to arbitration. Progressive, on the other hand, argues that its motorcycle policies were not required to include such coverage, nor need it submit coverage issues to arbitration, because these sections did not then apply to motorcycle insurance policies. Thus, to resolve the issue before us, we must determine whether the legislature intended that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175a et seq. govern insurance policies covering motorcycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Before reaching the merits of this appeal, we must, as a preliminary matter, determine whether the question before us should be decided in arbitration proceedings or by this court. The insureds argue that the issue of whether \u00a7\u00a7 38-175a through 38-175e govern motorcycle policies is a \u201ccoverage\u201d issue, and as such, must be decided by arbitration as provided by General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the basis for the duty to arbitrate relied upon by the insureds is \u00a7 38-175c (a), however, we must necessarily first determine whether it applies to motorcycle policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Recently, we have had the opportunity to examine the scope of \u00a7 38-175c (a). <em>Insecurity Ins. Co. of Hartford </em>v. <em>DeLaurentis, </em>202 Conn. 178, 188, 520 A.2d 202 (1987), we held that the question of whether a policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage provision extended benefits to accidents involving underinsured motorists was a question of coverage to be determined by arbitration. In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>199 Conn. 618, 623-24, 509 A.2d 467 (1986), we concluded that issues involving fleet stacking and workers\u2019 compensation setoffs also involved issues of coverage, and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>were subject to determination by arbitration. See also <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>189 Conn. 16, 19-21, 453 A.2d 1158 (1983); <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>181 Conn. 37, 41-42, 434 A.2d 304 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">This appeal is distinguishable from the cases cited in that here there is a dispute as to whether the dictates of \u00a7 38-175c (a) apply to the policies in question, not just a dispute over the scope of the coverage mandated by the section. Because the arbitrability of a dispute is ordinarily a legal question for the courts; <em>Frager </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>155 Conn. 270, 274, 231 A.2d 531 (1967); we conclude that the preliminary determination of whether motorcycle policies are governed by \u00a7\u00a7 38-175a through 38-175e is a question to be determined by this court, not an arbitrator. Cf. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>174 Conn 578, 580-81, 392 A.2d 466 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In construing \u00a7 38-175a, we must attempt to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>201 Conn. 89, 93, 513 A.2d 124 (1986); <em>Norwich </em>v. <em>Silverherg, </em>200 Conn. 367, 370-71, 511 A.2d 336 (1986); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 521, 441 A.2d 158 (1981); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1984) \u00a7 45.05. \u201cWhen the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, we need look no further for interpretative guidance because we assume that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 316, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S. Ct. 813, 88 L. Ed. 2d 787 (1986); <em>Mazur </em>v. <em>Blum, </em>184 Conn. 116, 118-19, 441 A.2d 65 (1981). When we are confronted, however, with ambiguity in a statute, we seek to ascertain the actual intent by looking to the words of the statute itself; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>[199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986)]; <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 214, 471 A.2d 1368 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>(1984) ; the legislative history and circumstances surrounding the enactment of the statute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 673; <em>DeFonce Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>State, </em>198 Conn. 185, 187, 501 A.2d 745 (1985) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 161, 496 A.2d 186 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>supra, 522; and the purpose the statute is to serve. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985); <em>Verrastro </em>v. <em>Sivertsen, </em>188 Conn. 213, 221, 448 A.2d 1344 (1982); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 8, 434 A.2d 293 (1980).\u201d <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">An examination of the language of \u00a7 38-175a fails to reveal definitively the types of vehicles that it governed at the time the policies involved in these cases were in force. Section 38-175a provides, in relevant part, that the \u201cregulations with respect to minimum provisions to be included in <em>automobile liability insurance policies . . . covering private passenger automobiles and commercial motor vehicles, as defined in subsection (7) of section 14-1 . . </em>. shall make mandatory the inclusion of . . . uninsured motorists coverages . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) At first blush, the cross reference in \u00a7 38-175a itself would appear to resolve the issue before us. General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (7),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> however, defines only \u201ccommercial motor vehicle.\u201d It does not define \u201cprivate passenger automobiles,\u201d nor is \u201cprivate passenger automobiles\u201d defined elsewhere in the statutes. It is therefore unclear from \u00a7 38-175a whether the legislature intended \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies. . . covering private passenger automobiles\u201d to include coverage for motorcycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The insureds urge us to look to statutes governing similar subject matter to help ascertain the legislative intent. They contend that General Statutes \u00a7 38-175f, regulating the cancellation of motor vehicle policies, adequately designates the types of vehicles covered by \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies,\u201d and that motorcycles are-so included.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 38-175f states that the vehicles covered by automobile liability insurance policies include \u201cthe following types only: (1) A motor vehicle of the private passenger or station wagon type that is not used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers, nor rented to others, or (2) any other four-wheel motor vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen hundred pounds or less which is not used in the occupation, profession or business of the insured . . . .\u201dIn light of this statute, the insureds argue that because a \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d is defined as a \u201cmotor vehicle which has the capacity of carrying not more than ten passengers\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (35)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; and because a motorcycle is defined as a \u201cmotor vehicle having not more than three wheels\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 14-1 (25)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>; therefore, motorcycles are \u201cmotor vehicle[s] of the private passenger . . . type\u201dand accordingly are types of vehicles covered by \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>While we recognize the principle that statutes are to be interpreted with regard to other relevant statutes because the legislature is presumed to have created a consistent body of law; <em>Heffernan </em>v. Slapin, 182 Conn. 40, 46, 438 A.2d 1 (1980); <em>State </em>v. Giorgio, 2 Conn. App. 204, 209, 477 A.2d 134 (1984); we find General Statutes \u00a7 38-175f of little help in interpreting \u00a7 38-175a. Section 38-175f, and more specifically the term \u201cmotor vehicle of the private passenger . . . type\u201d as set forth in that section, is itself not free from ambiguity. Although \u00a7 14-1 (35) defines \u201cpassenger motor vehicle\u201d as a motor vehicle which has the capacity to carry not more than 10 persons, \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle,\u201d virtually the same phrase used in the mandate of minimum coverage contained in \u00a7 38-175a, is defined differently elsewhere in the statutes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Additionally, \u00a7 38-175f refers to the types of vehicles covered as a \u201cmotor vehicle of the private passenger or station wagon type ... or <em>any other four-wheel motor vehicle\u201d </em>implying that all vehicles referred to in \u00a7 38-175f must be four-wheel motor vehicles. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, it cannot be said that \u00a7 38-175f clearly indicates that motorcycles are \u201cmotor vehicle[s] of the private passenger . . . type\u201d to be covered by \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We find it significant that the insurance commissioner, in adopting regulations pursuant to \u00a7 38-175a, defined a \u201c \u2018[p]rivate passenger automobile\u2019 [to mean] the same as private passenger motor vehicle as defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>in \u00a7 38-319 (g) of the general statutes.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38-175a-2 (4). General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 38-319 (g) defines a private passenger motor vehicle as <em>\u201ca: </em>(1) Private passenger type automobile, (2) station wagon type automobile, (3) camper type motor vehicle, (4) high-mileage type motor vehicle as defined in . . . section 14-1, or (5) truck type motor vehicle with a load capacity of fifteen hundred pounds or less, registered as a passenger motor vehicle as defined in. . . section 14-1, or as a passenger and commercial motor vehicle as defined in . . . section 14-1, or used for farming purposes. <em>It does not include </em>a <em>motorcycle </em>or motor vehicle used as a public or livery conveyance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The insureds argue that the exclusion of motorcycles from \u00a7 38-319 (g) applies only to motorcycles used as a public or livery conveyance. We do not agree. In attempting to ascertain whether the legislature intended to exclude all motorcycles or just motorcycles used as a public or livery conveyance, we recognize that there is a presumption of purpose behind every sentence, clause or phrase, and that no word in a statute is to be treated as superfluous. <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>supra, 60. Because a motorcycle is a motor vehicle, it would be redundant for the legislature to repeat the term \u201cmotorcycle,\u201d if it meant to exclude only those motorcycles used as public or livery conveyances.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Moreover, in construing a statute, common sense must be used and we must assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result. <em>Gentry </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>196 Conn. 596, 606, 494 A.2d 1206 (1985). We would be hard pressed to envision a situation where a motorcycle would be used as a public or livery conveyance. Therefore, we conclude that the legislature intended to exclude all motorcycles from its definition of \u201cprivate passenger motor vehicle\u201d in \u00a7 38-319 (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Furthermore, as we have previously stated, when terms are ambiguous or have not been defined by this court or the legislature, the terms will be given their commonly approved meaning unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed. <em>Federal Aviation Administration </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>196 Conn. 546, 550, 494 A.2d 564 (1985); <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>184 Conn. 607, 623, 440 A.2d 810 (1981) <em>(Armentano, J., </em>dissenting); <em>Rosnick </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>172 Conn. 416, 422, 374 A.2d 1076 (1977); see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). \u201cWhen a statute does not define a term, it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries.\u201d <em>Hinchliffe </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>supra; <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 570-71, 440 A.2d 767 (1981); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 183, 186, 438 A.2d 859 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The legislature chose to define the types of vehicles covered by \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies\u201d as \u201cprivate passenger automobiles.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201cautomobile\u201d as a <em>\u201cI-wheeled </em>automotive vehicle designed for passenger transportation on streets and roadways and commonly propelled by an internal combustion engine using volatile fuel. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) By contrast, \u201cmotorcycle\u201d is defined as \u201ca <em>2-wheeled </em>tandem automotive vehicle having 1 or 2 riding saddles and sometimes having a 3d wheel for the support of a sidecar.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since the regulation passed pursuant to \u00a7 38-175a excludes motorcycles from the term \u201cprivate passenger automobile\u201d and because the common understanding of \u201cautomobile\u201d does not encompass \u201cmotorcycle,\u201d we conclude that the statute\u2019s mandate of minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability policies covering \u201cprivate passenger automobiles\u201d did not apply to motorcycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Subsequent legislative action lends further support to our conclusion that the legislature did not intend to include motorcycle policies covering motorcycles within the ambit of \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies.\u201d In 1985, the General Assembly enacted Public Acts 1985, No. 85-12,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which amended \u00a7 38-175a as follows: \u201cThe insurance commissioner shall adopt regulations with respect to minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability insurance policies . . . <em>covering </em>private passenger motor vehicles, as defined in subsection (g) of 38-319, commercial motor vehicles, as defined in subdivision (9) of section 14-1, motorcycles, as defined in subdivision (29) of section 14-1 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The insureds contend that No. 85-12 of the 1985 Public Acts only clarified the law as it then existed, and that the sole purpose behind the amendment was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>allow the insurance commissioner to provide minimum liability limits for the vehicles enumerated in the amendment. We do not agree with this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Representative Morag L. Vance, in remarking on Public Acts 1985, No. 85-12, explained that \u201c[t]his bill and its amendment is simply intended to give the insurance commissioner the ability to draft the amount of liability coverage that should be carried for the vehicles that are defined in the amendment. . . . What this [bill] does is it gives [the insurance commissioner] the <em>ability to also regulate these other areas. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 28 H.R. Proc., Pt. 5, 1985 Sess., pp. 1575-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The apparent purpose of No. 85-12 of the 1985 Public Acts was, therefore, to extend to the insurance commissioner the ability to authorize regulations, including the mandatory inclusion of uninsured motorists coverages, for motorcycle policies, where no such authority existed before. By so amending the statute, the legislature further mandated that such policies include underinsured motorist coverage and that policies providing for binding arbitration also provide for the final determination of coverage issues in the arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Contrary to the insureds\u2019 position, \u00a7 38-175a was not amended to clarify the types of vehicles \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies\u201d covered. It is generally recognized that a statutory amendment is presumed to effect a change in the existing law; <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>supra, 49; <em>Reitzer </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of State Colleges, </em>2 Conn. App. 196, 202-203, 477 A.2d 129 (1984); 1A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 22.30; and that the legislature has not enacted futile or meaningless legislation. <em>City Council </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>180 Conn. 243, 251, 429 A.2d 481 (1980). Section 38-175a was first enacted in 1967 and it provided that automobile liability policies covered private passenger automobiles. It was not until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>1985 that the legislature undertook to expand the types of vehicles covered by \u201cautomobile liability insurance policies.\u201d There is nothing in the legislative history to demonstrate that the legislature intended this act to clarify the scope of \u00a7 38-175a. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 556-58, 522 A.2d 753 (1987); 1A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 22.31. It is apparent that the legislature intended not to clarify what type of vehicles had previously been covered by \u00a7 38-175a but to expand the statute to mandate that policies covering motorcycles provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">For the above reasons, we conclude that, at the times relevant to these cases, \u00a7\u00a7 38-175a through 38-175e did not mandate that motorcycle policies provide uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, nor did they mandate arbitration for coverage issues in motorcycle policies providing binding arbitration provisions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that: (1) in <em>Beloff </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>the trial court erred in granting Beloff s motions for summary judgment and to compel arbitration; (2) in <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DiGangi, </em>the Appellate Court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s decision granting DiGangi\u2019s motion to dismiss; and (3) in <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>the trial court was correct in dismissing Vogel\u2019s application to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>In <em>Beloff, </em>the judgment is set aside and the trial court is directed to render judgment for Progressive on Progressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment; in <em>DiGangi, </em>the Appellate Court\u2019s decision is reversed and that court is ordered to direct the trial court to render judgment on Progressive\u2019s complaint in accordance with this opinion; and in <em>Vogel, </em>the trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1983)] Sec. 38-175a. minimum provisions in automobile LIABILITY policies, (a) The insurance commissioner shall adopt regulations with respect to minimum provisions to be included in automobile liability insurance policies issued after the effective date of such regulations and covering private passenger automobiles and commercial motor vehicles, as defined in subsection (7) of section 14-1, registered or principally garaged in this state.
