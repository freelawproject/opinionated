J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0T\">This case comes to us, by way of reservation, as a multifaceted challenge to the constitutional and statutory validity of legislation colloquially known as Lemon Law II that establishes arbitration panels for the settlement of disputes between consumers and manufacturers of new motor vehicles. The plaintiffs, Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States, Inc., and a number of individual motor vehicle manufacturers and importers,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brought an action in six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>counts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from Public Acts 1984, No. 84-338, codified as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-181 through 42-184, both in its initial form and as amended in 1985. The complaint named as defendants the governor, William A. O\u2019Neill, and other governmental officials and agencies charged with enforcing the act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> State Representative John J. Woodcock III, a legislative sponsor of Lemon Law II, was permitted to intervene as a party defendant. At the joint request of all the parties, the trial court, <em>Satter, J., </em>granted a motion for reservation upon stipulated facts to have this court resolve nine questions of law about the validity of the statutes in question.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the questions were improvidently reserved, we remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>All of the plaintiff manufacturers and importers extend express written warranties to the retail purchasers of their cars. Although these warranties vary in scope and in duration, they all conform to the same general pattern. For new vehicles, and/or selected components, the warrantors promise to pay for repair or replacement of defective factory materials or workmanship during a stipulated warranty period. The warranty period ranges from a minimum of twelve months or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>12,000 miles (whichever occurs first) to a maximum of five years or 50,000 miles. The warranty may also contain a provision for a deductible.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Informal dispute resolution mechanisms to resolve consumer complaints about consumer products received federal encouragement in 1975, when Congress enacted the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. Pub. L. No. 93-637, title I, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301 et seq., and especially \u00a7 2310 (a). The federal trade commission has adopted standards for the operation of informal dispute settlement mechanisms. 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 703 et seq. In response, the plaintiffs Chrysler Corporation and Ford Motor Company have established their own informal dispute settlement mechanisms for the settlement of disputes with consumers regarding applicable warranties, among other matters. In addition, the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., administers an \u201cAuto Line\u201d dispute settlement mechanism which fourteen other manufacturers offer to consumers.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In 1982, the Connecticut legislature enacted Public Acts 1982, No. 82-287 (Lemon Law I). That act is codified as General Statutes \u00a7 42-179.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For consumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>buyers of new motor vehicles, the act provides supplemental remedies of repair, replacement and refund to facilitate the enforcement of express warranties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>made by the manufacturers of such vehicles. These supplemental remedies come into play whenever a manufacturer or authorized dealer, after a reasonable number of repair attempts, is unable substantially to conform a new vehicle to the terms of the express warranty. The validity of Lemon Law I is not an issue in the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>In 1984, the legislature enacted Public Acts 1984, No. 84-338 (Lemon Law II), now codified as General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-181 through 42-184. The purpose of Lemon Law II is to provide, for consumer purchasers of new motor vehicles, an alternative to civil litigation. The key provision is \u00a7 42-181,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which authorizes the department of consumer protection to establish \u201can independent arbitration procedure for the settlement of disputes between consumers and manufacturers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>motor vehicles which do not conform to all applicable warranties under the terms of section 42-179.\u201d Whether to invoke arbitration under the act is a deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>sion for the consumer: only the consumer may initiate arbitration proceedings, and the consumer may decide whether to accept the decision of the arbitration panel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 42-181 (b), (c). Once a consumer has brought a grievance to the statutory arbitration panel, the manufacturer must cooperate, in good faith, with all aspects of the arbitration procedure. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42-181 (b), (c) and 42-184. The department of consumer protection has promulgated the necessary regulations, effective December 18,1984, to create the automobile dispute settlement panels mandated by Lemon Law II. Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 42-1-181 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The legislature amended both Lemon Law I and Lemon Law II in 1985, when it enacted Public Acts 1985, No. 85-331, codified as General Statutes \u00a7 41-179a and as amendments to \u00a7\u00a7 42-179, 42-181, 42-182 and 42-185. The amendments, in addition to making a number of procedural changes, empowered the attorney general to certify a manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute settlement mechanism as complying with 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 703 et seq., thus avoiding the state\u2019s arbitration panels under Lemon Law II. To date, no manufacturer has obtained such certification. A report of the attorney general that has been made an exhibit criticizes existing private programs for, inter alia, their \u201cexclusion of consequential damages\u201d from the arbitration process.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The state has begun to implement and enforce Lemon Law II according to its terms. Arbitration panels have heard and resolved numerous consumer complaints pursuant to the applicable statutory and regulatory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>visions. Examination of the available documentation concerning the decisions of the arbitration panels, contained in exhibit M, indicates that these arbitration proceedings appear to have been conducted and concluded, in large part, without their participants having raised any of the questions of constitutional validity and statutory conflict that the present plaintiffs are pursuing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">With respect to each of the fourteen exhibits that accompany the stipulation,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> each party has reserved the right to challenge the relevancy of its contents to the issues raised by the reservation. The plaintiffs, furthermore, \u201cexpressly do not stipulate to the truth or accuracy of any of the information or statements contained in Exhibits A through N.\u201d In effect, therefore, the stipulation furnishes us with no binding particulars about the nature of the consumer disputes whose arbitrability these plaintiffs resist, or about the arbitral remedies previously sought or awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The stipulation as a whole, therefore, is simply a request for advice about the facial validity of Lemon Law II. The reserved questions raise a number of serious issues about the validity of Lemon Law II under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the federal and state constitutions, as well as a possible statutory conflict between Lemon Law II and the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act. General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The propriety of a reservation which seeks an adjudication of constitutional questions in a factual vacuum is always doubtful. Only recently, this court reviewed at length the discretionary prudential concerns which generally counsel against such an undertaking. <em>State </em>v. <em>Zach, </em>198 Conn. 168, 176-78, 502 A.2d 896 (1985), and cases there cited; see also J. Nowak, R. Rotunda &amp; J. Young, Constitutional Law (2d Ed. 1983) pp. 72-74; L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law (1978) \u00a7 3-13. A party mounting a constitutional challenge to the validity of a statute must provide an adequate factual record in order to meet its burden of demonstrating the statute\u2019s adverse impact on some protected interest of its own, in its own particular case, and not merely under some hypothetical set of facts as yet unproven. Whether a case comes to us by way of reservation or after a final judgment, the rule is the same. We do not give advisory opinions, nor do we sit as roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of legislative enactments. \u201cDetermination of the scope and constitutionality of legislation in advance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.\u201d <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 37 </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>347 U.S. 222, 224, 74 S. Ct. 447, 98 L. Ed. 650 (1954). In the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, facial invalidation of a statute is improvident. <em>Brockett </em>v. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 491, 501-502, 105 S. Ct. 2794, 86 L. Ed. 2d 394 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Without an adequate factual record, the issues concerning the constitutional validity of Lemon Law II are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>not ripe for review. The problem we face is illustrated by the parties\u2019 conflicting positions about the first issue that has been reserved to us: does Lemon Law II violate the portion of article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended, which provides that \u201cthe right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The basic principles that govern the scope of article first, \u00a7 19, are well established. The right to a jury trial is measured by a historical test. \u201c[A]s to cases triable to the jury prior to the constitution of 1818, and extant at the time of its adoption, the right may not be abolished.\u201d <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 298, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976); <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>Spring Brook Dairy, Inc., </em>135 Conn. 294, 297, 64 A.2d 39 (1949). Causes of action that are essentially cognizable at law are triable to a jury, while actions that are essentially equitable are not. <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>197 Conn. 34, 44-45, 495 A.2d 1034 (1985); <em>Franchi </em>v. <em>Farmholme, Inc. </em>191 Conn. 201, 209-11, 464 A.2d 35 (1983). This distinction is easier to state than to apply, especially when legal and equitable issues are combined in a single action. \u201cWhere incidental issues of fact are presented in an action essentially equitable, the court may determine them without a jury in the exercise of its equitable powers .... Where, however, the essential basis of the action is such that the issues presented would be properly cognizable in an action of law, either party has a right to have the legal issues tried to the jury, even though equitable relief is asked in order to give full effect to the legal rights claimed.\u201d <em>National Bank of Commerce of New London </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>128 Conn. 307, 310, 22 A.2d 773 (1941). Application of these principles to a particular controversy requires an analysis of the pleadings as a whole. In that analysis, \u201c[t]he form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>of the relief demanded is not dispositive.\u201d <em>United Stales Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>supra; <em>Franchi </em>v. <em>Farmholme, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The cause of action whose essential nature we are asked to assess is the complaint of a consumer who invokes Lemon Law II to avail himself of an arbitral forum to hear his dispute with the manufacturer of a new motor vehicle. The plaintiffs maintain that such a consumer complaint is essentially a cause of action for breach of an express warranty. Whether a warranty claim is viewed as a contract action, a tort action, or a hybrid of the two; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Healy, </em>176 Conn. 97, 100, 405 A.2d 54 (1978); such a matter has always been triable to a jury. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>2 Conn. (Root) 407 (1796). Because the issues that come before the statutory arbitration panels are substantially the same as those that would have been triable at law, the plaintiffs argue that, even as a statutory cause of action, a consumer complaint under Lemon Law II must respect the plaintiffs\u2019 right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">The defendants do not dispute the proposition that a common law action to recover damages for breach of an express warranty would have been a legal action triable to a jury prior to 1818. Rather, their argument is that Lemon Law II does not \u201ctrack\u201d this common law action. They maintain that the provisions of the Lemon Law follow, instead, the essential outlines of a bill in equity for specific performance of a contract or for rescission and restitution. Such equitable actions do not require a jury trial even if ancillary monetary damages are awarded. <em>United States Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Bohart, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">In our analysis of the causes of action that Lemon Law II authorizes to be brought to arbitration panels, we are of course handicapped by having no stipulated facts about the contents of the pleadings that the panels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>have entertained. In these circumstances, we are left with a facial appraisal of the applicable statutory provisions. The section of Lemon Law II that describes the remedies that arbitrators may order is \u00a7 42-181 (c). This section gives arbitration panels wide-ranging discretion to fashion \u201cappropriate remedies, including, but not limited to one or more of the following: (1) Repair of the vehicle; (2) Replacement of the vehicle with an identical or comparable new vehicle acceptable to the consumer; (3) Refund of the full contract price, plus collateral charges as specified in subsection (d) of . . . section 42-179; (4) Reimbursement for expenses and compensation for incidental damages as specified in subsection (d) of . . . section 42-179; (5) Any other remedies available under the applicable warranties, section 42-179, this section and sections 42-182 to 42-184, inclusive, or the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 88 Stat. 2183 (1975), 15 USC 2301 et seq., as in effect on October 1, 1982.\u201d The refund and reimbursements authorized by \u00a7 42-179 (d) include: \u201cThe full contract price ... all collateral charges, including . . . sales tax, license and registration fees . . . finance charges . . . and all incidental damages as defined in section \u00a7 42a-2-715, less a reasonable allowance for the consumer\u2019s use of the vehicle.\u201d Incidental damages, in turn, are defined in \u00a7 42a-2-715, which is part of the Uniform Commercial Code, as including \u201cexpenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected . . . and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach,\u201d subject to diminution by a reasonable allowance for use value.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The expansive nature of this statutory authority for remedial action leaves considerable room for variation in actual practice. The briefs of the parties, and their oral arguments in this court, make it apparent that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>take distinctly different views of how arbitration panels operate in fact, and especially of the remedies that are likely to be sought and awarded. The plaintiffs focus on the monetary relief that is afforded by way of a \u201crefund\u201d and note that a claim for such relief closely resembles a monetary action for breach of warranty. The defendants, by contrast, emphasize the centrality of \u201crepair\u201d and \u201creplacement\u201d as specific enforcement of the terms of the plaintiffs\u2019 warranties. Starting from these different points of departure, the parties disagree strenuously about what is essential and what is ancillary to the claims that Lemon Law II authorizes arbitration panels to decide. Absent a factual record, this is a disagreement that we cannot resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Because of the nature of the remedy that the act characterizes as a \u201crefund,\u201d if indeed that remedy is regularly invoked by Lemon Law II arbitration panels, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the act impairs their right of access to trial by jury presents an extremely close question that cannot be dismissed out of hand. We note that the attorney general has himself emphasized that the availability of adequate compensatory damages is essential to a viable alternative dispute resolution mechanism. We note further that Lemon Law II invites a comparison to relevant provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, when, in \u00a7 42-179 (d), it expressly incorporates the code\u2019s definition of incidental damages. Under article 2 of the code, a buyer\u2019s right to recover the purchase price of goods rightfully returned to the seller has never been characterized as an equitable remedy. The code speaks of specific performance only with regard to a buyer\u2019s entitlement to receive the goods that were promised. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 42a-2-711 (2), 42a-2-716. For a buyer who rightfully rejects or revokes acceptance of a seller\u2019s tender of goods, the right to recovery of the purchase price is not a claim for rescission and may be tried to a jury. General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>\u00a7 42a-2-711 (2); <em>Conte </em>v. <em>Dwan Lincoln-Mercury, Inc., </em>172 Conn. 112, 119-20, 374 A.2d 144 (1976); and compare General Statutes \u00a7 42a-2-718 (2); <em>Barco Auto Leasing Corporation </em>v. <em>House, </em>202 Conn. 106, 114-16, 520 A.2d 162 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Review of this serious challenge to the constitutional validity of Lemon Law II requires an adequate factual record. Without a finding of whether particular arbitration proceedings, or arbitration proceedings in general under Lemon Law II, essentially rely on requests and awards for refunds, we lack a basis for determining the extent to which the proceedings authorized by Lemon Law II are essentially legal or essentially equitable. Because it would be improvident to resolve this crucial issue on the present record, and because disposition of this issue may obviate the need to address the other questions that have been reserved to us, we conclude that it is inappropriate for us to respond to any part of the reservation. It no longer appears, as Practice Book \u00a7 4147 (formerly \u00a7 3133) requires, that the present determination of these questions \u201cwould be in the interest of simplicity, directness and economy of judicial action.\u201d <em>See State v. Zach, </em>supra, 178<em>; State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, </em>192 Conn. 671, 684, 474 A.2d 760 (1984); <em>Rothkopf v.

The manufacturer shall include with the warranty or owner\u2019s manual the name and address to which the consumer shall send such written notification.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u201c(d) If the manufacturer, or its agents or authorized dealers are unable to conform the motor vehicle to any applicable express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or condition which substantially impairs the use, safety or value of the motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall replace the motor vehicle with a new motor vehicle acceptable to the consumer, or accept return of the vehicle from the consumer and refund to the consumer the following: (1) The full contract price including, but not limited to charges for undercoating, dealer preparation and transportation, and installed options, (2) all collateral charges, including, but not limited to, sales tax, license and registration fees, and similar government charges, (3) all finance charges incurred by the consumer after he first reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, agent or dealer and during any subsequent period when the vehicle is out of service by reason of repair, and (4) all incidental damages as defined in section 42a-2-715, less a reasonable allowance for the consumer\u2019s use of the vehicle.

The.consumer may initiate a request for arbitration by calling a toll-free telephone number designated by the commissioner or by requesting an arbitration hearing in writing. The consumer shall file, on forms prescribed by the commissioner, any information deemed relevant to the resolution of the dispute and shall return the form accompanied by a filing fee of fifty dollars.

An expert shall sit as a non voting member of an arbitration panel whenever oral testimony is presented. Such experts may be recommended by the commissioner of motor vehicles at the request of the commissioner of consumer protection. An arbitration panel shall, as expeditiously as possible, but not later than sixty days after the time the consumer files the complaint form together with the filing fee, render a fair decision based on the information gathered and disclose its findings and the reasons therefor to the parties involved. The decision shall provide appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to one or more of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201c(1) Repair of the vehicle;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">\u201c(2) Replacement of the vehicle with an identical or comparable new vehicle acceptable to the consumer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">\u201c(3) Refund of the full contract price, plus collateral charges as specified in subsection (d) of said section 42-179;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">\u201c(4) Reimbursement for expenses and compensation for incidental damages as specified in subsection (d) of said section 42-179;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">\u201c(5) Any other remedies available under the applicable warranties, section 42-179, this section and sections 42-182 to 42-184, inclusive, or the Magnuson-Moss Warranty-Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 88 Stat. 2183 (1975), 15 USC 2301 et seq., as in effect on October 1, 1982.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">\u201cThe decision shall specify a date for performance and completion of all awarded remedies. Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or any regulation to the contrary, the department of consumer protection shall not amend, reverse, rescind or revoke any decision or action of an arbitration panel. The department shall contact the consumer, within ten working days after the date for performance, to determine whether performance has occurred. The manufacturer shall act in good faith in abiding by any department decision. In addition, if the decision is accepted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the consumer, either party to the arbitration may make application to the superior court for the judicial district in which one of the parties resides, or, when the court is not in session, any judge thereof for an order confirming, vacating, modifying or correcting any award, in accordance with the provisions of sections 52-417, 52-418, 52-419 and 52-420.

The commissioner of consumer protection shall determine the size, type face, form and wording of the sign required by this section, which shall include the toll-free telephone number and the address to which requests for the department\u2019s arbitration services may be sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u201c(f) Any consumer injured by the operation of any procedure which does not conform with procedures established by a manufacturer pursuant to subsection (b) of section 42-182 and the provisions of Title 16 Code of Federal Regulations Part 703, as in effect on October 1,1982, may appeal any decision rendered as the result of such a procedure by requesting arbitration de novo of the dispute by an arbitration panel. Filing procedures and fees for appeals shall be the same as those required in subsection (b) of this section. The findings of the manufacturer\u2019s informal dispute settlement procedure may be admissible in evidence at such arbitration panel hearing and in any civil action subsequently arising out of any warranty obligation or matter related to the dispute. Any consumer so injured may, in addition, request the attorney general to investigate the manufacturer\u2019s procedure to determine whether its certification shall be suspended or revoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>after proper notice and hearing.
