Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKN\">On this appeal, the defendant, the board of education of the town of Watertown (board), maintains that the trial court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees under General Statutes \u00a7 10-235<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the plaintiff, Anthony F. King, the former superintendent of schools for the town of Watertown. King incurred these fees in an action litigating the enforceability of a contract entered into on November 5,1980, between King and the board concerning King\u2019s resignation as superintendent. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The disposition of this appeal requires the exposition of circumstances that have their genesis in an earlier related appeal. <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>195 Conn. 90, 486 A.2d 1111 (1985). That case arose as a result of a claim for indemnification, filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 10-235 (a), for legal fees and costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>incurred by King in a lawsuit brought by the town council of the town of Watertown against the board in which King was joined as a necessary party. <em>Town Council </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. 55550 (February 20, 1981) (town council action).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There, the trial court concluded that King had not sufficiently alleged a claim under the indemnification statute and granted the motion to strike filed by the board. We found error. <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra. In reversing the trial court\u2019s action in <em>King, </em>we said: \u201cWe conclude that the legislature intended to make indemnification available to a board of education employee for losses sustained from claims or suits for damages, injunctive relief or both, resulting from any act of the employee performed \u2018in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of employment or under the direction of such board\u2019 <em>. \u201d </em>Id., 97. We set aside the judgment and remanded with direction to deny the motion to strike and for further proceedings. Id., 98. On remand, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of King and awarded attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $4499.19 plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Because King is seeking indemnification for legal expenses arising out of a suit for injunctive relief which resulted from his signing the November 5,1980 agreement, the only portion of \u00a7 10-235 that requires construction on the present appeal is whether King\u2019s legal fees were incurred while he \u201cwas acting . . . within the scope of employment or under the direction of the board of education.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 10-235. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>The trial court concluded that he was so acting. We agree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Our conclusion that King was \u201cacting . . . within the scope of [his] employment\u201d within the reach of \u00a7 10-235, while easy to state, requires, in its application, that we examine the factual circumstances that led to the present appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While occasionally cases may arise under \u00a7 10-235 in which an employee is so clearly within or without the scope of his employment that the question is one of law, in the greater number of cases the decision is a question of fact for the trier.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The memorandum of decision of February 20,1981, of the trial court, <em>Hull, J., </em>in the town council action, of which the trial court, <em>Gill, J., </em>in the present case took judicial notice, must serve as the starting point for our discussion. That decision states, inter alia: \u201cA basic social problem that rent the fabric of society in Watertown developed out of two actions of the Board beginning with the June, 1980 meeting and finalized at the next two monthly meetings.\u201d First, five longtime teachers who were department heads were replaced because they had not complied with statutory certification requirements. Second, at 1:30 a.m. at the June meeting of the board, without that question being on the agenda, William P. Williams, the \u201cpopular principal\u201d of the high school was transferred to a junior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>high school whose principal was in turn transferred to the high school. When these events took place, \u201call hell broke loose\u201d and the \u201cmanner in which the department head matter and particularly the Williams exchange was handled showed insensitivity to citizen reaction and public relations which helped precipitate the present imbroglio.\u201d King, who was a highly qualified educator and professional educational administrator, approved the removal of the \u201cuncertified department heads\u201d but recommended against the Williams transfer. King nevertheless became the \u201cfocal point of opposition to the Board\u2019s actions.\u201d \u201cThe degree of public anger and resentment against the Board and . . . King rose to an unprecedented high pitch and this continued to disrupt the entire educational process of the town of Watertown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">A citizens\u2019 group known as ARROW (Aroused Rabble Rousers of Oakville and Watertown) was the principal opponent of the board. From June, 1980, and thererafter, ARROW was \u201can extremely active and at times belligerent force in Watertown\u201d and \u201c[i]ts tactics at times seemed threatening to local officials. It had 200 regular members and could turn out 800 or 900 people at a town budget meeting. ARROW and its adherents were so fired up that they almost paralyzed the educational system in Watertown.\u201d Board opponents picketed the homes of board members and painted green arrows pointed toward homes of board members. Although nothing illegal was done by members of ARROW, \u201ca very high degree of personal, political and societal tension and animosity was ever present.\u201d Because of their resentment against the board, and particularly against the five member group which controlled the board, ARROW and its supporters \u201ceffectively blocked\u201d the adoption of the July 1,1980-June 30,1981 Watertown annual budget. On August 25, 1980, the town council adopted an interim budget for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the first ninety days of the new fiscal year and on November 25,1980, adopted a further sixty day interim budget. Both interim appropriations contained \u201cguidelines\u201d promulgated by the town council because of the austerity imposed by the lack of a budget. These \u201cguidelines\u201d were properly made known to the board and were in effect on November 5, 1980.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In June, 1980, and thereafter, the board was \u201calmost irreconcilably split 5-4\u201d on the Williams and department heads matters. The controlling group of five \u201cgenerally supported\u201d King while \u201csome members of the four man minority had reservations about him.\u201d As a result of the \u201cgreat public uproar,\u201d two members of the four member minority of the board solicited the help of Mark Shedd, the then state commissioner of education. Thereafter, Shedd sent Peter Adomeit to Water-town to act as a mediator.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Adomeit is an attorney who has mediated \u201cdozens of tense situations through the years . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Adomeit found a \u201chopelessly split Board with . . . King a lightning rod for community hostility.\u201d As the mediator, he felt that he had three objectives: \u201c(a) to defuse the situation and remove the threat of violence; (b) to protect the interests of the Board; [and] (c) to protect the interests of . . . King\u2019s professional advancement.\u201d Adomeit determined that it was \u201cimperative\u201d that King resign. He noted that King would have difficulty in securing another position at that time as superintendents are usually hired one year in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>No claim was ever made that grounds existed to remove King for cause. The five member majority of the board was not willing to attempt to fire King or seek his resignation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It remained willing to give him a new contract until the agreement of November 5, 1980, was reached. The majority of the board felt that it was necessary to provide <em>\u201ca </em>fair financial package\u201d to King if he would resign because \u201che was largely not responsible for the turmoil and would be suddenly terminated with no immediate employment prospects.\u201d The five member majority \u201cwas very much concerned about . . . King\u2019s family and his financial security.\u201d The four member minority agreed to the November 5, 1980 agreement because \u201cit felt that . . . King must go\u201d and it was concerned that if it did not agree with this agreement, \u201cthe majority would agree to give . . . King a longer contract than was achieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">At a special meeting on November 5,1980, the board unanimously approved an agreement worked out by Adomeit. That agreement included the renewal of King\u2019s one year contract and the tender by King of his resignation and the board\u2019s acceptance of the same. While the renewal of King\u2019s contract and his prompt resignation were arranged so that it might be easier for him to gain other employment, this had \u201clittle substance and probably contributed to the public reaction which occurred.\u201d The court found, however, that the board had acted in good faith in its approval of the agreement and \u201cwas acutely aware of and acted in direct response to the community response over the Board\u2019s actions and the widespread community demand that . . . King be ousted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Although \u201c[f]rom a purely financial viewpoint the agreement was an unusually generous one,\u201d there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201cmuch to be said on . . . King\u2019s behalf.\u201d King \u201cwas being forced out for reasons largely not of his doing.\u201d A majority of the board \u201cfelt that he should be reappointed,\u201d that his \u201creputation would be unfairly tarnished early in his career\u201d and that King \u201ccould make a strong claim that he was a mere scapegoat, caught in the crossfire between competing interests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Thereafter, on December 8, 1980, the town council brought an action against the board to enjoin the implementation of the November 5, 1980 agreement. <em>Town Council </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra. The board then moved to dismiss and strike the complaint in that the town council had failed to join King as a party \u201cnecessary and indispensable to the granting of the relief requested. ...\u201d The court then ordered King cited in as a party defendant. \u201cBecause he was cited in, [King] found it necessary to retain legal counsel to represent him . . . and, accordingly, incurred expenses for legal fees and other costs related to that action.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">After the remand ordered in <em>King, </em>the trial court, <em>Gill, J., </em>conducted an evidentiary hearing at which King and the chairperson of the board on November 5,1980, testified.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The parties agreed to the admission, as an exhibit, of Adomeit\u2019s testimony in the town council action which describes in great detail not only the grave problems he found in \u201cdeeply divided\u201d Watertown, but his evaluations, negotiations and recommendations leading to the November 5, 1980 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In this appeal, we must determine whether in the unusual circumstances of this case the interpretation to be given the \u201cwithin the scope of employment\u201d language, as used in \u00a7 10-235, legally justifies the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u201cThe fundamental objective of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>199 Conn. 667, 673, 509 A.2d 20 (1986); <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 57, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); see 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 58.06, p. 723. \u201cAs is true in every case involving the construction of a statute, our starting point must be the language employed by the legislature.\u201d <em>Verdon </em>v. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>187 Conn. 363, 366, 446 A.2d 3 (1982); <em>see Lundy Electronics &amp; Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>189 Conn. 690, 695, 458 A.2d 387 (1983). We may also look to the legislative history and the circumstances surrounding the statutory enactment and to legislative practice and policy. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 673-74. It is of some significance that the legislature did not define the phrase in question. The legislature wisely recognized the difficulty of composing a formula which would clearly demarcate the line between what is and what is not \u201cwithin the scope of employment\u201d and left each case to its own particular circumstances. See, e.g., 99 C.J.S. 676, Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 208. \u201cIn construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d <em>Stoni </em>v. <em>Wasicki, </em>179 Conn. 372, 376-77, 426 A.2d 774 (1979). Justice Cardozo once said: \u201cConsequences cannot alter statutes, but may help to fix their meaning. Statutes must be construed, if possible, that absurdity and mischief may be avoided.\u201d <em>In re Rouss, </em>221 N.Y. 81, 91, 116 N.E. 782 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">As we explicitly stated in <em>King, </em>since the first enactment in 1945 of the statute which has now become \u00a7 10-235 (a), \u201cthe protection afforded by the statute has been expanded frequently both with respect to the persons covered and the circumstances under which indemnification is available.\u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 95.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1973, this statute already protected those covered \u201cfrom financial loss or expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of <em>any </em>claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence . . . <em>or any other acts . . </em>. provided such . . . employee, at the time of the acts . . . was acting in the discharge of his duties <em>or . . </em>. under the direction of such board of education . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The encompassing \u201cor any other acts\u201d language was added expanding the protection and coverage of \u00a7 10-235 (a) in 1972.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See Public Acts 1972, No. 201, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u00a7 1. The phrase \u201cany other acts,\u201d albeit in another context and not controlling, has been said to include any act that is \u201cother,\u201d which means \u201cin addition to\u201d or \u201cdistinct from\u201d those acts already mentioned. See <em>In re Estate of Freshour, </em>177 Kan. 492, 280 P.2d 642 (1955). The word \u201cany\u201d has a diversity of meanings and may be used to indicate \u201call\u201d or \u201cevery\u201d as well as \u201csome\u201d or \u201cone\u201d and its meaning in a given statute depends upon the context and subject matter of the statute. <em>Donohue </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 550, 556, 235 A.2d 643 (1967); <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>81 Conn. 16, 21, 69 A. 1052 (1908). If that test is applied, it is apparent here that \u201cany\u201d means \u201call\u201d or \u201cevery.\u201d Not only do these words of the 1972 enactment impose no limitation but a 1973 amendment further broadens the scope of the statute by adding the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to infringement of any person's civil rights.\u201d See Public Acts 1973, No. 73-651, \u00a7 1.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This amendment under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>scores the broad legislative sweep of the term \u201cany other acts\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 10-235.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Further support for our conclusion can be found in the fact that the 1972 amendment also inserted the word \u201cor\u201d after \u201cduties\u201d in that portion of the statute which prior to that time had stated: \u201cprovided such . . . employee . . . was acting in the discharge of his duties within the scope of his employment or under the direction of such board of education . . . .\u201d The insertion of the additional disjunctive before \u201cwithin the scope of his employment,\u201d thereby placing that phrase between two disjunctives and separating it from the \u201cacting in the discharge of his duties\u201d phraseology served not only to create another alternative affording \u00a7 10-235 protection, but also arguably broadened the scope of employment ground because an employee no longer had to be \u201cacting in the discharge of his duties\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cwithin the scope of his employment.\u201d \u201cWhen changes have been introduced by amendment it is not to be assumed that they are without design.\u201d <em>City of Stamford </em>v. <em>Town of Stamford, </em>107 Conn. 596, 606, 141 A. 891 (1928); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 21 n.6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980); 1A J. Sutherland, supra, \u00a7 22.30, p. 265. Of course, the presumed change does not go any fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ther than that which is expressly declared or necessarily implied. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>supra; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Institute of Living, Inc., </em>175 Conn. 49, 63, 392 A.2d 491 (1978). In any event, the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d added in 1972 appears to have been intentionally used with its alternative significance and not, carelessly, as conjunctive. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Egan, </em>135 Conn. 102, 105, 60 A.2d 922 (1948). Its use indicates a clear legislative intent of separability. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pascucci, </em>164 Conn. 69, 72, 316 A.2d 750 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Additional support for our conclusion can be found in the interpretation of the phrase \u201cwithin the scope of employment\u201d in the context of the workers\u2019 compensation statute. Although the workers\u2019 compensation cases are not controlling on the issue before us, they are, nevertheless, instructive for at least two reasons. First, in those cases, statutory coverage does not require that the compensable injury result when the employee is acting solely or only for the benefit of the employer. See, e.g., <em>Dombach </em>v. <em>Olkon Corporation, </em>163 Conn. 216, 302 A.2d 270 (1972); <em>Marks\u2019 Dependents </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>251 N.Y. 90, 93-94, 167 N.E. 181 (1929) (Cardozo, J.). Second, unlike \u00a7 10-235, the workers\u2019 compensation statute provides that a personal injury is compensable when it is one \u201carising out of <em>and </em>in the course of [the employee\u2019s] employment . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The terms \u201carising out of\u201d and \u201cin the course of\u201d set out a \u201ctwo-part test\u201d and each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>must be demonstrated by the claimant. <em>McNamara </em>v. <em>Hamden, </em>176 Conn. 547, 550, 398 A.2d 1161 (1979); see <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Lemieux, </em>179 Conn. 501, 427 A.2d 397 (1980). As we have noted, \u00a7 10-235 sets forth three disjunctive circumstances where attorney\u2019s fees may be recoverable, i.e., \u201cin the discharge of [the employee\u2019s] duties <em>or </em>within the scope of employment <em>or </em>under the direction of [the] board of education . . . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) While we have no doubt that \u201cwithin the scope of his employment\u201d means that the legal injury must be incurred by an employee of a board of education and that the legal injury must be causally connected to that employment; see <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>Niejadlik, </em>175 Conn. 424, 399 A.2d 1256 (1978); the three disjunctive bases set out in \u00a7 10-235, fairly read, indicate a standard not quite as strict as that for workers\u2019 compensation under \u00a7 31-284 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The board argues that the trial court erred in its \u201cexclusive reliance on the \u2018course of employment\u2019 standard under the workers\u2019 compensation statute\u201d when it more appropriately should have considered \u201cthe purpose of \u00a7 10-235 to protect employees when acting in their employee capacities.\u201d It also maintains that \u201c[n]otwithstanding the fact that King was [s]uperintendent of [s]chools when he signed the severance agreement, he could not have been acting as [superintendent, but as an individual severing his employment relationship with [the board] on terms which were in the agreement only to satisfy [his] personal financial demands.\u201d Without any such finding by the trial court and without any request for further articulation, the board asserts that it is admitted that no agreement would have been concluded in the absence of these financial terms. We note, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>to the contrary, that the testimony of King at the remand hearing would have supported a finding, if one had been made, that a satisfactory financial arrangement for him was not the sole reason for his signing the agreement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The board\u2019s argument that King was acting individually and not as superintendent when he signed the November 5,1980 agreement lacks merit. It is true that the word \u201csuperintendent\u201d does not appear along with his signature on this agreement. But it is also true that that very agreement plainly sets out that the board had \u201cvoted to renew the contract of [King] as [superintendent of [s]chools in Watertown for the academic year 1981-1982 ...\u201d and his signing that agreement recited the tender of \u201chis resignation of [his] employment with the Board ...\u201d and the board\u2019s acceptance of that resignation. It is patently unrealistic to argue that the board was dealing with King as an individual when we consider the \u201ctumultuous events facing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>town\u201d with the town \u201c[facing] a true crisis of unprecedented proportions\u201d that brought both the full board and King to enter the agreement of November 5,1980. When King signed the agreement, he had valuable contractual rights that he was not required to waive. These rights included the remainder of his term under his original contract, as well as a new one year term as superintendent for 1981-1982. Moreover, the execution of this agreement was not, as the board argues, on terms \u201cwhich were in the agreement only to satisfy King\u2019s personal financial demands.\u201d What we have already set out and the agreement itself discloses is that the board, and indeed the town of Watertown, also benefited by the agreement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The causal connection of the agreement to King\u2019s status as an employee of the board is obvious. There is no finding that King\u2019s motivations in signing the agreement with the board were solely personal; the executed agreement involved benefits to both the board and King and it also involved concessions by both parties. The best interests of the^educational system of the town of Watertown and of the town itself in successfully negotiating for the termination of the employer-employee relationship constituted strong links in forging the necessary causal connection in what both parties perceived as a mutual agreement terminating that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In the town council action, King was not an adversary of the board, but a codefendant and, significantly, not a nominal defendant. Under all the circumstances, the town council action has to be viewed as an attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>to enjoin the implementation of an agreement between the board and King entered into while King was employed by the board and which the parties, both represented by counsel, negotiated concerning one basic matter\u2014the continuation of the employer-employee relationship. The town council did not prevail and there is no appeal pending in that case. Basically, concerned as the town council was with King\u2019s continuing status as superintendent of schools, the November 5, 1980 agreement was effected when King was a board employee and was causally connected with his status as an employee. Because the agreement was significantly connected with his employment, the challenged activity was \u201cwithin the scope of [King\u2019s] employment\u201d as required by \u00a7 10-235.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Our conclusion accords with the purpose of \u00a7 10-235. In 1972, the statute was amended to include the \u201cor any other acts\u201d language. In addressing this expansive language, proceedings on the Senate floor indicated that this amendment \u201cwould include acts which are not wanton, reckless or malicious and would cover more than just accident or negligence [sic] type of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>brought against them.\u201d 15 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1972 Sess., p. 2280, remarks of Senator James J. Murphy, Jr. We therefore disagree with the board\u2019s argument that King\u2019s conduct, vis-a-vis his execution of the November 5,1980 agreement, was not within the scope of his employment and not an act that \u00a7 10-235 intended to encompass.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The board also claims that the trial court erroneously awarded King statutory interest under General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The allowance of interest as an element of damages is primarily an equitable determination within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Bertozzi </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>164 Conn. 463, 467, 323 A.2d 553 (1973). On this record, we see no reasonable ground upon which to find an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-235 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Each board of education shall protect and save harmless any member of such board or any teacher or other employee thereof or any member of its supervisory or administrative staff, and the state board of education, the board of governors of higher education, the board of trustees of each state institution and each state agency which employs any teacher, and the managing board of any public school, as defined in section 10-183b, shall protect and save harmless any member of such boards, or any teacher or other employee thereof or any member of its supervisory or administrative staff employed by it, from financial loss and expense, including legal fees and costs, if any, arising out of any claim, demand, suit or judgment by reason of alleged negligence or other act resulting in accidental bodily injury to or death of any person, or in accidental damage to or destruction of property, within or without the person, or in accidental damage to or destruction of property, within or without the school building, or any other acts, including but not limited to infringement of any person\u2019s civil rights, resulting in any injury, which acts are not wanton, reckless or malicious, provided such teacher, member or employee, at the time of the acts resulting in such injury, damage or destruction, was acting in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of employment or under the direction of such board of education . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\"> The trial court in the present appeal, <em>Gill, J., </em>took judicial notice of this case.

First, the determination as to what is within the scope of employment is initially a fact-bound determination. Second, we must take note of this evidence because the board charges that in deciding the issue the trial court below ignored certain evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> Judge Hull found that two of these \u201cguidelines\u201d or \u201cexpenditure rules\u201d were violated by one paragraph of the November 5, 1980 agreement between the board and King.

This argument is rejected for several reasons. First, the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision explicitly recognizes that the board was claiming that, in signing the November 5, 1980 agreement, King acted \u201csolely in an individual capacity and for individual reasons and, therefore, falls outside the parameters of General Statutes Section 10-235.\u201d Second, a fair reading of the transcript of King\u2019s testimony discloses that the evidence on his motivations and reasons for sign<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ing the agreement required an evaluation by the trier of the extent to which his signing was based on personal interests and the best interests of the school system. Third, although the trial court\u2019s memorandum indicates that it made very few findings of fact, the court file discloses that the board did not seek an articulation of that decision. Practice Book \u00a7 4051 (formerly \u00a7 3082). Fourth, given the presumption that judicial acts and duties have been duly and regularly performed, there is nothing before us to demonstrate that the trial court ignored the evidence involved.

Initially, <em>Kearney </em>and the case before us are completely different factually. In <em>Kearney, </em>the plaintiff sought indemnification for his legal expenses under General Statutes \u00a7 10-235 after he had successfully defended an action brought against him by the board of education seeking his termination for his disciplining of a student. In the present appeal, the board and King were codefendants and not adversaries, as in <em>Kearney. </em>In addition, the <em>Kearney </em>court states that the \u201cquestion posed by the facts of this case is whether the paying of expenses or loss is intended by the statute to cover those paid by the teacher [Kearney] to defend himself against the Board\u2019s charges (whether he or it initiates the process) as opposed to a third person\u2019s charges.\u201d It is thus apparent that <em>Kearney, </em>fairly read, at least seems to recognize that \u00a7 10-235 can apply when a covered employee incurs such expenses in defending against an action instituted by a third party, which is the posture of the case before us. Its persuasiveness on the issue on the present appeal is, therefore, attenuated by its dissimilarities to the present matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b355-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a provides: \u201crate recoverable AS DAMAGES. Except as provided in sections 37-3b and 52-192a, interest at the rate of ten per cent a year, and no more, may be recovered and allowed in civil actions or arbitration proceedings under chapter 909, including actions to recover money loaned at a greater rate, as damages for the detention of money after it becomes payable except as otherwise provided with respect to demand obligations in section 42a-3-122 (4) (a). Judgment may be given for the recovery of taxes assessed and paid upon the loan, and the insurance upon the estate mortgaged to secure the loan, whenever the borrower has agreed in writing to pay such taxes or insurance or both. Whenever the maker of any contract is a resident of another state or the mortgage security is located in another state, any obligee or holder of such contract, residing in this state, may lawfully recover any agreed rate of interest or damages on such contract until it is fully performed, not exceeding the legal rate of interest in the state where such contract purports to have been made or such mortgage security is located.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\"> The trial court, <em>Gill, J., </em>refused to award King punitive damages.
