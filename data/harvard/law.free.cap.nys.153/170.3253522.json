Where th\u00e9 acts are distinctly pointed out, plaintiff should not be made to attempt what is hardly possible, namely, to differentiate those which he did as an individual from acts committed as an officer of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Had the plaintiff pleaded that, in consequence of his arrest and prosecution, he had lost certain customers, he might have to give the names thereof. But the averment that plaintiff \u201cwas greatly injured in hi's good name and credit among merchants in the city of New York and elsewhere, and also among his friends and acquaintances,\u201d is an allegation of general damage. Evans v. Metropolitan Street R. Co., 47 App. Div. 511, 513, 62 N. Y. Supp. 495. It does not say that any one has refused to trade with plaintiff, or has declined to extend him credit in any transaction. Particulars of such general damage are not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">The order denying motion for a further bill of particulars is therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
