This roof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>sloped inward toward the center, forming a well or depression. De-. fendant had a low wall extending along its line abutting on the plain- ' tiff\u2019s premises. A leader was arranged to carry off water from this well. The complaint stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\">\u201cThat at various times between the 1st and 6th days of July, 1914, the leader on defendant\u2019s premises which drained the roof thereof became choked and clogged with refuse and rubbish and failed to carry of\u00a3 the water. That as a result thereof, and on the 1st and 5th days of July, 1914, the water collected in the well or depression in the center of said roof caused by the slope thereof, overflowed the wall of the defendant\u2019s premises and percolated through the walls of the plaintiff\u2019s building into the various floors thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-6\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> Defendant\u2019s demurrer to this has been overruled. Such an arrangement of the roof, so as to gather water into a central depression, which may run over and be discharged upon an adjoining building, manifestly threatening legal harm to the neighbor, requires a degree of care measured by the danger. And this duty applied especially to the leader, which seems to be all under defendant\u2019s control and supplied the only safe exit for the water thus collected. That such an escape pipe had become choked and clogged with refuse and rubbish, and so failed to let the water out, was an allegation which called on defendant to explain, and to show how this rainwater was impounded, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s performance of its duties. A complaint which states facts that give rise to a duty is not defective, if it omit the conclusion of law to be drawn from the facts set forth. Case v. Carroll, 35 N. Y. 385, 391; 29 Cyc. 567. Besides the facts pleaded, a demurrer also admits other facts that may be implied by fair intendment. Sage v. Culver, 147 N. Y. 241, 41 N. E. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> We think, therefore, that this complaint showed such a duty towards plaintiff as to call on defendant to answer. 40 Cyc. 651. On demurrer, the court is not in a position to determine whether defendant\u2019s roof depression and the leader therefrom called for ordinary care, or if the danger from water so collected was such as to impose on defendant a higher requirement not to inflict injury on the premises adjoining. Fitzpatrick v. Welch, 174 Mass. 486, 55 N. E. 178, 48 L. R. A. 278; Jutte v. Hughes, 67 N. Y. 267, 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The order overruling the demurrer should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">THOMAS, CARR, and RICH, JJ\u201e concur. JENKS, P. J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
