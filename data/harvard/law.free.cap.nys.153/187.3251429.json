To the complaint, defendant had interposed a demurrer, which was overruled, and a formal order entered thereon; the judge who rendered the decision writing an opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> It appears that the trustee had been authorized by the federal court to continue the business; also to raise money on receiver\u2019s certificates \u201cfor the use of the trustee in the continuance and operation of the business of the said bankrupt.\u201d The judge who overruled the demurrer was of opinion\u2014in which I agree with him\u2014that the decision in Re Erie Lumber Co. (D. C.) 150 Fed. 817, was decisive of the interpretation of this order, to the effect that the authority of the trustee to continue the business was dependent on raising the money for that purpose by means of receiver\u2019s certificates. At all events, the decision overruling the demurrer is the law of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Defendant thereafter interposed an answer, which, so far as meeting the decision on the demurrer goes, sets out substantially that plaintiffs were creditors of the bankrupt and themselves joined in authorizing the defendant-trustee to continue the business <em>on credit. </em>Of this there was no proof. The judgment dismissing the complaint, therefore, was in plain disregard of the law of the case as settled on demurrer, and the judgment must therefore be reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
