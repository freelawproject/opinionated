The alleged term of employment was from June 17, 1914, to August 17, 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Plaintiff bases his claim of a definite agreement for a salary of $25 per week upon an interview with Mr. Huntley, the president of the defendant corporation. It appears from his testimony that he showed that officer a pencil memorandum containing his proposed terms of hiring; that thereupon Mr. Huntley stated that later he would prepare an agreement. No written agreement, however, was ever prepared or executed. Even assuming that there was a contract of employment, as asserted by the plaintiff, it was terminated on July 9, 1914. Hence the plaintiff was entitled to receive thereafter only the commissions earned by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Upon his discharge, unless he was willing to work under the terms of the contract proposed by Mr. Ri\u00f1es, the defendant\u2019s, agent, the plain- . tiff was bound to cease work, and if he were improperly discharged, his remedy was a suit for damages; these damages in this case would be limited to wages for one week.
