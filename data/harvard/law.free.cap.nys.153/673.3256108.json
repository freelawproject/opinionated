The wagon, which was drawn by one horse and was of the closed type, was loaded with barrels and other receptacles filled with vegetables, and according to plaintiff\u2019s estimate weighed altogether about eight tons. The plaintiff was sitting on the seat in front, beside his father, who was driving. The wagon was going north on the east side of Second avenue, on which there are two lines of track, one running north and the other south. When at about Thirty-Sixth street, where it was their intention to cross, the direction of the wagon having already been turned to the west, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, both he and his father looked to see if the road was clear, and plaintiff saw the car a little to the north of Thirty-Fifth street coming \u201cpretty fast.\u201d Without halting or changing the course of the wagon, which continued on its way, and just as it was \u201cabout to get on the track,\u201d plaintiff looked again and saw the car about the distance of \u201cthree pillars\u201d of the elevated road away, and plaintiff then told his father \u201cto go ahead.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Plaintiff again looked when the car -was 125 feet away, its speed apparently unchanged. At this time the horse or some part of the wagon was on the'track, and plaintiff Jold his father \u201cto whip the horse, that the car was coming.\u201d Thus urged, the horse \u201ctried all\u2019he could, with the heavy load he had,\u201d and had succeeded in drawing all but the \u201cback part\u201d of the wagon clear of the track when it was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> On this state of facts the case cannot be distinguished from a number of cases where recovery has been denied on the ground of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence-. Netterfield v. N. Y. City Ry. Co., 129 App. Div. 56, 113 N. Y. Supp. 434; Litzour v. N. Y. City Ry. Co., 116 App. Div. 477, 101 N. Y. Supp. 990; Clancy v. Troy &amp; Lansingburgh R. R. Co., 88 Hun, 496, 34 N. Y. Supp. 877. The court charged that the contributory negligence, if any, of the plaintiff\u2019s father, who drove the wagon, was not attributable to plaintiff. The plaintiff not only was fully aware of the danger to be apprehended from the approaching car, but was an active participant in directing the movements of the wagon. Under these circumstances he is chargeable with the negligence of his father. Brickell v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 120 N. Y. 290, 24 N. E. 449, 17 Am. St. Rep. 648; Donnelly v. Brooklyn City R. R. Co., 109 N. Y. 16, 22, 15 N. E. 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The judgment should be reversed, with costs, the complaint dismissed, with costs, and the finding that the plaintiff was free from contributory negligence is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">INGRAHAM, P. J\u201e and CLARKE and SCOTT, JJ., concur. DOWLING, J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
