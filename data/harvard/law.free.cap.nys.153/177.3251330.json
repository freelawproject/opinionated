The complaint, after alleging that the horse was of a vicious disposition, known to the defendant, sets forth article 6, section 1, of the Traffic Rules of the Police Department, which provides, in substance, that no horse shall be left unattended in any street or highway unless securely fastened or unless the wheels of the vehicle are so chained or fastened as to prevent it from being dragged. The complaint further alleges that defendant\u2019s horse at the time of the accident had been left unattended and the wheels unfastened.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> Although it is true that an action based upon the keeping of a vicious animal is not one strictly in negligence (see Hunter v. Metropolitan Co., 50 Misc. Rep. 158, 98 N. Y. Supp. 234), nevertheless, the liability of the owner is \u201cin a certain sense based upon negligence\u201d which, after proof of ownership and scienter, is presumed. Muller v. McKesson, 73 N. Y. 195, 199, 200, 29 Am. Rep. 123. I do not think therefore that, as matter of pleading, it can be successfully maintained that the complaint in the case at bar sets forth two causes of action. But, in any event, neither the theory nor the facts upon which a recovery might be based involve any inconsistent position so as to warrant the compelling of an election, and certainly not before the evidence was all in. See Tuthill v. Skidmore, 124 N. Y. 155, 26 N. E. 348; Mayo v. Knowlton, 134 N. Y. 250, 252, 31 N. E. 985; Seymour v. Lorillard, 51 N. Y. Super. Ct. 399. The plaintiff emphasizes his reliance upon negligence as a basis for recovery by the allegation of the complaint that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">\u201cSolely by reason of the negligence and improper conduct of the defendant, * * * as heretofore alleged, the plaintiff was injured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Nevertheless, the learned court below, over plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception, compelled plaintiff to elect whether to proceed on the \u201ctheory\u201d of maintaining a vicious horse or the violation of a municipal regulation. Plaintiff elected the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"AqS\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that the regulation plainly refers to the prevention of the running away of horses and was not framed or designed to meet the contingency disclosed in the case at bar, and, inferentially, I assume, therefore, that the violation of the ordinance was immaterial. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>perfectly evident that the requirement of this ordinance in the alternative, namely, either that the horse be fastened or that the wheels of the vehicle be blocked, would not have been violated by defendant if the latter alternative had been adopted. Yet that could not by any possibility have prevented the accident which is the basis of this suit. In this respect the case is clearly distinguishable from Kelley v. N. Y. State Rys., <em>207 </em>N. Y. 342, 100 N. E. 1115. See, also, Fluker v. Ziegele Brewing Co., 201 N. Y. 40, 43, 93 N. E. 1112, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 793. In this view, it is apparent that defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been granted. But that very consideration only brings into clearer relief the error committed in compelling plaintiff to elect.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> Strange to say, toward the conclusion of its case, the defendant insisted on offering proof that the animal was gentle, and plaintiff objected on the ground that he was proceeding on a violation of an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The only maintainable cause of action stated in the complaint is one for the keeping of a vicious animal and the consequent negligence of the defendant, and defendant was erroneously prevented from introducing proof on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
