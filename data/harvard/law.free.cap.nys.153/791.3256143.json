A motor car, passing along this road, met the defendant\u2019s team, which had no lights, so that the two vehicles collided. The shaft of the cart passed through the motor car\u2019s windshield, injuring the driver and another in the car. The evidence warranted the jury in finding that the accident was because defendant drove on the wrong side of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-18\">Was this a violation of section 43 of the Penal Law? This is the familiar provision which makes a misdemeanor any willful act which seriously injures the property of another, or which disturbs the public peace or health, or outrages public decency, for which no other punishment is expressly prescribed. This defendant negligently drove on the wrong side of the highway, which resulted in injury to person and property. But this section of the Penal Law requires that the injuring act shall be \u201cwillful.\u201d There must exist an intention designedly and purposely to cause injury. Not every intentional act is willful. It must be with wrongful purpose, or with a design to injure another, or one committed out of mere wantonness or lawlessness. Wass v. Stephens, 128 N. <em>Y. 123, </em>128, 28 N. E. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Driving on the left side of the highway is not a nuisance, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>does not violate section 1530 of the Penal Law. The conviction in People v. Darragh, 141 App. Div. 408, 126 N. Y. Supp. 522, cited on this point, is not applicable. Darragh was operating a motor car at high speed in a closely built up section of the city. He drove into a crowd of boys and killed one. He was rightly convicted, since his excessive speed was a misdemeanor (Highway Law, \u00a7 291), giving to his act of running down the boy the character of manslaughter (Penal Law, \u00a7 1050, subd. 1). But driving on the left side of a road is not a misdemeanor. It subjects the offender only to a civil penalty of $5, to be recovered by the party injured, in addition to the damages caused by such violation. Highway Law, \u00a7 332. Modern traffic conditions upon country roads at night may well call for more strict regulations to prevent collision, but this consideration is for the Legislature. A civil penalty having been affixed for driving on the wrong side of the road, that infraction is not subject to prosecution under the Penal Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The judgment of conviction of the Court of Special Sessions, and order of the County Court of Nassau County, affirming said conviction, should therefore be reversed, and the defendant discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
