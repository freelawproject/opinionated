If such a \u201cdefense\u201d may prevail, the city ordinances are so much waste paper. With a valid ordinance such as this, the only issue in a suit for a penalty is whether the ordinance was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-18\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> This electric sign ordinance is reasonable and perfectly plain. It provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-19\">\u201cNo electric sign shall be maintained in the city of New York contrary to the provisions of this ordinance under a penalty of $10 a day for each day or part of a day the same shall be so maintained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-20\">It provides a plain and simple method of obtaining a license. The ordinance was approved July 24, 1912, the sign then existing, and defendant\u2019s application for a license is dated September 26, 1913, and was issued September 29, 1913. The comment of the Appellate Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>in City of New York v. Hewitt, 91 App. Div. 446, 86 N. Y. Supp. 833, is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">\u201cIf, then, this judgment can be sustained at all, it must be upon the ground that the court may, as matter of benignity, suspend the operation of the ordinance against an individual. The court had no power of dispensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">GUY, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b48-8\">PENDLETON, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Anr\">I dissent on the ground that that part of an ordinance which imposes from the adoption of the ordinance a per diem penalty on the maintenance, without a license, of all existing signs, previously duly authorized, irrespective of whether good, bad, or indifferent, or dangerous or not, before reasonable opportunity to acquire a license, is so unreasonable that it is invalid as an exercise of the police power. The unreasonableness is not to be determined by what has been, but what may be, done under it. City of Rochester v. West, 164 N. Y. 510, 514, 58 N. E. 673, 53 L. R. A. 548, 79 Am. St. Rep. 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
