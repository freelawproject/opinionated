Plaintiffs introduced evidence, however, that, about seven months after the purchase of the furs, defendant made a payment to plaintiff. This payment defendant claims was on account of a bill for repairs to other furs. Plaintiffs claim it was on account of the bill in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">The evidence shows that bills for the furs in question were sent to each of the sons as well as to the defendant. Defendant testified that she never received any bill for the furs, and was never informed that they had been charged to her account, until six months after the furs had been taken away from her by her son George. There is no convincing evidence of ratification by defendant with knowledge of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">Under objection and exception of defendant\u2019s counsel, the court permitted plaintiffs\u2019 witness to give evidence of declarations made by defendant\u2019s son George, in the absence of defendant, as to his agency and his authority to purchase' furs for defendant\u2019s account. The admission of this evidence was reversible error; it being established by all the authorities that declarations of an agent as to his agency, in the absence of the principal,, are not binding upon the principal. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>court also erred in excluding the deposition of the defendant\u2019s son Herbert Salinger as to the circumstances attending the receipt of the furs as evidence tending to negative the claim that defendant, with knowledge of the facts, had ratified the act of her son George in purchasing the furs.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u25a0 Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
