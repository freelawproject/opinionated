The finding of the jury that there was such a defective plank, and that the accident occurred in the way described by the plaintiff, is against the overwhelming weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Such finding, and the judgment and order appealed from, should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
