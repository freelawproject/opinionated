The plaintiff then proceeded to tax the costs on appeal, and from an order entered at Special Term of the City Court, striking out the costs, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-18\">In the case of La Rosa v. Wilner, 54 Misc. Rep. 574, 104 N. Y. Supp. 952, this court decided, upon almost identical facts, that \u201csubdi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>vision 5 of section 3228, supra, has no application whatever to the costs given a prevailing party on appeal,\u201d citing section 3237 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which is contained in the same article (title 1, art. 1, c. 21) with section 3228, and states: \u201cThe foregoing sections of this article do not affect the recovery of costs upon an appeal.\u201d The learned justice at Special Term, in granting the order, relied upon the cases of People ex rel. Shiels v. Greene, 114 App. Div. 168, 99 N. Y. Supp. 679; and Miller v. City of Buffalo, 129 App. Div. 833, 113 N. Y. Supp. 1056. Neither of these cases, however, is a case within title 1, art. 1, c. 21, of the Code of Civil Procedure, and affected by the provisions of section 3237 thereof, quoted above; and the former case follows Snyder v. Collins, 12 Hun, 383, which was decided prior to the enactment of section 3237, supra. In a case not governed by section 3237 it is well settled that, \u201cwhere a new trial is granted with costs to abide the event,\u201d the event contemplated is one which determines that the successful party is by law entitled to costs. Snyder v. Collins, 12 Hun, 383; People ex rel. Shiels v. Greene, supra. But it is impossible, in construing the provisions of section 3228 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, to overlook the express stipulation\" that they \u201cdo not affect the recovery of costs upon an appeal.\u201d If the effect of section 3228 is removed from consideration of costs on appeal, the plaintiff, being successful in the action is entitled to recover the costs of the appeal given \u201cto abide the event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The order appealed from is accordingly reversed, with costs. The plaintiff is not, however, entitled to the item of $25, taxed pursuant to section 3251, subd. 3, of the Code of Civil Procedure, for \u201cproceedings after granting a new trial,\u201d which item must be stricken from the bill of costs on appeal as taxed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
