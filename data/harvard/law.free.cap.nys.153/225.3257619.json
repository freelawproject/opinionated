The complaint failed to allege a publication of the description, specimen, or fac simile of the trade-mark, or label, or other private mark, as provided in that section, and the complaint was therefore dismissed. This was error. The statute provides penalties in three classes of cases: (1) For filling any bottle with, etc., or selling, or offering to sell therefrom, any article or substance other than the original contents. (2) For removing, defacing, or obliterating any brand, trade-mark, etc., impressed, stamped, or blown into the substance of the vessel or-receptacle. (3) For using, trafficking, etc., or refusing to return any vessel, etc., branded, or stamped, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">In the first case publication is not required. In the last two it is. This case belongs to the first class, and publication was not required. In Haslinghuis et al. v. Hencken, Harren &amp; Co., 143 N. Y. Supp. 1094, this question was apparently not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
