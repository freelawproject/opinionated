It demands damages accruing to it from such action and such conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">There is no affirmative defense set up in the answer. The moving affidavit, upon which the order for the examination of plaintiff was obtained, clearly shows that the defendants desire to disprove by plaintiff all the allegations of plaintiff which it must establish in order to make out its prima facie case. Obviously there is merely an attempt to cross-examine plaintiff on its own case before trial. This may not be done. Siede v. Newkirk, 148 App. Div. 864, 133 N. Y. Supp. 623, is precisely in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the order for examination be granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
