J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao6\">This is an appeal from an order that reverses the ruling and decision of the county treasurer of Nassau county, grants, the application of the relator for the issuance of a liquor tax certificate, and requires the county treasurer, acting as deputy excise commissioner of the state, to issue such certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">\u2018 The proceeding was begun by petition for a writ of certiorari. It was addressed to the honorable County Court of Nassau county. The order for the writ is entitled at a Special Term of the County Court held in and for the county of Nassau, with the statement that the county judge of that county was \u201cpresent,\u201d and contains the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>sion that the court hereby in its discretion dispenses with notice of application for the writ. The writ requires return to the County Court of the county of Nassau at a Special Term, that the action of the county treasurer may be reviewed, and that \u201cthis court\u201d (i. e., the County Court) may act thereon. The order appealed from is made at a Special Term of the County Court, held in and for the county of Nassau at the county courthouse, whereat the county judge was \u201cpresent,\u201d recites the action of \u201cthe court\u201d in the matter, was marked \u201cEnter\u201d by the county judge, and the clerk thereupon certifies that it was \u201cGranted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">I think that this order must be regarded as one granted by the County Court, and not made by the county judge (People ex rel. Cecere v. Slocum, 161 App. Div. 733, 146 N. Y. Supp. 556), and that therefore, upon the authority of this case, it must be reversed. There is a distinction that must be regarded as substantial between the statutory powers vested in a court and conferred upon a judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The order of the County Court of Nassau County is reversed, with \u2022 $10 costs and disbursements, and the writ of certiorari is dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
