That he had received $500 on account and demanded payment of the balance. That defendant\u2019s president did not deny the balance was owing the plaintiff, but asked him to wait \u201cuntil we get on our feet and we will pay you. We will settle up with you.\u201d That the balance was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Defendant\u2019s counsel on cross-examination of plaintiff put in evidence his receipt given to the defendant, for $500, \u201cbeing commission on sale of\u201d the property in question, and also defendant\u2019s check given to plaintiff in payment of this sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The plaintiff then rested his case, and the defendant moved to dismiss \u2022on the ground:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cThat the receipt signed and the check paid is an accord and satisfaction in full payment of all commissions to be paid on sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">There was no ruling on this motion, and the defendant rested without putting in any evidence, and then moved for the direction of a verdict on the ground that the commission had been paid, which motion was granted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The direction of a verdict is error fatal to the judgment. There was no question of accord and satisfaction in the case, because the plaintiff\u2019s claim was for a liquidated amount, and there was no evidence of any dispute between the parties as to the sum which should be paid, or that the $500 was a receipt in full discharge of the demand Ryan v. Ward, 48 N. Y. 204, 8 Am. Rep. 539; Fuller v. Kemp, 133 N. Y. 231, 33 N. E. 1034, 20 L. R. A. 785; Komp v. Raymond, 175 N. Y. 102, 67 N. E. 113. The receipt did not contradict the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to the agreed compensation for his services, that he had made demand for the balance, that the defendant promised to pay it, but had breached its contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant .to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
