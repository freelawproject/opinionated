As part consideration for the exchange the defendant agreed to assign a second mortgage of $6,000, secured by premises <em>777 </em>Prospect avenue, having about three years to run. The contract is silent as to the rate of interest on this second mortgage. It appears, however, that the mortgage, which by its terms was payable on the 1st day of March, 1916, bore interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum. On May 1, 1913, the exchange was consummated, and the parties then agreed that, in consideration of the closing of title, the defendant should \u201cpay to the Benenson Realty Company, or its assigns, upon the interest days set forth in the said mortgage, 1 per cent, of the said principal sum during the existence of the said mortgage from the date hereof.\u201d There\u00e1fter, and on August 1, 1914, the mortgage was foreclosed for nonpayment of interest, and the plaintiff thereupon began this action to recover from the defendant the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>sum of $170, being 1 per cent, on the amount of the mortgage from May 1, 1913, till March 1,1916, the date when the mortgage by its terms was to become due. At the time it was conceded that the defendant had paid interest till May 1, 1914, and she conceded that she owed the plaintiff 1 per cent, interest, amounting to $25, from that date till August 1, 1914, when the mortgage was foreclosed. The learned trial justice, however, held that the defendant had agreed to pay 1 per cent, interest on the amount secured by the mortgage until March 1, 1916, regardless of whether or not the mortgage was previously foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">In my opinion the interpretation which the trial justice has placed upon the defendant\u2019s obligation is not borne out by the written agreement. The defendant might have made a promise to pay 1 per cent, interest till the due date of the mortgage, but she did not do so. She agreed to pay the excess interest \u201cduring the existence of the said mortgage,\u201d and when the foreclosure was completed the mortgage ceased to exist and became merged in the judgment. Thereafter no sums, either of principal or interest, were payable under the mortgage, but all rights of the parties to the mortgage became fixed by the judgment. Consequently, by the plain terms of the defendant\u2019s agreement her obligation to pay interest on the sum secured by the mortgage during its \u201cexistence\u201d was terminated. This contract is not only plain on its face, but it apparently secured to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor exactly what it intended to obtain. The parties evidently contemplated that the existing 5 per cent, mortgage should in effect be changed to a 6 per cent, mortgage, and the defendant should pay the additional 1 per cent. When, however, the plaintiff elected to declare the whole sum due for nonpayment of interest, then no further interest was payable under the mortgage, but interest at the rate of 6 per cent, was payable under the judgment, and consequently thereafter the plaintiff\u2019s right to interest was not affected by the rate fixed in the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Judgment modified, by reducing the same to the sum of $25 damages, with appropriate costs in the court below, and, as thus modified, affirmed, with costs of appeal to the appellant; costs of appeal to be set off against the judgment. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
