The realty is situate in the county of New York. It appears that the representations were made, the negotiations were conducted, and transactions Were carried out in that county. It appears that all of the parties are engaged in business therein, that the office of the plaintiffs, as executors, is therein, and that all of the participants in the negotiations who are the supposed or proposed witnesses, of whom many are specified, are engaged in business in the said county.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">The sole justification for the venue of the county of Kings is the residence of one of the plaintiffs. Even as to him, it is not alleged that he is to be a witness, and the allegation of the moving affidavit that he had nothing to do with the transactions involved in this action is not denied. We think that the motion should have been granted, under the authority of Jacobs v. Davis, 65 App. Div. 144, <em>72 </em>N. Y. Supp. 558, Archer v. McIlravy, 86 App. Div. 512-514, 83 N. Y. Supp. 727, Lufty v. Sullivan, 119 App. Div. 506, 104 N. Y. Supp. 177, Pinkus v. United Cloak &amp; Suit Co., 124 App. Div. 535-536, 108 N. Y. Supp. 932, and Jacina v. Lemmi, 155 App. Div. 397, 139 N. Y. Supp. 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Some of the witnesses named by the defendants are experts. The respondents contend that their convenience is not to be considered. This is not the rule when experts are to testify from personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>knowledge (as we may infer in this case), and not from an assumed state of facts. Groff v. Rome Metallic Bedstead Co., 98 App. Div. 152-154, 90 N. Y. Supp. 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
