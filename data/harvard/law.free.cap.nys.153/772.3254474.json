The complaint was dismissed upon the merits, upon the ground that the plaintiff, upon discovery of the fraud, failed to promptly disaffirm the purchase, but instead ratified and confirmed it. From this judgment, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">In December, 1907, the plaintiff purchased from the defendant, who was president of the Indian Refining Company, 130 shares of its stock. The complaint alleges, and the learned trial justice found upon sufficient evidence, that the plaintiff was induced to make this purchase upon defendant\u2019s fraudulent representation that a dividend had been declared for the year 1907, which would be paid on February 15, 1908, to those who were stockholders of record on December 31, 1907. Shortly after the purchase the plaintiff received from the Refining Company a notice of the declaration of a 10 per cent, dividend for the year 1907, and on February 17, 1908, he and his assignor received two checks of the Refining Company, aggregating $1,300, indorsed \u201cDividend No. 2.\u201d No dividend had, in fact, been declared, and the $1,300 which plaintiff and his assignor received was paid either by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>ant or the Refining Company in apparent accord with defendant\u2019s representations. Notwithstanding the fact that plaintiff received a letter from Dwight, the attorney for the Refining Company, in May, 1908, stating, \u201cNo dividend has been declared or paid on the Indian Refining Company\u2019s stock during the last six months,\u201d the trial court found that the plaintiff did not discover the defendant\u2019s fraud until April 6, 1911. The plaintiff did not offer to return the stock, or do anything to disaffirm the purchase, until January, 1912, when this action was commenced. As stated by Andrews, J., in Schiffer v. Dietz, 83 N. Y. 300:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-5\">\u201cA party claiming to rescind a contract for fraud must act prtimptly on discovery of the fraud, and restore, or offer to restore, to the other party what he has received under it. He cannot thereafter deal with the other party on the footing of an existing contract, or with the property acquired under it as his own.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">See, also, Tanenbaum v. Federal Match Co., 189 N. Y. 75, 81 N. E. 565; Pryor v. Foster, 130 N. Y. 171, 29 N. E. 123; Strong v. Strong, 102 N. Y. 69, 5 N. E. 799; Zimmele v. American Plaster Board Co., 1 App. Div. 327, 37 N. Y. Supp. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Applying this rule, the complaint was properly dismissed. There is an abundance of evidence to sustain the finding that the plaintiff discovered the fraud certainly as early as April, 1911. He not only did not then offer to return the stock, or take any steps looking towards a disaffirmance of the purchase, but all of his acts from that time down to about the time this action was commenced, January 29, 1912, indicated an intention on his part to treat the sale as a valid one. He suggested that he be elected a director of the corporation. He accepted, two dividends declared upon the stock. He claimed the right to subscribe for his pro rata share of an increase in the capital stock of the1 company, by virtue of his being the owner of the stock the sale of which he now seeks to repudiate; and because he was not allotted such pro rata share he threatened to bring suit against the company to recover $21,000. Under such circumstances, I think the court properly determined that with full knowledge of the facts he elected to ratify the purchase of the stock, and he was not in a position to question the validity of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">It follows that the judgment dismissing the complaint should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">INGRAHAM, P.
