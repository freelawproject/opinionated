To such allegation the defendants interposed a general denial. The right of the plaintiff to recover was dependent upon his employment by the defendants. A vital issue, therefore, was the authority of Margolin to bind the defendants by a contract with plaintiff for the performance of such service. In order to establish such authority the plaintiff called Margolin as a witness. To the question of plaintiff\u2019s attorney inquiring for whom the witness hired the plaintiff, the defendants interposed the objection that the question was improper and incompetent at this time; no authority having been shown as yet. The record subsequent to the objection is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\">\u201cThe Court: If they fail to show that they had any authority I will sustain the objection. Q. Who told you to hire him? A. Canno.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-6\">Cross-examination by defendants\u2019 attorney:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-7\">\u201cQ.

That is the only communication you had from Canno before you hired him? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-8\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Attorney: I ask that the testimony be stricken out on the ground that the writing itself is the best evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-9\">\u201cThe Court: I deny the motion.

Do you know whether it is over there where you lived? A. I left all these papers in Beech Ridge. Q. You don\u2019t know whether it is there at Beech Ridge or not? A. No, sir. Q. You haven\u2019t been asked by Mr. Lyons or .Mr. Cole about that letter since that time, until you have been put on the witness stand? A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-18\">\u201cDefendants\u2019 Counsel: I renew my motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-19\">\u201cThe Court: I will deny the motion. (Exception.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-20\">This testimony of Margolin, so far as it is claimed to establish the nonexistence of the letter, is most unsatisfactory. The period of two years during which he said he had them did not expire as to the letter until more than a year after the first trial, nor until about the time of the second trial. When Margolin testified, in answer to the question, \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether it is over at your home?\u201d \u201cNo; I know I haven\u2019t got it,\u201d he evidently referred to his home at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>of the trial, which appears to have been at Youngsville, because, when later questioned as to whether the letter was at Beech Ridge, he said he did not know. Although the evidence indicates that the defendant was operating the Beech Ridge creamery in the summer \u00f3f 1914, there is nothing in the record indicating, or giving the right to infer, that when Margolin lived at Beech Ridge the creamery there was being operated by the defendants, or that the place in which he lived and where the letter was left was the creamery building, or that the letter, if still at the place where Margolin lived at Beech Ridge, is in the possession or under the control of the defendants, as has been suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It has been argued that the evidence establishes the ratification by defendants of the hiring of plaintiff by Margolin. The plaintiff testified that one of the defendants was at the Fulton creamery at various times prior to the 1st day of July, and at times talked with plaintiff and told him how he wanted the cheese made, and that the payment of plaintiff for services rendered was made by defendant by its check for his March, April, and May services. The latter two checks, which were offered in evidence by the plaintiff, were made by the defendant, Canno Dairy, payable to the order of A. P. Fulton, and bore the following indorsement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-6\">\u201cPay to the order of O. Cole, employs of Canno Dairy Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-7\">\u201cA. P. Fulton.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b999-8\">\u201cC. Cole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">\u2014indicating that as early as May 10th a misunderstanding existed as to whether Fulton or the defendants were the employers of the plaintiff. After July 1st, the defendants sent no cans in which to pack and ship the cheese, and hence the plaintiff ceased making cheese, and from that time until December 1st, a period of five months, the sole duty performed by the plaintiff for the defendants, and which represents approximately five-sixths of his claim, consisted in going daily to the Fulton creamery, pulling the plug from the defendants\u2019 vat, thus allowing the skimmed milk which Fulton had run into the vat the preceding day to run out, washing the vat, returning the plug, and going back home.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">While it is claimed to be a question of fact under the evidence whether the defendants ratified the employment of plaintiff by Margolin, there is no evidence aside from the declaration of Margolin, that the hiring was for a period terminating December 1st, or that either of the defendants was at the Fulton creamery subsequent to July 1st, or at any time ratified the hiring with knowledge of the alleged length of the term. In fact, Margolin does not testify that the letter authorized him to hire the plaintiff for any length of time. The testimony of Margolin as to the contents of the letter was necessary in order to sustain plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action, and we think that such testimony, in the absence of proof as to the loss of the letter, was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">The defendants were entitled to insist that every reasonable effort for the discovery or production of the letter, without success, had been exhausted before parol evidence of its contents was admitted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>Margolin was'an interested witness, to the extent, at least, of justifying his action in employing plaintiff, and avoiding liability to plaintiff for assuming the authority to employ plaintiff in case he did not have it; and the defendants were entitled to have the letter produced, if it could be done by a search through the witness\u2019 papers left at Beech Ridge. Secondary evidence as to the contents of the letter was only admissible when such was the. best evidence attainable after reasonable effort to obtain the original had been exhausted. For aught that appeared, the letter was still at Margoliffs former residence. It was there when last seen, and that was the place where search should naturally first be made for it. In the absence of all proof indicating its loss or destruction, and of the conditions under which it was left at Beech Ridge, which may have been of a character which insured its preservation, rather than its loss, it may still be presumed to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> This was the second trial of the case, the first having been had in justice court in January, 1913, and presumably the plaintiff was aware, upon the trial in County Court in February, 1914, of the importance of the evidence claimed to be afforded by the letter.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-6\">\u201cThe general rule is that the party alleging the loss of a material paper, where such proof is necessary for the purpose of giving secondary evidence of its contents, must show that he has in good faith exhausted, to a reasonable degree, all the sources of information and means of discovery which the nature of the case would naturally suggest, and which were accessible to him. Simpson v. Dall, 3 Wall. 460, 475 [18 L. Ed. 265].\u201d Kearney v. Mayor of City of N. Y., 92 N. Y. 617, 621.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">In the case of Dishaw v. Wadleigh, 15 App. Div. 205, 211, 44 <em>N. Y. </em>Supp. 207, the witness testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-8\">\u201cI can\u2019t tell where the letter is; don\u2019t know where it is; don\u2019t think I could find it. I think it has been destroyed, but I am not sure. I have not been asked to produce those letters here. I have destroyed some of the letters, and some I have not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">The court, in its opinion reversing the judgment, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-10\">\u201cThis evidence does not show that any effort whatever was made to produce the letters, or ascertain that they could not be found. I think it was error to receive such evidence, and error not to have stricken it out upon the defendant\u2019s motion. Kearney v. Mayor, 92 N. Y. 617. The evidence gave color to the transaction in controversy, and was well calculated to influence the jury, and for such error the judgment and order must be reversed and a new trial granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">It would certainly be establishing a dangerous precedent to permit a writing vital to' the maintenance of a cause of action to be established by parol until some satisfactory proof of its loss or of inability to produce it had been made, or at least some effort to ascertain whether the writing were still in existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">For the reasons stated, the judgment and order appealed from should be reversed, with costs to the appellants to abide the result. All concur, except KELLOGG, J., who dissents, in a memorandum in which HOWARD, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1000-13\">JOHN M. KELLOGG, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS7g\">(dissenting). Plaintiff was employed in February, 1912. The trial was in February, 1914. Margolin conceded<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>ly was in the employ of the defendants, making cheese at the Fulton factory. He taught the plaintiff how to make cheese, and employed him as defendants\u2019 cheesemaker in his place. At the factory the skimmed milk was run into the defendants\u2019 vats, and plaintiff made cheese from it, which defendants marketed. The plaintiff acted as defendants\u2019 cheesemaker from February until July 1st, and was recognized by them as their employ\u00e9. Each month they sent a check for the amount of his wages to the order of Fulton, and directed him to turn it over to the plaintiff, which he did. They directed him in their work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">A reversal of the judgment in favor of the plaintiff is urged upon the ground that it does not appear that Margolin had authority to employ the plaintiff. Margolin swears that the defendants wrote him authorizing the employment, that he had not seen the letter since he received it two years before, that he did not save it, that he was now living at Youngsville, that he knew he had not the letter, that it was not at his residence, and that when he left Beech Ridge he left all \u201cthese papers\u201d there. He does not know whether the letter is there or not. It is improbable that papers left at his former residence two years before were in existence or were available for production. If we infer that at Beech Ridge he was in the employ of the defendants, and left there \u201cthe papers\u201d relating to the employment, the letter, if in existence, is with the defendants, and not with the witness. I think the letter was sufficiently accounted for, and that it was competent for Margolin to swear that he was authorized to make the employment. If Margolin had not original authority, the defendants have ratified the employment. At least there is enough evidence of the employment prima facie to- put the defendants to proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">I favor an affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
