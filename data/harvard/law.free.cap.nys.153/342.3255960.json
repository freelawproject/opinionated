The first ground of the demurrer is sufficiently considered in the opinion in the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>case. The company was a proper, if not a necessary, party, and that is sufficient to warrant its being joined as a party defendant in a suit in equity, notwithstanding the fact that no relief is demanded against it. Mawhinney v. Bliss, 124 App. Div. 612, 109 N. Y. Supp. 332. If the stockholders are not entitled to a distribution of the fund and property of the Anthony Company, for which the individual defendants are accountable, then the Anthony Company is entitled thereto, and, in either event, it is a proper, if not a necessary, party, for either, it is, or its stockholders in its right are, interested in the consideration received by the individual defendants, for which they are accountable. Mawhinney v. Bliss, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">It follows that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and plaintiff\u2019s motion for an order overruling the demurrer granted, with $10 costs, but with leave to respondent to withdraw the demurrer and interpose an answer on payment of the costs of the appeal and of the motion. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
