It was admitted by the defendant upon the trial that he had visited the defendant 123 times; that the charge for each visit was, by arrangement with the plaintiff, fixed at the sum of $2 per visit. It was conceded by plaintiff that $236 had been paid him, leaving a balance of $10 due. It is true that the defendant testified that, \u201cI believe in all I have paid him around $290,\u201d but he could give no reason for such belief. He also testified that, when he ceased visiting the plaintiff\u2019s office, he \u201cthought he owed him probably $10 or $15.\u201d He said that it ran along about a year, and then he got a bill for $60, upon which he paid plaintiff $50, and upon consultation with his employers, to whom the plaintiff had written letters, was told by them that \u201cthey considered the bill was well paid.\u201d This'is corroborative of the- plaintiff\u2019s claim that there was, still due and owing him the sum of $10, and there was no testimony from which it could be reasonably said that plaintiff\u2019s bill was incorrect. The plaintiff should therefore have had a judgment for $10.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Judgment reversed, and judgment directed in favor of the plaintiff for $10, without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
