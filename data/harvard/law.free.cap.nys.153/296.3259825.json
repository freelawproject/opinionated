He was not the incendiary. A witness, Stern, is a convicted accomplice. The case is deficient in direct evidence to establish defendant\u2019s guilt save that which came from the lips of Stern. Kessler, the convicted incendiary, was called as a witness by the prosecution, but gave no evidence inculpating the defendant. The prosecution asserted disappointment. The assistant district attorney, under the pretext of probing the conscience and testing the recollection of Kessler, read from a. paper, in question form, an extrajudicial statement, purporting to have been previously made by Kessler, in which he implicated the defendant. Stern\u2019s testimony was perhaps sufficiently corroborated by evidence of circumstances tending to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime. The circumstantial evidence was insufficient to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt without Stern\u2019s testimony. In this state of the record the learned trial court was requested to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u201cThat the jury, in weighing the testimony of Isaac Stern, may consider the different statements made by him at different times, and that if the jury disbelieve Isaac Stern, then they must acquit the defendant; there is nothing else in this thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">The court made this disposition of the request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">\u201cThat is a question that, perhaps, ought to be left to the jury. I think I will leave that to the jury, that if they disbelieve the testimony of Isaac Stern, then it is for them to say whether there is testimony outside of that to lead them to believe beyond a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">An exception was recorded. We think the exception presents prejudicial error. We cannot know whether the jury believed a convicted accomplice. If they did not, the evidence was insufficient to establish defendant\u2019s guilt. The jury may have assumed that the statement of Kessler, made out of court and indirectly placed before them, constituted evidence. They were not advised in the charge that it did not, although the method of getting it before the jury was vigorously and consistently opposed by the learned counsel for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-14\">Judgment of conviction of the County Court of Kings County reversed, and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
