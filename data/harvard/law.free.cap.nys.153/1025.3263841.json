Two motions for the same object cannot be made upon the same state of facts, where the first has been denied without leave to renew. Hall v. Emmons, 9 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 370, 372; Childs v. Childs, No. 2, 144 App. Div. 168, 128 N. Y. Supp. 782. See Nichols\u2019 Practice, \u00a7 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-13\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> The language that the court declined to refer \u201cand will leave the parties where they were, and they can thus try their case whenever the condition of the equity calendar in Richmond county permits,\u201d showed no reservation of a right to renew this motion for a reference. On the merits, also, the order should not stand. The complaint alone, and not matters raised in an answer, determines if the cause is referable. Steck v. Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Co., 142 N. Y. 236, 37 N. E. 1, 25 L. R. A. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-14\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> This complaint was the usual one by a building contractor against the owner in a mechanic\u2019s lien suit. It had two claims, for a balance of the contract coriipensation, and a further demand for extras. These are not a long account under Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-15\">Liens on real property, enforced in a court of record, follow the Code provisions for mortgage foreclosure. Lien Law, \u00a7 43; Laws of 1909, c. 38. On the other hand, statutory liens on vessels maybe tried by a justice without a jury, or \u201cmay be referred by such justice to a referee, to hear and determine.\u201d Lien Law, \u00a7 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-16\">The reason for this contrast is obvious. Liens by mechanics on buildings, being presumably to realize the means to pay wages, are designed to be speedy and inexpensive in enforcement, so as to reach a prompt determination of all claims filed against the property, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>the costs resting in the discretion of the court. Lien Law, \u00a7 53. Ex-' cept by consent, such issues are not subject to the exceptional and costly mode of trial before a referee, unless clearly involving a long account between the parties, in the legal sense of that term. Cassidy v. McFarland, 139 N. Y. 201, 34 N. E. 893.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-3\">The order of reference should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs\u2014a disposition which leaves the cause still pending for trial and subject to be disposed of at the Richmond County Special Term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
