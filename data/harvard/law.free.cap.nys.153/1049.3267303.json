This resolution continued :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1089-14\">\u201cResolved, that the title to be so acquired is hereby determined to be a title in fee in such premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1089-15\">The corporation counsel was instructed to apply to the Special Term of the Supreme Court for the appointment of commissioners. The board of estimate then fixed the area of assessment for benefit. Under section 994 of the City Charter it authorized the acceptance of deeds of cession to land lying within the lines of the street. ' The usual petition by the corporation counsel followed, showing the requisite notice of application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>The outstanding feature is the disclosure that the proceeding, while nominally to \u201copen\u201d an old street and to correct some of its boundary lines, is in fact to prepare for placing through these blocks a section of a rapid transit line, being part of the system of elevated roads. When this appeared, the court denied the motion to appoint commissioners, from which the city has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">The difficulty here is the actual purpose of this taking, according to the moving papers. It is to prepare for a new rapid transit railway, to be built in Ely avenue, which is to be part of the Steinway Tunnel rapid transit extension. The engineer of the board of estimate advised the immediate approval of the map, so as to \u201cavoid delay in the railroad construction.\u201d Mr. Raisman, an engineer of the Public Service Commission, states in his affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1090-6\">\u201cThe part of the rapid transit line which rnns along said Ely avenue is known as route No. 50. The type of railroad to be built is that of an elevated railroad, which will be supported by columns, placed generally on the curb lines of the said avenue. These columns will support girders which will carry the tracks, platforms, and other structures of the railroad, and will be so placed that there will be a clearance or head room underneath the said girders of not less than 14 feet to the surface of the roadway of said avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">The Legislature has wisely empowered the city of New York by condemnation to take either an easement or a fee. City Charter, \u00a7 970. This is not only because a uniform municipal ownership in fee of streets (as already exists in the streets from old Dutch highways) might simplify urban rights, but doubtless in view of the greatly increased uses \u201cin, over, upon or under\u201d metropolitan streets. If the question were reviewable by the courts, much may be said for the greater dignity, permanence, and artistic effect of streets and highways owned in fee, and therefore fully controlled by the authorities, as has been the immemorial practice of countries under the civil law. Mitchell v. Bass, 33 Tex. 259. By usage derived from England, the public has but a bare right of passage, under the theory which favored the proprietary right of the lord of the manor, as against the continental idea of a public thoroughfare owned, laid out, improved, and embellished by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">Here the petitioner\u2019s difficulty is not as to taking a fee. It is the method of such acquisition, and who pays the bill. These proceedings theoretically are to be local benefits. The cost incident to the commission, and even of the maps copied from the borough topographical bureau, are to be assessed back on lot owners. A street use (under City Charter, \u00a7 990) is to be \u201ckept open for, or as part of a public street, forever, in like manner as the other streets in the city are and of right ought to be.\u201d Where these purposes are strictly pursued, the process of assessing the cost back upon the lot owners as \u201cbenefits\u201d may be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">However, in the opening of what is to remain a street, the board of estimate acts are legislative and beyond court review. But their power is confined to local street purposes, as contrasted with objects for the entire municipality. Plainly the court is bound to withhold approval from a proceeding which, instead of being based on a real street purpose, is taken with the object of bringing in an elevated railroad struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1051\">*1051</page-number>ture spanning from curb to curb, along a street already opened, accepted, and (save in respect to an insignificant strip) virtually dedicated to the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
