The police department has a rule (No. 725) which calls for investigation by that department, and for efforts to have such information furnished in writing and embodied in a written report, to be made four months after the probationary appointment. Under this rule relator\u2019s statements in his application filed with the civil service examiners were investigated by being compared with court records; also the circumstances of the relator\u2019s discharge from employment as a street car conductor. Thereupon relator was notified in writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-5\">\u201cThat your conduct and capacity as a probationary patrolman having been unsatisfactory to the police commissioner, you will not be appointed permanently at the end of your probationary period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">Upon his application, the Special Term granted a writ of peremptory mandamus, directing the commissioner to appoint the relator. A probationary period for stich appointments is recognized as an important and necessary part of the examination itself, by which the commissioner of police can supplement the applicant\u2019s written answers by investigation conducted by direct inquiry into the conduct of the applicant while he held prior positions. Laws of 1883, c. 343, \u00a7 2; Matter of Murray, 18 App. Div. 337, 46 N. Y. Supp. 172; People ex rel. Van Petten v. Cobb, 13 App. Div. 56, 59, 43 N. Y. Supp. 120; People ex rel. Sweet v. Lyman, 157 N. Y. 368, 52 N. E. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> By the present Civil Service Law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-8\">\u201cAll appointments or employments in the classified service [except veterans] ' shall be for a probationary term not exceeding the time fixed in the rules.\u201d Laws of 1909, c. 15 (Consol. Laws, c. 7) \u00a7 9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">The rules may fix the time or length of probation, but cannot annex an unauthorized limitation. People ex rel. Kastor v. Kearny, 164 N. Y. 64, 67, 58 N. E. 14. \u201cProbation,\u201d as defined, signifies a proceeding to ascertain the truth, to determine character and qualification. Rule 11 of the municipal civil service commission provides for such probationer that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-10\">\u201cIf his conduct or capacity on probation be unsatisfactory to the appointing officer, the probationer shall be notified in writing that at the end of such period he shall, for that reason, not be retained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">This rule is not to be construed to limit the full scope and purpose of probation which the statute commands. Civil Service commissions and examiners- have not facilities for making thorough investigation by outside inquiries into the applicant\u2019s personal records. We cannot circumscribe the statutory probation, so as to deprive the commissioner of the salutary check by looking up past records, besides those of the actual service of the probationer, to the end that, before making a permanent appointment, the probationer\u2019s conduct, capacity, and fitness may be found satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-12\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> And this same ruling, in February last, was made by the Appellate Division of the First Department (People ex rel. Holsten v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>Woods, 151 N. Y. Supp. 1138), where the commissioner found the probationer\u2019s prior record so unsatisfactory as to disqualify him for appointment. Manifestly this court should follow this judicial determination of the power of the commissioner of police, which extends throughout the greater city of New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and relator\u2019s motion denied, with $25 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
