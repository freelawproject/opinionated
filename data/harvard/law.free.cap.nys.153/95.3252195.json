The issue thus raised was not tried as an issue of fact, but the motion was heard upon affidavits, and was denied. This court has repeatedly held that a judgment in the Municipal Court cannot be vacated upon a motion made for that purpose upon the ground of non-service of process, when the application is not coupled with a request that defendant\u2019s default should be opened. Review &amp; Record Co. v. Gilbreth, 65 Misc. Rep. 503, 120 N. Y. Supp. 100; Phillips v. Albert, 81 Misc. Rep. 131, 142 N. Y. Supp. 325; Roberts &amp; Lewis Co. v. Dale, 74 Misc. Rep. 390, 132 N. Y.
