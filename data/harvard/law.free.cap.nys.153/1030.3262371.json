The appeal is also taken from an order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, made on the minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> At the time of the accident, the plaintiff and three other of defendant\u2019s employes were moving a heavy boiler in defendant\u2019s shop, using for that purpose a block and fall borrowed by defendant from one Gledhill. The evidence, which is not controverted, establishes that the block and fall was defective, and that, unless care was exercised in its use, the chain was liable to catch, and if, when it was caught, it was jerked to loosen it, the object being lifted would drop, resulting in possible danger to the persons using it. Gledhill testified that when he loaned the block and tackle to the defendant he said to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-5\">\u201cYou want to be careful in using them. * * * I told him that he would have to be careful in using them or they would catch, and if he jerked them loose they would drop with him. If you have a twist in the chain, it will catch coming over the sheave. * * * And let it go down in this groove in the sheave suddenly and unexpectedly. * * * I told him to be careful of it. * * * Of the falls; to watch out for it. I says, \u2018Be careful of it. * * * Be careful about them dropping on you.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">Neither of the persons engaged in moving the boiler had ever had any experience in lifting heavy bodies with chains or a block and fall. When the boiler had been moved on rollers for some distance, the defendant told one of the men assisting in the work to attach the chain block and put a sling around the boiler and pull it in on the floor of a lower room. He neglected to inform the workmen of the condition of the block and fall or chain connected therewith, or caution them as to its use, or warn them of the possible danger in its use should the chain catch and an attempt be made by jerking to loosen it. After the boiler had been moved a short distance, and while the plaintiff was placing blocks on the floor under the lower end of the boiler to protect the floor, as he had been directed, the chain caught, and the workman who was operating it gave it an extra hard jerk, and the lower end of the boiler slid forward and fell to the floor, catching the plaintiff in its descent, inflicting serious injury. The workman testified that he did not know, and had not been told, of the defective condition of the block and fall, and that he gave no warning to plaintiff before jerking the chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> At the request of counsel for the appellant, the learned court correctly instructed the jury that it was the duty of a master to furnish to his employ\u00e9s implements and appliances which were reasonably suited and safe for the work in hand, and to give them the necessary instructions regarding their use. Having knowledge of the defective condition of the block and fall, and the danger reasonably to be apprehended in its use, it was the duty of the defendant to have warned the persons engaged in the work of the danger which might reasonably have been apprehended, and to have given them necessary instructions as to the manner in which the implement should be operated, but he omitted to give such instruction and warning, and clearly he was guilty of negligence and chargeable with consequent liability. If the verdict of the jury is based upon defendant\u2019s freedom from negligence, it is against the weight of the evidence and cannot be permitted to stand. The learned trial court further properly instructed the jury, at plaintiff\u2019s request, that if the defendant was negligent, and the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>free from contributory negligence, he was entitled to recover. I am unable to find any act of the plaintiff which contributed to his injury. The boiler did not drop' on him while he was under it, but, sliding as it fell, pinned him to the wall of the building. As I have pointed out, he was uninformed and uninstructed as to the defective condition of the block and fall and the danger to be apprehended from its use, and, if the jury found that he was guilty of contributory negligence, that finding was likewise against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">There is no merit in the appellant\u2019s suggestion that the evidence relating to the insurance was improperly received, and the only trouble with the case is that the verdict of the jury is so greatly against the weight of the evidence on both questions involved as to require a reversal of the judgment and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">The parties hereto having stipulated in open court that this case may be disposed of by a court of four, the decision is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
