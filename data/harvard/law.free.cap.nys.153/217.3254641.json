Upon the objection of the answering defendants, the trial justice marked the action discontinued without prejudice to a new action upon plaintiff\u2019s discontinuance, and then proceeded with an inquest on defendant\u2019s counterclaim, and rendered judgment against the plaintiff for $418.66. A motion to vacate this judgment was denied. The learned trial justice erred in proceeding to take proof on the counterclaim after the discontinuance. The discontinuance terminated the right of the defendant to litigate the counterclaim in the action (A. M. Engel &amp; Co. v. Davis, 81 Misc. Rep. 202, 142 N. Y. Supp. 469), and the fact that no objection was made by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to the procedure does not warrant defendants\u2019 recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and judgment on counterclaim vacated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
