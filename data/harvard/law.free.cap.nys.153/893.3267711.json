The note was dated there, was payable there, and the loan was made to the defendant, who resides there; and if the transaction was usurious, it was the result of an agreement made there. We think this action should be tried where the whole transaction occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">The order, therefore, is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to transfer the place of trial to Onondaga county granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
