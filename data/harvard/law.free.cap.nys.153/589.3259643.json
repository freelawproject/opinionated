There was a second count in the information, but no attempt was made to secure a conviction under it.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\">The prosecution was based on subdivisions \u201ca\u201d and \u201cb\u201d of section 416 of the Greater New York Charter, as amended by chapter 754, Taws 1913. These subdivisions read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">\u201cSee. 416. (a) It shall not be lawful for any person or copartnership to engage in, perform, or carry on the trade, business or calling of employing or master plumber in the city of New York unless such person or each member of such copartnership shall have been registered as provided in the foregoing section. (b) It shall be unlawful for any person or copartnership in the city of New York, unless said person or copartnership shall have complied with the requirements of the preceding paragraph to hold him or themselves out to the public as a master or employing plumber by the use of the word \u2018Plumber\u2019 or \u2018Plumbing\u2019 or words of similar import or meaning on signs, cards, stationery or in any other manner whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The only proof against the defendant was that he displayed on his place of business a sign reading as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">M. Iser,</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">General Contractor Tinsmith &amp; Roofer.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Plumbers- &amp; Gas-Fitters Supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">The sole question in the case is whether by the exhibition of this sign defendant held himself out to the public as a master or employing plumber by the use of the words \u201cPlumbing\u201d or \u201cPlumber,\u201d or words of similar import.\u2019 In our opinion he did not. The sign must', of course, be read as it is written, and not be given a forced or strained construction in order to convict a person of -a criminal act. If there be two equally possible readings, one innocent and one criminal, the defendant is entitled to have the -innocent one adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Evidently defendant holds himself out as a general contractor, tinsmith, and roofer. The question at issue turns upon the reading of the last three lines. Does the defendant proclaim by them that he deals in supplies for plumbers and gas-fitters, which would- be quite innocent, or does he proclaim that he (for the sign is that of an individual) is a plumber and gas-fitter, which would be unlawful, and that he deals in supplies of an undesignated character ?</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">It is much the more reasonable to read the sign in its innocent sense than in its criminal. In the first place, it would be strikingly ungrammatical to speak of an individual as plumbers and gas-fitters, using the plural form, especially as the draughtsman of the sign had been careful to describe him as contractor, tinsmith and roofer in the singular form. This reading also specifies the character of the supplies in which the defendant deals. Finally, the sign, as it is printed in the case on appeal, has a period after the word \u201croofer,\u201d but none after the word \u201cgas-fitters\u201d on the following line.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-12\">\u25a0 As against this we have only the circumstance, which appears to have turned the scale against the defendant in the court below, that the sign painter omitted the apostrophe after the words \u201cplumbers\u201d and \u201cgas-fitters.\u201d This omission seems a slight peg upon which to hang a conviction for a misdemeanor. It is quite probable that the sign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>painter drew the sign phonetically, painting the words as he spoke them and heard them spoken, and never troubled himself with the nice use of the apostrophe, if, indeed, he had ever heard of such a thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and the defendant discharged. Settle order on notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">McLAUGHLIN, LAUGHLIN, and CLARKE, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b631-7\">INGRAHAM, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9S\">I dissent. The question is whether the evidence justified a finding that the defendant held himself out to the public as a \u201cmaster or employing plumber, by the use of the word \u2018plumber,\u2019 or \u2018plumbing,\u2019 or words of similar import or meaning, or signs, cards, stationery, or in any manner whatever.\u201d The proof was that the defendant displayed on his place of business the sign quoted in the prevailing opinion. I think it clear that any one looking at thaf sign would understand that the defendant was engaged in the business of a plumber and gas-fitter, and that the addition of the word \u201csupplies\u201d on a separate line at the end of the sign did not imply that the defendant confined himself to furnishing plumbers\u2019 and gas-fitters\u2019 supplies. There was, therefore, a question of fact presented to the trial court whether such a sign was within the prohibition of the charter. The defendant by testimony could have overcome this presumption ; but he rested upon the proof of the sign, and I think there was sufficient to justify the court in its judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
