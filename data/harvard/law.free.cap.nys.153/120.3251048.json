Plaintiff proved that defendants, operated a factory, from one window of which their employ\u00e9s were in the habit of throwing boxes, box lids, and other refuse upon an adjoining lot which did not belong to defendants. Plaintiff\u2019s child, three years of age, was playing with two or three children in this open lot when defendants\u2019 employ\u00e9s threw an empty box, weighing about, 100 pounds, out of the window. It struck and injured plaintiff\u2019s child, and this action is brought to recover for the resultant damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-19\"><bracketnum>[1, 2]</bracketnum> The learned judge below seems to be of opinion that plaintiff was a trespasser upon the adjoining lot, and consequently could not recover from defendants unless injured by something in the nature of a \u201ctrap.\u201d In this, however, he was in error. In the first place, there was no proof that plaintiff\u2019s child was a trespasser, and indeed no proof as to the ownership of the lot, except that it did not belong to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>fendants. Moreover, there was proof that there was a path running through the lot, and that it was continuously used by persons generally as a short cut; also that children customarily played thereon. <em>V </em>But apart from that consideration, plaintiff\u2019s child was not a trespasser as to defendants, or rather the point that plaintiff\u2019s child may have been a trespasser on an adjoining lot cannot be raised by defendants. Wittleder v. Citizens\u2019 Elec. Illuminating Co., 47 App. Div. 410, 62 N. Y. Supp. 488; Wilson v. American Bridge Co., 74 App. Div. 596, 77 N. Y. Supp. 820. Both these cases are cited with approval in Weitzman v. Barbeur Asphalt Co., 190 N. Y. 452, 83 N. E. 477, 123 Am. St. Rep. 560. Defendants could also properly be held either on the theory of negligence or of nuisance. Hogle v. Franklin Mfg. Co., 199 N. Y. 388, 92 N. E. 794, 32 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1038. Whether or not plaintiff might be held guilty of imputed contributory negligence by allowing his young child to play on this lot might become a question for the jury, if knowledge of defendants\u2019 employes\u2019 habitual negligence had been brought home to him, but there is not even a hint to that effect in the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
