The defendant then had the right to review the interlocutory judgment on appeal from the final judgment, by inserting in his notice of appeal a statement that he wished to review the interlocutory judgment. Bates v. Holbrook, 89 App. Div. 548, 85 N. Y. Supp. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">As this appeal is from the interlocutory judgment, taken after the entry of final judgment, such appeal is not authorized, and it must therefore be dismissed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
