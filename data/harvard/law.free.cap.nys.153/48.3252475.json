He went to the ticket office in the station and purchased a ticket, receiving from the ticket seller change for the bill which he gave in payment of his fare. Included in the change was a \u201cplugged\u201d or uncurrent coin. Plaintiff insisted on receiving a good coin in its place, but the ticket seller refused to give him such a one, apparently without any good reason. After a short dispute on this point the ticket seller called a person in uniform in defendant\u2019s employ, who forcibly removed plaintiff from his place in front of the ticket seller\u2019s window. It is perfectly clear that this presented a case for submission to the jury. Gillispie v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 178 N. Y. 347, 70 N. E. 857, 66 L. R. A. 618, 102 Am. St. Rep. 503; Palmeri v. Manhattan Railway Co., 133 N. Y. 261, 30 N. E. 1001, 16 L. R. A. 136, 28 Am. St. Rep. 632; Dwinelle v. New York Cent. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 120 N. Y. 117, 24 N. E. 319, 8 L. R. A. 224, 17 Am. St. Rep. 611. It may be that plaintiff was unreasonable in his insistence upon receiving a good coin, or that his damages from the assault were inconsiderable; but those were matters for the jury to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
