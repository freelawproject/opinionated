Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Co., 142 N. Y. 236, <em>37 </em>N. E. 1, 25 L. R. A. 67); and, if the matters of an account of over 50 items appearing on the face of the complaint are put in issue by a general denial, the examination and proof of this long account are directly involved. The referable character of issues thus made on the answer cannot be defeated by the attempt, through an affidavit by defendant\u2019s attorney, to make it appear that some matters in the account will not be questioned, since an attorney cannot in this way undo his client\u2019s sworn denials. Kennedy v. Kenna, 49 How. Prac. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-19\">The order of reference is-therefore affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements, with liberty, however, to the appellant to apply at Special Term to vacate the order of reference upon his stipulation admitting the correctness of the account.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
