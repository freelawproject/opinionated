L. c. 152, \u00a7 35C, could nevertheless receive the minimum benefit under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The insurer, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Mutual), appeals from the decision of the reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents awarding the minimum benefit to the claimant.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the following reasons, we conclude that the claimant is entitled to the minimum \u00a7 31 benefit, and therefore, we affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>Joseph McDonough began working for the Boston Edison Company in 1961 as a mechanic, primarily in its Massachusetts Avenue garage. He retired from that position in December, 1991, accepting a lump sum pension payment. In April, 1996, he was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and asbestosis. He passed away the following month. His widow, the claimant Martha McDonough, sought benefits under G. L. c. 152, including medical expenses under \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30, burial expenses under \u00a7 33, and survivor\u2019s benefits under \u00a7 31. After hearing, an administrative judge found that McDonough\u2019s illness had been caused by exposure to asbestos fibers at his workplace, and that that exposure to asbestos occurred between the start of his employment in 1961 and December, 1978. (After December, 1978, testing conducted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found no asbestos fibers remaining in the garage.) As a result, McDonough\u2019s date of injury for purposes of workers\u2019 compensation was December, 1978. See <em>McDonough I, supra </em>at 605, citing <em>Squillante\u2019s Case, </em>389 Mass. 396, 397 (1983) (in case of latent injury, date of injury is date of last exposure). As of that date of injury, McDonough was married to and living with the claimant. Under \u00a7 35C, where five years or more have elapsed between the date of injury and the date on which the worker or survivor first became eligible for benefits, \u201cthe applicable benefits shall be those in effect on the first date of eligibility for benefits.\u201d Here, that date of eligibility was May 10, 1996, the date of McDonough\u2019s death. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>As of that date, McDonough and the claimant were still married and living together.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The board awarded the claimant benefits under \u00a7\u00a7 13, 30, 31, and 33. With respect to the calculation of benefits under \u00a7 31, the board resorted to 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.02(1) (1999), which provided that if the worker was not employed as of the date of eligibility, benefits should be calculated based on the worker\u2019s earnings as of the last date of employment. Under \u00a7 31, the claimant was thus awarded two-thirds of McDonough\u2019s average weekly wage as of the date he retired in 1991. Liberty Mutual appealed the award of benefits under \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In <em>McDonough I, supra </em>at 606, we held that because Mc-Donough had no weekly wage on the date of eligibility for benefits under \u00a7 31, the calculation resulted in no payment to the claimant \u2014 two-thirds of zero equals zero. To the extent that the regulation, 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.02(1), provided otherwise, we held that it was invalid as contrary to the statute. <em>McDonough I, supra </em>at 607-608. However, we remanded the case to the board to consider whether, notwithstanding the absence of a weekly wage on the date of eligibility, the claimant was entitled to the minimum payment described in \u00a7 31 (\u201cin no instance shall said widow or widower, receive less than one hundred and ten dollars per week\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 608 n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">On remand, the board concluded that the claimant was entitled to that minimum benefit. Liberty Mutual appealed to a single justice of the Appeals Court, who reported the case to the full panel of that court. We transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion in order to consider whether the minimum benefit described in \u00a7 31 is available even when the average weekly wage at the time of eligibility is zero. We conclude that it is, and we affirm the board\u2019s decision to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>When reviewing the board\u2019s decision we give \u201cdue weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge\u201d of the agency. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7). We exercise de nova review of questions of statutory construction, however, and we must overturn agency decisions that are not consistent with governing law. See <em>Atlanticare Med. Ctr. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Med. Assistance, </em>439 Mass. 1, 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>(2003); <em>Plymouth </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>426 Mass. 1, 5 (1997). In this case, we agree with the board\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The first paragraph of \u00a7 31 provides that \u201c[i]f death results from the injury, the insurer shall pay the following dependents of the employee, . . . wholly dependent upon his or her earnings for support at the time of his or her injury, or at the time of his or her death.\u201d Among the listed dependents are \u201cthe widow or widower, so long as he or she remains unmarried.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the claimant was married to and living with McDonough on the date of injury, December, 1978. There is no dispute that she was wholly dependent on his earnings at that time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As she was dependent on McDonough\u2019s earnings at the time of his injury, the claimant qualifies under the first paragraph of \u00a7 31 to receive benefits, which are calculated according to the second paragraph of the same section.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Liberty Mutual argues that because the claimant only became eligible for \u00a7 31 benefits upon McDonough\u2019s death, her dependence on McDonough\u2019s earnings at the time of his death is the only means by which she could qualify for \u00a7 31 benefits. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>We disagree. The first paragraph of the statute refers to those who are dependent on earnings of an employee at the time of death <em>or </em>at the time of injury. The claimant was dependent on McDonough\u2019s earnings at the time of his injury, although not at the time of his death (because he no longer had any earnings). Nothing in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 35C, or our interpretation of \u00a7 35C in <em>McDonough I, supra, </em>affects the qualifications set forth in the first paragraph of \u00a7 31. Rather, \u00a7 35C sets the date of the average weekly wage to be used for the calculation of benefits under the second paragraph of \u00a7 31. <em>McDonough I, supra </em>at 605-606. As the claimant satisfies the prerequisites under the first paragraph of that section, we move on to the second paragraph to determine what amount she is entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The second paragraph of \u00a7 31 first provides for a benefit of two-thirds of the average weekly wage of the deceased employee. As explained in <em>McDonough I, supra </em>at 606, that calculation yields no benefits for the claimant, as McDonough had no earnings at the date of eligibility (his date of death). However, after prescribing the two-thirds average weekly wage as the amount of benefit to be paid, the second paragraph of \u00a7 31 sets forth a proviso that <em>\u201cin no instance </em>shall said widow or widower, receive less than one hundred and ten dollars per week\u201d (emphasis added). We interpret the words \u201cin no instance\u201d literally, meaning that no circumstance or condition will operate to deprive the surviving spouse of the minimum benefit. See <em>Rudenauer </em>v. <em>Zafiropoulos, </em>445 Mass. 353, 358-359 (2005) (interpreting words \u201cin no event\u201d in statute of repose to foreclose possibility of any exception). Thus, the fact that McDonough had no earnings at the time of his death does not disqualify the claimant from receiving that minimum benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Liberty Mutual argues that to award minimum weekly compensation when the employee had no weekly wage at the time of eligibility would violate the limited wage replacement goals of the workers\u2019 compensation act (act). See <em>McDonough I, supra </em>at 604; <em>Letteney\u2019s Case, </em>429 Mass. 280, 282 (1999); <em>Ahmed\u2019s Case, </em>278 Mass. 180, 183 (1932); <em>Corriveau </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 924, 926 (1997). Although we have frequently recognized that the primary goal of the act is wage replacement, certain portions of the act serve other purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>beyond precise wage replacement. See, e.g., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 28 (requiring double compensation when injury results from employer\u2019s \u201cserious and wilful misconduct\u201d); G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 33 (compensation for burial expenses); G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34A (providing minimum benefits for permanent and total incapacity); G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (providing compensation for disfigurement regardless of incapacity); G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A (designating payments to nondependent relatives, or to special fund, if no dependents exist). As such, the mere fact that our interpretation does not equate with a strict wage replacement scheme does not require us to deviate from the plain language of \u00a7 31. The minimum payments described in \u00a7 31 are not altered by considering their place in a larger statutory scheme that has the over-all goal of wage replacement. Although this particular exception may be at odds with that over-all goal, the wording of \u00a7 31 itself is clear that nothing is to prevent a surviving spouse from receiving at least the minimum benefit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The board correctly interpreted \u00a7 31 to require minimum payments even when there was no weekly wage on the date of eligibility. We therefore affirm the decision of the reviewing board ordering the minimum weekly payment of \u00a7 31 benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-14\"> General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 31, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-15\">\u201cIf death results from the injury, the insurer shall pay the following dependents of the employee, . . . wholly dependent upon his or her earnings for support at the time of his or her injury or at the time of his or her death, compensation as follows ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-16\">\u201cTo the widow or widower, so long as he or she remains unmarried, a weekly compensation equal to two-thirds of the average weekly wages of the deceased employee, but not more than the average weekly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>wage in the commonwealth . . .; provided, however, that in no instance shall said widow or widower, receive less than one hundred and ten dollars per week . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Counsel for the claimant has filed a suggestion of death and moved that Mary A. Noonan, administratrix of the claimant\u2019s estate, be substituted as the claimant in this matter. We take notice of the suggestion of death, and we allow the motion to substitute. We refer to the original claimant, Martha Mc-Donough, throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b100-7\">By comparison, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual) has consistently argued that, at the time of McDonough\u2019s death, the claimant was not \u201cwholly dependent upon [McDonough\u2019s] earnings for support,\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 31, because McDonough had no \u201cearnings\u201d after his retirement in 1991. Section 32 of the workers\u2019 compensation act, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 32, contains a conclusive presumption that a wife is \u201cwholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee\u201d when she lives with him at the time of his death. Notwithstanding the fact that the \u00a7 32 presumption does not include any presumption with respect to dependence on \u201cearnings\u201d (but only presumes that the spouse is dependent \u201cfor support\u201d), we previously stated that it applied to the claimant. <em>McDonough\u2019s Case, </em>440 Mass. 603, 605 n.2 (2003). In any event, Liberty Mutual has not contested that the claimant was \u201cwholly dependent upon [McDonough\u2019s] earnings for support\u201d back in 1978, when his workplace injury occurred. Although there was no explicit finding on the point, the evidence adduced at the hearing was that the claimant was bom in 1929, and she dropped out of school in her sophomore year of high school. She worked in a bakery for nine years, ending her work there a few years after her marriage to McDonough in 1952. During her marriage, she raised at least two children, and she was unemployed at the time McDonough retired in <em>1991. </em>There is no suggestion in this record that she held any gainful employment outside of the home during her marriage. The record certainly supports the inference that the claimant was \u201cwholly dependent upon [McDonough\u2019s] earnings for support\u201d back in 1978, when McDonough was injured, and Liberty Mutual does not claim otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">We also note that, under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 23, a spouse who claims any benefits under G. L. c. 152 loses the right to sue the employer for the wrongful death of the other spouse. See <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Stackpole Fibers Co., </em>403 Mass. 360, 361-362 (1988). According a surviving spouse with a payment of $5,720 per year is modest compensation for the loss of that right.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The claimant has requested and is entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in this appeal, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 12 (3) and 12A. See <em>Daly\u2019s Case, </em>405 Mass. 33, 40-42 (1989). Within fourteen days of the date of rescript, she shall submit to this court a petition for fees and costs, with any appropriate supporting materials, as described in <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004). Liberty Mutual will be given fourteen days thereafter to respond to the petition for fees and costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
