The defendant was convicted by a jury of rape of a child by force, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A, and indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B. Among several challenges to his convictions, he claims that the denial of his repeated requests to review the complainant\u2019s therapy records was an abuse of discretion, and that the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocols impose an unconstitutionally high burden on defendants, leading to the unavailability of exculpatory evidence and depriving defendants of their constitutional right to a fair trial. The defendant also asserts that the trial judge abused her discretion by admitting in evidence the complainant\u2019s detailed testimony of prior alleged but uncharged sexual assaults by the defendant; that he was denied his rights of due process and confrontation when the prosecutor cross-examined him about a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession that had been suppressed prior to trial; that his trial counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>ineffective in several respects; and that the judge abused her discretion in denying his motion for a new trial without a hearing. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">For the reasons we explain below, we conclude that a number of errors at trial, in combination, require that we grant the defendant a new trial. As to the defendant\u2019s challenge to the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocols, we announce today a new protocol governing a defendant\u2019s request to inspect statutorily privileged records of any third party. The new protocol, which replaces the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocol, is not constitutionally compelled, and shall apply prospectively to all criminal cases tried after the issuance of the rescript in this case. Because the defendant is to receive a new trial, he shall have the benefit of the new protocol. We therefore do not consider his challenge to the rulings on his requests for access to the complainant\u2019s therapy records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We turn first to the facts of this case. We then address the alleged errors at trial. Last, as described in more detail in the Appendix to this opinion, we outline the protocol applicable to pretrial requests for documents from nonparties in all criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">1. <em>Factual background. </em>In February, 2001, when the complainant was sixteen years old, she told her boy friend and then her parents that two of her cousins, the defendant and Frederick Lomberto, both four years older than the complainant, had raped and sexually assaulted her over a period of several years beginning in 1992 or 1993 when she was eight or nine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>years old.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the evening she made these statements, the complainant attempted suicide. Her parents took her to Milford Hospital, where she was treated and released the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In March and April, 2001, the complainant met with several therapists, including a psychiatrist and a social worker, and underwent a psychiatric evaluation at Pembroke Hospital. She also received counselling at Wayside Counseling Center. After expressing suicidal thoughts to her boy friend, she met with her high school guidance counsellor, who in April, 2001, filed what appears to be the first report of suspected abuse pursuant to G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In May, 2001, the complainant underwent the first of two sexual abuse intervention network (SAIN) interviews.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the first SAIN interview conducted at the Milford police department, the complainant stated that abuse by the defendant and Lomberto had commenced when she was eight or nine years old and stopped when she was thirteen years old. She described several specific instances that she said had occurred when she was nine or ten years old, and stated that the defendant had raped or sexually assaulted her \u201calmost fifty times.\u201d Thereafter, in June, 2001, a physician conducted a child protection evaluation and physical examination of the complainant at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Medical Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In the second SAIN interview, conducted at the Bellingham police department in July, 2001, the complainant was questioned about a handwritten list she had prepared of alleged incidents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>sexual abuse by the defendant and Lomberto beginning in June, 1992, and ending in September, 1997. Among other incidents, the complainant described two rapes by the defendant in the summer of 1997. She said one had taken place at her home in July, 1997, one week before her thirteenth birthday; the second had taken place, she said, in the basement of her grandparents\u2019 house during a yard sale in August, 1997. These allegations served as the basis for two sets of indictments against the defendant, charging him with rape of a child by force and indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">2. <em>Procedural background. </em>In May, 2003, the defendant\u2019s motion for severance from his codefendant Lomberto was allowed. Before the cases were severed, the defendant and Lomberto filed several joint motions seeking access to the complainant\u2019s therapy records in accordance with the procedures set forth in <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 179-183. Two judges in the Superior Court denied the motions, concluding that the defendants had not demonstrated a sufficient basis for ordering in camera review of the records.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Their motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>The defendant\u2019s trial commenced on January 9, 2004; the jury deliberated for three days, and returned guilty verdicts on the indictments relating to the August, 1997, incident only. Because the jury failed to agree on a verdict on the indictments relating to the July, 1997, incident, the judge declared a mistrial as to those indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Lomberto\u2019s trial commenced on January 21, 2004, immediately following the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s trial. When the jury could not reach verdicts on any of the eleven charges, the judge declared a mistrial. Before his retrial, Lomberto filed a renewed <em>Bishop </em>motion for access to the therapy records of the complainant. A different judge in the Superior Court allowed the motion, ordered all of the complainant\u2019s therapy records produced for in camera review, and subsequently permitted Lomberto and his counsel to review and copy certain records.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In September, 2004, a jury returned guilty verdicts against Lomberto on two of the rape charges and three of the indecent assault and battery charges and verdicts of not guilty on four of the rape charges and two of the indecent assault and battery charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">In December, 2004, the defendant\u2019s counsel filed a motion for a new trial, arguing among other things that the denial of access to the records had deprived the defendant of a \u201cviable defense to the charged offenses\u201d because the redacted records introduced at Lomberto\u2019s second trial reflect that the complainant \u201crepeatedly and consistently reported\u201d that the alleged abuse occurred several years before the defendant turned seventeen years old, and \u201cdirectly contradict\u201d the complainant\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial that the alleged abuse had occurred in July and August of 1997. See note 5, <em>supra. </em>The judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial without a hearing. The defendant\u2019s appeal from that ruling was consolidated with his direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">3. <em>Prior bad acts. </em>At the defendant\u2019s trial the complainant, who was then nineteen years old, testified first about the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>charged incidents, which allegedly occurred in July and August, 1997. Following this testimony, the prosecutor asked the complainant to \u201cestimate\u201d how many times the defendant had \u201ctouched [her] in a sexual way\u201d before August, 1997. The complainant responded, \u201cUncountable.\u201d After the judge gave a limiting instruction,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the prosecutor proceeded to question the complainant about seven different incidents of uncharged sexual abuse that allegedly had occurred before 1997, each of which the complainant described in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The defendant contends that the judge abused her discretion in allowing the complainant to testify in such detail about the unindicted incidents and that this testimony \u201coverwhelmed\u201d the evidence of the two incidents with which the defendant was charged. We agree. The jury heard more about uncharged sexual assaults than they did about the crimes charged. Of the sixty-five transcript pages of the complainant\u2019s direct testimony, fifteen pages covered the July and August, 1997, incidents, while twenty-one pages contained testimony of the uncharged assaults. Trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the complainant, in turn, was directed primarily at discrediting her testimony of the uncharged conduct. Later, much of the defendant\u2019s own testimony was devoted to denying the uncharged prior bad acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">It is long established that evidence of uncharged criminal acts or other misbehavior is not admissible to show a defendant\u2019s bad character or propensity to commit the charged crime, but may be admissible if relevant for other purposes such as \u201ccommon scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent or motive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>434 Mass. 358, 366 (2001), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, </em>398 Mass. 214, 224 (1986). In sexual assault cases, some evidence of uncharged conduct may be admissible to give the jury a view of the entire relationship between the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>and the alleged victim, and \u201cthe probative existence of the same passion or emotion at the time in issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>418 Mass. 788, 794 (1994), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 470 (1982). It is left to the judge to determine whether such evidence has probative value and, if so, whether its probative value outweighs the risk of undue prejudice to the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 794-795; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Helfant, supra </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Some testimony by the complainant concerning the rapes and sexual assaults by the defendant spanning several years was probative of the relationship between the defendant and the complainant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 794. But even if relevant, a judge must guard against the risk that evidence of prior bad acts will divert the jury\u2019s attention from the charged acts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>440 Mass. 519, 530 (2003). Here, the jury\u2019s attention was repeatedly drawn to the uncharged conduct. In his closing argument, the prosecutor emphasized for the jury the complainant\u2019s testimony about \u201can ongoing basis of sexual assault\u201d and suggested that her testimony was credible in part because it was \u201cextremely detailed,\u201d recounting \u201cyears of abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The Commonwealth argues that the judge\u2019s limiting instructions were sufficient to cure any prejudice, and points to the judge\u2019s subsequent ruling that the jury\u2019s split verdict demonstrates that the jury were \u201cnot overwhelmed or inflamed against the defendant.\u201d In the circumstances of this case, however, we conclude that the defendant has shown the requisite prejudice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, supra </em>at 795 (\u201cIt is implicit in the general rule regarding the inadmissibility of prior bad acts evidence that the admission of such evidence carries with it a high risk of prejudice to the defendant\u201d). Allowing the complainant to testify in detail about each of seven uncharged incidents was excessive. The judge should have intervened to prevent the \u201cdanger of overwhelming a case with such bad act evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 380 (1998) (noting judge\u2019s obligation to guard against this danger). It was not, as the judge later recognized, that the defendant suffered \u201csome prejudice by virtue of this evidence,\u201d but that the prejudice was overwhelming. At a new trial the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>judge should take care to limit any prior bad act testimony to establishing in summary fashion that the complainant claims that the abuse continued over a number of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">4. <em>Use of Lomberto\u2019s admission at the defendant\u2019s trial. </em>In May, 2001, several months after she first made the allegations of the sexual abuse by her two cousins, the complainant\u2019s father interrogated Lomberto, during which Lomberto admitted to the complainant\u2019s allegations. The father had videotaped the interrogation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court later concluded that the admission had been coerced and ordered it suppressed at Lomberto\u2019s trial. At trial, the defendant denied all allegations that he had sexually abused the complainant. Toward the end of his direct testimony, his counsel asked whether he had \u201cany knowledge\u201d that Lomberto had raped the complainant, to which the defendant replied, \u201cNo, never.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On cross-examination the prosecutor attempted to impeach this statement by showing that the defendant knew of Lomberto\u2019s videotaped admissions. The judge ruled that the suppressed admissions could not be introduced, but allowed the prosecutor to refer to the admissions to impeach the defendant. In the ensuing examination, which is reproduced in the margin, the prosecutor elicited from the defendant an admission to the effect that he knew that Lomberto had been \u201cforced\u201d to admit that he had sexually abused the complainant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>mediately gave a limiting instruction that any evidence of Lomberto\u2019s role in the crimes charged could not be used against the defendant. Lomberto was, of course, not a witness at the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s ruling on the use of Lomberto\u2019s coerced admission on grounds both constitutional (right to confrontation and due process) and nonconstitutional (Lomberto\u2019s admission was involuntary and therefore unreliable and was not true impeachment material). As to his constitutional claims, the defendant relies in part on <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>391 U.S. 123 (1968). That reliance is misplaced. The defendant and Lomberto were not tried jointly, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>416 Mass. 55, 57-58 (1993) <em>(Bruton </em>rule applies only at joint trial), and the defendant\u2019s testimony about Lomberto\u2019s admission did not explicitly implicate the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, </em>424 Mass. 770, 782 (1997), quoting <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 208 (1987) <em>(Bruton </em>rule limited to \u201ccases where the codefendant\u2019s statement \u2018expressly implicate[s]\u2019 the defendant, leaving no doubt that it would prove to be \u2018powerfully incriminating\u2019 \u201d). Nevertheless, the defendant should not have been questioned about Lomberto\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The connection between the defendant and Lomberto permeated the trial. It informed the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, and the complainant repeatedly testified about sexual abuse by her \u201ccousins\u201d or by \u201cSean and Fred.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s repeated objections to evidence associating the defendant with Lomberto were overruled. Moreover, as the defendant points out, although the judge gave a limiting instruction, the judge did not instruct the jury that Lomberto\u2019s admission had been coerced, which compounded the potential prejudice to the defendant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>James, supra </em>at 783 (\u201ccontextual incrimination\u201d occurs \u201cwhere the circumstances of the case and the nature of the codefendant\u2019s statement so obviously implicate the defendant in the crime itself as virtually to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>constitute direct incrimination\u201d). The judge\u2019s limiting instruction did not effectively counteract the prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Furthermore, the rationale underlying our cases interpreting <em>Bruton </em>applies with some force to the prosecution\u2019s use of Lomberto\u2019s involuntary admission to impeach the defendant. A defendant\u2019s own involuntary admission may not be used to impeach him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Kleciak, 350 Mass. 679, 689-690 (1966). If the contextual incrimination from the use of a codefendant\u2019s admission is strong enough, it can \u2014 and here it did \u2014 undermine the effect of a judge\u2019s limiting instruction such that the use of the coerced admission becomes inherently unfair. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>428 Mass. 57, 60 (1998); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>412 Mass. 147, 161-163 (1992), citing <em>LaFrance </em>v. <em>Bohlinger, </em>499 F.2d 29 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Meachum </em>v. <em>LaFrance, </em>419 U.S. 1080 (1974) (if wife\u2019s decision to waive spousal privilege and testify at husband\u2019s first trial was not voluntary, then use of her prior recorded testimony at husband\u2019s second trial \u201coffends fundamental fairness\u201d); <em>LaFrance </em>v. <em>Bohlinger, supra </em>at 35-36 (due process clause prohibits use of defense witness\u2019s coerced statement to impeach witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">As to the nonconstitutional claims, Lomberto\u2019s admission was not true impeachment material and should not have been admitted for that purpose. The defendant denied any knowledge that Lomberto had sexually abused the complainant. The prosecutor then used Lomberto\u2019s admission to elicit from the defendant an admission that he knew that Lomberto had been forced to confess to the crimes. This was not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s testimony. The coerced admissions are unreliable hearsay not relevant to the question whether the defendant had committed the charged acts. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>406 Mass. 78, 83 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chretian, </em>383 Mass. 123, 136 (1981) (relevant evidence has \u201crational tendency to prove an issue in the case\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kleciak, supra </em>at 690 (\u201can involuntary confession does not become any more trustworthy . . . because the confession is used to impeach the credibility of the defendant rather than as substantive evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>5. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant claims that his trial counsel was ineffective in several respects, of which we address two. First, in his opening statement counsel promised exculpatory testimony from a witness, Daniel LaBonte. But counsel had never spoken to LaBonte. That ineffectiveness was compounded, the defendant argues, when the prosecutor sought and the judge gave a missing witness instruction when defense counsel later decided not to call LaBonte to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Second, he says, counsel agreed to the admission of an unredacted written report by a physician, who performed a child protection evaluation and physical examination of the complainant, which contained inadmissible hearsay. We examine the defendant\u2019s claims under the familiar standard to determine \u201cwhether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974) <em>(Saferian), </em>and, if so, \u201cwhether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">a. <em>Missing witness instruction. </em>We conclude that the defendant has satisfied both prongs of the <em>Saferian </em>standard with respect to this claim. Defense counsel told the jury in his opening statement that LaBonte and another witness, Doug Wiebers, would testify that they were with the defendant at his grandparents\u2019 yard sale on the day of the second alleged rape in August, 1997, and that the defendant had not entered his grandparents\u2019 house as the complainant had asserted. Wiebers did testify to those facts. But when LaBonte arrived at the court house, he explained to defense counsel (who had not previously interviewed him) that he had no memory of driving to the defendant\u2019s grandparents\u2019 house during a yard sale in August, 1997, seven years earlier. As a result, defense counsel decided not to call LaBonte.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">On cross-examination the prosecutor\u2019s first question to the defendant was, \u201cWho is Daniel LaBonte?\u201d When defense counsel objected to the question, the prosecutor explained at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>sidebar that he was \u201claying the foundation\u201d for a missing witness instruction, which the judge later allowed over defense counsel\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In his closing argument, the prosecutor drew the jury\u2019s attention to defense counsel\u2019s promise in his opening statement that LaBonte would testify that he was with the defendant \u201con that day\u201d in August, 1997, and that counsel had failed to deliver on his promise. As requested, the judge gave a missing witness instruction during her final charge to the jury, permitting the jury to draw a negative inference against the defendant because LaBonte had not testified as defense counsel had promised.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">It is fundamental that counsel should not make a promise to a jury about anticipated testimony from a witness he has not interviewed. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCicco, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 111, 122 (1998) (\u201cDefense counsel failed to meet a minimum standard of performance by announcing to the jury that the defendant might testify without first having met with him to discuss that possibility and to prepare him for it\u201d). That error was compounded when defense counsel failed to challenge effectively the Commonwealth\u2019s attempt to capitalize on the error. Had defense counsel explained to the judge that he did not call LaBonte to testify because LaBonte did not remember the events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>of seven years earlier, the judge likely would not have given a missing witness instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zagranski, </em>408 Mass. 278, 287 (1990) (jury can only draw negative inference from failure to call witness if, among other things, \u201cthe witness\u2019s absence [is] not explained in the circumstances of the case\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 225, 244 (1990) (judge should decline to give missing witness instruction if given plausible reason for nonproduction of witness). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tripolone, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902-903 (2003) (judge properly declined to give missing witness instruction where among other things witness likely would not remember more precisely than other witnesses events that occurred seven years earlier).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s focus on LaBonte\u2019s absence had an obvious impact on the jury. On the first day of their deliberations, the jury sent the judge a question concerning LaBonte\u2019s absence and asked whether the Commonwealth could have summonsed LaBonte.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In response the judge stated: \u201cMr. LaBonte was designated as a defense witness. You may not speculate as to why the Commonwealth, the prosecution did not call him as a witness, and you may not consider the fact that the prosecution did not call him in your deliberations at all.\u201d The judge\u2019s response, although correct, placed any negative inference from LaBonte\u2019s absence solely at the feet of the defendant. It is noteworthy that the jury returned guilty verdicts on the August, 1997, indictments only. Had LaBonte not been mentioned, the jury might have accepted Wiebers\u2019s version of events of August, 1997. Defense counsel\u2019s initial error, combined with the missing witness instruction, was \u201cdecisive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>366 Mass. 284, 294 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>61 Mass.

The defendant claims this amounted to ineffective assistance because the report contained highly prejudicial hearsay evidence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The statute establishing the medical records exception to the hearsay rule \u201cis not to be interpreted as rendering admissible all the contents of hospital records,\u201d <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 528 (1978); rather it makes admissible only those portions of records relating to \u201ctreatment and medical history.\u201d G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79. See <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Dong, </em>412 Mass. 682, 684 (1992). The majority of the report related to the treatment and medical history of the complainant. The report did, however, contain hearsay statements concerning the complainant\u2019s sister, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>implied that she, too, might have been abused, inferentially by the defendant and Lomberto. These statements should have been redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The report also included statements bearing on the question of liability that should have been redacted.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79 (contents of hospital record referring to \u201cquestion of liability\u201d not admissible). Although a hospital record relating to treatment and medical history may be admitted \u201ceven though incidentally the facts recorded may have some bearing on the question of liability,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Concepcion, </em>362 Mass. 653, 656 (1972), quoting <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>330 Mass. 148, 149 (1953), ultimate conclusions concerning the charged crimes should be redacted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiMonte, </em>427 Mass. 233, 241-242 (1998) (notations on hospital intake form stating that complainant had been \u201cassaulted\u201d should have been redacted); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 202-203 (1987) (admission of so much of hospital record that contained \u201cdiagnosis\u201d of \u201csexual molestation\u201d was error entitling defendant to new trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Counsel\u2019s decisions will not be viewed as constituting ineffective assistance unless they are \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>409 Mass. 266, 273 (1991). The Commonwealth argues that defense counsel\u2019s decision to agree to admission of the report was not manifestly unreasonable because he had a tactical reason for doing so: to ask the physician about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>other sexual relationships that the complainant may have had that could have caused tissue scarring noted by the physician in her report. The defendant counters that his trial counsel could have cross-examined the physician about the tissue scarring without admitting the entire report in evidence. Had defense counsel complied with the procedural requirements of the rape-shield statute, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 21B, he likely would have been permitted to question the physician on this issue.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>(\u201cEvidence of specific instances of a victim\u2019s sexual conduct.. . shall not be admissible except. . . evidence of recent conduct of the victim alleged to be the cause of any physical feature, characteristic, or condition of the victim\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cortez, </em>438 Mass. 123, 129 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cardoza, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 648-649 (1990). Admission of the entire report was not necessary to the defense strategy. Defense counsel should have moved to redact the hearsay statements concerning the complainant\u2019s sister and the statements naming the defendant and Lomberto as the perpetrators of the sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">6. <em>Relief for errors at trial. </em>In the preceding sections we have identified several errors that occurred at the defendant\u2019s trial. We have not considered whether any single error is sufficient to warrant reversal of the convictions because we conclude that the combination of errors requires that we grant the defendant a new trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cancel, </em>394 Mass. 567, 576 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>380 Mass. 545, 550 (1980) (although errors taken individually not sufficiently prejudicial to require reversal of conviction, combination of errors resulted in substantial risk of miscarriage of justice, where court had \u201cserious doubt as to whether this defendant was [unduly] prejudiced\u201d by combination of errors); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mazzone, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 345, 353 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 500, 507 (1999) (\u201cWhile each error in isolation might not have required reversal, we conclude that the cumulative errors \u2018fatally infected the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>ment of conviction\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kines, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 540, 542, 543-544 (1994) (new trial required where case turned largely on credibility of witnesses, and combination of errors \u201ccreated a risk that the evidence may not have been weighed in an unbiased manner\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">7. <em>Protocol for pretrial inspection of third-party records. </em>As noted earlier, the defendant challenges the denial of his pretrial and posttrial motions to review the complainant\u2019s treatment records. He also raises a constitutional challenge to the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocols: having reviewed the complainant\u2019s treatment records introduced at Lomberto\u2019s second trial, he asserts that adherence to the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocols denied him a \u201cviable defense\u201d to the crimes for which he was indicted. We need not address his arguments because, in light of recent developments in our jurisprudence and continuing concerns about potential constitutional infirmities of some aspects of the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocols, we announce today a new protocol that shall apply in every criminal case (the protocol is not limited to sexual assault cases) where a defendant seeks pretrial inspection of statutorily privileged records of any third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The protocol is grounded in Mass. R. Crim. P. 17 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 885 (1979), which governs pretrial access to \u201cbooks, papers, documents, or other objects\u201d (hereafter records) held by a third party not under the Commonwealth\u2019s control,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lampron, </em>441 Mass. 265 (2004) <em>(Lampron), </em>where we set forth mandated procedures and standards for rule 17 (a) (2) motions. The protocol announced today adds new requirements to our previous cases discussing rule 17 (a) (2), and shall apply whenever a defendant seeks pretrial records from a third party that are covered by a statutory privilege. The new protocol replaces the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocols.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In <em>Lampron, </em>we considered the final sentence of rule 17 (a) (2), which states: \u201cThe court may direct that books, papers, documents, or other objects designated in the summons be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>produced before the court within a reasonable time prior to the trial or prior to the time when they are to be offered in evidence and may upon their production permit the books, papers, documents, objects, or portions thereof to be inspected and copied by the parties and their attorneys if authorized by law.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We stated that rule 17 (a) (2) \u201cis intended to expedite trial proceedings by avoiding delay caused by the often onerous task of responding to a summons of documents,\u201d and emphasized that mie 17 (a) (2) <em>must </em>be satisfied before any documents of any kind may be summonsed from any third party prior to trial. <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 268-270.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><em>Lampron </em>also addressed for the first time the standard that a party must satisfy before a judge orders the issuance of a rule 17 (a) (2) summons before trial. Because our rule is modeled on the analogous Federal rule, Fed. R. Crim. P. 17 (c), we adopted the standard articulated by the United States Supreme Court for issuance of a summons for pretrial production of documentary evidence, <em>id. </em>at 270:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">\u201c[T]he party moving to subpoena<footnotemark>[23]</footnotemark> documents to be produced before trial must establish good cause, satisfied by a showing \u2018(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 269, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 669-700 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Our recent cases have also established that only a judge may issue a rule 17 (a) (2) summons prior to trial, and only on the filing of a motion that satisfies the requirements of Mass. R. Grim. P. 13 (a) (2), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1516 (2004), as applied to a role 17 (a) (2) motion, <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 270-271<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>; that the Commonwealth has standing to challenge the issuance of a rule 17 (a) (2) summons, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam, </em>444 Mass. 224, 229 (2005); and that a defendant\u2019s motion for issuance of a rule 17 (a) (2) summons may proceed ex parte only in clearly defined \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>444 Mass. 786, 793 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In <em>Lampron, </em>we commented on the standard that the judge must apply in determining whether the moving party has made a showing sufficient to satisfy the first of the four-requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>standard. We held that the defendant must \u201cmake a factual showing that the documents sought are relevant and have evidentiary value\u201d and that \u201c[potential relevance and conclusory statements regarding relevance are insufficient . . . .\u201d <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We have not previously commented on the other three requirements of the <em>Lampron </em>standard. The second requirement of rule 17 (a) (2) mandates that the moving party show that the documents sought are \u201cnot otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence.\u201d <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, supra </em>at 699-700. This imposes on the moving party an affirmative obligation to show that no other source likely exists for the desired records. The third requirement of the rule, \u201cthat the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial,\u201d is designed to limit use of rule 17 (a) (2) to instances where the absence of pretrial production would tend unreasonably to delay the trial. <em>Lampron, supra. </em>The final requirement mandates that the moving party establish that the motion is made in good faith and is not intended as a \u201cgeneral \u2018fishing expedition.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Requirements three and four both serve as a reminder that rule 17 (a) (2) is <em>not </em>a discovery tool, <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269, and that the limited purpose of rule 17 (a) (2) is to authorize a court \u201cto expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for the inspection of the subpoenaed materials.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nixon, supra </em>at 698-699, citing <em>Bowman Dairy Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 214, 220 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">A statutory privilege may apply to some or all of the records of a third party for which a defendant seeks a summons under rule 17 (a) (2). In <em>Lampron, </em>we did not address what, if any, additional requirements a defendant should meet when the records sought are privileged because <em>Lampron </em>presumed that the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocols would apply once the four <em>Lampron </em>requirements were satisfied. <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 271-272. Today we replace the <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocols. To the rule 17 (a) (2) requirements as explicated in <em>Lampron, supra </em>at 269-270, we now add further requirements applicable where some or all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>the records sought by the defendant from a third party are presumptively covered by a statutory privilege.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">An explanation for the adoption of a new protocol is necessary. In <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 175-179, this court explained that allowing a defendant to pierce a statutory privilege may be necessary to effectuate his constitutional right to \u201cput before a jury evidence that might influence the determination of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, quoting <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 56 (1987). See <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 223, citing <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, supra </em>at 56-58; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 883-884 (1991) (Stockhammer), and quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Two Juveniles, </em>397 Mass. 261, 266 (1986) (defendant\u2019s interests at stake in disclosure of statutorily privileged records are \u201cwell-established due process rights of an accused, protected by the Constitutions of the United States and of the Commonwealth ... to gain access to evidence \u2018shown to be relevant and likely to be significant\u2019 or material to his defense, and to use that evidence to confront witnesses and to challenge the validity of the Commonwealth\u2019s case\u201d). We need not repeat those discussions here.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In <em>Bishop, </em>and again in <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 224, this court sought to \u201cstrike the proper balance\u201d between a defendant\u2019s due process right to such evidence and the protection of a statutory privilege. In <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 179-180, this court said that, to pierce a statutory privilege, the defendant must show \u201cat the threshold, that records privileged by statute are likely to contain relevant evidence.\u201d Three years later, in <em>Fuller, </em>the court held that the \u201clikely to be relevant\u201d standard was \u201ctoo broad and flexible\u201d when applied to sexual assault counselling records, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20J, and determined that such records should be produced for in camera inspection only when a defendant \u201chas demonstrated a good faith, specific, and reasonable basis for believing that the records will contain exculpatory evidence which is relevant and material to the issue of the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>guilt,\u201d adding that the evidence must tend \u201cto create a reasonable doubt that might not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 225, 226.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The court concluded then, as we do now, that in certain circumstances a defendant must have access to statutorily privileged records \u201cso as not to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.\u201d <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 223, quoting <em>Bishop, supra </em>at 176. But the \u201cstringent\u201d balance struck in <em>Fuller, supra </em>at 227, has given rise to continuing difficulties, many of which have been articulated in the thoughtful briefs we received from amici. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pelosi, </em>441 Mass. 257, 258-259 n.1 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">As the claim in the case before us demonstrates, among the most significant difficulties is the inability of defendants to meet the stringent <em>Fuller </em>standard, even though statutorily privileged records may contain exculpatory evidence. The <em>Bishop-Fuller </em>protocol also embroiled the courts in highly contentious conflicts concerning whether documents were actually privileged. The amended protocol is designed to give the fullest possible effect to legislatively enacted privileges consistent with a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial that is not irreparably prejudiced by a court-imposed requirement all but impossible to satisfy.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Experience has also confirmed that trial judges cannot effectively assume the role of advocate when examining records. Requiring judges to take on the perspective of an advocate is contrary to the judge\u2019s proper role as a neutral arbiter. See <em>Stockhammer, supra </em>at 882, quoting <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>384 U.S. 855, 875 (1966) (\u201cIn our adversary system, it is enough for judges to judge. The determination of what may be useful to the defense can properly and effectively be made only by an advocate\u201d). Despite their best intentions and dedication, trial judges examining records before a trial lack complete information about the facts of a case or a defense to an indictment, and are all too often unable to recognize the significance, or insignificance, of a particular document to a defense. The absence of an advocate\u2019s eye may have resulted in overproduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tian, as well as underproduction, of privileged records, and has repeatedly contributed to trial delays and appeals, jeopardizing the rights of defendants, complainants, and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Accordingly, the protocol we announce today provides a reasonable opportunity for defense counsel (and <em>only </em>defense counsel in the first instance) to inspect pretrial presumptively privileged records produced by a third party, subject to a stringent protective order. We outline here the broad aspects of the protocol and detail the protocol in the attached Appendix.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> We emphasize that the standard for summonsing third-party records for inspection before trial is intended to guard against intimidation, harassment, and fishing expeditions for possibly relevant information. Rule 17 (a) (2) is not a discovery tool. Before ordering that a summons issue for such records, \u201c[a] judge hearing a rule 17 (a) (2) motion must evaluate whether the <em>Lampron </em>requirements of relevance, admissibility, necessity, and specificity have been met. . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>444 Mass. 786, 792 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">We now outline the new protocol. First, before a judge determines whether a summons for records may issue to any person or institution, the custodian of the records (record holder) and the third party who is the subject of the records (third-party subject), where applicable, shall be afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard on whether the records sought are relevant or covered by a statutory privilege.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The custodian of the records and the third-party subject, where applicable, need not avail themselves of this opportunity, nor shall the third-party subject be required to assert any statutory privilege. Rather, unless and until the privilege holder waives the privilege, all records likely to be covered by a statutory privilege shall remain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>and shall be treated as presumptively privileged; there is no requirement at this stage that a judge determine that the summonsed records are in fact privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Second, if a judge orders the issuance of a rule 17 (a) (2) summons, all presumptively privileged records that are summonsed shall be retained in court under seal, and shall be inspected only by counsel of record for the defendant who summonsed the records. Before conducting any such inspection, counsel shall sign, as an officer of the court, and file a protective order containing stringent nondisclosure provisions. Among other things, the protective order shall prohibit counsel from copying any record or disclosing or disseminating the contents of any record to any person, including the defendant. Judges and counsel are required to report any violation of a protective order to the Board of Bar Overseers for disciplinary action. Disclosure of the contents of any record to the defendant or any other person shall be permitted if, and only if, a judge subsequently allows a motion for a specific, need-based written modification of the protective order.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">A protocol permitting defense counsel only to inspect presumptively privileged records before trial is not entirely new. See <em>Stockhammer, supra </em>at 882-884. We emphasize, however, that there have been significant changes in our jurisprudence since <em>Stockhammer </em>was decided. At that time, defense attorneys seeking documents from a third party typically summonsed those records directly to their own offices, without the necessity of obtaining a judicial order. No prior showing of any kind was required, and complainants, witnesses, and record holders were not protected in any respect from intimidation, harassment, or fishing expeditions. In contrast, the requirements we imposed in <em>Lampron </em>now permit pretrial production of a third party\u2019s records only on a judicial finding that the moving party has satisfied clearly articulated standards designed to guard against such abuses.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Our decision today is informed by art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, but is not constitutionally compelled. We therefore apply the new protocol to cases tried after the issuance of the rescript in this opinion. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 248 (2005) (applying modification of fresh complaint doctrine prospectively, where modification was exercise of superintendence power and not new constitutional rule); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 721 n.10 (2004) (\u201cWhen announcing a new common-law rule, a new interpretation of a State statute, or a new role in the exercise of our superintendence power, there is no constitutional requirement that the new rule or new interpretation be applied retroactively, and we are therefore free to determine whether it should be applied only prospectively\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">8. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgments are reversed. The verdicts are set aside. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"Atg\">1. <em>Filing and service of a motion pursuant to Mass.

As I have already instructed you, the general rule is that in reaching your verdict, you may only consider the evidence that was presented to you in court. However, under certain circumstances, you may also consider the fact that a potential witness did not testify. Where a party has knowledge of a person who can be located and brought forth who is friendly to or at least not hostile to that party and who can be expected to give testimony of distinct importance to the case, the party would naturally offer that person as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u201cIf then, without explanation,' the defendant does not do so, you are free to, but not requirefd] to, infer that the witness, had he been called, would have given testimony unfavorable to that party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\">\u201cWas Dan LaBonte \u2014 once Dan LaBonte did not show up as a witness for the defense, was the prosecution allowed to call him and compel him to appear at the end of the trial?

The decision not to call these two witnesses was not \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978). The witnesses\u2019 testimony would have been cumulative of Wiebers\u2019s testimony, and coming from relatives of the defendant could have appeared to the jury to be biased. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>429 Mass. 146, 153 (1999) (testimony of relative of defendant is \u201cinherently less credible than the testimony of other witnesses\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The defendant also argues that the physician\u2019s report does not fall within the hospital record exception to the hearsay rule, G.

He contends that the report would have been excluded from evidence had defense counsel objected. The argument is unavailing. The defendant relies on the complainant\u2019s testimony at Lomberto\u2019s second trial that she had a \u201cpelvic exam\u201d after the district attorney became involved \u201cbecause they told me that I had to go, that it was just standard procedure, that all rape victims had to go.\u201d Lomberto\u2019s trial occurred after the defendant\u2019s, and we do not view trial counsel\u2019s decision \u201cwith the advantage of hindsight.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>at 729. As to his second argument, the admissibility of hospital records is not premised on proof of warnings to patients to be honest and accurate. See G.
