On March 16, 2006, a Superior Court judge signed an impoundment order after hearing from both parties. Counsel agreed that impoundment was in the best interests of the parties and in the public interest to safeguard the confidentiality of statutorily protected peer review materials and documents. We conclude on inspection of the orders that the purpose of impoundment was to protect the confidentiality of documents, including the pleadings and the peer review materials at issue, excluding names of parties and facts of the case. Counsel for the plaintiff openly acknowledged at oral argument that \u201cthe purposes [for impoundment] have long since become superseded by the way in which this case has evolved in the court.\u201d The initial order was designed for very limited purposes to accommodate the needs of the parties at the time, and no real need for impoundment currently exists. In so holding, we reiterate our previous observation that \u201cimpoundment is always the exception to the rule, and the power to deny public access to judicial records is to be \u2018strictly construed in favor of the general principle of publicity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Republican Co. </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>442 Mass. 218, 223 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blondin, </em>324 Mass. 564, 571 (1949), cert. denied, 339 U.S. 984 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Michael D.

Thus, we are asked once again to examine the extent to which communications for the purpose of medical peer review may be kept confidential and for what purposes the privilege may be pierced. See <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., </em>446 Mass. 1 (2006). For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the order must be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision and from the record, reserving the recitation of other relevant facts for later discussion. The defendant Franklin Medical Center (FMC) is a licensed Massachusetts hospital. As such, it is required by stringent Federal and State laws and regulations to maintain quality assessment and risk management programs. Among these programs are policies and procedures to report and address behavior by hospital staff that might be inconsistent with or harmful to good patient care or safety. G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 203 <em>(a)-(d). </em>Accordingly, FMC established medical staff bylaws that provided, among other things, for the summary suspension of a physician\u2019s membership or clinical privileges when necessary to \u201creduce the substantial likelihood of injury or damage to the health or safety of any patient, employee, or other person at the Medical Center; or . . . [f]or the continued effective operation of the Medical Center.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> FMC also established a separate policy on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>medical staff \u201cdisruptive behavior\u201d that specifies the targeted behavior <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and set out detailed procedures for documentation, investigation, notice to the physician with the opportunity to respond, and \u201ccorrective\u201d actions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The incident that precipitated this litigation occurred at approximately 7 a.m. on October 28, 2004, at a regularly scheduled meeting of FMC\u2019s surgical support services committee. In attendance was the plaintiff, William Vranos, an orthopedic surgeon who was a partner in Franklin Orthopedic Group in Greenfield, a member of the medical staff of FMC, and, since January, 2002, chief of FMC\u2019s department of surgery. Also attending were Henry K. Godek, FMC chief of anesthesia; the defendant Kenneth Gaspard, director of surgical and material services; and Kim Cotter, Gaspard\u2019s assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">During the meeting, Vranos and Gaspard exchanged heated words over a new policy that would restrict the availability of surgical services. The parties agree that the argument quickly escalated, although they offer differing accounts of who used inappropriate and threatening verbal and body language to whom. It is uncontested that approximately ten days before the meeting, forty-nine members of the department of surgery, including Vranos, signed a \u201cmemorandum of concern\u201d (memorandum) expressing doubts about the judgment of Gaspard and Cotter in managing the surgical department.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Shortly after the meeting, Gaspard reported to the defendant Michael D. Skinner, FMC\u2019s president, that he had been physically threatened and verbally abused by Vranos at the meeting. Gaspard told Skinner that Vranos raised his voice repeatedly, slammed charts and documents down on the table, grabbed a chair and threw it aside, and angrily demanded that Gaspard remain in the meeting when Gaspard wanted to leave. Gaspard told Skinner that he was afraid during the incident that Vranos might hit him, and that he still felt unsafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Skinner and Vranos had had previous dealings concerning Vranos\u2019s relationship to FMC. Specifically, for nearly six months prior to October 28, 2004, Skinner attempted to recruit Vranos to leave the Franklin Orthopedic Group and establish a competing orthopedic practice at FMC. Vranos had declined Skinner\u2019s offer and instead, in September, 2004, accepted a position at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Vermont, less than twenty miles from FMC, effective January 1, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>At approximately 8:30 a.m. on the day of the altercation, Skinner met with Cotter and John Brady, PMC\u2019s director of human resources. Cotter corroborated Gaspard\u2019s version of events, and said she had been frightened during the encounter between Vranos and Gaspard. At one point during her meeting with Skinner and Brady, Cotter began to tremble and cry. Subsequent to these meetings, Skinner arranged for the vice-president of hospital operations and the director of employee relations to interview Gaspard and Cotter to confirm their accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">On October 29, 2004, Skinner called Vranos to his office. During the meeting, Skinner handed Vranos a notice of a summary suspension, effective immediately.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The notice stated in part that Vranos \u201cused intimidating, abusive, and hostile language and exhibited threatening behavior, including picking up a stack of papers and slamming them down on the table, picking up a chair and slamming it down in the conference room, and placing [himself] physically close to one or more individuals while speaking in loud, angry, and confrontational manner [during the October 28 meeting].\u201d The notice also stated that Vranos had \u201ca history of disruptive behavior . . . [and] unprofessional conduct ... at PMC,\u201d and that Vranos\u2019s behavior and conduct \u201chas been perceived to be intimidating, abusive, hostile, and physically threatening.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The judge determined, for purposes of the discovery order, that, prior to issuing the notice to Vranos, Skinner did not give Vranos the opportunity to explain himself. Nor did Skinner contact Godek prior to issuing the summary suspension or consult with the patient care assessment coordinator as provided in PMC\u2019s policy addressing disruptive physician behavior. However, pursuant to its medical staff bylaws, within three business days of the suspension, on November 3, 2004, PMC convened a medical staff summary suspension review committee (review committee) to consider the terms of Vranos\u2019s suspension and to advise PMC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>board of trustees whether to continue, modify, or terminate the suspension. The bylaws provided that the review committee be composed of various officers and staff, including the president or a designated representative. Skinner was a member of the review committee that considered Vranos\u2019s suspension on November 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">After reviewing submissions by Vranos, Godek, Gaspard, Cotter, Skinner, and several other physicians, the committee recommended that Vranos\u2019s suspension be lifted provided that he (1) resign as chief of surgery; (2) apologize to Gaspard and Cotter; and (3) seek anger management counseling or its equivalent. The FMC board of trustees (trustees) accepted the recommendation on November 9. Vranos agreed to the terms, and the suspension was lifted that day. Vranos waived his right to a hearing to challenge his suspension and returned to work on November 10, with full medical staff membership and clinical privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">On March 3, 2005, Vranos filed his unverified complaint for defamation against FMC, Skinner, and Gaspard.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The gravamen of Vranos\u2019s complaint is that, in the course of the summary suspension investigation and review, Skinner and Gaspard published untrue statements about Vranos\u2019s professional conduct that were motivated by their animus toward Vranos as a result of their prior interactions with him, as recounted above.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the course of discovery, Vranos requested production of two categories of information: (1) documents and responses to inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>rogatories concerning credentialing communications between FMC and other hospitals, State regulators, and other credentialing organizations (credentialing materials)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>; and (2) material prepared for the summary suspension of Vranos in connection with the peer review committee, including incident reports, memoranda, narrative statements, committee minutes, and other documents submitted to the review committee and the board of trustees (disputed peer review documents).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendants objected to the majority of the requests on the basis of the medical peer review privilege, and Vranos subsequently moved to compel discovery, which the judge allowed in relevant part.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Simultaneously, the hospital petitioned for reconsideration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>for interlocutory review by a single justice of the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118. The motion for reconsideration was denied on April 24, 2006, and on May 11, 2006, the single justice granted FMC\u2019s petition. On July 19, 2006, we granted Vranos\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>Because our opinion involves the complex regulatory scheme governing health care facility quality assessment and risk management, we begin with a brief summary of that scheme, which we have described at some length in prior cases. See, e.g., <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>426 Mass. 514, 517-526 (1998); <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>401 Mass. 172, 177-182 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">a. <em>Medical peer review. </em>Strong public policy mandates the highest quality of care in our health care facilities. That public policy finds voice in, among others, a strict regulatory scheme covering virtually all aspects of hospital operations. Integral to this regulatory scheme is an effective process for self-scrutiny, manifest most prominently in the medical peer review process. For more than twenty years, both Federal and State laws have required and regulated medical peer review committees in hospitals, and for that same length of time, laws have protected the confidentiality of medical peer review proceedings. See generally <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 517-518. The Health Care Quality Improvement Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11101-11152 (2000), first enacted in 1986, codified Federal standards for medical peer review that provided limited immunity to committee members and made confidential documents submitted to a national physicians\u2019 data bank. See <em>id. </em>Following passage of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, the Legislature enacted laws and the Board of Registration in Medicine (board) promulgated regulations that progressively offered increased immunity for medical peer review committee members and witnesses and privilege against subpoena, discovery, and the use in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>evidence of documents related to medical peer review. See <em>id. </em>at 518-519. We have recognized that the intent of these confidentiality provisions is \u201c[t]o \u2018promote candor and confidentiality\u2019 in the peer review process . . . and to \u2018foster aggressive critiquing of medical care by the provider\u2019s peers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., </em>446 Mass. 1, 11 (2006), quoting <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 518, and <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra </em>at 182. To advance the Legislature\u2019s purpose, we have reviewed the statutory medical peer review privilege broadly. See, e.g., <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra </em>(G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 [a], establishes \u201ca broad privilege\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Taken together, G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 204 (a) and 205 <em>(b), </em>provide weighty protection to a medical peer review committee\u2019s work product and materials. They express the Legislature\u2019s considered judgment that the quality of health care is best promoted by favoring candor in the medical peer review process. Necessarily, the interests of the general public in quality health care are elevated over the interest of individual health care professionals in unfettered access to information about peer review of their actions. See <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 532 (\u201cthe peer review privilege imposes some hardship on litigants seeking to discover information from hospital records, but the Legislature has clearly chosen to impose that burden on individual litigants in order to improve the medical peer review process generally\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Nevertheless, the staff member at the center of the medical peer review process is not without recourse to ensure fairness. Medical peer review committees are required by Federal and State laws and regulations to provide medical personnel with notice and an opportunity to be heard about decisions of a peer review committee affecting them. See G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 203 <em>(b); </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(3). Testimony from members of, or witnesses before, a medical peer review committee may be obtained \u201cas to matters known to such persons independent of the committee\u2019s proceedings.\u201d G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 (c). See 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 304(4) (1994). Information \u201cotherwise available from original sources\u201d may be discoverable even if presented to a peer review committee. G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 <em>(b). </em>See also G. L. c. 111, \u00a7\u00a7 204 <em>(a), </em>205 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The Legislature has permitted the subject of a medical peer review to pierce the statutory privilege to establish a cause of action against the member of a peer review committee for the member\u2019s failure to act in good faith pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85N. We have recognized that the exception for failure to act in good faith must be construed narrowly to preserve the purposes of the peer review privilege to promote good health care. See <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., supra </em>at 10-11. Therefore, the exception operates to invade the peer review privilege only \u201con some threshold showing that a member of a medical peer review committee did not act in good faith in connection with his activities as a member of the committee, for example did not provide the medical peer review committee with a full and honest disclosure of all the relevant circumstances, but sought to mislead the committee in some manner.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We now consider whether the judge properly ordered production of the disputed communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">b. <em>Credentialing communications. </em>The judge ruled that credentialing communications concerning Vranos between the defendants and the board, the Vermont Board of Medical Practice, Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, and other credentialing organizations were not covered by the medical peer review privilege and must be produced. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">First, the defendants\u2019 communications to the board concerning Vranos\u2019s conduct, including peer review materials, were not voluntary but rather mandated as part of the hospital\u2019s obligation to participate in health care facility quality assessment and risk management programs. See, e.g., G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 53B; 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.07(17)(c) (1995) (\u201can essential element of a Patient Care Assessment Program pursuant to 243 [Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7] 3.00, is that a reporting entity report any \u2018disciplinary action\u2019 to the Board relating to any employment practice, association for the purpose of providing patient care, or privileges\u201d); G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 5F (\u201cAny health care provider . . . shall report to the board any person who there is reasonable basis to believe is in violation of . . . any of the regulations of the board . . .\u201d). These materials do not lose their character as \u201cproceedings, reports and records\u201d pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 <em>(a), </em>or information and work product \u201cnecessary\u201d to meet the hospital\u2019s statutory risk management and quality assessment programs pursuant to G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 205 <em>(b), </em>merely because they are required to be furnished to the board. To hold otherwise would severely undermine the Legislature\u2019s carefully constructed scheme to promote systemwide good health care, for the statutory obligation to report incidents of unprofessional physician behavior would render meaningless the incentives confidentiality and privilege offer to peer review committee members and witnesses to proceed in all candor. A similar analysis pertains to the credentialing documents the hospital was required to send to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in response to its credentialing inquiry. <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 524-525. See 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.05, 3.12(1)(d) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Finally, although Massachusetts laws and regulations do not expressly require a health care facility to provide credentialing information to another State\u2019s board of registration in medicine, we assume without deciding that applying the medical peer review privilege to such communications is also consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent to provide broad protection for candid assessments of a physician\u2019s performance. See 243 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.01 (board regulations intended to promote \u201cactive self-scrutiny and reporting of adverse incidents in in-patient and out-patient settings to permit individual physicians, institutions and the Board to recognize patterns requiring corrective action\u201d). See also <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 517-519; <em>Beth Israel Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>401 Mass. 172, 182 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In short, the judge erred in designating the credentialing communications outside the scope of the medical peer review privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">c. <em>Peer review privilege. </em>We next address the order to produce the disputed peer review documents.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We consider only whether the judge erred in concluding that these docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ments fell within the \u201csingle, narrow exception to the privilege \u2018to establish\u2019 that a member of a peer review committee did not act \u2018in good faith and in the reasonable belief that based on all of the facts the action or inaction on his part was warranted\u2019 during the peer review process.\u201d <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., supra </em>at 11, citing G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 <em>(b), </em>and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85N. See <em>id. </em>at 12 n.24 (distinguishing claims for \u201cbad faith\u201d from claims for failure to act in \u201cgood faith\u201d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The judge cited two pieces of \u201cundisputed evidence\u201d as \u201ckey\u201d to his conclusion that the privilege should be abrogated. First, \u201cthere were circumstances attendant to the incident which <em>suggest </em>the <em>possibility </em>of ulterior motives on the part of Skinner\u201d (emphases added), including the possibility of FMC losing revenue when Vranos switched hospitals, see note 12, <em>supra, </em>and Vranos\u2019s signature on the memorandum of concern. Second, \u201cthe nature and vigor\u201d of Skinner\u2019s investigation of Vranos <em>\u201cindicates </em>that Skinner <em>may </em>have used the peer-review process without the requisite good faith\u201d (emphases added). These suspicions, as we shall explain, are insufficient to pierce the thick armor of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">As an initial matter, we note that Vranos did not in fact submit <em>any </em>evidence to support his discovery claims. His discovery argument rests on the claims that \u201c[gjood faith was missing because Skinner\u2019s <em>animus </em>was unrelated to [Vranos\u2019s] professional qualities, which caused Skinner to purposefully avoid exculpatory facts about the incident and to avoid investigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the facts in a reasonable manner.\u201d However, Vranos\u2019s complaint was unverified, and unlike Skinner, he never submitted an affidavit to establish a factual foundation supporting his position. Thus, despite the judge\u2019s reference to \u201cthe collective weight of the evidence\u201d in favor of Vranos, any evidence before the judge was submitted by and in support of the defendants; the only evidence on the record was the uncontested testimony proffered in Skinner\u2019s affidavit. In spite of this, the judge held in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s conclusory and unverified statements. This reliance alone would be a ground to vacate the order.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">With specific reference to the medical peer review privilege, we have taken pains to emphasize that \u201cmere inference\u201d will not suffice to meet the movant\u2019s burden to pierce the medical peer review privilege. <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., supra </em>at 12; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 531 (privilege may not be pierced where plaintiff has provided \u201cno contradictory evidence\u201d to show that documents at issue are not mandated by board regulations). We have stressed that, to break through the medical peer review process, the moving party must show that the medical review process itself, and not the reasons for initiating it, was infected with lack of good faith. <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., supra </em>at 12 (\u201cThe focus must be on the committee member\u2019s actions within <em>the peer review committee process itself, </em>not on possible discriminatory reasons for initiating a review of the plaintiff\u2019s work\u201d [emphasis added]). Thus, Vranos\u2019s theory that the desire for vengeance motivated Skinner\u2019s initiation of the investigation, which the judge accepted, is irrelevant. Vranos has failed to point to any evidence of misconduct within the peer review process (which, in fact, resulted in the lifting of Vranos\u2019s summary suspension). See <em>Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp. Corp., supra </em>at 12-13, quoting <em>Doe </em>v. <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp. of Fort Wayne, </em>42 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) par. 36,973 (N.D.

The judge, for example, concluded that Skinner\u2019s initial investigation of the incident leading to Vranos\u2019s summary suspension was \u201cinadequate and somewhat arbitrary\u201d because, under FMC\u2019s bylaws, such a remedy (suspension) \u201cseems to be intended\u201d for \u201cgrave and immediate safety concerns.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In fact, FMC\u2019s bylaws submitted to the judge as part of Skinner\u2019s affidavit provide that summary suspension is appropriate \u201c[t]o reduce the substantial likelihood of injury or damage to the health or safety of any patient, employee, or other person at [FMC]\u201d and \u201c[f]or the continued effective operation of [FMC].\u201d It is also evident that summary suspension proceedings are necessarily conducted quickly and without the time for a thorough review of all evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We do not consider indicative of lack of good faith that Skinner, as FMC\u2019s president, would act swiftly and decisively in response to a disruptive incident between two members of the FMC staff that had tremendous potential to disrupt the day-to-day operations of the entire institution.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Finally, we note that Vranos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>knowingly declined to exercise his right to contest his temporary suspension to the trustees and cannot now rely on speculation to obtain information that might otherwise have been available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The exceptions to the privilege urged by Vranos would decimate the efficacy of confidentiality protections in G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 204 (a), any time a plaintiff asserts an allegation of bad faith, which undoubtedly more plaintiffs would do if we accepted Vranos\u2019s argument. \u201cIt does not seem reasonable that the Legislature would create a [peer review committee] privilege and through an exception undercut the confidentiality that that privilege allows.\u201d <em>Beth Israel Hosp.

The defendants moved to dismiss all counts under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 364 Mass. 754 (1974), for failure to state a claim. A Superior Court judge dismissed four of the six counts, and denied the motion to dismiss on the defamation counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Specifically, Vranos\u2019s complaint and subsequent pleadings allege that Gaspard and Cotter were seeking revenge for Vranos\u2019s signing the memorandum of concern about their leadership, and that Skinner was worried that, in light of Vranos\u2019s reputation in the community and the proximity of his new hospital to FMC, FMC would lose revenue as a result of Vranos\u2019s departure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Request no. 14 of Vranos\u2019s first request for production of documents included: \u201cAll documents submitted to the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine, the Vermont Board of Medical Practice, Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, and any other entity concerning plaintiff\u2019s summary suspension, including copies of reference letters sent by Drs.

The judge also ordered responses to related interrogatories, including, for example, no. 1: \u201cIn the ten years prior to October 29, 2004, how many summary suspensions were imposed on members of the FMC medical staff?\u201d; no. 3: \u201cIn the two years prior to October 29, 2004, how many corrective actions were initiated against members of the FMC medical staff?\u201d The judge grouped such material under the caption \u201cNon-Peer Review Discovery,\u201d without further elaboration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The judge found that Skinner\u2019s affidavit describes six categories of documents withheld on the ground of privilege: \u201c(1) Physician incident reports prepared by Gaspard and Cotter; (2) a narrative statement describing the incident prepared by Godek; (3) memoranda to the file following the incident by Skinner \u2018or by others\u2019 and submitted to Skinner, concerning conversations with Gaspard, Cotter, and Vranos; (4) documents submitted to the committee convened pursuant to the bylaws to review the summary suspension and the minutes of a meeting of the summary suspension review committee; (5) documents submitted to the [trustees] concerning the [trustees\u2019] review of summary suspension; and (6) correspondence to the plaintiff concerning the summary suspension, including \u2018special notice of summary suspension\u2019 and a \u2018notice of final action.\u2019 \u201d FMC also produced a privilege log describing sixty-eight documents withheld from production and the privileges cited for each.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The judge first ordered production of various documents and interrogatories designated by the judge to be \u201cNon-Peer Review Discovery,\u201d including those documents relating to credentialing communications.

Second, the judge ordered production of a subset of documents requested by Vranos relating to the peer review process, but subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the \u201csingle, narrow exception\u201d to the prohibition against discovery. FMC subsequently filed a request for in camera inspection of itemized documents from Vranos\u2019s medical staff file. In his order on four posttrial motions, the judge withheld a decision on the issue of in camera inspection pending any order of the Appeals Court. The judge denied FMC\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and allowed motions for protective orders for the credentialing documents and business documents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">There is no dispute that the documents falling in this category (e.g., proceedings, reports, and records) are peer review materials. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Milton Hosp. &amp; Med.

App. Ct. 495, 499 (2002), instructs that a reviewing court first determine whether the records for which the privilege is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>claimed clearly fall within the privilege on their face. If the records are not facially privileged, the court should consider evidence proffered by the party asserting the privilege. The aim of the inquiry is to determine whether the document was created by, or otherwise as a result of a \u201cmedical peer review committee.\u201d See <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>426 Mass. 514, 531 (1998). For purposes of the present action, we will assume, without further inquiry, and in accordance with the judge\u2019s conclusion, that the records considered by the reviewing committee fall within the privilege. These include: memoranda following the incident by Skinner or others, documents submitted to the committee and the minutes of the suspension review committee, documents submitted to the trustees, and correspondence to the plaintiff concerning the summary suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em> Pardo </em>v. <em>General Hosp.

However, its policy on medical staff disruptive behavior states: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of [the disruptive behavior] policy, one or more incidents of disruptive behavior by a Member may be grounds for corrective action or other disciplinary action under the procedures set forth in the FMC Medical Staff Bylaws. <em>Nothing in this policy is intended to preempt, interfere with, or otherwise affect the procedures for corrective action and other disciplinary action set forth in the FMC Medical Staff Bylaws\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Skinner stated in his affidavit: \u201cI did not make the decision to impose summary suspension against [Vranos] lightly. I understood that I had the option of imposing summary suspension or initiating a request for corrective action. After learning of the incident involving Vranos on the morning of October 28, I had to balance the competing needs of getting information and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>addressing the situation expeditiously. I discussed the situation generally with seasoned health care professionals who deal regularly with medical staff issues. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\u201cI made a final decision that summary suspension was not only warranted, but necessary because [Vranos] accepted no responsibility whatsoever for his role in a troubling incident and because at least some cooling off period was required before I could comfortably allow him to work again in our Surgery Department. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
