L. c. 91, the waterways statute. The plaintiffs asserted that the department\u2019s decision was based on an unauthorized regulatory exemption and in excess of the department\u2019s authority. After a Superior Court judge denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings and allowed the defendants\u2019 cross motion for judgment on the pleadings, the plaintiffs appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Although various arguments concerning the application of the public trust doctrine have been raised by the parties, resolution of the competing claims in this case turns on a straightforward application of principles of statutory construction. Because we conclude that the regulatory exemption promulgated by the department exceeded its authority, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">1. <em>Background. </em>North Point is the developer of a project that would turn approximately forty-eight acres of abandoned rail yards and industrial land into residential, office, retail, and park space. The site, located primarily in East Cambridge,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has a roughly triangular shape and is bounded on one side by the Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway, on a second side by the Gilmore Bridge, on which Charlestown Avenue traverses, and on the third side by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) rail lines and a maintenance facility. The proposed project consists of five million square feet of office, retail, and residential space and the potential relocation of the MBTA Green Line Lechmere subway station. It would also expand and improve roadways, bicycle paths, and sidewalks under the Gilmore Bridge.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The project site consists in part of filled tidelands. Until the early 1960\u2019s, when the Millers River flowed through the site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>and into the Charles River, those tidelands were flowed tidelands. Then, under a 1962 license issued by the Department of Public Works pursuant to G. L. c. 91, the Boston and Maine Railroad (Boston and Maine) filled the site. As part of its project and as required by the terms of the license, Boston and Maine constructed underground culverts to serve the drainage function previously performed by the river. The Millers River is no longer visible and flows through the site only through the underground culverts.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">General Laws c. 91 governs, among other things, water- and nonwater-dependent development in tidelands and the public\u2019s right to use those lands. Chapter 91 finds its history in the public trust doctrine, \u201can age-old concept with ancient roots . . . expressed as the government\u2019s obligation to protect the public\u2019s interest in ... the Commonwealth\u2019s waterways.\u201d <em>Trio Algarvio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, </em>440 Mass. 94, 97 (2003), citing <em>Boston Waterfront Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 629, 631, 645 (1979). Under the public trust doctrine, the Commonwealth holds tidelands in trust for the use of the public for, traditionally, fishing, fowling, and navigation. <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Barnstable, </em>432 Mass. 194, 198 (2000), and cases cited. To the extent that nonwater-dependent use \u2014 that is, nontraditional use \u2014 is to be made of tidelands, the Legislature has now expressly mandated that any such nonwater-dependent use <em>\u201cshall </em>serve a proper public purpose\u201d (emphasis added). See G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, as amended by St. 1983, c. 589, \u00a7 26.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The obligation to preserve the public trust and to protect the public\u2019s interest (as mentioned in note 5, <em>supra, </em>the two are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>coterminous) has been delegated by the Legislature to the department, which, as charged in G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 2, \u201cshall act to preserve and protect the rights in tidelands of the inhabitants of the commonwealth by ensuring that the tidelands are utilized only for water-dependent uses <em>or otherwise serve a proper public purpose'\u2019* *</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(emphasis added). General Laws c. 91, \u00a7 1, defines \u201c[tjidelands\u201d as \u201cpresent and former submerged lands and tidal flats lying below the mean high water mark,\u201d and distinguishes between \u201cCommonwealth tidelands\u201d \u2014 \u201ctidelands held by the commonwealth in trust for the benefit of the public or held by another party by license or grant of the commonwealth subject to an express or implied condition subsequent that it be used for a public purpose\u201d \u2014 and \u201c[pjrivate tidelands\u201d \u2014 \u201ctidelands held by a private party subject to an easement of the public for the purposes of navigation and free fishing and fowling and of passing freely over and through the water.\u201d The tidelands on the North Point project site, having been filled by Boston and Maine, are now \u201cfilled tidelands.\u201d Filled tidelands are \u201cformer submerged lands and tidal flats which are no longer subject to tidal action due to the presence of fill.\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.02 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">As part of its mandate to \u201cpreserve and protect\u201d the public\u2019s rights in tidelands, G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 2, the department, under G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 14, may not license uses or structures in tidelands, except as authorized by G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, unless such structures \u201care necessary to accommodate a water dependent use.\u201d As to Commonwealth tidelands, such structure shall also \u201cserve a proper public purpose and that said purpose shall provide a greater public benefit than public detriment to the rights of the public in said lands.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 18, in turn, which was substantially amended in 1983, see St. 1983, c. 589, \u00a7 26, does allow the department to license nonwater-dependent uses of tidelands, but, pursuant to the 1983 amendments, if, and only if, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the department has made a written determination, following a public hearing, that the structure or fill \u201cshall serve a proper public purpose and that said purpose shall provide a greater public benefit than public detriment to the rights of the public in such lands.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 18 also allows the department to promulgate regulations for the implementation of its authority under G. L. c. 91.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In 1990, the department promulgated regulations as authorized by G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18. Those regulations indicate the areas subject to licensing and permitting by the department, which include all filled tidelands in the Commonwealth \u201cexcept for landlocked tidelands.\u201d 310 Code Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Reg. \u00a7 9.04(2) (1994).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is this exemption of all landlocked tidelands from any and all licensing requirements that concerns us here.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">In response to North Point\u2019s proposed project, the plaintiffs, in January, 2003, filed with the department a request for a determination of the applicability of G. L. c. 91 to the filled tidelands on the project site.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The department issued a negative determination of applicability on the basis that the site is located on landlocked tidelands and that, pursuant to the landlocked tidelands exemption discussed earlier, 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.04(2), the project is not subject to any licensing and permitting by the department. The plaintiffs appealed from the decision within the department, and following a hearing, an administrative magistrate issued a recommended final decision, granting summary decision to the department. That recommendation ultimately was adopted by the department\u2019s commissioner. The plaintiffs then filed their complaint in the Superior Court, appealing from the commissioner\u2019s final decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>2. <em>Discussion. </em>We now consider the department\u2019s authority to promulgate the landlocked tidelands exemption, 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.04(2). We do so under familiar standards. The department has \u201ca wide range of discretion in establishing the parameters of its authority pursuant to the enabling legislation.\u201d <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., </em>378 Mass. 519, 525 (1979). Where, as here, the administrative agency is vested with broad authority to effectuate the purposes of the legislation, we give deference to its expertise and experience. <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867 (1997). The principle of according weight to an agency\u2019s discretion, however, is \u201c \u2018one of deference, not abdication,\u2019 and this court will not hesitate to overrule agency interpretations of statutes or rules when those interpretations are arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Boston Preservation Alliance, Inc. </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>396 Mass. 489, 498 (1986), citing <em>Finkelstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976) (interpretation of rules). See <em>Protective Life </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 618-619 (1997) (interpretation of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Only the Commonwealth, \u201cor an entity to which the Legislature has delegated authority expressly, may act to further public trust rights.\u201d <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Barnstable, </em>432 Mass. 194, 197 (2000). \u201cThe Commonwealth may delegate, and has delegated, its authority to preserve and regulate Commonwealth tidelands to State agencies or municipalities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199 n.10. See <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>383 Mass. 895, 913-914 (1981), and cases cited. In enacting G. L. c. 91, the Legislature delegated at least some of that authority to the department. See <em>Fafard </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Barnstable, supra </em>at 200 n.ll (\u201cthe Commonwealth\u2019s authority and obligations under [G. L. c. 91] are not precisely coextensive with its authority and obligations under the public trust doctrine\u201d). The department, in turn, as authorized by G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, has promulgated regulations for the implementation of its authority under the statute. Although the plaintiffs do not dispute the department\u2019s authority, in general, to promulgate regulations, they contend that the department has acted in excess of its authority in exempting all landlocked tidelands from all licensing requirements. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">General Laws c. 91 sets out to \u201cpreserve and protect,\u201d under the department\u2019s watch, the public\u2019s rights in tidelands. Those rights can only be relinquished or extinguished by the Legislature. <em>Trio Algarvio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Protection, </em>440 Mass. 94, 97 (2003), citing <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra </em>at 902-903, and <em>Boston Waterfront Dev. Corp. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>378 Mass. 629, 645, 646 (1979). In the first of two advisory opinions issued in response to proposed legislation relative to tidelands within the city of Boston, five Justices stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u201c[A]cting consistently with appropriate limitations . . . the Legislature has the power to transfer or relinquish the Commonwealth\u2019s and the public\u2019s interests in tidelands within the Commonwealth. ... Of course, whether any such transfer or relinquishment should occur, and under what conditions beyond those mandated by constitutional considerations, is a matter for the Legislature . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>Opinions of the Justices, supra </em>at 902.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Pursuant to its power to do so, the Legislature has, in certain circumstances, relinquished or extinguished the public\u2019s rights in tidelands. See, e.g., St. 1983, c. 664, \u201cAn Act providing that a certain license to maintain existing fill or structures in certain tidewater of the Taunton River in the city of Fall River be irrevocable\u201d (Fall River Act), and St. 1983, c. 679, \u201cAn Act relative to certain tide waters in the city of New Bedford and the rights of the commonwealth of Massachusetts therein\u201d (New Bedford Act). When the Legislature takes such action, it does so explicitly. Both of those acts, for example, specifically \u201cdeclared relinquished and extinguished subject to compliance to the use and conditions set forth [herein]\u201d the public\u2019s rights in certain filled tidelands. St. 1983, c. 664, \u00a7 1. St. 1983, c. 679, \u00a7 1. See notes 23 &amp; 24, <em>infra. </em>In both acts the conditions require that the use of the land still confer certain public benefits. If compliance with those conditions ceases, title to the lands \u201cshall revert to the status held prior to the effective date of this act.\u201d St. 1983, c. 664, \u00a7 3. St. 1983, c. 679, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Unlike the Fall River and New Bedford Acts, the provisions of G. L. c. 91, which was amended in 1983 at the same time that the Legislature approved the Fall River and New Bedford Acts, contains no language suggesting that the statute is intended to relinquish or extinguish the public\u2019s right in any tidelands, filled or unfilled, landlocked or otherwise.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In fact the Legislature has considered, but never enacted, legislation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>would relinquish or extinguish rights in landlocked tidelands.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the department has broad discretion in the regulations that it promulgates under G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, see <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., </em>378 Mass. 519, 524-525 (1979), the department does not have the authority to relinquish or extinguish the public\u2019s rights in any of the Commonwealth\u2019s tidelands, except on terms expressly authorized by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">A central issue in this case therefore is whether the regulation in question, 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.04 (2),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> operates either to relinquish or extinguish the public\u2019s rights in the Commonwealth\u2019s tidelands or fails to provide for a method by which the department could determine the \u201cproper public purpose\u201d of nonwater-dependent uses of filled land. The purpose of G. L. c. 91, and the concomitant mandate to the department, is to preserve and protect the public\u2019s rights in the Commonwealth\u2019s tidelands. Those rights, as we have already noted, traditionally involve the use of tidelands for \u201cfishing, fowling and navigation.\u201d The public\u2019s interest in the tidelands, in other words, traditionally involves water-dependent use of the land. There is no suggestion that the proposed North Point project would involve any kind of water-dependent use. Indeed, because the tidelands on the project site are landlocked and filled, their very nature would preclude any such use. This does not, however, negate the applicability of \u00a7 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 18, as amended in 1983, the department is authorized to license both water- and nonwater-dependent uses of tidelands, but a nonwater-dependent use (such as the North Point filled land) may <em>only </em>be licensed if such use constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u201cproper public purpose.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> If landlocked tidelands are exempt entirely from the statutory licensing procedures, no opportunity exists for the department to determine, as it must under \u00a7 18, whether a proposed use of filled tidelands meets that requirement. The department has no authority to forgo its responsibility to preserve and protect the public\u2019s rights in tidelands (water dependent or nonwater dependent), whether for administrative convenience, conservation of the department\u2019s resources or any other laudable agency reason. By exempting filled \u201clandlocked\u201d tidelands from the statute\u2019s licensing requirements, the department is relinquishing all control over the use of the filled land. It does so without legislative authorization, effectively relinquishing all public rights that the Legislature has mandated be preserved through the licensing requirements.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">General Laws c. 91 does not define what constitutes a \u201cproper public purpose\u201d as used in \u00a7 18 of that chapter. Cf. <em>Opinions of the Justices, supra </em>at 906. But it is not our role to determine whether the proposed North Point project meets that statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>requirement. Nothing in the 1962 license granted to Boston and Maine indicates how the licensed use constitutes a proper public purpose or otherwise protects the public\u2019s interest in the land, because at the time the license was granted, the then-applicable version of \u00a7 18 did not require either including such information in the license or making a specific finding that the use met a proper public purpose.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Now, however, \u00a7 18 provides that the department may license nonwater-dependent use of filled tidelands only after holding a public hearing and making a written determination that the use \u201cshall\u201d serve a proper public purpose. Despite the department\u2019s broad discretion to promulgate regulations, <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Med., supra, </em>nothing gives the department the authority to exempt tidelands \u2014 landlocked and filled or otherwise \u2014 from the existing statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The department argues that it is not \u201csurrendering public rights by declining jurisdiction\u201d over landlocked tidelands. In similar fashion, North Point claims that an exemption from administrative licensing \u201cdoes not amount to a relinquishment of any public trust rights.\u201d Beyond those conclusory statements, the defendants do not explain how a \u201cproper public purpose\u201d in nonwater-dependent filled tidelands could possibly be served <em>unless </em>the department retained jurisdiction over them. It is the department\u2019s licensing procedure, authorized by G. L. c. 91, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>\u00a7 18, and as constrained by the requirements of that section, that serves to ensure the existence of a \u201cproper public purpose\u201d in the use of all filled tidelands. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The department has attempted to fashion an exemption from the licensing requirements that is narrow and directed only to nonwater-dependent uses of filled tidelands. Nevertheless, by exempting such tidelands from the licensing requirements of G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, entirely, the department has relinquished its obligation to ensure that all nonwater-dependent uses of filled tidelands serve a \u201cproper public purpose,\u201d as the Legislature has mandated. The exemption exceeds the department\u2019s authority and is invalid.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The department has limited resources and does not believe that the de minimis impact of development on landlocked tidelands on the Commonwealth\u2019s waterways merits the regulatory burden of licensing projects thereon. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 9.00. We must give deference to the department\u2019s \u201cexpertise and experience.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Inst. of Tech. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>425 Mass. 856, 867 (1997). We must also, however, presume that when the Legislature amended G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, in 1983, it did so recognizing the administrative burden imposed by subjecting <em>all </em>nonwater-dependent projects on filled tidelands, landlocked and otherwise, to the licensing requirement, and that the Legislature deemed this burden acceptable for the resulting protection of the public interest. Should the Legislature decide otherwise, it may, of course, enact legislation that it deems appropriate to relinquish these public interests, as it has done on previous occasions. See, e.g., note 16, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">For more than one and one-half centuries, the Legislature has been fully cognizant of its authority to relinquish the public\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>rights in tidelands by means of appropriate legislation. This authority belongs to the Legislature alone. The rights of the public in Commonwealth tidelands \u2014 filled, landlocked, or otherwise \u2014 cannot be relinquished by departmental regulation, regardless of the fact that the department has proffered potentially worthy public policy rationales in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because the department has exceeded its authority by promulgating a regulation that relinquishes its obligations under G. L. c. 91, we reverse the decision of the judge in the Superior Court. Judgment shall enter in the Superior Court remanding the case to the department for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Small portions of the site are located in Boston and Somerville.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The original proposed project provided for a park system that included a 5.5 acre \u201ccentral park.\u201d According to the plaintiffs, the 5.5 acre park has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>eliminated.

Efekta Schools, Inc., which operates an education and travel business, is an abutter to the project site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\">The department \u201cassumes\u201d that the plaintiffs meant to file their complaint pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 7, which provides for \u201cjudicial review of any regulation,\u201d rather than \u00a7 14. Although the plaintiffs do challenge the validity of the regulation, they also challenge the department\u2019s application of the regulation in this case and seek, among other things, an order setting aside the department\u2019s decision. Their complaint is properly brought under \u00a7 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\">In their complaint, the plaintiffs contend that the department incorrectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>determined that the North Point project site tidelands are \u201clandlocked\u201d because the Gilmore Bridge, which forms one border of the triangular-shaped site, does not \u201centirely separate\u201d the filled tidelands from flowed tidelands. The plaintiffs do not contest this issue in their appeal, focusing instead on the validity of the exemption and its application to the project site, but we briefly summarize the proceedings on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">If the tidelands were not landlocked, the project site would not be exempt from the licensing requirements of G. L. c. 91. In the negative determination of applicability, the department stated that the \u201cdetermination as to whether an elevated public roadway, in existence as of January 1, 1984, qualifies as a landlocking structure is made on a case by case basis by the Department,\u201d and that, in this case, \u201ceven though Charlestown Avenue [which traverses the Gilmore Bridge] is an elevated public way, it serves to entirely separate the site from the Charles River, because it is low in elevation and is supported by a significant number of closely-spaced bridge piers and other at-grade structural elements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The administrative magistrate, in his recommended final decision, agreed that the tidelands are landlocked, but rejected the department\u2019s site-specific basis for the determination, and concluded instead \u201cthat elevated public ways separate filled from flowed tidelands in the same manner as do at-grade public ways.\u201d The department\u2019s commissioner adopted the recommended final decision, but also noted that the department\u2019s \u201ccaveat\u201d that whether something qualifies as a landlocking structure is made on a case-by-case basis is an \u201cappropriate precaution given the complexities of Chapter 91 jurisdiction.\u201d The judge in the Superior Court affirmed the final decision of the commissioner, including, specifically, the finding that the tidelands are landlocked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The second advisory opinion, <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>383 Mass. 927 (1981), submitted the same day, followed the same reasoning. The proposed legislation to which the Justices were responding in both advisory opinions was never enacted. This does not derogate the Justices\u2019 reasoning regarding legislative authority to relinquish or extinguish public trust rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Extensive amendments to G. L. c. 91 were approved on December 17, 1983. St. 1983, c. 589. The Fall River Act (St. 1983, c. 664) was approved on December 20, 1983, and the New Bedford Act (St. 1983, c. 679) was approved on December 21, 1983. It cannot be, then, that the Legislature was indifferent to the possibility of including language in G. L. c. 91 specifically relinquishing or extinguishing rights, if that was what the Legislature desired. Further amendments to G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, enacted in 1986, delegated to the department the authority to promulgate regulations pursuant to the 1983 statute. St. 1986, c. 348, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b367-7\">A bill was proposed in 1990 to amend the General Laws by adding a new chapter, 91B, entitled \u201cAn Act releasing residual rights of the commonwealth in and to landlocked lands.\u201d 1990 House Doc. No. 5815. The bill would have freed landlocked lands \u201cof all residual rights, and all residual rights in and to all such lands\u201d would have been \u201cabsolutely and irrevocably extinguished.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3.

See St. 1986, c. 348, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Water-dependent uses are presumed to meet the public purpose requirement. 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.31(2)(a) (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">The defendants argue that there is no rational reason why the Legislature would prohibit the department from exempting landlocked tidelands from licensure but allow the department to exempt from licensure certain activities, such as a change in use in certain circumstances on filled land. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. 9.05(3). A blanket abdication of departmental oversight over all landlocked tidelands differs substantively from the express, limited exemptions contained in 301 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.05(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Furthermore, the only issue we are asked to address is the validity of the landlocked tidelands exemption as it exists in 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.04 (2). We have not been asked to hypothesize as to the outcome of this case had the department included certain activities involving the use of landlocked tidelands as a category of \u201cactivities not requiring a license or permit\u201d under 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.05(3) (2000). The department\u2019s decision to exempt all landlocked tidelands from the definition of the \u201cgeographic areas . . . subject to licensing and permitting by the Department under [these regulations],\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 9.04, is the only regulation we consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">North Point implies that <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>383 Mass. 895, 910 (1981), where five Justices stated that \u201c[n]either the public nor the Commonwealth has a continuing interest in these tidelands,\u201d carries some substantive weight that should inform our decision here. To the contrary, the fact that the Legislature declined to enact the legislation to which this advisory opinion was addressed is prima facie evidence that the Legislature has not authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the department to exempt entirely landlocked tidelands from the requirement that one\u2019s use of tidelands satisfy \u201ca proper public purpose.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\">General Laws c. 91, \u00a7 18, as amended by St. 1956, c. 528, stated: \u201cEvery license granted under this chapter shall be signed by the department, shall state the terms on which it is granted and specify by metes, bounds and otherwise the location, dimensions and limits and the mode of performing the work authorized thereby. Before a license is granted, the department shall give notice to the aldermen or selectmen of the town where the work is to be performed that they may be heard, except that in the case of a proposed bridge, dam or similar structure across a river, cove or inlet, the department shall give notice to the aldermen or selectmen of every municipality into which the tidewater of said river, cove or inlet extends. The recital in a license that a notice required by law has been given, or that the aldermen or selectmen have not objected, shall be conclusive evidence of such facts. The department shall keep a record of each license and a plan of the work or structure. Such license shall be void unless, within one year after its date, it and the accompanying plan are recorded in the registry of deeds for the county or district where the work is to be performed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">The plaintiffs argue that the regulatory exemption also allows previously licensed uses of tidelands that have become landlocked to avoid the change-in-use provision of G. L. c. 91, \u00a7 18, which states that a change in use or structural alteration of a licensed structure or fill \u201cshall require\u201d a new license, issued by the department in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 91. Because we have determined that the landlocked tidelands exemption itself is invalid, we need not address that question, nor the additional arguments raised by the plaintiffs regarding the application of the exemption to the North Point project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Because our decision results in a remand to the department for further proceedings, we need not consider the argument raised by the plaintiffs in their reply brief, and North Point\u2019s responsive motion to strike, that by applying for a license pursuant to G. L. c. 91 to build a storm drainage system under the project site, North Point acknowledges that G. L. c. 91 governs the entire project.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
