During the brawl, the defendant stabbed Colono, who later died. The defendant was indicted and tried on a charge of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The central issue at trial was whether the defendant acted in self-defense. To support his theory that Colono or Rodriguez started the fight, the defendant sought to introduce evidence of each man\u2019s prior violent behavior. At the time of trial, the law of self-defense in Massachusetts permitted a defendant knowledgeable about the victim\u2019s violent character to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s specific violent acts or reputation for violence to demonstrate the defendant\u2019s reasonable apprehension for his or her safety. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fontes, </em>396 Mass. 733, 735-736 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>365 Mass. 496, 501-502 (1974). But the law did not permit a defendant unaware of the victim\u2019s violent propensity to introduce evidence of that propensity to show who was the first aggressor. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>431 Mass. 282, 291 (2000), and cases cited. Here, the defendant knew nothing of the violent histories of Colono or Rodriguez, who were strangers to him, and the trial judge disallowed the defendant\u2019s repeated attempts to introduce evidence of Colono or Rodriguez\u2019s violent pasts to demonstrate that either had a violent character.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">The jury convicted the defendant of voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">While the record was being assembled for appeal, we decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649 (2005) <em>(Adjutant). </em>There we held that \u201cwhere the identity of the first aggressor is in dispute and the victim has a history of violence,\u201d the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>has the discretion to admit \u201cevidence of specific acts of prior violent conduct that the victim is reasonably alleged to have initiated, to support the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664. Declaring that the decision marked a \u201cnew common-law rule of evidence,\u201d we stated that the rule \u201cshall apply only prospectively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 667. But contrary to our regular practice when establishing a new rule not constitutionally mandated, see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, ante </em>122, 124, 147 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 248 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 720-722 &amp; n.10 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 930 (2005), we afforded the defendant in <em>Adjutant </em>the benefit of the new role, for reasons we explain below.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Within days of our deciding <em>Adjutant, </em>the judge here (who coincidentally had also been the trial judge in Adjutant) scheduled a hearing \u201cto determine whether the conviction of the defendant should be vacated and a new trial ordered on the grounds that, although the court views the evidence as legally sufficient to support the verdict returned by the jury, the integrity of the evidence has been rendered suspect as a result of the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>[Adjutant].\u201d </em>She also solicited legal memoranda from the parties. The defendant moved for a new trial, citing Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2), 378 Mass. 896 (1979), which the Commonwealth opposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">After a hearing, the judge issued a thoughtful memorandum of decision and order, allowing the defendant\u2019s motion, vacating his conviction, and ordering a new trial. She concluded, in the exercise of her broad discretion under role 25 (b) (2), that the integrity of the defendant\u2019s trial was compromised by his inability to introduce evidence of the violent pasts of Colono and Rodriguez. She further concluded that, like the defendant in <em>Adjutant, </em>this defendant was entitled to a new trial because the propensity evidence he had sought to introduce was probative of the main issue in the case: the identity of the first aggressor. Having moved unsuccessfully for reconsideration, the Commonwealth appealed. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We now affirm the judge\u2019s order granting the defendant \u00bf new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">1. <em>Background. </em>A consideration of the facts in evidence, as well as the facts excluded by the judge, is necessary for resolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>tian of the central issue in this appeal. We therefore describe them in some detail, beginning with the evidence before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">a. <em>The evidence at trial, </em>i. <em>Events preceding the fight. </em>During the evening of April 11, 2003, Rodriguez was visiting his mother\u2019s apartment in Lynn with his girl friend, Giselle Abreu. The two planned to join Colono (Rodriguez\u2019s cousin) and go to a bar in Somerville. Before leaving Lynn for the evening, Rodriguez and Abreu had an argument. At trial, each claimed the argument was only oral, but a percipient witness, Shawn Bates, testified that he saw Rodriguez beat Abreu. Bates telephoned the police, and the responding officers briefly questioned Rodriguez and Abreu. The incident unnerved Rodriguez and delayed the couple\u2019s outing \u2014 midnight came and went before they left to pick up Colono.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">They drove Rodriguez\u2019s mother\u2019s automobile, a Chevrolet four-door sedan, taking with them a six-pack of beer and one half-pint bottle of brandy that Rodriguez had purchased for Colono; Rodriguez was twenty-one years of age at the time, and Colono was eighteen years of age. Earlier in the evening, Rodriguez had consumed some beer and whiskey. On their way to Colono\u2019s apartment in Cambridge, Rodriguez drove, but after collecting Colono, Rodriguez switched seats with Abreu. Rodriguez did not have a driver\u2019s license, and although Abreu also had no license, Rodriguez thought that it would be less likely that the police would stop the automobile if a woman was driving. Rodriguez sat in the front passenger seat with Abreu while Colono sat in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">The three decided to go to the Pizza Ring restaurant on Western Avenue. Abreu stopped in front of the restaurant. Rodriguez went inside and placed an order, then returned to the automobile, and the three waited until the pizza was ready. As they waited, Colono drank a couple of beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">While the preceding events were unfolding, the following events were simultaneously transpiring. At about 9:30 p.m. on April 11, the defendant met a friend, Jennifer Hansen, and her friend at a diner in Davis Square. While there, the defendant drank a couple of whiskeys with soda. After about forty-five minutes, the three went to a nearby pub. There, the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>drank two sodas to which he added whiskey from a half-pint flask he had purchased on the way to the pub. At approximately 11:40 p.m., the three made their way to the Western Front, a bar and club near Central Square. The three drank the rest of the defendant\u2019s whiskey and danced, staying until the club closed at 1:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Hansen and her friend took a cab home, while the defendant began walking to his home, along Western Avenue. His route took him toward the Pizza Ring where Colono, Rodriguez, and Abreu were waiting in the automobile for their pizza. As he approached the Pizza Ring, the defendant was talking on his cellular telephone to his girl friend, Janice Olmstead. Shortly thereafter, the fight occurred between the defendant on the one hand, and Colono and Rodriguez on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">ii. <em>The fight. </em>From the perspective of Rodriguez and Abreu, the fight happened as follows. As the defendant approached their automobile, he was talking on his cellular telephone and appeared to be intoxicated and stumbling. Colono said, \u201cLook at this dude walking down the street,\u201d and everyone in the automobile began laughing. Colono\u2019s window was open, and as the defendant passed, Colono either said that the defendant was \u201cshitfaced\u201d (Abreu\u2019s version) or told the defendant, \u201cGet off the street\u201d or \u201cGet off the street, shitface\u201d (Rodriguez\u2019s versions). Shortly after the defendant passed the automobile, he ended his telephone conversation, turned around, and came back to Colono\u2019s window. Rodriguez said to his cohorts that the defendant had \u201ca lot of nerve\u201d coming back to the automobile. The defendant leaned down, looked in the window, and asked Colono either, \u201cWere you talking to me?\u201d (Rodriguez\u2019s version), or \u201cExcuse me. Did you say something?\u201d (Abreu\u2019s version).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Colono answered, \u201cYes. Do you want to do something about it?,\u201d to which the defendant responded, \u201cYes,\u201d and opened Colono\u2019s door.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Colono got out of the automobile \u201cas fast as he could\u201d and started \u201cswinging.\u201d Abreu said she saw \u201c[p]unches everywhere,\u201d but did not see who threw the first punch.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>According to Rodriguez, as the defendant and Colono wrestled, the defendant pushed Colono against a nearby brick wall and put Colono in a headlock \u2014 the defendant, standing over Colono, held Colono\u2019s head against the defendant\u2019s chest while Colono tried unsuccessfully to punch his way free. Abreu testified that the defendant appeared to be hitting Colono in the stomach and upper body and was \u201cgetting the best of\u201d Colono. Rodriguez got out of the automobile to help Colono but was slightly delayed because the door was broken: he had to open his window and then open his door using the outside handle. When Rodriguez went to Colono\u2019s aid, he punched the defendant in the head and pulled the defendant to the ground. The defendant, Colono, and Rodriguez were of approximately the same height and weight. When Rodriguez pulled the defendant off Colono, the defendant fell on his backside (Abreu\u2019s version) or fell on his knees (Rodriguez\u2019s version), and Colono, who was wearing construction boots, tried to kick the defendant in the head but missed. Colono and Rodriguez then backed away and the defendant stood up. Colono told Rodriguez to be careful because the defendant had a knife, and then Colono got back in the automobile. At that point, both Rodriguez and Abreu saw for the first time that the defendant was holding a knife.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although neither Rodriguez nor Abreu knew it yet, Colono had been slashed twice (in the abdomen and arm) and stabbed three times (twice in the chest and once in the abdomen).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Rodriguez put up his fists and asked whether the defendant was \u201cready for a piece of\u201d him, to which the defendant replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Rodriguez then opened his hands to show he was carrying no weapon, said the fight was over, and got back into the front passenger seat of the automobile. Thinking the defendant would telephone the police, and wanting to avoid having to explain to the authorities what had happened (and concerned about the presence of alcohol in the automobile and that Abreu was driving without a driver\u2019s license), Abreu and her companions drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The defendant\u2019s version of the fight differed markedly from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>that of Abren and Rodriguez. According to him, as he passed the automobile while talking on the telephone with Olmstead, he heard the people in the automobile \u201chailing\u201d him or \u201ccalling out something.\u201d He told Olmstead he would call her back, put his telephone in his pocket, and walked back to the automobile to see what the occupants needed, believing they might need directions. He walked to the driver\u2019s window and saw three people in the automobile, two men in the front seats and a man or woman in the back seat; he was \u201cone hundred percent sure\u201d that he went to the driver\u2019s window, and he said that the driver was a man. With his hands at his sides, empty, he asked the driver, \u201cExcuse me. Were you talking to me?\u201d The driver answered, \u201cYeah. I\u2019m talking to you, bitch.\u201d The defendant, a \u201clittle put off,\u201d said, \u201cWell, fuck you then,\u201d and turned to walk away; he never touched the automobile. The man in the driver\u2019s seat then \u201ccame right out\u201d of the automobile, hit the defendant in the nose, and slammed the defendant in the head with his fists. Although the defendant tried to stop him, a second man joined the fight \u201clike that fast,\u201d hitting the defendant from behind; the next thing he knew, the defendant was on the ground trying to cover his head. The defendant thought he could not escape the beating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201c[T]he worst was the guy in the back. He just kept on pounding me, like pow, like lights go out, come back in. It\u2019s like not just stars. It\u2019s like everything goes out and then everything comes back in. And it was just like over, and over, and over. And it was like that fast. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cI was thinking: What is going to stop these guys? Like they already had me down. . . . [Tjhere\u2019s nothing to stop these guys. Who is going to stop them? There\u2019s nobody on the street. There\u2019s nothing going on. . . . [A]re they going to know to stop before I\u2019m dead? Are they going to stop when I\u2019m unconscious? ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u201c[T]he only thing I can think of is like: Okay, okay, okay. Get your knife out, get your knife out. Get them away from you. . . . I\u2019m scrambling. There\u2019s still hits like this [indicating] from above . . . like a pile driver ... it just keeps going .... I pulled my knife out of my pocket, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>and then I opened it up, and the next image I have is . . . looking at it .. . . And I\u2019m like: All right. It\u2019s going to get them away. It\u2019s going to get them away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The defendant then stabbed and slashed upward with the knife, trying to get the man in front of him away so that he could escape. Although he knew he had made contact with the man, he did not think that the man was seriously injured: when the defendant was up and stumbled away, both assailants \u201cbolted\u201d to the automobile. The defendant, thinking the men were \u201cgoing for something big, like to take me down,\u201d scrambled for his telephone, hoping the men would think he was dialing 911 and leave. The men and Abreu then drove away.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">iii. <em>Aftermath of the fight. </em>On leaving the scene, Rodriguez discovered that Colono had been stabbed. The driver stopped at a convenience store to look for a public telephone.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As Rodriguez was shouting for help from people in the area, a woman who was nearby used a cellular telephone to dial 911. An ambulance arrived and took Colono to Beth Israel Hospital while police officers questioned Rodriguez.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Rodriguez told the police that he had picked up Colono at the Pizza Ring and that when Colono entered the automobile, he \u201ckeeled over in the back seat.\u201d Rodriguez denied witnessing a fight. He also said that Colono had told him he had been \u201cjumped\u201d and stabbed by \u201ca bunch of white guys,\u201d and that Colono had \u201cfucked up this drunk white dude.\u201d Abreu corroborated Rodriguez\u2019s account, telling the police that, while she and Rodriguez were driving down Western Avenue, they discovered Colono enmeshed in a fight with a white man, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>they pulled over and saw the man holding a knife, and that Colono got in the back seat and they drove off.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Rodriguez\u2019s brother drove Rodriguez and Abreu to the hospital where Colono had been taken; the automobile in which they had been driving had been impounded. At about 3:15 a.m., Colono died. The cause of his death was multiple stab wounds. At the hospital, the alcohol content of Colono\u2019s blood measured .082 per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">While those events involving Colono and his cohorts were transpiring, other developments were taking place concerning the defendant. Shortly after the fight, at about 1:56 a.m., the defendant dialed 911 and reported that he had \u201cwitnessed a young man getting stabbed.\u201d He told the 911 operator his location and, when asked whether the victim was with him, said, \u201cNo, sir. I just saw it happen. I\u2019m, I\u2019m just a fucking bystander, sir.\u201d When asked about the attacker, the defendant said, \u201cSome guy came out of a car in a fucking black jacket, stabbed this other guy. So the guy, he just screamed, \u2018I\u2019ve been stabbed,\u2019 and that was it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Shortly thereafter, a police officer responded to the scene and the defendant told him that he had seen a stabbing down the street, and that both the victim and the perpetrators had run away in the same direction. As the officer left to look for the victim and assailants, another officer took over questioning the defendant. The defendant told that officer that he had seen multiple attackers assault a \u201ckid\u201d; the defendant also mentioned something about a stabbing but said he was confused. The defendant had a welt on his forehead and, while rubbing it, claimed he had been injured while trying to help the victim. He told another officer at the scene conflicting stories: first, that no one had been stabbed but, later, that someone had been stabbed and that the defendant had intervened because he had a penknife. The defendant denied needing medical treatment and, after giving the authorities his identification information, was allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>leave. At trial, the defendant testified that he had given officials at the scene incorrect accounts of the fight because he was concussed, he was not thinking clearly, he wanted to go home, and he did not want to press charges for fear that the assailants would come after him.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">At 2:41 a.m., the defendant left a message on Hansen\u2019s cellular telephone, which was played to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u201cHey, Jen. How\u2019s it going? I just, um, I got attacked. I just got attacked by a group, um \u2014 . I fended them off, [inaudible] ha ha. I stabbed him a couple of times and \u2014 don\u2019t repeat this to police, um, but, yeah. I\u2019ve got a fucking killer headache. I just walked a couple miles home. I think I\u2019ve got a concussion. Um, anyway, I had a swell time tonight. I hope you guys, um, made it home . . . okay. Bye-bye.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Several hours later, two police officers went to the defendant\u2019s apartment and took him to the Cambridge police station for questioning. The defendant felt \u201cbeat up,\u201d his jaw and face hurt, he had a \u201cnasty total-body kind of ache,\u201d and he had a headache similar to when he had sustained concussions in the past from playing rugby.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Over the course of the morning, the headache got worse and focused on the back of his head where he had been hit. On the way to the police station, the defendant, referring to his welt, said \u2014 \u201ckind of in jest,\u201d according to one of the officers \u2014 \u201cYou guys must raise them tough around here. They really know how to hit around here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">At the station, the defendant (after waiving his Miranda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>rights) told the officers that, while walking down Western Avenue earlier in the morning, he saw \u201csome dudes sitting and leaning up against a car,\u201d one of whom was white or Hispanic. The defendant passed them, turned around, saw a scuffle, and went to \u201chelp break it up.\u201d As the defendant approached the fight \u2014 which involved two \u201cguys\u201d against one \u201ckid\u201d \u2014 one of the attackers told the defendant, \u201cFuck off, bitch,\u201d and \u201cpopped\u201d the defendant in the head. One of the assailants then pulled a knife and \u201csomeone\u201d got stabbed. The defendant then walked away and dialed 911. Several times during the interview, the defendant said that he was \u201creally drunk last night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">After the defendant gave that statement, a third police officer informed the defendant that Colono had died. The defendant responded, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. I\u2019m sorry, sir. I lied to those guys,\u201d meaning (according to the defendant) that he had lied to the other officers about how the fight had happened and about having been \u201creally drunk.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He subsequently told the police that he had sustained concussions in the past from playing rugby, but denied needing medical attention. At about 8:30 a.m., the defendant was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">After he was booked, the defendant complained of a headache and an emergency medical technician (EMT) took him to Cambridge City Hospital. He told the EMT that he had been punched in the head; that, after the incident, his vision was spotty; that he had a history of concussions; and that he believed he might have sustained a concussion from the fight. At the hospital, he told a physician that he had been kicked and punched, but the physician saw no signs of head or neck trauma. Thereafter, the defendant was taken back to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The following day, the defendant returned to the hospital, complaining of a headache, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. During that visit, the defendant told the same physician he had seen the previous day that he had been struck in the head with a fist or blunt object and had lost consciousness for several seconds. The physician again concluded that there were no signs of head injury. The symptoms that the defendant reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>were similar to those he had experienced when he had sustained concussions from playing rugby. According to Dr. David Ross, a physician who had treated the defendant for those earlier concussions, the defendant then complained of headache, confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, and loss of memory \u2014 among the most common symptoms of concussions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. Ross also testified that there usually are no external signs of a concussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Another physician, Dr. Jeremy Schmahmann, had not examined the defendant but, based on reviews of the defendant\u2019s medical history and the testimony of the medical and police personnel who had interviewed the defendant after the fight, concluded that the defendant\u2019s symptoms were consistent with a concussion. He also testified that the physician who had examined the defendant at Cambridge City Hospital did not perform all of the possible tests used to diagnose a concussion. Finally, Dr. Schmahmann explained that fatal trauma can be caused by being beaten in the head with fists or by being kicked in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">We now summarize the evidence proffered by the defendant that was excluded by the judge at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">b. <em>Evidence of violent histories of Colono and Rodriguez. </em>Based on the defendant\u2019s witness list, which included numerous people who had knowledge of Colono and Rodriguez\u2019s violent backgrounds, the Commonwealth filed a pretrial motion in limine to prevent the defendant from introducing any evidence to show that either Colono or Rodriguez had violent propensities.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In reply, defense counsel acknowledged that Massachusetts law at the time did not permit him to introduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Colono or Rodriguez\u2019s prior bad acts for propensity purposes where the defendant did not know of those acts, but argued that the evidence would be admissible under existing evidentiary rules, such as those regarding impeachment and state of mind. Following a hearing, the judge precluded the defendant from mentioning Colono\u2019s prior convictions or other bad acts in opening statements; she instructed the defendant that he could refer to Rodriguez\u2019s record \u201cvery sparingly,\u201d concluding: \u201cWe will see what happens during the course of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ATL\">Once the trial was under way, defense counsel, while cross-examining Rodriguez, sought to explore whether Colono had violent tendencies \u2014 counsel elicited from Rodriguez that Colono was \u201chot headed,\u201d and counsel asked Rodriguez whether Colono \u201cwould make comments to people, and then there would be trouble.\u201d The prosecutor objected, and during a sidebar discussion defense counsel claimed that his line of questioning was relevant to Colono and Rodriguez\u2019s states of mind, and who during the fight \u201cinstantly\u201d had the \u201cupper hand.\u201d The prosecutor complained that the evidence sought to be elicited was inadmissible prior bad acts evidence for propensity purposes. The judge allowed defense counsel limited questioning regarding Rodriguez\u2019s state of mind. Defense counsel\u2019s subsequent questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>of Rodriguez elicited no testimony regarding any specific violent acts of Colono or the violent reputation of Colono.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Later during cross-examination of Rodriguez, defense counsel made an offer of proof, seeking permission to introduce evidence that Rodriguez had told a defense investigator that Colono had never lost a fight except one with his brother. Counsel called the matter \u201ccritical in this case,\u201d saying that it related to \u201c[w]ho was the first aggressor ... the believability of whether [the victim] would wait for [the defendant] to open the door to the car before flying out.\u201d Counsel also sought to explore Colono\u2019s \u201cstreet fighting ability as compared to [the defendant\u2019s].\u201d \u201c[T]he issue is who started it, whether [the defendant] was the initial aggressor, whether [the victim] was, whether it\u2019s reasonable to assume that given that it started as a fight that [the defendant] immediately had the upper hand.\u201d The prosecutor again complained that counsel was attempting to introduce improper propensity evidence, and the judge did not allow counsel to introduce evidence regarding Colono\u2019s fighting abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Finally, shortly before defense counsel cross-examined Rodriguez\u2019s brother, the prosecutor complained that counsel wished to pursue a line of questioning regarding whether Rodriguez and Colono \u201cgrew up fighting.\u201d The judge concluded: \u201cHistory of combative prior acts of combat or fighting? That\u2019s not coming in. Characterizations are not coming in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">We turn now to consider the legal claims on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">2. <em>Propriety of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. </em>The defendant has moved to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, arguing that no appeal lies from the allowance of a motion for a new trial under Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2). To be sure, the defendant cited rule 25 (b) (2) in his motion for a new trial, and the judge cited that rule in her decision. But the substance of the motion was more in the nature of one filed under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). Rather than claiming that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, the defendant challenged the fairness of the trial on the ground that he was unable to introduce evidence relevant to his self-defense theory. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>393 Mass. 318, 322-324 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>(1984) (pleadings to be treated according to nature and substance rather than technical form); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cornish, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 173, 178-179 (1989) (treating rule 25 [b] [2] motion as rule 30 [b] motion where judge was concerned about trustworthiness of evidence, fairness, and interests of justice rather than about verdicts being against weight of evidence). Pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (8), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), the Commonwealth may appeal from the allowance of a motion for a new trial under rule 30 (b). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 571-572 (1986) (treating defendant\u2019s postverdict motion for mistrial as rule 30 [b] motion, and thus recognizing Commonwealth\u2019s right of appeal under rule 30 [c] [8]). The Commonwealth\u2019s appeal is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">3. <em>Propriety of the order granting the defendant a new trial. </em>A judge may grant a new trial under rule 30 (b) \u201cat any time if it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>392 Mass. 493, 497 (1984). \u201c[T]he granting of a new trial is a decision firmly committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge [who] has the advantage of firsthand evaluation of the witnesses and the evidence at trial. . . . Our task is only to ensure that there exists in the record before us evidence to support the judge\u2019s decision to order a new trial\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, supra </em>at 324. \u201c[T]he judge\u2019s ruling will be affirmed unless \u2018no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by [her].\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Candelario, </em>446 Mass. 847, 858 (2006), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodreau, </em>442 Mass. 341, 348 (2004). Reversal for abuse of discretion is \u201cextremely rare.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>13 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Ct. 10, 19 (1982). Having reviewed the entire case, we conclude that the judge did not abuse her discretion in granting the defendant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The relevant law concerning self-defense is as follows. \u201c[T]he right of self-defense ordinarily cannot be claimed by a person who provokes or initiates an assault unless that person withdraws in good faith from the conflict and announces his intention to retire.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>375 Mass. 768, 772 (1978). Even if a defendant does not initiate the fight (or withdraws after initiating it), where he uses deadly force \u2014 as the defendant did here by stabbing Colono with a knife, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toon, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 644 n.3 (2002) \u2014 tibie defendant is not entitled to an instruction on self-defense unless there is \u201cevidence warranting at least a reasonable doubt\u201d that he \u201c(1) had reasonable ground to believe and actually did believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, from which he could save himself only by using deadly force, (2) had availed himself of all proper means to avoid physical combat before resorting to the use of deadly force, and (3) used no more force than was reasonably necessary in all the circumstances of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 450 (1980), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, 316 </em>Mass. 201, 208 (1978). In determining whether a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense, \u201call reasonable inferences should be resolved in favor of the defendant, and, no matter how incredible his testimony, that testimony must be treated as true.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>428 Mass. 393, 395 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">We now apply those legal principles to this case. The identity of the first aggressor was hotly contested at trial. In her opening statement, the prosecutor repeatedly asserted that, when the defendant approached the automobile, he had his knife \u201cready\u201d; that the defendant opened the automobile door; and that Abreu, Rodriguez, and Colono drove away after the fight because they did not want the police to blame them \u201cfor what [the defendant] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>had started.\u201d Defense counsel, in his opening, claimed that the defendant was not holding the knife when he approached the automobile; did not touch the door; and was walking away from the automobile when one of the men \u201cexplode[d] out,\u201d accompanied immediately thereafter by the other man.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">During the presentation of the evidence, the prosecutor specifically elicited testimony from Rodriguez and Abreu to substantiate the idea that the defendant had started the fight, while defense counsel specifically elicited testimony from the defendant to support the notion that Rodriguez or Colono had started it. And in closing argument, each party emphasized its view of how the fight began: the prosecutor repeatedly said that the defendant became the aggressor by opening the automobile door, while defense counsel reiterated his theme that the defendant had acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">The Commonwealth argues that, questions of first aggressor aside, the defendant\u2019s self-defense theory necessarily fails \u2014 i.e., that he was not entitled to a jury instruction on self-defense \u2014 because the jury could not, as a matter of law, have formed a reasonable doubt concerning any of the three <em>Harrington </em>factors discussed earlier. We disagree. Under the defendant\u2019s version of the fight \u2014 which we must accept for purposes of examining whether he was entitled to an instruction on self-defense, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>\u2014 one of the men \u201ccame right out\u201d of the automobile and punched him; the defendant tried to stop the assailant but a second man immediately joined the fight, hitting the defendant from behind; the next thing he knew, the defendant was on the ground trying to cover his head; Colono and Rodriguez were of comparable size and weight to the defendant, and Rodriguez was muscular and worked as a bouncer; the defendant was being \u201cpound[ed] . . . over, and over, and over\u201d; nobody else was present to help the defendant; he thought he could not escape the beating and thought his assailants were going to beat him unconscious or kill him; he used his knife in order to get the assailants away from him; he suffered a welt on his forehead and his face was swollen; and a medical expert testified that the defendant\u2019s symptoms following the fight were consistent with a concussion, and that fatal trauma can be caused by being beaten in the head with fists. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>In light of that evidence, the jury could have formed a reasonable doubt about the defendant\u2019s duty to retreat, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pike, supra </em>at 398-399; the reasonableness of Ms belief that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, from wMch he could save himself only by using deadly force; and that he used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 988, 989-990 (1984) (defendant entitled to self-defense instruction where victim and victim\u2019s brother attacked defendant; defendant drew knife only when second assailant was at his back; defendant intended to use knife to fend off rather than stab), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, 66 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 548, 554-555 (2006) (defendant not entitled to self-defense instruction where victim alone punched defendant, using only \u201cbottom of Ms fists\u201d; no indication victim Mt defendant with degree of force likely to cause serious bodily harm; defendant had no injuries).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Because the evidence allowed the jury to form a reasonable doubt about each of the <em>Harrington </em>prerequisites for self-defense, the question of who was the first aggressor \u2014 the threshold prerequisite for self-defense \u2014 was key. Thus, we now consider how the defendant and the judge addressed that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Havmg carefully reviewed the record, it is apparent that the defendant sought, albeit unsuccessfully, to capitalize on evidence of Colono and Rodriguez\u2019s violent pasts for purposes of establisMng that one or the other was the first aggressor. To support Ms self-defense theory, the defendant assembled a list of witnesses who had knowledge of numerous prior violent acts of Colono and Rodriguez. See note 12, <em>supra. </em>He also attempted at various turns during trial (set forth in detail above) to introduce evidence of Colono and Rodriguez\u2019s fighting Mstories and abilities. The judge, however, prevented him from introducing such evidence. In light of those various attempts by the defendant to introduce evidence of Colono and Rodriguez\u2019s violent predispositions, we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant failed to raise the matter at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">We therefore turn to consider whether the judge abused her discretion in granting the defendant a new trial. After the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>defendant was convicted and sentenced but before Ms appeal \u2014 and thus before Ms conviction became final \u2014 we released our opimon in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649 (2005). In that case, we announced a new role granting trial judges the discretion m self-defense cases to admit prior bad act evidence of victims \u2014 even if unknown to the defendant \u2014 for puiposes of illuminatmg the identity of the first aggressor. See <em>id. </em>at 664. Although we said m <em>Adjutant </em>that the new rule announced there applies prospectively, we applied it to Adjutant herself, noting that the identity of the first aggressor was paramount in her case; that she had sought at trial to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s prior violent acts to address the first aggressor question; and that she had pressed the matter on appeal. We reasoned that, \u201c[g]iven the probative value of the excluded evidence, it may have been enough to create reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666. Those factors led us for the first time to apply a new rule of criminal law, not constitutionally mandated, to the defendant before us, even though we said in the decision that the new rule would apply prospectively. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dwyer, ante </em>122, 124, 147 (2006); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 248 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dagley, </em>442 Mass. 713, 720-722 &amp; n.10 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 930 (2005). In this case, in ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge similarly concluded that the \u201cmtegrity of [the] verdict is suspect where the jury did not have the benefit of relevant evidence critical to the issue of whether the defendant was the aggressor or whether he was acting in self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Our review of the judge\u2019s decision in tMs case is limited to whether she abused her discretion. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b). We cannot say that \u201cno conscientious judge, actmg mtelligently, could honestly have taken the view expressed by [her].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Candelario, </em>446 Mass. 847, 858 (2006). The defendant was in the same shoes as Adjutant in that, in both cases, the defendants attempted to introduce evidence of the victims\u2019 violent propensities, and both pursued the matter before their convictions had become final through direct appeals. As m <em>Adjutant, </em>m tMs case the identity of the first aggressor was essential, and the defendant sought aggressively and repeatedly (\u201cevery which way,\u201d according to the prosecutor) to introduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>evidence of Colono and Rodriguez\u2019s violent histories to illuminate the matter. At each turn the judge rejected those attempts. Where the defendant had persistently attempted to introduce evidence of Colono and Rodriguez\u2019s violent histories to support the central issue at trial \u2014 whether he had acted in self-defense \u2014 and where the defendant\u2019s conviction had not yet become final when he moved for a new trial, we cannot say that the judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201cfairness require[d]\u201d granting the defendant a new trial was an abuse of her broad discretion to see that justice is done. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">4. <em>Matters to be resolved at retrial, </em>a. <em>Propensity evidence. </em>We leave to the sound discretion of the judge the kinds of evidence of prior violence that she may admit at retrial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, supra </em>at 663. As to the victim, <em>Adjutant </em>establishes the appropriate guidance: the judge may admit evidence of Colono\u2019s specific acts of prior violent conduct but may not admit evidence of his general reputation for violence. See <em>id. </em>at 664-665.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">As for evidence of Rodriguez\u2019s prior violent acts, we conclude that the same principles should apply to Rodriguez. Although he is not a victim in this case, Rodriguez assisted the victim in the fight. In fact, according to the defendant\u2019s view of the evidence, Rodriguez might have started it. The facts of <em>Adjutant </em>involved an altercation involving only two people \u2014 the victim and the defendant. See <em>id. </em>at 650-652. But nothing in <em>Adjutant </em>precludes a judge from admitting evidence of prior acts of violent conduct of a victim\u2019s cohort. Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>163 Ill. App. 3d 754, 773-774 (1987), and cases cited (discussing use of third-person character evidence to show identity of aggressor). Because Rodriguez played a central role in the fight here, and because the purpose of the <em>Adjutant </em>rule is to give the jury a full picture of the altercation so as to make an informed decision about the identity of the initial aggressor or aggressors (where there is evidence that one or more aggressors jointly initiated the fight with a defendant), evidence of Rodriguez\u2019s specific acts of prior violent conduct is admissible. Before admitting evidence of specific examples of a third party\u2019s violent acts, the judge should determine whether, in the light most favorable to the defendant, the third party was acting in concert with or to assist the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Before retrial, the defendant shall, in accordance with <em>Adjutant, </em>provide the court and the Commonwealth timely notice of the specific evidence he intends to offer (he is not limited to those violent acts that he sought to introduce at his first trial), and the Commonwealth shall provide the court and the defendant notice of whatever rebuttal evidence it intends to offer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, supra </em>at 665-666. The judge may then exercise her sound discretion with regard to the admission of such evidence. See <em>id. </em>at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">b. <em>Unavailable witness. </em>At trial, the defendant sought to call as a witness Anthony Lewis, who had witnessed the fight between Rodriguez and Abreu at Rodriguez\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment on the night in question. In addition to having purportedly seen Rodriguez beat Abreu, Lewis temporarily secreted Rodriguez in Lewis\u2019s apartment when the police arrived; lied to the police about Rodriguez\u2019s whereabouts; and saw Rodriguez and Abreu sniff cocaine that Rodriguez had brought with him to Lewis\u2019s apartment. Lewis made those allegations in an affidavit, but later claimed that he had signed the affidavit without the advice of counsel. The defendant hoped to elicit from Lewis testimony consistent with the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Lewis informed the judge that he wished to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the judge appointed counsel for him. Following a colloquy with counsel, the judge concluded that Lewis had a valid Fifth Amendment privilege. The defendant then requested that the judge either grant Lewis immunity or admit the statements Lewis had made in his affidavit without Lewis testifying, on the ground that his statements were made against his penal interest. The judge denied both requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">With respect to Lewis\u2019s invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights, the judge did not inquire whether, despite Lewis\u2019s not having had the advice of counsel, he nonetheless signed the affidavit \u201cfreely and voluntarily.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Slonka, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 760, 769 (1997). Accordingly, on retrial, if Lewis again claims a Fifth Amendment privilege, the judge shall hold a hearing to determine whether Lewis \u201cfreely and voluntarily\u201d signed the affidavit, thereby \u201cforfeit[ing] his privilege against self-incrimination. \u2019\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 769. We thus express no opinion about the admissibility of any statements of Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judge did not abuse her discretion in granting the defendant a new trial.
