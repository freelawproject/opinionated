Although the board informed Maitland of his appellate rights under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 15, and G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 64, Maitland failed to file his complaint for judicial review within thirty days, as required by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1). See <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>414 Mass. 663, 664-665 &amp; n.l (1993). Although Maitland acknowledges that the statutory deadline is \u201cjurisdictional\u201d and \u201cnot susceptible to extension except in limited circumstances as provided in the statute [not applicable here],\u201d <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra </em>at 666; accord <em>Ramaseshu </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>441 Mass. 1006,1006-1007 (2004), he nonetheless seeks an extension to file his complaint. He argues that the single justice had the authority to extend the deadline pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 14 (b), as amended, 378 Mass. 939 (1979), and that the single justice should have done so because the delay in filing the complaint was attributable not to Maitland but to Maitland\u2019s counsel, and because Maitland\u2019s underlying claims of error by the board were meritorious. Contrary to Maitland\u2019s suggestion, rule 14 (b) does not allow a judge to alter the requirements of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1). See <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., supra </em>at 665 (statutory appeal period \u201ccannot be overridden by a contrary rule of court\u201d). Moreover, Maitland\u2019s other reasons for seeking to justify an extension do not fall within the \u201climited circumstances as provided in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1) (extension possible where requested before thirty-day deadline or where timely petition for rehearing sought).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The single justice neither abused his discretion nor otherwise erred in denying Maitland\u2019s motion for leave to file his complaint late.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-12\">For the first time on appeal, Maitland seeks to bolster his claims, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 829 (2005); <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 427 (1997); and <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 348 (1992). His attempt is, however, unavailing. First, the Appeals Court\u2019s <em>Gross </em>decision has been superseded on further appellate review by a decision of this court, and that decision does not support Maitland\u2019s cause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>447 Mass. 691 (2006). Second, the portion of the <em>Covell </em>decision that Maitland seeks to rely on is dictum, and in any event, the facts underlying that dictum are starkly different from the facts here. <em>Covell </em>v. <em>Department of Social Servs., supra </em>at 427-432. Third, the <em>DeCarolis </em>case does not support Maitland\u2019s position: there, the claims for judicial review were determined to be time-barred under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, just as Maitland\u2019s claim for such review was barred here. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport </em>v. <em>DeCarolis, supra </em>at 352. Although one claim for declaratory relief survived in <em>DeCarolis, </em>see <em>id. </em>at 352-354, no such claim is involved here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
