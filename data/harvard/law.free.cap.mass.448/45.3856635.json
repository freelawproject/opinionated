The transmission Unes would connect an offshore wind-powered energy generating facihty (wind farm) proposed for construction by Cape Wind in Federal waters off Nantucket Sound with the existing New England regional electric power grid. The board conditioned its approval on the submission by Cape Wind of copies of all Federal, State, and local permits necessary to begin building the wind farm. The Affiance to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. (Affiance), intervener in the administrative proceedings below, appealed from the board\u2019s decision to a single justice of this court, pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, and G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P. The single justice reserved and reported the case without decision to the fuU court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">1. The background necessary to decide this appeal is as follows. The board is an independent review board estabhshed within the department of telecommunications and energy and charged by the Legislature with administering the provisions contained in G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69H through 69Q. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H. The approval of the board is required prior to the commencement of construction of any \u201cfacility\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or \u201cgenerating facility\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the Commonwealth, and no State agency may issue a construction permit for any such facility un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>less the petition to construct the facility has already received approval from the board. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69J, 69J <em>1k. </em>The board\u2019s governing mandate, set forth in \u00a7 69H, is to \u201cprovide a reliable energy supply for the commonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost.\u201d To accomplish this purpose, on the receipt of a petition for approval of construction of an energy facility at a site, the board is obliged to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201creview the need for, cost of, and environmental impacts of transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, facilities for the manufacture and storage of gas, and oil facilities; provided, however, that the board shall review only the environmental impacts of generating facilities, consistent with the [C]ommonwealth\u2019s policy of allowing market forces to determine the need for and cost of such facilities. Such reviews shall be conducted consistent with [\u00a7 69J <em>\u00bc </em>]for generating facilities and with [\u00a7 69J] for all other facilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The Legislature significantly altered the scope of the board\u2019s governing mandate when it enacted St. 1997, c. 164 (1997 Restructuring Act). Prior to that time, the board was charged to \u201cprovide a necessary energy supply for the [C] ommonwealth with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost.\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69H, as amended through St. 1992, c. 141, \u00a7 9. Consistent with this charge, the board\u2019s review typically focused on whether there was a \u201cneed\u201d for the proposed energy facilities. In 1988, the board developed an analysis specific to determining the \u201cneed\u201d for transmission lines that connect to generating facilities that fall outside the board\u2019s jurisdiction. That standard, set forth in the board\u2019s decision relative to a petition to construct a 1.2 mile overhead electric transmission line submitted by Turners Falls Limited Partnership, directed the board to consider whether the energy from the new generator was needed to improve the reliability of the power supply system, or to increase economic efficiency, by analyzing (1) whether there was a need within New England for the power generated by the non-jurisdictional generating f\u00e1cil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ity, and (2) whether the transmission lines would provide benefits to Massachusetts. (We shall refer to this standard, as do the parties and the board, as the Turner Falls standard.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">As indicated, in 1997, the Legislature eliminated language in \u00a7 69H requiring the board to review the \u201cneed\u201d for power to be generated by proposed facilities. The 1997 Restructuring Act also added a new provision to G. L. c. 164 to govern the board\u2019s review of proposed generating facilities. That provision, \u00a7 69J <em>1U, </em>explicitly states that \u201c[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the board to make findings regarding the need for, the cost of, or alternative sites for a generating facility\u201d (except in limited circumstances not relevant here) and prohibits the board from seeking data relative to \u201cthe necessity for, or cost of, [a] proposed generating facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">2. We now recite the facts leading to this appeal. On September 17, 2002, the applicants filed the joint petition to construct and operate transmission lines consisting of two parallel electrical circuits, each made up of two cables and six conductors. The transmission lines would begin at an existing 115 kilovolt switching station in Barnstable and run underground through Barnstable and Yarmouth. The lines then would run under the sea floor from Lewis Bay in Yarmouth, through Nantucket Sound, to the site of the proposed wind farm. The route is approximately eighteen miles in length. Approximately twelve miles of each circuit would be undersea, buried in a trench in the sea bottom about twenty feet apart. At landfall, both circuits would feed into a single underground duct bank for the remainder of the route (approximately six miles), which would terminate at the utility switching station in Barnstable. About half of the undersea portion of the transmission lines would be located outside the three-mile offshore Massachusetts boundary and so under waters controlled by the United States government.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The area in which the wind farm itself is proposed to be built is located in Federal waters and, thus, falls beyond the scope of the board\u2019s jurisdiction and this case. As described in the record, the wind farm would consist of 130 wind turbine generators and an electrical service platform. The wind turbines each would be approximately 420 feet in height from the water to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>top of the blade. The wind turbines would be sited over approximately twenty-four square miles of Horseshoe Shoal in Nantucket Sound and connected, by undersea cables, to a service platform which would house an electric transformer. The closest land locations in different directions from the wind farm include Point Gammon in Yarmouth, 4.7 miles to the north; Cape Poge on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, 5.5 miles to the southwest; and points in Nantucket approximately eleven miles to the south and southeast.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On December 20, 2002, the board granted intervener status to five entities, including the Alliance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board accepted prefiled testimony and held twenty-one days of evidentiary hearings, which concluded on October 21, 2003. After the close of the evidentiary hearings, the board sought comments and arguments from the parties on the proper standard of review to be applied to the petition in light of changes to the language of \u00a7 69H, and the addition of \u00a7 69J effected by the 1997 Restructuring Act. In response, the parties submitted briefs indicating their respective positions on appropriate revisions to the Turner Falls standard. On December 18, 2003, the board closed the evidentiary record. On July 2, 2004, the board\u2019s presiding officer issued a tentative decision for board approval, and the parties, and the public, were given an opportunity for comment. The board entered its final decision on May 11, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In its decision, the board concluded that the applicants had successfully demonstrated that (1) the transmission lines will be needed if the wind farm is built; (2) the proposed transmission line project was superior to alternative approaches in terms of cost, environmental impact, reliability, and ability to address the identified needs; and (3) the proposed primary route was superior to the alternative routes in terms of cost, environmental impact, and reliability of supply. Only the first conclusion, concerning the need for the transmission lines, is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">With respect to that conclusion, the board found that \u201cthe total capacity of all existing transmission cable in Nantucket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Sound would be insufficient to transmit the output of the proposed wind farm, even if they would be totally dedicated to that purpose.\u201d Recognizing that the wind farm proposal was still in the initial stages of permitting, however, the board could not \u201cfind that the wind farm will be available to contribute to the regional energy supply.\u201d In order to ensure that the transmission lines are not built unnecessarily, the board determined that construction on the Unes could not begin until Cape Wind had successfully obtained permits required to begin construction of the wind farm. Accordingly, the board approved the petition to construct the transmission lines subject to compliance by the applicants with the condition that, prior to the commencement of construction, \u201cCape Wind shall submit to the [board] copies of all permits required for Cape Wind to begin installation of wind farm equipment in Nantucket Sound.\u201d The board clarified that, \u201c[b]ecause the issues addressed in this [d]ecision relative to this facility are subject to change over time, construction of the proposed facility must commence within three years of the date of the decision,\u201d and that the applicants must notify the board of \u201cany changes other than minor variations to the proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">3. Alliance does not contest the accuracy of the board\u2019s determination that, if Cape Wind receives the necessary permits from Federal and State agencies and if, therefore, its proposed construction of the wind farm goes forward, there will be a \u201cneed\u201d for the transmission lines, as that term is used in the board\u2019s authorizing statute. The Alliance objects, however, to (a) the timing of the board\u2019s decision to deviate from the Turners Falls standard to arrive at the determination of \u201cneed,\u201d and (b) the contingent nature of the board\u2019s decision. On the basis of these objections, the Alliance requests that we vacate the board\u2019s decision and remand the matter for further proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The scope of our review is limited to \u201cwhether the decision of the board is in conformity with the [Constitution of the [C]ommonwealth and the [Constitution of the United States, was made in accordance with the procedures established under [G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69H-690,] and with the rules and regulations of the board with respect to such provisions, was supported by substantial evidence of record in the board\u2019s proceedings; and was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of the board\u2019s discretion under the provisions of [\u00a7 69H] to [\u00a7 690].\u201d G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69P. Consistent with well-established principles of administrative law, we give great deference to the board\u2019s expertise and experience. See <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 412 (2001). The Alliance bears the burden of proving that the decision is invalid, and that burden is a heavy one. See <em>id.\\ </em>G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">a. The decision to announce a new approach by which it would henceforth determine the need for proposed transmission lines, and the timing of that decision, was within the board\u2019s discretion. \u201cIt is a recognized principle of administrative law that an agency may adopt policies through adjudication as well as through rulemaking.\u201d <em>Arthurs </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>383 Mass. 299, 312-313 (1981), citing <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 201-203 (1947). See <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>383 Mass. 675, 679 (1981). The parties in this case were aware that the 1997 Restructuring Act had changed the rules with respect to the manner in which the board evaluates the need for proposed energy facilities. All agreed that the approach adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>by the board in 1988, in the Turners Falls decision, was no longer viable. The board heard evidence and then invited the parties to address, in post-hearing briefs, the legal question of the appropriate standard to replace that of Turners Falls. By proceeding in this manner, the board was able to consider the legal question in a specific factual context. The board\u2019s decision to wait until after the evidentiary record was complete maximized the likelihood that the standard it developed would be workable and grounded in the evidence. We reject the Alliance\u2019s contention that the board misled the parties to rely on the Turners Falls standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">An agency conducting an adjudicatory proceeding is required to give all parties \u201csufficient notice of the issues involved to afford them reasonable opportunity to prepare and present evidence and argument.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (1). See <em>LaPointe </em>v. <em>License Bd. of Worcester, </em>389 Mass. 454, 458 (1983) (\u201cDue process requires that, in any proceeding to be accorded finality, notice must be given that is reasonably calculated ... to afford [an interested party] an opportunity to present his case\u201d). If the board had created a new standard that required substantive fact finding, it clearly could not have done so without giving notice to the parties and granting each a fair opportunity to prepare arguments and submit evidence in order to meet that standard. See <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>405 Mass. 115, 120-121 (1989). That is not what happened here. The Alliance cannot seriously claim that it lacked reasonable notice of the substance of the issues or a chance to prepare its case. See <em>Strasnick </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Pharmacy, </em>408 Mass. 654, 660-661 (1990); <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>395 Mass. 836, 844-846 (1985); <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>372 Mass. 678, 686 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">b. There was nothing improper in the board\u2019s decision to issue a conditional permit. See <em>Mello </em>v. <em>License Comm\u2019n of Revere, </em>435 Mass. 532, 534 (2001). On the contrary, the board\u2019s decision was an effective method to accomplish its statutory obligation to determine whether there was a need for the proposed transmission lines. See <em>Andover </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 377, 381 (2001).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As has been discussed, in light of the 1997 Restructuring Act, the board could no longer consider, pursuant to the Turners Falls standard, the need for the generating facility that the proposed transmission lines would serve. To ensure that a proposed transmission line is needed, or, in the words of the board, to ensure that the \u201ctransmission line, with its attendant costs and potential construction and permanent impacts, is not built unnecessarily,\u201d the board stated that it would consider (1) whether the \u201cexisting transmission system is inadequate to interconnect the new or expanded generator\u201d and (2) whether the \u201cnew or expanded generator is likely to be available to contribute to the regional energy supply.\u201d When the proposed generating facility is subject to the board\u2019s jurisdiction, the required showing \u201cmay be made by obtaining the [board\u2019s] approval of the generating facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In circumstances such as the present case, when the proposed generating facility is beyond the board\u2019s jurisdiction, the board determined, \u201cthe showing may be made on a case-by-case basis based on indicators of project progress (e.g., progress in permitting or in obtaining project financing).\u201d This approach is particularly appropriate if the generating facility (here, the wind farm) is within the jurisdiction of the United States government, and Federal agencies will be making critical decisions about its permitting. An attempt by the board to predict the decisions of Federal agencies would constitute an exercise in administrative inefficiency and waste the time and effort of the board and the applicants. If the board incorrectly predicted that the wind farm would not get its permits, then the transmission lines would have been unnecessarily rejected. If it incorrectly predicted that the wind farm would get its permits, then it would have permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ted the construction of the transmission lines to go forward unnecessarily. To defer ruling on the transmission lines until after the wind farm had received all of its permits (a course of action supported by the Alliance) would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme, which contemplates that the board will be the first State agency to act. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J. The board cannot act with absolute finality, however, when it cannot predict what other permitting Federal and State agencies will do. See <em>Andover </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., supra </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The Alliance attacks the board\u2019s decision as an \u201cimproper delegation of its statutory duty to make an independent finding of need.\u201d We disagree. Based on the evidentiary record, the board made clear findings, which the Alliance does not challenge, that the \u201ctotal capacity of all existing transmission cables in Nantucket Sound would be insufficient to transmit the output of the proposed wind farm, even if they could be totally dedicated to that purpose\u201d and that \u201cthe existing transmission system is inadequate to interconnect the proposed wind farm.\u201d At that point in time when Cape Wind submits to the board copies of all permits required to commence construction of the wind farm, the need for the proposed transmission lines will be conclusively established. Rather than improperly delegating its responsibilities, the board has, in effect, imposed a heightened standard of proof on the applicants.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The Alliance relies on our decision of <em>Point of Pines Beach Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>419 Mass. 281, 285-286 (1995), as support for its position that the conditional nature of the board\u2019s decision was unlawful. This reliance is misplaced. In the <em>Point of Pines Beach Ass\u2019n </em>case, the board had approved a petition for the construction of a gas-fired power generating facility by Altresco Lynn, Inc. (Altresco). The statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>applicable to the board\u2019s approval at that time<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> required that it be based on a finding that the proposed project would \u201cprovide a <em>necessary energy supply for the commonwealth </em>with a minimum impact on the environment at the lowest possible cost\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J, as amended through St. 1992, c. 141, \u00a7 15. The board stated in its decision that the record was \u201cunclear regarding the ability of Massachusetts utilities to acquire surplus supplies from out-of-state providers\u201d and concluded that, \u201cbased on the record, the [board] is unable to determine that the proposed project is needed to provide a necessary energy supply for the Commonwealth prior to the year 2000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283-284. The board nevertheless approved the petition, subject to the condition that Altresco submit to the board, within four years, a contract with Boston Edison Company, signed and approved by the department of public utilities, or signed and approved long-term purchase agreements from other buyers, to purchase a specified percentage of the proposed facility\u2019s power output. See <em>id. </em>at 282-283. The board argued that approved power purchase agreements satisfactorily established the required finding of need. We disagreed and vacated the board\u2019s decision, reasoning that (1) although the existence of power purchase agreements may demonstrate the <em>utility\u2019s </em>need for power, such agreements would not establish the <em>Commonwealth\u2019s </em>need for power, as required by the statute, and (2) the department\u2019s approval of a power purchase agreement does not, by itself, warrant an inference of Commonwealth need. See <em>id. </em>at 285-286, citing <em>New Bedford </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Council, </em>413 Mass. 482, 489-490 (1992). It was not the conditional nature of the board\u2019s decision that rendered it invalid, but the board\u2019s inability to find a future need in the Commonwealth for the proposed generating facility. As stated, the Alliance does not quarrel with the proposition, as found by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>the board, that the transmission lines will be needed to service the wind farm, if and when it is constructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">It is, of course, true that \u201c[a] party to a proceeding before a regulatory agency, such as the [board,] has a right to expect and obtain reasoned consistency in the agency\u2019s decisions.\u201d See <em>Tofias </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 340, 349 (2001), quoting <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>367 Mass. 92, 104 (1975). We have stated that the requirement of \u201creasoned consistency\u201d means only \u201cthat any change from an established pattern of conduct must be explained.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>416 Mass. 668, 673 (1993). Here, the board carefully, and adequately, explained its reasons for its decision, including its adoption of the new standard for determining need and the conditional nature of its approval. The board\u2019s decision, in our view, is an eminently reasonable and practical approach to the uncommon jurisdictional issues presented by the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">4.

These alleged errors are that the board erred (1) in denying the Alliance\u2019s motion to reopen the record to include the draft environmental impact report (DEIR) on the wind farm project; and (2) in failing to require Cape Wind to produce specific financial information as required by G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J. The Alliance makes these assertions without citation or convincing argument, and we consider them only briefly. As for the first, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>decision whether to reopen the record is a matter within the board\u2019s discretion. See <em>Box Pond Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 408, 417 (2001). The record demonstrates that the board carefully examined the merits of doing so and properly concluded that it was not warranted. We import no significance to the fact that the final decision, issued on May 11, 2005, included a finding that the DEER had not yet been completed when the report had, in fact, been issued in November, 2004. The finding was correct on December 18, 2003, the date the evidentiary record was closed. As for the second, even assuming that the statutory language may fairly be read in the manner urged by the Alliance, the substantial deference owed to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute it is charged to enforce includes approving an interpretation of statutory language that may be read in two ways. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Bedford, </em>444 Mass. 775, 783 (2005), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\"> In <em>Andover </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>435 Mass. 377 (2001), we affirmed the board\u2019s approval of a petition to construct and operate an electrical generating facility in the town of Dracut. The board\u2019s decision in that case deferred setting emission limits for the proposed facility until the department of environmental protection issued its final air plan approval. See <em>id. </em>at 380. Opponents argued that the board\u2019s decision constituted an improper abdication of its statutory responsibility, under G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 69J <em>\u00bc, </em>to establish \u201cfinal, binding emissions limits for the proposed facility.\u201d We concluded that, far from being improper, the board\u2019s decision reflected \u201can accurate observation of the different roles of the board and [other Federal and State] agencies in the over-all permit process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Such is the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Recognizing that its analysis ventured into new territory, and cognizant of the value of precedent in its past decisions, the board conducted a lengthy alternative review of the proposed wind farm and concluded that the applicants had established a need for the proposed transmission lines consistent with the Turner Falls standard. Although the board\u2019s cautioned approach is understandable, its analysis under the Turner Falls standard has no legal effect. This is so because, as has been discussed, G. L. c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 69H and 69J <em>\u00bc, </em>explicitly prohibit the board from seeking data regarding the need for, or cost of, a proposed generating facility, except in certain narrowly defined circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b73-5\"> The board issued its decision in 1993, well before the enactment of the electric utility restructuring act, St. 1997, c. 164 (1997 Restructuring Act), changed the board\u2019s mandate from providing \u201ca necessary energy supply for the commonwealth\u201d to providing \u201ca reliable energy supply for the commonwealth,\u201d St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205, and added the provisions of \u00a7 69J \u00bc, inserted by St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 210, which now apply to petitions for the construction of new and expanded generating facilities and which expressly do not require a finding of need for the approval of such petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
