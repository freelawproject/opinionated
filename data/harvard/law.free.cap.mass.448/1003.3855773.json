L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. Koplow had requested that this court assume jurisdiction over his appeal from a conviction of assault and battery where the Appeals Court had vacated the entry of the appeal, without prejudice, because the record of the criminal proceedings was then incomplete. The Commonwealth represents, however \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>and Koplow does not deny \u2014 that the record is now complete. Accordingly, nothing appears to prevent Koplow from being able to pursue his appeal in the Appeals Court.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b874-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b874-7\"><em>David Koplow, </em>pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b874-8\"><em>Christina Miller, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for District Attorney for the Suffolk District.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
