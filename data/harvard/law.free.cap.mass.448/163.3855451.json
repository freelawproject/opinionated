When the jury were unable to reach unanimous verdicts on the latter two charges, the Commonwealth decided to retry the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He filed a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds, arguing that the Commonwealth did not have sufficient evidence to convict him of dissemination of matter harmful to a minor in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28. That motion was denied. The defendant then filed in the county court a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tian for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, which was denied by a single justice. The defendant appealed, claiming that the single justice erred in denying his petition. Because we conclude that a rational trier of fact could find that the Commonwealth had proved each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence presented at trial, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s petition for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\"><em>Facts and procedural background. </em>We summarize the essential facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The defendant hired a twelve year old girl, whom we shall call Jane, to work at the Fairway Driving Range (Fairway) in Marlborough to assist with washing golf balls during the summer of 2001. She eventually operated the cash register, fixed batting cages, and collected balls from the driving range. In April, 2002, Jane began working at Fairway again. Although Jane initially enjoyed working with the defendant and soon referred to him as \u201cUncle Leo,\u201d she testified that she began to feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">At trial, Jane testified that on three occasions between March, 2001, and August, 2002, the defendant showed her \u201cporn\u201d videotapes in the clubhouse at Fairway. Jane testified that on each occasion the defendant used a video cassette recorder on the Fairway premises and showed her these videotapes when no one else was around. Jane further testified that these videotapes were kept on a shelf in the clubhouse and concealed in a golf videotape case. She recounted in graphic detail the sexual conduct she specifically observed on all three occasions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She also described in detail one particular incident where the defendant exposed himself to her while showing her a \u201cppm\u201d videotape. She admitted that she did not reveal these events to anyone until the third incident because she was \u201cscared.\u201d Jane testified that after the defendant showed her a \u201cppm\u201d videotape on her final night working at Fairway, she telephoned a friend when she arrived home. The friend contacted Jane\u2019s mother, who took Jane to the police station. After Jane spoke to the police, two officers went to the defendant\u2019s residence and ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>rested him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, the police contacted the manager of Fairway, who consented to a search of the premises. Although the officers discovered the television in the office area, as Jane described, they were unable to recover the videotapes at Fairway. However, after searching the defendant\u2019s residence, one of the police officers recovered a pornographic videotape.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defendant filed a motion for required findings of not guilty on all charges. However, at the hearing, the defendant did not argue that the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to support the charges of open and gross lewdness and dissemination of matter harmful to a minor, but only discussed the indecent assault and battery charges. The judge denied the motion except for one of the indecent assault and battery charges. Thereafter, the defendant testified and denied all remaining charges, including showing pornographic videotapes to Jane. At the close of the defendant\u2019s case, the remaining charges were submitted to the jury. They returned verdicts of not guilty on the remaining indecent assault and battery charges but were unable to reach unanimous verdicts on the other two charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 28, makes it a crime to knowingly disseminate<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> any matter<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that is harmful to a minor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>A minor is a person under eighteen years of age.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Matter is \u201c[h]armful to minors\u201d if it is \u201cobscene<footnotemark>[9]</footnotemark> or, if taken as a whole, it (1) describes or represents nudity, sexual conduct or sexual excitement, so as to appeal predominantly to the prurient interest of minors; (2) is patently contrary to prevailing standards of adults in the county where the offense was committed as to suitable material for such minors; and (3) lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value for minors.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The defendant argues that the single justice erred in denying his petition for relief of the denial of his motion to dismiss. We review the single justice\u2019s decision denying the defendant relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, for an abuse of discretion or other error of law. The defendant contends that, because the videotapes were not admitted in evidence, the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to satisfy the third part of the definition of \u201c[hjarmful to minors,\u201d as set forth in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. The defendant further argues that the Commonwealth failed to introduce the alleged \u201cppm\u201d videotapes and instead solely relied on the testimony of Jane regarding the videotapes\u2019 contents. The defendant claims that Jane\u2019s descriptions of the contents were short and incomplete and, in turn, that the jury were unable fully -to realize the contents of the videotapes to ascertain whether the other portions contained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value pursuant to the statute. Because the Commonwealth did not introduce any videotapes, the defendant states the jury were unable to view the contents \u201cas a whole,\u201d as required by the statute, and were forced to speculate on the remaining contents of the videotapes. Thus, the defendant argues, retrial would violate his rights against double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u201cIn order for a defendant to be placed twice in jeopardy, his original jeopardy must have terminated.\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 793, 796 (1985). Original jeopardy terminates when proceedings against a defendant end. However, as the defendant concedes, if the Commonwealth presents legally sufficient evidence to convict, double jeopardy will not prevent retrial after a mistrial is declared because of the jury\u2019s inability to reach a unanimous decision. <em>Thames </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>365 Mass. 477, 479 (1974). See <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 326 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Although the Commonwealth did not produce at trial the videotapes that the defendant allegedly had shown to Jane, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s assertion that the absence of the videotapes prevented the jury from deciding whether, \u201cas a whole,\u201d the videotapes lacked literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 153, 154-156 (2003), the Commonwealth introduced excerpts from a magazine that were admitted in evidence against the defendant, who was charged with disseminating obscene matter to both adults and minors pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a728 and 29. In that case, the witnesses stated that the defendant threw \u201cpornographic\u201d pages of a magazine out of a car window, doing so once in the presence of minors at a school bus stop. <em>Id. </em>at 155-156. Although the entire magazine was not admitted in evidence, the court stated that \u201c[tjaken as a whole,\u201d the specific pages that were admitted were sexually explicit and satisfied the statutory definition of obscenity, and affirmed three counts of disseminating obscene matter pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 159 (reversing conviction of disseminating material harmful to minors because children did not see contents). Similarly, in <em>New Palm Gardens, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 785, 791-793 (1981), an inspector of the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission) testified and gave a description before the commission of a portion of an obscene performance he had observed. The Appeals Court stated, \u201cThe inspector\u2019s description to the commission was sufficiently complete to give the full flavor of the performance and the commission could properly conclude that the likelihood that the unseen portions had \u2018serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value\u2019 was remote.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 793. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Plank, </em>378 Mass. 465, 467 (1979) (two officers allowed to testify concerning portion of observed dance; court ultimately concluded that testimony was insufficient to support finding that dance depicted \u201csexual conduct \u2018in a patently offensive way\u2019 as required by the definition of obscene in \u00a7 31\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In making his argument the defendant states that in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isenstadt, </em>318 Mass. 543, 554 (1945), this court reviewed the entire book at issue \u201cas a whole.\u201d The defendant\u2019s reliance on that case is unavailing. There, the defendant was convicted of selling and possessing, for the purpose of sale, exhibition, loan, or circulation, a book that allegedly was \u201cobscene, indecent or impure, or manifestly tends to corrupt the morals of youth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547. Because the charge concerned four descriptions of scenes involving sexual intercourse contained in the book, the court viewed the entire book as a whole to determine whether it was obscene, indecent, or impure. In this case, the whole of Jane\u2019s observations are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">At trial, Jane was asked specifically to describe what she saw.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Jane testified that on three occasions the defendant showed her a videotape that contained sexual conduct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>nudity. When asked to describe the content, Jane specifically detailed the scenes that she observed. Jane\u2019s testimony as to the entire contents of the \u201cppm\u201d videotapes she personally observed was sufficient.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In this case, considering in its entirety the details Jane recounted, the descriptions alone, without the admission of the entire videotapes, are sufficient to support the third part of the definition of \u201c[h]armful to minors\u201d in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31. Viewing the essential facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth presented sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant disseminated matter harmful to a minor in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677-678 (1979). Thus, original jeopardy has not terminated, and the Commonwealth may retry the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the order of the single justice denying the defendant\u2019s petition for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-14\">The jury found the defendant not guilty of the four indecent assault and battery charges submitted to them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b182-8\">We have carefully reviewed Jane\u2019s testimony but think it is unnecessary to present the specific details here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The defendant was placed under arrest after explaining what had happened between Jane and himself earlier that evening. Specifically, he stated, \u201cWe were fooling around together and throwing water at each other.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">During a sidebar at trial, a discussion commenced regarding the pornographic videotape that was recovered at the defendant\u2019s residence after the police conducted a search. The Commonwealth stated that it was not planning to introduce the videotape because of an inability to lay the necessary evidentiary foundation for its admission in evidence as one of the videotapes that was shown to Jane. However, the Commonwealth did not indicate whether this videotape was, in fact, shown to Jane. The Commonwealth stated in its memorandum in opposition to defendant\u2019s petition for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, that it may or may not use the videotape at a later trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Under G.

L. c. 272, \u00a7 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The defendant argues that dissemination of photographs or videotapes, as is the case here, is speech that is protected under the First Amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, as amended by art. 77 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. However, the defendant neglects to mention that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment, although nonobscene adult entertainment is entitled to constitutional protection. <em>T &amp; D Video, Inc. </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 461, 467 (2006). See <em>Schad </em>v. <em>Mount Ephraim, </em>452 U.S. 61, 65-67 (1981); <em>Roth </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 485 (1957). A court must determine whether the speech in question may be suppressed within constitutional standards. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moniz, </em>338 Mass. 442, 447 n.l (1959). In any event, the defendant does not make, nor could he make, any argument regarding the constitutionality of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7\u00a728 and 31. These statutes are constitutional. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferro, </em>372 Mass. 379, 381-382 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>707 Main Corp., </em>371 Mass. 374, 376 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b184-13\">It is uncontested that Jane was a minor at the time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[9]\">\n<p id=\"b184-14\">9Matter is \u201cobscene\u201d as defined in G.

Similarly, in this case, the specific videotapes are not available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The defendant argues that the Commonwealth failed to \u201cflesh out\u201d the third part of the definition of \u201charmful to minors\u201d found in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 31, because Jane was not asked questions relating to the length of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>videotapes; how long she watched them; the number of characters in the movie, including whether there were major and minor characters; other activities characters may have undertaken; whether the movie had many different scenes or a story line; and whether the videotapes involved science or took place in a laboratory, a museum, or a theater. Although the prosecutor may not have asked these specific questions, the prosecutor did ask Jane specific questions pertaining to what she observed, where she was located when she saw the videotapes, the form of the movie, and whether any other person was working at the clubhouse when the defendant showed her the videotapes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The defendant claims that there are \u201cun-described portions of the tapes\u201d that could have been different from the content that Jane described. This is mere speculation and is unsupported by the record, especially given that the main defense at trial was that the defendant did not show anyone pornographic videotapes at Fairway.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
