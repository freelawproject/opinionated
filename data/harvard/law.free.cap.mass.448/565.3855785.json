L. c. 71, \u00a7 89, to operate a \u201cCommonwealth charter school.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> AMSA would draw its students from the towns of Hudson, Marlborough, Maynard, and Clinton. Pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (g),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a copy of AMSA\u2019s \u201cfinal application\u201d for a charter had been sent to the school committees of these towns for their review and comment. Each of the four school committees submitted written comments, some extensive and detailed, in opposition to the final application. After the approval of a charter for AMSA, three of the four school committees, the school committees of Hudson, Marlborough, and Maynard (plaintiffs), commenced an action in the Superior Court against the board, the Commissioner of Education (commissioner), and AMSA seeking judicial review of the board\u2019s decision to grant AMSA a charter (1) through certiorari under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4; (2) under the Administrative Procedures Act, G. L. c. 30A; or (3) by means of a declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231 A. On cross motions for judgment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>the pleadings, a Superior Court judge concluded that the plaintiffs had no right to judicial review under these statutes, and final judgment entered in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed, and we granted their application for direct appellate review. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">1. To establish context, we first set out the pertinent statutory provisions and regulations. As part of the Education Reform Act of 1993, the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89, the charter school statute. See St. 1993, c. 71, \u00a7 55. As previously noted, the statute provides for two types of charter schools: Commonwealth charter schools and Horace Mann charter schools. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(a) </em>and <em>(b). </em>Both types of charter schools are considered public schools, see <em>id., </em>and, generally speaking, are established to encourage innovative educational practices. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(d).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Commonwealth charter schools operate under a charter granted by the board, are managed by a board of trustees (\u201cdeemed to be public agents authorized by the [Commonwealth to supervise and control the charter school\u201d), and operate independently of the local school committees for the districts in which the charter schools are located. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 (a). The charter under which a Horace Mann charter school operates is also granted by the board, but must be \u201capproved by the local school committee in which the school is located and by the local collective bargaining agent [teachers\u2019 union].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(b). </em>In addition, Horace Mann charter schools are operated and managed by boards of trustees that are independent of local school committees. <em>Id. </em>A member of the school committee may serve on the board of trustees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The charter school statute authorizes the operation of only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>limited number of charter schools.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(i). </em>When granted, a charter authorizes the charter school to operate for a period of five years. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(Jck).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">In Commonwealth charter schools, the boards of trustees, in consultation with the teachers, determine the curriculum and budget. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(x). </em>However, the curriculum, like other aspects of the charter school, must comply with the \u201cprovisions of law regulating other public schools,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 89 (t) (exempting only certain provisions concerning teacher tenure and teacher demotion or dismissal). These provisions include compliance with G. L. c. 71 A, which pertains to English language learners, and with G. L. c. 7IB, which pertains to the provision of special education services. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (?). In addition, all charter school students \u201cshall be required to meet the same performance standards, testing and portfolio requirements set by the board of education for students in other public schools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(w).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Substantial discretion is extended to the board in the process of granting a charter. The board is directed to \u201cestablish the information needed in an application for the approval of a charter school,\u201d provided that the application contains certain specified information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 (/). The board is charged with \u201cmak[ing] the final determination on granting charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>school status and may condition charters on the applicant\u2019s taking certain actions or maintaining certain conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(i). </em>The board may revoke a school\u2019s charter if the school \u201chas not fulfilled any conditions imposed by the board in connection with the grant of the charter or [if] the school has violated any provision of its charter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(kk). </em>The board may also place a charter school on \u201cprobationary status to allow the implementation of a remedial plan after which, if said plan is unsuccessful, the charter may be summarily revoked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The board is charged with \u201cdeveloping] procedures and guidelines for revocation and renewal of a school\u2019s charter,\u201d provided that, in the case of a Horace Mann charter school, the school committee and teachers\u2019 union vote in support of renewing its charter; and, in the case of a Commonwealth charter school, the board of trustees \u201chas documented in a manner approved by the board . . . that said [C]ommonwealth charter school has provided models for replication and best practices.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(ll).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The charter school statute and regulations promulgated by the Department of Education (department) establish the application process. Under the statute, a charter school comes into existence on the grant of a charter. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(a), (b). </em>The board, subject to certain statutory prerequisites, see note 7, <em>supra, </em>determines the content of the applications, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (/), and makes the final decision whether to grant a charter, see <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(i). </em>The statute provides a general timetable governing the process. \u201cApplications to establish a charter school shall be submitted to the board each year by November 15,\u201d and the board \u201cshall review the applications and grant new charters in February of the following year.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(h). </em>Applications are to be submitted to the board and are to be \u201cfiled with the local school committee for the school district in which the charter school is to be located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(g). </em>Further, \u201c[b]efore final approval to establish a [C]ommonwealth charter school the board of education shall hold a public hearing on said applications, and solicit and review comments on the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>plication from the local school committee for the school district in which said charter school is to be located.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">The department\u2019s regulations and guidelines track the statutory provisions and more particularly describe the application process. The application process begins in August of the year prior to the year in which the charter school plans to open if granted a charter, and culminates in the grant of a charter the following February. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(l)-(3) (2005). In August,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> prospective applicants must file a letter of intent with the department\u2019s charter school office. Generally speaking, the prospectus describes the basic elements of the applicant\u2019s plan and includes a variety of legal certifications. The department, however, provides a detailed description of what must be contained in the prospectus, provides an \u201coutline\u201d or template, and limits the document to twenty pages, exclusive of the cover page and specified documents and limited attachments (concerning the qualifications of the founding group members). Thereafter, reviewers from inside and outside the department review and evaluate each prospectus. Based on these advisory evaluations, the commissioner selects applicant groups to be invited to submit final applications. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">As noted, a final application must be submitted to the board by November 15. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(h). </em>Copies must be sent to \u201cthe superintendent of the school districts from which the applicant intends to draw students,\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(3)(b), and to the local school committees, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(g). </em>In general terms, final applications must contain a detailed discussion of the proposed charter school\u2019s mission statement, educational philosophy, curriculum, assessment system, organizational plan, and plan for serving special student populations and providing other student services. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (f); 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.05(1), (2) (2005). As with the case of prospectuses, the department provides a detailed description of what must be contained in the final application, provides an \u201coutline\u201d or template, and limits the document to fifty pages of text and thirty-five pages of \u201crequired and optional attachments.\u201d Prospectuses and final applications are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>required to be submitted \u201cin accordance with the schedule, application form, and guidelines established by the [department.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">From late November to January, local superintendents and school committees are invited to submit written comments concerning a final application. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (g); 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(3)(b). During this time, the board and the department will hold at least one public hearing on the final application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(3)(b). In the application package, the department explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">\u201cAll public comment, including written comment from superintendents [and school committees], will be considered in the review process. Several public hearings on the final applications are conducted during January. Written or oral opposition alone, however, is not reasonable grounds for denial of a charter. Similarly, strong public support alone does not constitute reasonable grounds for granting a charter. Any substantial issues raised in pubic comment that demonstrate deficiencies in a specific final application as measured against the stated criteria will be taken into account and addressed during the applicant group\u2019s interview with the [department\u2019s charter school office].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Also in late November to January, each final application is reviewed and evaluated by review panels consisting of department staff and persons from outside the department such as current and former teachers; researchers; charter school founders; and school, business, and public policy leaders. As with the prospectus reviewers, the function of the review panels for the final application is solely advisory. See 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(3)(c) (\u201cThe [b]card . . . may be assisted [in granting charters] by review panels comprised of individuals appointed by the [c]ommissioner [and] [m]embers of these panels may review applications but the reviewers\u2019 role shall be <em>solely advisory\u201d </em>[emphasis added]). In the application materials, the department explains that \u201c[t]he questions and deficiencies raised by review panels regarding final applications serve as the basis of the applicant group interviews.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Next, in January, each applicant group is interviewed by the department, which inquires into issues and comments raised by the review panels and others. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(3)(a). The interview\u2019s purpose is \u201cto better assess [the founding group\u2019s] qualifications to start a charter school.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">In February, the commissioner makes his recommendations to the board, which then votes on the commissioner\u2019s recommendations at its February meeting. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(h). </em>The board then \u201cmake[s] the final determination on granting charter school status and may condition charters on the applicant\u2019s taking certain actions or maintaining certain conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 (f). With respect to the statutory and regulatory criteria for assessing charter applications, see <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 89 (i); 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.05(l)(a)-(i), the board is permitted to \u201ctemporarily waive such conditions and award a charter, provided that the applicant submits adequate written assurance that all such conditions will be met prior to the opening of the school.\u201d 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.05(2). In addition, recognizing that the startup of a charter school involves \u201ca tremendous undertaking,\u201d the department states in its application materials that the board may award a charter conditional on the school\u2019s opening in the year following the year in which the charter was granted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">There is no statutory or regulatory provision permitting an appeal from the board\u2019s decision to grant a charter. As explained by the department in the application materials: \u201cThe application process leading up to the [b]card\u2019s decision has been designed to afford applicant groups and others several opportunities to clarify misunderstandings related to an application and to make the case for, or against, the award of a charter. Applicants who are not awarded a charter . . . may reapply in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Application fees for student admission to charter schools are prohibited. G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(f). </em>In addition, \u201c[t]here shall be no tuition charge for students attending charter schools.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(n). </em>Commonwealth charter schools receive public funds directly from the Commonwealth. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(nn). </em>The funding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>comes from the State through a reduction in the educational funding (at a calculated per pupil rate) for the towns from which the charter school draws its students. <em>Id. </em>Subject to appropriation, the Commonwealth may provide partial reimbursement to those towns for the reductions made. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(oo).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">2. We next set forth the material facts. In furtherance of its goal to establish a Commonwealth charter school, AMSA submitted to the department, on August 8, 2003, a letter of intent and, on September 8, 2003, its prospectus. Five reviewers performed independent examinations of AMSA\u2019s prospectus, identifying areas of both strength and weakness.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">On November 14, 2003, AMSA submitted its final application to the department and, pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(g), </em>sent copies of it to the local school committees, including the plaintiffs. By early January, several internal and external reviewers concluded their evaluations of AMSA\u2019s final application. In addition to providing written evaluations, the reviewers participated \u201con a half-day panel to discuss and evaluate every section of each application.\u201d In mid-January, the plaintiffs submitted written comments in opposition to AMSA\u2019s final application. The department held three public hearings, on January 12, 14, and 15, timing which both public support and opposition to AMSA\u2019s final application was expressed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">On January 30, 2004, the board interviewed the members of AMSA\u2019s founding group. During the interview, AMSA\u2019s founding group shared with the interviewers various materials that AMSA had continued to develop following the submission of its final application (interview submissions).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These interview submissions included a lengthy (approximately 203 pages) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>\u201cDetailed [Mathematics] Curriculum\u201d for students in grades six and seven; applications for employment; curriculum outlines for the subjects of physics, chemistry, computer usage, biology, literature, English, geography, and visual arts; an employee manual; and a student and family handbook. In addition, the submissions included a letter from the lead founder of AMSA, Dr. Julia Sigalovsky, to the commissioner made in response to the \u201cvaluable feedback from the community\u201d and \u201cto clarify some of the points that may not have been clear in [AMSA\u2019s] application, as well as [to] address what [AMSA] believe[s] are some common concerns and in some cases misunderstandings. \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The department permitted all of the applicants, including AMSA, during the interviews \u201cto elaborate on the main weaknesses or areas of confusion identified in the review of their applications or to clarify aspects of their applications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">On February 24, 2004, the board held a public meeting and voted (five to one) to grant AMSA a charter to open in September, 2005. The minutes of the hearing state the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201cActing Associate Commissioner Kristin McIntosh provided an overview of the proposal and responded to questions. Chairman [James A.] Peyser asked if the charter school application had changed since the public comment period. Ms. McIntosh responded that the application did not change in a material way; rather, the founding group provided clarification on some issues about which questions had been raised during the interview process. Chairman Peyser asked about the school\u2019s plans for providing special education services as required by law. Ms. McIntosh said the proposal reviewers look for a commitment, a plan, understanding and agreement to meet the legal requirements, and that this school\u2019s founding group met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>that standard. She added that, like all charter schools, this school will have to flesh out the details of its special education program before it opens. Chairman Peyser noted that the school has been criticized for focusing its program on advanced learning, and he asked if the founders understand that the school must serve all students, including students with disabilities and English language learners. Ms. McIntosh said that they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201cCommissioner [David P.] Driscoll said the school\u2019s focus on advanced math and science makes it somewhat unique. The Department has done due diligence to ensure that the school is prepared to meet its legal obligations to educate all students. The Commissioner said he is satisfied that all of the issues raised in the January 23rd letter from Hudson had been addressed. Dr. [Roberta] Schaefer [a member of the board] said she is pleased that the concept of charter schools is expanding to include a variety of educational programs. She expressed concern that some letters opposing the charter school that she has received from public school students appear to be part of an orchestrated campaign. Commissioner Driscoll said in recommending this charter he does not credit any opinions the founders expressed about the inadequacy of existing public schools; rather, the charter should be granted on the strength of the proposed program and the fact that it meets the standards in the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">AMSA opened in September, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">3. We turn now to the governing law. In allowing cross motions for judgment on the pleadings for the defendants, the judge concluded that the plaintiffs had no right to judicial review of the board\u2019s decision to grant AMSA a charter through certiorari under G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4; under G. L. c. 30A; or by means of a declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">a. <em>Certiorari. </em>The judge correctly concluded that the board\u2019s grant of a charter to AMSA is not subject to judicial review under the certiorari statute.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Certiorari is a limited procedure reserved for correction of substantial errors of law apparent on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>the record created before a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal. <em>St. Botolph Citizens Comm., Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Redevelopment Auth., </em>429 Mass. 1, 7 (1999). To obtain certiorari review of an administrative decision, one must show \u201c(1) a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding; (2) a lack of all other reasonably adequate remedies; and (3) a substantial injury or injustice arising from the proceeding under review.\u201d <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Hazardous Waste Facility Site Safety Council, </em>392 Mass. 107, 117 (1984), quoting <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Concord, </em>355 Mass. 79, 83 (1968). If the proceeding or hearing involves \u201cunsworn statements by interested persons advocating or disapproving the proposed new policy\u201d rather than \u201csworn testimony by witnesses subject to cross-examination in a hearing preceded by specific charges,\u201d the hearing is more likely to be legislative or regulatory, rather than quasi-judicial, in nature. See <em>Pronghorn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. of Peabody, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 70, 72, 73 (1982). Further, if a hearing is not preceded by \u201cspecific charges\u201d and is not \u201cfollowed by the adoption of formal findings of fact,\u201d it is more likely to be regulatory in nature. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Here, under the statutory and regulatory scheme, an applicant cannot be awarded a charter until the board conducts a public hearing. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (g) (\u201cBefore final approval to establish a [C]ommonwealth charter school the [board] shall hold a public hearing on said applications . . .\u201d); 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(3)(b) (\u201cThe [b]card and the [department] shall hold a public hearing on final applications\u201d). The hearing, however, is not preceded by specific charges. It serves only to provide an opportunity for public comment on a final application. There are no statutory or regulatory provisions requiring that witnesses testify or that sworn testimony be taken at the hearing, and the department is not provided an opportunity to cross-examine any persons who decide to verbalize concerns or submit written information. Following the hearing, the board is not required to issue any written decision with accompanying findings of fact. Based on these considerations, we conclude that the board\u2019s decision to grant AMS A a charter was not made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>in the context of a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding. See <em>Pronghorn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Licensing Bd. of Peabody, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">b. <em>General Laws c. 30A. </em>The decision to grant AMSA a charter was not made in an adjudicatory proceeding and, therefore, is not subject to judicial review under G. L. c. 30A. As noted by the judge, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, provides to an aggrieved party judicial review of a \u201cfinal decision of any agency in an adjudicatory proceeding.\u201d If the decision is not made in an adjudicatory proceeding, a court will lack jurisdiction to review the decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Hazardous Waste Facility Site Safety Council, supra. </em>An adjudicatory proceeding is defined by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (1), as \u201ca proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of specifically named persons are required by constitutional right or by any provision of the General Laws to be determined after opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The plaintiffs contend that an adjudicatory proceeding took place because AMSA\u2019s right and privilege to operate a charter school \u201cwas determined by the [bjoard at the February 2004 \u2018public hearing\u2019 required by [G. L. c. 71,] \u00a7 89 (g).\u201d While the board did publicly make the determination to grant AMSA a charter at its February 24, 2004, meeting, and conducted more than one public hearing pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (g), the board\u2019s ultimate decision to grant AMSA the charter constituted an adjudication of AMSA\u2019s rights, not the plaintiffs\u2019. Further examination of the nature of the proceedings, see <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Department of Envtl. Mgt., </em>439 Mass. 738, 746 (2003), demonstrates that no adjudicatory proceeding occurred in the charter school application process.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The fact that a public hearing was required in the charter application process does not render the process or the public hearings an adjudicatory hearing. See <em>id. </em>See also <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Acting Comm\u2019r of the Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs, </em>362 Mass. 136, 140, 143 (1972). The public hearings were not of an adversary nature and were not conducted as such. Under the statutory and regulatory scheme, the board is not required to take formal testimony, hear or cross-examine witnesses, or assess the credibility of witnesses or information submitted at any public hearing. Nor is the board required to make any written decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>or particular findings of fact after any public hearing. Rather, the public hearing provides an opportunity for the public, including the local school committees if they so desire, to comment on the final application for the proposed charter school. The information provided at the public hearing, depending on its content, may be used to evaluate the final application before the board. However, the final decision to grant a charter at all times rests with the board. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(i). A </em>close examination of the process demonstrates that, with its resulting decision, it is legislative in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">We reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that, because a department regulation provides for judicial review under G. L. c. 30A of a decision to <em>revoke </em>a charter, see 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13(3) (2005), judicial review under G. L. c. 30A must similarly be provided in the case of a decision to <em>grant </em>a charter. The two types of actions are entirely different. By its terms, the cited regulation does not speak to any judicial review available to school committees seeking to challenge the board\u2019s grant of a charter. Further, under the regulation, the only entity afforded judicial review in the case of the revocation of a charter is the charter school itself. See 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13(3) (\u201cUpon receiving a notice of intent to revoke a charter ... the school shall have all rights of review as provided in [] G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 13\u201d). The regulation affords no right of judicial review to a school committee for the grant of a charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">c. <em>Declaratory judgment. </em>In count three of their amended complaint, the plaintiffs seek a declaration that \u201cthe [d]ecision to grant a conditional charter to AMSA was illegal, improper or otherwise contrary to law.\u201d The judge determined that the plaintiffs are not entitled to declaratory relief because they \u201care not challenging a \u2018consistently repeated\u2019 practice\u201d as required under G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 2 (declaratory relief \u201cmay be used in the superior court to enjoin and to obtain a determination of the legality of the administrative practices and procedures of any municipal, county or state agency or official which practices or procedures are alleged to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States or of the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, or are in violation of rules or regulations promulgated under the authority of such laws, which violation has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>been consistently repeated\u201d). We also conclude that the plaintiffs are not entitled to declaratory relief, but for a different reason, namely, lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">To obtain declaratory relief in a case involving administrative action, \u201ca plaintiff must show that (1) there is an actual controversy; (2) he has standing; (3) necessary parties have been joined; and (4) available administrative remedies have been exhausted.\u201d <em>Villages Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Envtl. Affairs, </em>410 Mass. 100, 106 (1991). The standards for determining standing under G. L. c. 231A are set forth in <em>Enos </em>v. <em>Secretary of Envtl. Affairs, </em>432 Mass. 132, 135-136 (2000) <em>(Enos):</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">\u201c \u2018A party has standing when it can allege an injury within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme under which the injurious action has occurred.\u2019 <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 293 (1977). See <em>Bonan </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>398 Mass. 315, 320 (1986) (standing requires \u2018a definite interest in the matters in contention in the sense that [a plaintiff\u2019s] rights will be significantly affected by a resolution of the contested point\u2019). See also <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>396 Mass. 37, 42 (1985); <em>Doe </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>381 Mass. 702, 704-705 (1980). We have said that \u2018standing is not measured by the intensity of the litigant\u2019s interest or the fervor of his advocacy.\u2019 <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Boston, supra, </em>quoting <em>Valley Forge College </em>v. <em>Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, </em>454 U.S. 464, 486 (1982). It is settled that G. L. c. 231A does not provide an independent statutory basis for standing. <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 42-43. See <em>Konstantopoulos </em>v. <em>Whately, </em>384 Mass. 123, 127 (1981). To have standing here, the plaintiffs\u2019 interests must come within the \u2018 \u201czone of interests\u201d arguably protected by [the statute]. . . . [I]t is not enough that the plaintiff[s] be injured by some act or omission of the defendant; the defendant must additionally have violated some duty owed to the plaintiff[s].\u2019 <em>Penal Insts. Comm\u2019r for Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>382 Mass. 527, 532 (1981), quoting L.H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 3-22, at 97-98 (1978).\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201cThe terms used to define a plaintiff's standing \u2014 \u2018injury within the area of concern\u2019; \u2018definite interest in the matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>in contention\u2019; \u2018violation of duty owed\u2019 \u2014 are elastic concepts that have different meanings for different parties. Plaintiffs asserting standing invariably see their interests as squarely within the disputed area of concern .... Defendants, on the other hand, invariably view the issue of standing more narrowly and, unless standing on the part of the plaintiffs is definitely present, seek to insulate the governmental conduct in dispute from judicial review. In the final analysis, we must decide whether standing exists by examining several considerations, including the language of the statute in issue; the Legislature\u2019s intent and purpose in enacting the statute; the nature of the administrative scheme; decisions on standing; any adverse effects that might occur, if standing is recognized; and the availability of other, more definite, remedies to the plaintiff's. In making our inquiry, we pay special attention to the requirement that standing usually is not present unless the government official or agency can be found to owe a duty directly to the plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We first note that the plaintiffs are seeking to challenge the board\u2019s approval of a charter to AMSA essentially on three grounds, asserting that the charter is invalid because (1) the board permitted AMSA to file a \u201crevised\u201d final application<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and deprived the plaintiffs of receiving and commenting on that revised application in violation of their rights under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(g); </em>(2) AMSA failed to provide a lawful special education plan in its final application; and (3) AMSA failed to make a proper showing of a need for its charter school in the four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>towns in its region. The pertinent statute, on which the plaintiffs predicate standing, is G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (g). The \u201cduty\u201d prescribed by \u00a7 89 <em>(g) </em>is twofold and involves (1) a duty on the part of AMSA to file a copy of its final application<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cwith the local school committee for the school district in which the charter school is to be located\u201d; and (2) a duty on the part of the board \u201c[b]efore final approval\u201d to \u201csolicit and review comments on the application from the local school committee for the school district in which said charter school is to be located.\u201d These \u201cduties\u201d were satisfied. AMSA sent copies of its final application to the plaintiffs, and before the board made its final decision, it solicited, and received, written comments on the final application from the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Our review of the language and purpose of the charter school statute, its administrative scheme, and other pertinent considerations, satisfies us that the Legislature did not intend that school committees, in these circumstances, should be able to seek judicial review of the board\u2019s decision to grant a charter for a Commonwealth charter school. The statutory and regulatory scheme clearly discloses that, in the case of Commonwealth charter schools, the Legislature intended that school committees have a very limited role in the charter school process. This limitation appears in the very first provisions of the charter school statute where the definitions distinguish between a Commonwealth charter school and a Horace Mann charter school. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (a), <em>(b). </em>The Legislature expressly states that a Commonwealth charter school is to operate \u201cindependently of any school committee.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(a). </em>In contrast, the Legislature has expressly subjected Horace Mann charter schools to school committee approval. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(b). </em>The distinction has legal significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The charter school statute itself limits the role of school committees in the charter school application process. Pursuant to G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (g), a charter school applicant must send a copy of its final application to the local school committee or school committees, and the board, prior to granting a Commonwealth charter, must hold a public hearing and must solicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>and review comments on the final application from the local school committees. The statute contemplates that local school committees may have valuable insights, recommendations, or criticisms of a final application, and that the board should \u201creview\u201d and consider the insights, recommendations, or criticisms. However, this limited role of school committees in the process does not demonstrate, or equate with, a legislative intent that school committees may judicially challenge the board\u2019s decision to grant a Commonwealth charter. To rule otherwise would ignore the broad discretion afforded the board by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The charter school statute directs the board to establish the criteria, in addition to that set forth in the statute, for inclusion in a charter school application, see G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 (f). The statute also designates the board as the <em>final </em>decision maker on granting charters, and authorizes the board to impose unspecified conditions in connection with granting charters. See <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(i). </em>The board may revoke a charter, see <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(kk), </em>and is charged with developing the procedures and guidelines for the revocation of charters, see <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 89 (ll). The board may also place a charter school on probationary status. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(kk).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In administering the charter school statute, the board has not relinquished its broad discretion. The board ensures th\u00e1t at least one of its members attends any public hearing on a final application. 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(3)(b). Also, although the board is assisted by reviewers in the evaluation of final applications, the role of the reviewers is only advisory. See 603 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.04(3)(c). Last, the board at no time expands a school committee\u2019s limited role in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The charter school statute does not expressly contemplate clarifications or elaborations to a final application. The statute also does not prohibit receipt of such information. In view of the facts that the board establishes the criteria of an application, is the ultimate decision maker, and has authority to impose unspecified conditions on the grant of a charter, it necessarily follows that the board is implicitly authorized to accept, or even request, such information. Indeed, the administrative process provides for an opportunity, during the interview stage, for ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>plicants to clarify orally any misunderstandings and verbally address any deficiencies appearing in the final applications. The Legislature could have provided that local school committees are to be provided with copies of every document in the charter school application process and be permitted to comment at every stage and in response to every document submitted. It declined to do so, most likely in recognition of the fact that such a role for local school committees would make the entire process unworkable and unwieldy. There is nothing in the statutory or regulatory scheme that suggests that the Legislature intended that school committees have the last word before the board votes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The purposes of establishing charter schools, essentially to provide greater options and opportunities for innovative learning within public education, see <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 89 <em>(d), </em>are not undermined by a determination that the plaintiffs lack standing. Although school committees also have these same general goals, the concerns are too broad and general in nature to form a basis for standing. See <em>Enos, supra </em>at 138 (stating, in dismissing claims of landowners adjacent to proposed sewage treatment facility, that \u201c[t]o grant standing based on MEPA\u2019s ultimate goal of the protection of the environment would allow suit in almost every project within MEPA\u2019s jurisdiction, based on generalized claims by plaintiffs of injury such as loss of use and enjoyment of property\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The statutory and regulatory scheme establishes a collabora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>live process. We conclude that granting school committees standing to challenge the grant of Commonwealth charters will necessarily distort the collaborative purpose of the process, frustrate what was intended to be a nonadversary administrative procedure, and subvert the very purpose of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">We add that the plaintiffs\u2019 concern about the provision of special education services at AMSA might be addressed by an alternate remedy. Under G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89 <em>(jj), </em>a school committee \u201cmay complain to a charter school\u2019s board of trustees concerning any claimed violations of [G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 89,] by the school. If, after presenting their complaint to the trustees, the [school committee] believe[s] their complaint has not been adequately addressed, they may submit their complaint to the [board] which shall investigate such complaint and make a formal response.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b584-9\">There are two types of charter schools: Commonwealth charter schools and Horace Mann charter schools.
