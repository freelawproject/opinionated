L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. The defendant Stuart Roth-man is the owner of a plot of land in Orleans (town), which ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>pears as \u201cLot 12\u201d on a 1915 town plan (locus).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rothman sought to build a single-family residence on the locus, but the town building commissioner (commissioner) denied the permit on the ground that the lot did not have the minimum area and frontage required by the town\u2019s present zoning bylaws. Roth-man appealed to the town\u2019s zoning board of appeals (board), which reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision and determined that the locus was buildable under the \u201cgrandfather\u201d provision of the town\u2019s zoning bylaws, \u00a7 164-22A(1), which incorporates by reference the statutory \u201cgrandfather\u201d provisions of G.

See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17. On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge in the Land Court disagreed with the board\u2019s interpretation of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, and granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. The Appeals Court affirmed. See <em>Rourke </em>v. <em>Rothman, </em>64 Mass. App. Ct. 599 (2005). We granted further appellate review and now conclude that the board was correct in its determination that G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, renders the locus a buildable lot.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Background. </em>We first set forth the applicable law. The first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., the portion of the statute on which the board relied in granting the permit, \u201cexempts certain lots from increased zoning restrictions provided certain conditions are met . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 758 (1985). These conditions are that, \u201cat the time of recording or endorsement,\u201d the lot (1) had at least 5,000 square feet with fifty feet of frontage, (2) \u201cwas not held in common ownership with any adjoining land,\u201d and (3) \u201cconformed to then existing requirements.\u201d G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 6. We have interpreted the \u201ctime of recording or endorsement\u201d to mean the time of \u201cthe most recent instrument of record prior to the effective date of the zoning change.\u201d <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, supra </em>at 762 (\u201cthe status of the lot immediately prior to the zoning change is controlling\u201d). The parties, the Land Court, and the Appeals Court have all agreed that, for the locus, this is the time of a March, 1970, conveyance that first rendered it separately owned from other adjoining lots.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is no dispute that, at that time, the locus met two of the three conditions: it had more than 5,000 square feet and fifty feet of frontage, and as a result of the March, 1970, conveyance it was no longer \u201cheld in common ownership with any adjoining land.\u201d Thus, the only dispute is whether, in March, 1970, the locus \u201cconformed to then existing requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">To answer this question, an understanding of the history of the property and the town\u2019s zoning bylaws is necessary. The locus first appears on a 1915 town plan; it contains approximately 8,000 square feet and has approximately eighty feet of frontage. The town\u2019s first zoning bylaws were adopted in 1954 and provided, in \u00a7 5.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u201cNo building . . . shall be erected in a residence district on a lot containing less than fifteen thousand square feet and having a minimum frontage of one hundred feet; provided that one building may be erected on any lot which, at the time this by-law is adopted, either is separately owned or contains five thousand square feet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Thus, the 1954 bylaws permitted building on lots that had at least 15,000 square feet with one hundred feet of frontage, and on pre-existing lots that, at the time of the bylaws\u2019 adoption, were either separately owned or at least 5,000 square feet. Although not separately owned in 1954, the locus was buildable because it was larger than 5,000 square feet. In 1961, the bylaws were amended to increase the minimum size for new lots to 20,000 square feet with 120 feet of frontage, but they still allowed building on pre-1954 lots that, in 1954, either were separately owned or at least 5,000 square feet. Thus, as of 1961, the locus was still buildable.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The locus was held in common ownership with one or more adjoining lots until March, 1970, when it became separately owned for the first time. In May, 1970, the town amended its bylaws to allow building only on lots that had 20,000 square feet with 120 feet of frontage, or were at least 5,000 square feet <em>and </em>were separately owned in 1954. This change from \u201cor\u201d to \u201cand\u201d rendered the locus unbuildable for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In 1971, the town again amended its bylaws, eliminating entirely the language that had rendered buildable all separately owned pre-1954 lots of at least 5,000 square feet, and instead incorporating by reference the statutory \u201cgrandfather\u201d provisions of then \u00a7\u00a7 5A and 7A of G. L. c. 40A (now G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6). See St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3. With alterations that are not material, this provision remains in effect as \u00a7 164-22A(1) of the town\u2019s zoning bylaws. See note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>There is no question that, at the relevant time, March, 1970, the locus was a buildable lot. Accordingly, the board decided, as Rothman now argues, that the locus met \u201cthen existing requirements\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6. Nevertheless, the plaintiffs argue, and the Land Court and Appeals Court concluded, that the locus did not \u201cconform to then existing requirements\u201d because it was only buildable due to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>\u201cexemption\u201d or \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d in the town\u2019s bylaws. We disagree with the plaintiffs and conclude that the board\u2019s interpretation is the one more faithful both to the statutory text and to the policy underlying \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">1. <em>The statutory text. </em>The plaintiffs acknowledge that the plain language of the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., grants a perpetual exemption from increased local zoning requirements to certain lots that were once buildable under local bylaws. The plaintiffs do not argue that the locus would not qualify for the statutory exemption if, for example, it had become unbuildable due to the town\u2019s change in 1961 to require a 20,000 square foot minimum lot size. Rather, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument hinges on the concept that the locus became unbuildable because of the \u201crepeal\u201d of a local \u201cexemption\u201d rather than an \u201cincrease\u201d in a \u201crequirement.\u201d This is a distinction without a difference. Nothing in the words \u201cthen existing requirements\u201d suggests an arbitrary distinction between once-buildable lots based solely on the linguistic mechanism by which they became unbuildable.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The ordinary meaning of the word \u201crequirement\u201d is merely \u201csomething required: . . . something called for or demanded: a requisite or essential condition . . . .\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1929 (1961). This of course begs the question \u201crequired for what,\u201d and because the first sentence of \u00a7 6, fourth par., deals with exemption from regulations that govern whether a lot is buildable, the answer is \u201crequired in order for a lot to be buildable.\u201d To determine what was required for the locus to be buildable in March, 1970, we look to \u00a7 5.1 of the town zoning bylaws, then in effect, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\u201cNo buildings . . . shall be erected in a residence district on a lot containing less than 20,000 sq. ft. and having a minimum frontage of 120 ft.; provided that one building may be erected on any lot which, at the time this bylaw is adopted, either is separately owned or contains 5,000 sq. ft.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">We agree with Rothman that it was the entirety of this provision that set forth the \u201crequirements\u201d for lots to be buildable at the time, and that it had different \u201crequirements\u201d for new lots, pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>1954 lots, and separately owned pre-1954 lots. The plaintiffs contend that the provision\u2019s \u201crequirements\u201d consist only of what precedes the words \u201cprovided that,\u201d with the remainder being not a \u201crequirement\u201d but an \u201cexemption.\u201d However, the plaintiffs ascribe talismanic significance to a purely semantic distinction. Nothing in the phrase \u201cprovided that\u201d makes what follows it any less a \u201crequirement\u201d than what precedes it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that the statute\u2019s references to \u201carea, frontage, width, yard, or depth requirements\u201d necessarily limit the word \u201crequirements\u201d to specific dimensional m\u00ednimums. However, placing the modifying phrase \u201carea, frontage, width, yard, or depth\u201d before \u201crequirements\u201d does not change our conclusion that the locus \u201cconformed to then existing requirements.\u201d As discussed above, the town\u2019s zoning bylaws in effect in March, 1970, simply had different \u201carea, frontage, width, yard, or depth\u201d requirements for a lot based on whether it was in existence before the 1954 bylaws and, if so, whether it was separately owned. In March, 1970, the locus met the requirements specifically applicable to it as a pre-1954 lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">In agreeing with the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the first sentence of \u00a7 6, fourth par., the Appeals Court and the Land Court both relied on <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 55 (1992), <em>S.C., </em>415 Mass. 329. (1993).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The result in the <em>Tsagronis </em>decision, however, is entirely consistent with our interpretation of \u00a7 6. In that case, the Appeals Court rightly rejected an attempt to parlay a finite, seven-year zoning \u201cfreeze\u201d that was permitted in a previous, superseded version of G. L. c. 40A into the permanent zoning exemption of the current \u00a7 6, fourth par. To hold otherwise would have frustrated the Legislature\u2019s intent in limiting this \u201cfreeze\u201d to seven years. Because the lot in the <em>Tsagronis </em>case, unlike the locus here, was \u201cnever valid as a buildable lot except on a finite basis,\u201d <em>Tsagronis </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Wareham, supra </em>at 62, that decision is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The Appeals Court also relied on <em>Ferzoco </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 986 (1990), a decision whose reasoning we have never adopted. The <em>Ferzoco </em>court concluded that a lot which, though smaller than the town\u2019s minimum lot size, was buildable under a local \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d did not conform to \u201crequirements\u201d so as to qualify for a five-year exemption from zoning under the <em>second </em>sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In so holding, the Appeals Court stated only that \u201c[t]here was no intention [by the Legislature], we think, to pile one grandfathered period upon another . . . .\u201d <em>Ferzoco </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Falmouth, supra </em>at 987. Because this conclusion is not compelled by the statutory text or, as discussed <em>infra, </em>by the policy underlying \u00a7 6, the <em>Ferzoco </em>decision is overruled.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">2. <em>Underlying policy. </em>Our interpretation of the first sentence of \u00a7 6, fourth par., comports with the legislative policy that \u00a7 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>embodies: \u201cSection 6 is concerned with protecting a once valid lot from being rendered unbuildable for residential purposes, assuming the lot meets modest minimum area . . . and frontage . . . requirements.\u201d <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 763 (1985), quoting <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Chilmark, </em>380 Mass. 246, 261 (1980). This statutory policy of keeping once-buildable lots buildable, grounded in principles of fairness to landowners, applies regardless whether the local change rendering a property unbuildable is characterized as a \u201crepeal\u201d of an \u201cexemption\u201d or a \u201cgrandfather clause.\u201d Consistent with this policy, we have construed various provisions of \u00a7 6 broadly to protect landowners\u2019 expectations of being able to build on once-valid lots.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The plaintiffs contend that a competing policy favoring \u201ceventual elimination of nonconformities,\u201d <em>Bransford </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Edgartown, </em>444 Mass. 852, 859 (2005) (Greaney, J., concurring), demands a narrow interpretation of \u201crequirements.\u201d While elimination of nonconformity may be a general goal of zoning, it is certainly not the goal of the first sentence of \u00a7 6, fourth par., the manifest purpose of which is to <em>preserve </em>the buildable status of certain nonconforming lots in perpetuity. <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, supra </em>at 763; <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Chilmark, supra </em>at 261. By contrast, when the Legislature wished to create time-limited zoning exemptions to gradually reduce nonconformity, it knew well how to do so. Cf. G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par., second sentence (five-year zoning freeze); G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fifth par. (seven- or eight-year zoning freeze). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cIt is not our role to impose additional constraints on the interpretive instructions provided by the Legislature.\u201d <em>C.O. </em>v. <em>M.M., </em>442 Mass. 648, 652 (2004). Likewise, the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal to the need for local flexibility in zoning decisions is out of place in a discussion of \u00a7 6, which represents a decision by the Legislature specifically to <em>deprive </em>municipalities of flexibility with regard to once-buildable lots. Indeed, in this case, the board itself agreed with Rothman\u2019s broad reading of the first sentence of \u00a7 6, fourth par., thus expressly declining the flexibility which the plaintiffs claim it requires.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that the locus \u201cconformed to then existing requirements\u201d as of March, 1970, within the meaning of the first sentence of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, fourth par. Based on our interpretation of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 6, the zoning board of appeals of Orleans was correct to determine that the locus was a buildable lot under \u00a7 164-22A(1) of the town\u2019s zoning bylaw.
