The present lawsuit was commenced after First Financial denied Fuller\u2019s request to defend him under his general liability policy against claims brought by Doe. The underlying lawsuit then was settled. As part of the settlement, Fuller assigned his rights in the present case to Doe. Doe was substituted as the plaintiff in the Superior Court, seeking to reach and apply First Financial\u2019s insurance policy. On cross motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge applied the exclusionary clause in the insurance policy and ruled in favor of First Financial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-11\">1. <em>Background. </em>Jane Doe\u2019s claims stem from an incident that occurred on the night of July 14, 1995. Doe had gone to 434 Dudley Street in the Roxbury section of Boston to visit a friend. While entering the apartment building, Doe was approached from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>behind by Elwood Furrowh, who put a knife to her back and stated, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me.\u201d Furrowh then forced Doe off the premises to his nearby apartment, where he raped her multiple times, threatened her life, cut her with a knife and attempted to kill her. Doe escaped the following morning and reported the incident to the police. Furrowh subsequently was arrested and prosecuted. He pleaded guilty to multiple counts of aggravated rape, assault by means of a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to maim, assault and battery, and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-5\">As the owner of 434 Dudley Street, Fuller carried a general liability insurance policy from First Financial. First Financial, however, declined to defend Fuller from Doe\u2019s claims on the basis of exclusions contained in the policy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As relevant here, the exclusionary language concerned claims that arise as a result of an assault or battery:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-6\">\u201cIt is agreed and understood that this insurance does not apply to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of assault or battery or out of any act or omission in connection with the prevention or suppression of any such act, whether caused by or at the instigation or direction of the \u2018insured,\u2019 his employees, patrons or any other person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">Subsequent to learning that First Financial declined to defend or indemnify him in Doe\u2019s action, Fuller settled the case with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Doe. The settlement approved by the judge included the following judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-5\">\u201cJudgment shall enter for the Plaintiff, Jane Doe, on Count I of her Complaint in the amount of Two Million ($2,000,000) Dollars, of which One Million ($1,000,000) Dollars is found to be attributable to damages arising from the physical beating, stabbing and attempted murder of the plaintiff, and One Million ($1,000,000) Dollars is found to be attributable to damages arising from the rape and kidnapping.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">Conceding that the portion of the judgment attributed to \u201cphysical beating, stabbing and attempted murder\u201d was excluded from coverage, Doe stepped into the shoes of Fuller in the present case to argue that the insurance policy did not exclude coverage for the half of her judgment that was attributable to rape and kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">According to Doe, the rape and kidnapping claims are not included in the exclusion of coverage for injuries arising out of assault or battery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She argues that because rape is a specific and independent crime that differs significantly from assault and battery, we should not read the exclusionary language in the insurance policy so to include rape and kidnapping claims. In support of this argument, she contends that rape commonly is understood as a distinct and independent crime from assault or battery. The plaintiff further cites instances in Massachusetts common law and statutory law where rape is defined as a particularly heinous crime, separate from the more general assault and battery. Doe also points to numerous examples of how rape and its consequent harm are treated differently from other crimes by law enforcement and crime experts. In addition, she argues that kidnapping consists of any restraint on a person\u2019s liberty and need not involve any particular showing of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">First Financial responds that under Massachusetts law, every rape necessarily includes an assault or a battery or both. It argues that the exclusionary provision applies to Doe\u2019s case because rape and kidnapping are particular types of assault or battery. First Financial contends that this view is supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Massachusetts jurisprudence on the subject of exclusionary provisions in insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">2. <em>Standard. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). The parties produced a statement of agreed facts and exhibits in the Superior Court, leaving no material facts in dispute. The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. See <em>Home Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>444 Mass. 599, 601-602 (2005); <em>Chenard </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 444, 445 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">3. <em>Analysis. </em>We are called on to interpret particular language in First Financial\u2019s policy, namely, whether Doe\u2019s judgment for damages attributable to her rape and kidnapping falls within the policy\u2019s exclusion that \u201cthis insurance does not apply to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 arising out of assault or battery.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the language of an insurance policy is not ambiguous, we interpret the words of the policy in their usual and ordinary sense. <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. 379, 381 (1998), citing <em>Hakim </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>424 Mass. 275, 280 (1997). The relevant language in First Financial\u2019s policy is unambiguous \u2014 that is, it is not susceptible to more than one meaning, such that reasonably intelligent persons might disagree as to which meaning is proper. <em>Citations Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, supra, </em>citing <em>Jefferson Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 474-475 (1987). Indeed, we previously have interpreted the language most crucial to this dispute in similar circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">In <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 454 (1999), the</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>plaintiff sought to reach and apply the insurance policy of a motel after winning a judgment for negligence that proximately caused her to be brutally beaten and raped by a third party on the motel premises. The motel\u2019s insurance policy contained an \u201cillegal acts\u201d exclusion that stated, in relevant part: \u201cAll coverage is excluded hereunder for any claim which arises wholly or in part out of allegations of violation of any federal, state, or local statute, ordinance, or law.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 456. The Superior Court judge in the <em>Bagley </em>case agreed with the plaintiff that this exclusion did not apply to her claim because she was seeking coverage for negligent conduct of the insured motel, rather than the illegal acts of her attacker. <em>Id. </em>at 456. In deciding whether a claim of negligence was included under such an exclusion, we observed that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 must be read expansively . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457. Unlike the plaintiff in the <em>Bagley </em>case, Doe does not challenge the exclusion\u2019s application on the basis of her negligence theory of liability. Bagley\u2019s guidance to read the \u201carising out of\u201d language broadly is instructive nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The <em>Bagley </em>decision cited favorably to \u201ccases interpreting the phrase \u2018arising out of\u2019 in insurance exclusionary provisions\u201d that \u201csuggest a causation more analogous to \u2018but for\u2019 causation, in which the court examining the exclusion inquires whether there would have been personal injuries, and a basis for the plaintiff\u2019s suit, in the absence of the objectionable underly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ing conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 457, citing <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Parish, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 67, 70-71 (1999), and <em>New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 727 (1996). Applying that theory of causation here requires the conclusion that Doe\u2019s rape and kidnapping would not have occurred absent the initial assault and battery by Furrowh while still on the premises of 434 Dudley Street.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">We need not reach Jane Doe\u2019s argument that rape and kidnapping are separable and independent crimes not synonymous with assault or battery in the common understanding of insured persons. Whether that is true or not does not change the application of the broad causal interpretation mandated by the <em>Bagley </em>case \u2014 Doe\u2019s injuries attributable to her rape and kidnapping arose out of the initial assault, i.e., Furrowh\u2019s verbal threat to Doe of, \u201cYou\u2019re coming with me,\u201d and the initial battery, i.e., Furrowh\u2019s placement of a knife to Doe\u2019s back.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, the assault and battery by Furrowh was committed with the obvious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>intent to accomplish the subsequent abduction and rape. \u201c[W]ithout the underlying assault and battery, there would have been no personal injuries\u201d related to the rape and kidnapping. <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Parish, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 67, 70 (1999). We therefore read the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d in First Financial\u2019s policy to bring within the boundaries of the exclusion all the terrible consequences of the initial attack on Doe, as pleaded in the underlying criminal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, the exclusion of the First Financial policy applies to the judgment obtained by Doe in the underlying action for damages attributable to her rape and kidnapping. The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b20-12\"> Although the application for direct appellate review was submitted in the name of Robert Fuller, Jane Doe is the only active plaintiff in this case on appeal, maintaining Fuller\u2019s name in the caption for the sake of clarity. Fuller assigned his interest in this case to Doe as a result of settlement of the underlying lawsuit in the Superior Court, as explained herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b21-8\"> First Financial initially founded its denial in the \u201csexual action\u201d exclusion as well as the \u201cassault and battery\u201d exclusion of its policy. The \u201csexual action\u201d exclusion states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b21-9\">\u201cIt is understood and agreed that coverage for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 is not provided nor will the Company have any duty to defend for claims, accusations, or charges brought by or against any \u2018insured(s)\u2019 including employees of the \u2018insured(s)\u2019 for actual or alleged sexual action, sexual abuse, or employment related claims, accusations or charges. It is understood and agreed that coverage for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018property damage\u2019 is not provided nor will the Company have any duty to defend for claims, accusations or charges of negligent hiring, investigation, placement, training or supervision arising from actual or alleged sexual action, sexual abuse or employment related claims, accusations or charges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">First Financial does not contest the Superior Court judge\u2019s ruling that this exclusion does not encompass rape and kidnapping by a third party initiated on the insured\u2019s property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b22-9\"> We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Victim Rights Law Center.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b23-8\"> All Doe\u2019s damages, including her emotional injuries and her need for psychotherapeutic care, fall under the definition of \u201cbodily injury\u201d for the purposes of an insurance contract. See <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 743, 744-745 (2003), and cases cited. The nonphysical harm to Doe constitutes \u201cbodily injury\u201d because it directly resulted from the corporeal harm that she suffered at the hands of her attacker. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 698, 702-703 (1999). Thus, the nature of Doe\u2019s injuries do not remove her claims from the exclusions of First Financial\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b24-6\"> The slight difference in language between the phrase \u201carises wholly or in part out of\u201d in <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 454, 456 (1999), and \u201carising out of\u201d in First Financial\u2019s pohcy is inconsequential. In <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass. </em>v. <em>Hermitage Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 316 (1995), cited in the <em>Bagley </em>case, we contrasted the defendant\u2019s more narrow exclusionary language with an insurance pohcy from a Connecticut case that is nearly identical to First Financial\u2019s pohcy exclusion. <em>Liquor Liab. Joint Underwriting Ass\u2019n of Mass. </em>v. <em>Hermitage Ins. Co., supra </em>at 320-321 n.4, citing <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Figueiredo, </em>223 Conn. 31, 32 (1992). In so doing, the result of <em>United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Parish, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 67, 70-71 (1999), which upheld the broad exclusionary effect of the \u201carising out of\u201d language, was foreshadowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b24-7\"> The insurance pohcy at issue in <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., supra </em>at 456, also contained, inter aha, an assault and battery exclusion. Because we ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s claims were barred from coverage under the illegal acts exclusion, <em>id. </em>at 455, there was no need to interpret the assault and battery exclusion in that case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b25-6\">We read the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d broadly, but do so in a different sense than was required in <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., supra. </em>For the purposes of the <em>Bagley </em>case, we read the phrase expansively to reject the argument that the plaintiff\u2019s claim did not \u201carise out of\u201d an illegal act because her pleaded claim concerned negligence of the motel. In this case, the breadth of the phrase refers to the chronological unfolding of events during a single criminal episode. Given the general rule that the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d is to be read broadly, there is no conflict in these differing applications. This is especially true in light of the source of the interpretative rule cited by the <em>Bagley </em>case, <em>Rischitelli </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>423 Mass. 703, 704 (1996), which was interpreting the phrase in a similar manner. In that case, the plaintiff was denied insurance coverage for injuries allegedly \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of an auto\u201d where he was battered by another driver following an automobile accident. <em>Id. </em>at 704. While we interpreted the phrase \u201carising out of\u201d broadly, we interpreted the battery to be \u201csufficiently independent of the motor vehicle accident\u201d so as to not be covered. <em>Id. </em>at 707. The initial assault and battery on Doe was not similarly detached from the subsequent rape and kidnapping and consequent injuries. Cf. Mass. R. Crim. P 9 (a) (1), 378 Mass. 859 (1979) (allowing joinder where related offenses \u201care based on the same criminal conduct or episode or arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\"> Assault and battery are common-law crimes with penalties prescribed in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. Assault is defined either as an attempt to use physical force on another, or as a threat of use of physical force. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gorassi, </em>432 Mass. 244, 247-248 (2000), and cases cited. Harmful battery consists of \u201c[a]ny touching \u2018with such violence that bodily harm is likely to result ....\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 482 (1983). Battery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>by means of a dangerous weapon, such as a knife, \u201cnecessarily entails a risk of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482-483.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
