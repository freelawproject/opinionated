We conclude that there is not.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><em>Background. </em>For purposes of the present appeal, the facts are not in dispute. In October, 2005, a twenty year old woman was stabbed at a nightclub in Lawrence, after she was allegedly served alcohol despite being under the legal drinking age. This incident attracted significant publicity. Soon after, the Lawrence police department filed an application for issuance of criminal process in the District Court against the nightclub\u2019s corporate owner. Pursuant to G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, a \u201cshow cause\u201d hearing before a clerk-magistrate was scheduled, which the court indicated would be closed to the public. The Eagle-Tribune Publishing Company (the Eagle-Tribune), publisher of the Eagle-Tribune newspaper, sought access to the show cause hearing and filed a \u201cMotion to Open Preliminary Probable Cause Hearings to the Press and to the Public.\u201d The clerk-magistrate denied the motion,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as the Eagle-Tribune\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration. The Eagle-Tribune sought relief from a single justice of this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and the Attorney General filed an opposition. The single justice denied relief, and the Eagle-Tribune timely appealed to the full court. Because there is no First Amendment right of public access to show cause hearings, the single justice did not abuse his discretion or commit other error in denying the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\"><em>Show cause hearings. </em>As this case turns largely on the nature of criminal show cause hearings in Massachusetts, we describe some of the aspects of such hearings as they have developed through statute, case law, and the District Court Standards of Judicial Practice: The Complaint Procedure (1975) (Complaint Standards).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Many criminal prosecutions begin with an arrest, followed by</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the filing of an application for a complaint against the arrested person by a law enforcement officer. See standards 2:00-2:04 of the Complaint Standards. However, prosecution may also be commenced by the filing of an application for issuance of criminal process against an individual or entity by a private citizen or a law enforcement officer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See standards 3:00-3:26 of the Complaint Standards. In cases where criminal process is sought against a person not under arrest, G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, provides for a show cause hearing at which the accused is given \u201can opportunity to be heard personally or by counsel in opposition to the issuance of any process.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>When first enacted in 1943, G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, merely \u201cgave a statutory basis for a practice sometimes . . . followed by the judge or clerk of allowing the attorney for the prospective defendant to state relevant circumstances which might be thought to bear on the propriety of the issuance of process.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>333 Mass. 414, 416 (1956). The hearing is \u201cheld for the protection and benefit of the respondent named in the application,\u201d <em>Victory Distribs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ayer Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>435 Mass. 136, 142 (2001), and is not required by either the Federal Constitution or the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>439 Mass. 352, 355 n.3 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The show cause hearing is held before a clerk-magistrate, who need not be an attorney. The hearing\u2019s legal function is to determine whether there is probable cause to issue criminal process against the accused. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A; commentary to standard 3:00 of the Complaint Standards. However, \u201c[t]he implicit purpose of the [\u00a7 ] 35A hearings is to enable the [clerk-magistrate] to screen a variety of minor criminal or potentially criminal matters out of the criminal justice system through a combination of counseling, discussion, or threat of prosecution \u2014 techniques which might be described as characteristic, in a general way, of the process of mediation.\u201d Snyder, Crime and Community Mediation \u2014 The Boston Experience: A Preliminary Report on the Dorchester Urban Court Program, 1978 Wis. L. Rev. 737, 746-747, quoted with approval in <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>382 Mass. 64, 69-70 (1980). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 356; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk of the Boston Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>432 Mass. 693, 702 &amp; n.12 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 235 (1983). Thus, \u201ca show cause hearing . . . will often be used by a clerk-magistrate in an effort to bring about an informal settlement of grievances, typically relating to minor matters involving \u2018the frictions and altercations of daily life.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk of the W. Roxbury Div. of the Dist.

L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, for abuse of discretion or other error of law. <em>Victory Distribs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ayer Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 137. As the Eagle-Tribune has not argued any basis for its right to access other than the Federal Constitution, our analysis is limited to whether there exists under the First Amendment a right of public access to show cause hearings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The First Amendment confers a qualified right of public access to certain judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>478 U.S. 1, 8-9 (1986) <em>(Press-Enterprise II); Press-Enterprise Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>464 U.S. 501, 509-10 (1984) <em>(Press-Enterprise I). </em>For this right of access to apply to a particular proceeding, the proceeding must satisfy a two-part test of \u201cexperience\u201d and \u201clogic\u201d: (1) the type of proceeding must have a historic tradition of openness, and (2) public access must \u201cplay[] a significant positive role in the functioning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>particular process in question.\u201d <em>Press-Enterprise II, supra </em>at 8. See <em>WBZ-TV4 </em>v. <em>Executive Office of Labor, </em>414 Mass. 767, 770 (1993). In applying this test, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that certain proceedings, such as trials, have historically been open to the public and benefit from public access. <em>Press-Enterprise II, supra </em>at 9. Others, however, notably grand jury proceedings, have always been secret and \u201cwould be totally frustrated if conducted openly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the tests of experience and logic are met and a First Amendment right of access to a type of proceeding is found, such a proceeding may only be closed to the public on specific findings that \u201cclosure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Press-Enterprise I, supra </em>at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">a. \u201cExperience.\u201d Show cause hearings fail the \u201cexperience\u201d test because there is no tradition of public access to this type-of proceeding. Since their beginnings as informal opportunities for the accused to be heard on the question whether to issue criminal process, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>333 Mass. 414, 416 (1956), show cause hearings have always been \u201c[p]resumptively . . . private and as informal as circumstances will permit.\u201d Standard 3:15 of the Complaint Standards. Of course, the \u201cexperience\u201d test does not turn merely on the label given the proceeding, <em>Press-Enterprise II, supra </em>at 7; thus, we must also look to whether any analogous proceedings have historically been open to the public, <em>In re Boston Herald, Inc., </em>321 F.3d 174, 184 (1st Cir. 2003).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, the parties have not called our attention to, nor have we located, any proceeding resembling a Massachusetts show cause hearing to which the public enjoys a right of access.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The Eagle-Tribune argues strenuously that show cause hearings are the equivalent of the preliminary criminal hearings to which the Supreme Court has found a First Amendment right of public access. See <em>Press-Enterprise II, supra </em>at 13 (finding public right of access to California preliminary hearings). However, this analogy fails on multiple levels. The <em>Press-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number><em>Enterprise II </em>decision involved preliminary hearings held after a defendant has already been charged with a crime to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to bring the person to trial. See <em>Press-Enterprise II, supra </em>at 12. In holding that such proceedings, as conducted in California, implicate a First Amendment right of public access, the United States Supreme Court relied on the fact that they \u201cfunction!] much like a full-scale trial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7, in that \u201c[t]he accused has the right to personally appear . . . , to be represented by counsel, to cross-examine hostile witnesses, to present exculpatory evidence, and to exclude illegally obtained evidence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">By contrast, a show cause hearing, which takes place before any criminal prosecution has begun, bears little resemblance to a trial. The rules of evidence that obtain at a trial do not apply. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 229, 236 (1983) (noting no \u201cproscription against consideration of hearsay at this stage of criminal proceedings\u201d). The accused has no right to appointed counsel at a show cause hearing, only a right to have an attorney present if one is already retained. Cf. <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1970) (Federal Constitution requires appointment of counsel for indigent criminal defendants at preliminary hearings); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>363 Mass. 843, 847-848 (1973). While the accused has the right \u201cto be heard personally or by counsel,\u201d G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, counsel is \u201cpermitted to participate only to the extent that the magistrate feels it will be materially helpful in deciding whether process should issue.\u201d Commentary to standard 3:15 of the Complaint Standards. Thus, an accused at a show cause hearing does not have a right to cross-examine the witnesses against him. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, supra </em>at 415-416.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">As the Attorney General points out, the proceeding in Massachusetts that corresponds to the preliminary hearing at issue in <em>Press-Enterprise II </em>is not a show cause hearing under G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 35A, but rather, a <em>probable cause </em>hearing under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 38.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See standards 3:00-3:04 of the Standards of Judicial Practice: Trials and Probable Cause Hearings (1981) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>(Probable Cause Standards). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, supra </em>at 416 (distinguishing show cause hearings from probable cause hearings). Like the prehminary hearings that the Supreme Court has found to require public access (and unlike a show cause hearing), a probable cause hearing takes place after an individual is already charged with a crime.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 38. Its purpose is to determine whether there is sufficient admissible evidence to bind the defendant over for trial in the Superior Court,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> see <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 846-848, a substantively higher standard of \u201cprobable cause\u201d than that required at show cause hearings, see <em>id. </em>at 848-849.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>also standard 3:01 of the Probable Cause Standards. The probable cause hearing is a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the criminal process at which the defendant has the right to appointment of counsel. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 847-848, quoting <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Alabama, supra </em>at 9. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Britt, </em>362 Mass. 325, 330-331 (1972). The defendant also has the right to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 855-856. The rules of evidence are fully applicable and a finding of probable cause \u201cmust be based on competent testimony which would be admissible at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849 n.6. See standard 3:02 of the Probable Cause Standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Show cause hearings are not like probable cause hearings. They are more akin to grand jury proceedings, which likewise precede the formal initiation of criminal prosecution and employ the same \u201cprobable cause to arrest\u201d standard. See note 16, <em>supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>392 Mass. 445, 450 (1984); <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 848. See also commentary to standard 1:00 of the Complaint Standards (\u201cClerks and judges of the District Court, in effect, serve a grand jury-type function to determine whether a person is to be involuntarily cast in the role of a defendant in a criminal case\u201d). The Supreme Court has acknowledged that grand jury proceedings require secrecy in order to function. <em>Press-Enterprise II, supra </em>at 9. Show cause hearings may also be analogized to the complaint procedure for arrested individuals, in which a law enforcement officer swears to the underlying facts before a clerk-magistrate who must determine probable cause. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 22; standard 2:03 of the Complaint Standards. This is an ex parte proceeding at which not even the accused, let alone the public, is present. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smallwood, </em>379 Mass. 878, 884-885 (1980). Finally, to the extent that show cause hearings often function as informal dispute resolution sessions akin to court-facilitated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>mediation, they share in a tradition not of openness, but of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">b. <em>\u201cLogic.\u201d </em>Although the two parts of the <em>Press-Enterprise </em>test are conjunctive and failure of the \u201cexperience\u201d test is fatal to a First Amendment claim, see <em>WBZ-TV4 </em>v. <em>Executive Office of Labor, </em>414 Mass. 767, 770 (1993), we note that show cause hearings also do not meet the \u201clogic\u201d test, because public access would not significantly aid their functioning. The show cause hearing is \u201cheld for the protection and benefit\u201d of the accused, <em>Victory Distribs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ayer Div. of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>435 Mass. 136, 142 (2001), and allows the clerk-magistrate to screen out baseless complaints with minimal harm to the accused\u2019s reputation; this purpose would be frustrated by public access to the hearings. Furthermore, the ability of clerk-magistrates to resolve commonplace disputes without the need for criminal prosecution could be compromised by hearings open to the public, which may inflame the animosities involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\"><em>Allowing public access to show cause hearings. </em>While the First Amendment does not require that a Massachusetts show cause hearing be open to the public, there may be circumstances in which an open hearing is appropriate. Standard 3:15 of the Complaint Standards states only that show cause hearings are \u201cpresumptively\u201d closed, not that they should always be closed. Indeed, standard 3:16 of the Complaint Standards provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-7\"><em>\u201cIf </em>the application [for issuance of process] is one of special public significance, and if in the opinion of the magistrate the legitimate interest of the public outweighs the right of privacy in the accused, the hearing may be open to the public, and should be conducted in the formal atmosphere of a courtroom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">Where an incident has already attracted public attention prior to a show cause hearing, the interest in shielding the participants from publicity is necessarily diminished, while the public\u2019s legitimate interest in access is correspondingly stronger.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">In deciding whether to allow access to a particular show cause hearing, clerk-magistrates should consider not only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>potential drawbacks of public access, but its considerable benefits:<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">\u201cIt is desirable that [judicial proceedings] should take place under the public eye . . . because it is of the highest moment that those who administer justice should always act under the sense of public responsibility, and that every citizen should be able to satisfy himself with his own eyes as to the mode in which a public duty is performed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Republican Co. </em>v. <em>Appeals Court, </em>442 Mass. 218, 222 (2004), quoting <em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Pulsifer, </em>137 Mass. 392, 394 (1884) (Holmes, J.). The transparency that open proceedings afford may be especially important if a well-publicized show cause hearing results in a decision not to bring criminal charges, thereby ending the matter. In such cases, the public may question whether justice has been done behind the closed doors of the hearing room. This is not to say that every case that may attract public attention necessarily requires a public show cause hearing; for instance, \u201c[t]he sole fact that the person complained against is a public official or otherwise well known is not in and of itself . . . reason for the hearing to be public.\u201d Commentary to standard 3:16 of the Complaint Standards. Of course, relief from a clerk-magistrate\u2019s decision in extraordinary cases may be sought from a single justice of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The order of the single justice denying relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Massachusetts Newspaper Publishers Association.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b666-8\">In brief handwritten findings made after a hearing on the motion, the clerk-magistrate stated that the decision was \u201cbased on the [accused\u2019s] best interest as a private corporation which outweighfs] any standing the press or public may have at such a preliminary stage of [the] proceedings.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b666-9\">While lacking the force of law or rules, the Standards of Judicial Practice: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>The Complaint Procedure (1975) (Complaint Standards) are \u201cadministrative regulations promulgated by the Chief Justice of the District Court that [are] treated as statements of desirable practice\u201d to be followed in the District Courts. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the W.
