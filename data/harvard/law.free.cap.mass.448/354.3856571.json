L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>c. 123A. We consider whether individuals who are not serving any criminal sentence and have no charges pending against them, but who have been civilly committed to Bridgewater State Hospital under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, following a period of incarceration, are subject to SDP commitment. We conclude that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><em>The statute. </em>We summarize briefly those provisions governing commitment of an SDP that are pertinent to our analysis. Chapter 123A authorizes indefinite commitment to the treatment center (see G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 2) of any person who (1) has been \u201cconvicted of ... a sexual offense\u201d or \u201ccharged with a sexual offense and . . . determined to be incompetent to stand trial,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in sexual offenses if not confined to a secure facility.\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The procedure for commitment of an SDP begins with a report by an \u201cagency with the authority to direct the release of a person presently incarcerated, confined or committed to the department of youth services,\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 12 (a), which is referred to as the \u201cagency with jurisdiction,\u201d G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. Its role is to notify the appropriate prosecutorial officials of the identity of \u201cthose prisoners or youths who have a particularly high likelihood of meeting the criteria for a sexually dangerous person.\u201d \u00a7 12 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">The next step, and the one most important to our analysis, is the filing of the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cWhen the district attorney or the attorney general determines that the prisoner ... is likely to be a sexually dangerous person as defined in section [one], the [prosecutor] . . . may file a petition alleging that the prisoner . . . is a sexually dangerous person . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>The petition is filed \u201cin the superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>court where the prisoner ... is committed or . . . where the sexual offense occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><em>Facts and procedural history. </em>We set forth the relevant background of these cases, which are factually identical in all respects material to our decision. The salient facts are not contested. Richard Gillis was convicted of sexual and nonsexual offenses and was serving a term of incarceration when he was transferred to Bridgewater State Hospital pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18, which provides for the hospitalization of mentally ill prisoners. After the expiration of his sentence in December, 2001, he continued to be held at Bridgewater State Hospital for successive time periods pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, the statutory provisions for involuntary civil commitment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Almost three years after his sentences had expired, the Commonwealth sought to commit Gillis to the treatment center pursuant to G. L. c. 123A.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Mark Andrews was convicted and served terms of incarceration for various offenses, both sexual and nonsexual in nature. Like Gillis, he was hospitalized at Bridgewater State Hospital during his incarceration pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18, and was kept there after the expiration of his sentence pursuant to the civil commitment statutory regime, G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8. A few weeks after Andrews\u2019s sentence expired, a district attorney petitioned to commit him to the treatment center indefinitely as an SDP pursuant to G. L. c. 123A.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Judges dismissed the Commonwealth\u2019s petitions in each case because the defendants were civil mental health patients at Bridgewater State Hospital who were no longer prisoners serving any term of penal confinement, and thus not subject to the terms of G. L. c. 123A. The Commonwealth appealed, and we then transferred the cases to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>The SDP statute seeks to balance the dual concerns of protecting the public from sexually dangerous persons and preserving individual liberty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parra, </em>445 Mass. 262, 264 (2005); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>441 Mass. 157, 160 (2004). To that end, the statute limits the class of persons subject to SDP commitment to those who either have been convicted of, or face charges on but are incompetent to stand trial for, an enumerated sexual offense. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. In general, the triggering event for SDP commitment is the impending release, usually from prison, of a sex offender. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(a) </em>(requiring \u201cagency with jurisdiction\u201d to notify prosecutorial authorities six months prior to release of sex offender); G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12 (e), 14 <em>(e) </em>(authorizing temporary commitment of person sought to be committed as SDP who is \u201cscheduled to be released from jail, house of correction, prison or a facility of the department of youth services\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">At issue in the present cases is whether the statute also subjects individuals to SDP commitment who, though having at one time committed an enumerated offense, having already completed a term of incarceration, and facing no pending charges, are civilly committed to Bridgewater State Hospital. To determine whether the language of G. L. c. 123A extends this far, we apply familiar principles of statutory interpretation. However, our interpretation is necessarily informed by the rule that \u201c[l]aws in derogation of the liberty or general rights, of the citizen . . . are to be strictly construed . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>187 Mass. 15, 17 (1904). While the rule is principally applicable to criminal cases, and proceedings under G. L. c. 123A are civil in nature, \u201cthe potential deprivation of liberty to those persons subjected to these proceedings,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 502 (2000), warrants this more stringent analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Narrowly construing the SDP statute, as with other statutes in derogation of liberty, not only helps avoid possible constitutional due process problems, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>446 Mass. 583, 597-598 (2006), but also helps ensure that individuals are not deprived of liberty without a clear statement of legislative intent to do so. Indeed, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>adopted this approach implicitly in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286 (2002). We refused to broaden the class of persons subject to SDP commitment where \u201cthe language of G. L. c. 123A [did] not plainly and unambiguously [so] provide,\u201d and stated that \u201cany broadening of the statute would be the province of the Legislature, not this court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294. With these principles in mind, we turn to the question of statutory interpretation at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">On its face, the statute does not provide for SDP commitment of individuals who, at the time of the commitment petition, are held at Bridgewater State Hospital after completing a term of incarceration. To the contrary, the statute contemplates commitment of those who are currently serving a criminal sentence or committed to the Department of Youth Services, or Who face pending charges. General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>the provision that authorizes prosecutors to petition for an individual\u2019s commitment as an SDP, repeatedly employs the term \u201cprisoner\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cWhen the district attorney or the attorney general determines that <em>the </em>prisoner... is likely to be a sexually dangerous person as defined in section 1, the district attorney or the attorney general at the request of the district attorney may file a petition alleging that <em>the prisoner. . . </em>is a sexually dangerous person and stating sufficient facts to support such allegation in the superior court where <em>the </em>prisoner... is committed or in the superior court of the county where the sexual offense occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>Id. </em>See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 12 (a), 13 <em>(a) </em>(also referring to prisoners).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">In interpreting provisions of the General Laws, the Legislature has directed that \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. \u201cWe derive the words\u2019 usual and accepted meanings from sources presumably known to the statute\u2019s enactors, such as their use in other legal contexts and dictionary definitions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>444 Mass. 102, 105 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Zone Book, Inc., </em>372 Mass. 366, 369 (1977). The word \u201cprisoner,\u201d in its \u201ccommon and approved usage,\u201d refers to an individual who is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>either serving a criminal sentence or awaiting trial. See 12 Oxford English Dictionary 513 (2d ed. 1989) (\u201cone who is kept in custody ... as the result of a legal process, either as having been condemned to imprisonment as a punishment, or as awaiting trial for some offence\u201d); Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1804 (1993) (\u201ca person held under arrest or in prison\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1213 (7th ed. 1999) (\u201cA person who is serving time in prison\u201d; \u201c[a] person who has been apprehended by a law-enforcement officer and is in custody, regardless of whether the person has yet been put in prison\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">We recognize that G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1 <em>(m), </em>defines a prisoner potentially more broadly as \u201ca committed offender and such other person as is placed in custody in a correctional facility in accordance with law.\u201d That same section states that the definitions provided therein apply \u201cunless the context otherwise requires.\u201d G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1. Here, the context of the SDP statute, which we must constme narrowly, requires a construction of \u201cprisoner\u201d that is no broader than its ordinary usage. We will not assume that mentally ill persons civilly committed to Bridgewater State Hospital are \u201cprisoners\u201d where \u201cthe language of G. L. c. 123A does not plainly and unambiguously provide\u201d such a definition. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 294. Because the defendants in these cases, who completed their sentences and faced no charges at the time of the petitions, are not \u201cprisoners\u201d in the ordinary sense of the word, they are not within the class of persons for whom G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b), </em>authorizes SDP commitment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The key operative fact of the statute is that SDP commitment is only available if the procedure is initiated before the termination of a period of criminal confinement; if it is not, the statute no longer applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The Commonwealth contends that Bridgewater State Hospital has a unique status that renders a person placed there technically a \u201cprisoner.\u201d In support, the Commonwealth relies on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>following chain of statutory /definitions: (1) \u201cprisoner\u201d is \u201ca committed offender and such other person as is placed in custody in a correctional facility in accordance with law,\u201d G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1 <em>(m); </em>(2) \u201cstate correctional facility\u201d is \u201cany correctional facility owned, operated, administered or subject to the control of the department'of correction, including but not limited to . . . Massachusetts/Correctional Institution, Bridgewater,\u201d G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 1 <em>(n)y </em>and (3) \u201c[t]he Bridgewater state hospital shall be part of the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Bridgewater,\u201d G. L. c. 125, \u00a7 18. However, the Commonwealth\u2019s definition would make any mentally ill person placed at Bridgewater State Hospital a \u201cprisoner.\u201d Cf. G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 7 (any male \u201cpatient\u201d at mental health facility who is in need of strict security may be committed to Bridgewater State Hospital). Furthermore, there is no indication that the Legislature intended individuals at Bridgewater State Hospital to face potential SDP commitment, but not individuals at other institutions that do not happen to be affiliated with the Department of Correction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Legislature could not have intended SDP commitment to turn on the fortuity of where an individual is placed, and we do not interpret statutes so as to produce an illogical result. <em>ROPT Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Katin, </em>431 Mass. 601, 603 (2000), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Nor does <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geary, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 930 (1991), support the Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation of \u201cprisoner.\u201d There, the Appeals Court held that a defendant serving a life sentence who was transferred to the SDP treatment center at Bridgewater was still a \u201cprisoner\u201d for purposes of an enhanced penalty statute. <em>Id. </em>at 931. In so holding, the Appeals Court relied specifically on the fact that \u201c[h]is life sentence . . . remained in effect and, had he been found at some point to be no longer a sexually dangerous person, he would have been returned [to prison] to continue serving the underlying sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the defendants in the present cases were no longer serving any criminal sentence while at Bridgewater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>State Hospital at the time of their SDP petitions, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geary, supra, </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Despite the statute\u2019s repeated references to \u201cprisoners,\u201d the Commonwealth argues that the defendants nonetheless fall under the SDP statute because it mentions persons \u201cincarcerated, <em>confined </em>or committed to the department of youth services\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 1. Yet the statute\u2019s use of the word \u201cconfined\u201d does not expand the class of individuals subject to SDP commitment under \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>Nor are we persuaded by the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that interpreting \u201cconfined\u201d to include the defendants is necessary so as not to render that word superfluous. \u201cConfined\u201d may refer to persons in custody who are incompetent to stand trial for an offense; such persons, while neither \u201cincarcerated\u201d nor \u201ccommitted to the department of youth services,\u201d are nonetheless expressly made subject to SDP commitment. See G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 12 <em>(a). </em>Because they have been charged with an offense and are awaiting trial, such persons also fall squarely within the ordinary meaning of \u201cprisoner\u201d in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The amendments to the SDP statute in response to our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, </em>437 Mass. 286 (2002), do not require a different result. In the <em>McLeod </em>case, the defendant had been released after completing his sentence for an enumerated sexual offense, and was subsequently convicted of and imprisoned for a nonsexual offense. <em>Id. </em>at 286-287. During this second term of incarceration, the Commonwealth petitioned to commit the defendant as an SDP. <em>Id. </em>at 287. We affirmed the dismissal of the petition, holding that the SDP statute as then in effect did not authorize commitment of any and all incarcerated persons merely because, \u201cat some point in the past, they had been convicted of an enumerated sexual offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294. Subsequently, the Legislature amended the statute to apply to \u201ca person who has <em>ever </em>been convicted of or adjudicated as a delinquent juvenile or a youthful offender by reason of a sexual offense as defined in section 1, <em>regardless of the reason for the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>current incarceration, confinement or commitment\u201d </em>(emphasis added). G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 (a), as amended by St. 2004, c. 66, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9. The language of the 2004 amendments brings within the statute\u2019s purview the circumstances in the <em>McLeod </em>case: a convicted sex offender currently serving a sentence or facing charges for a nonsexual offense. Put differently, the 2004 amendments authorize SDP commitment of any <em>prisoner </em>who has ever been convicted of an enumerated offense. The amended language does not, however, apply to defendants not serving any sentence who have no criminal charges pending against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The Commonwealth next argues that interpreting the statute to authorize SDP commitment of the defendants is necessary to further the statute\u2019s purpose of protecting society from sexually dangerous persons at the time of \u201ctheir actually being reintegrated into the community.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shedlock, </em>58 Mass. App. Ct. 445, 452 (2003). The Commonwealth contends that it should not be required prematurely to petition for the SDP commitment of persons who, like the defendants, are still segregated from society by some other legal means.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on the <em>Shedlock </em>decision is misplaced. That case, decided after the <em>McLeod </em>case but before the 2004 amendments to the SDP statute, held that a defendant serving a <em>prison sentence </em>for an enumerated sexual offense and a consecutive <em>prison sentence </em>for a nonsexual offense was subject to an SDP petition while serving the latter sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shedlock, supra </em>at 451 (\u201c \u2018release\u2019 as used in \u00a7 12 [a] must mean a sexual offender\u2019s release into general society at the end of a continuous period of <em>incarceration </em>that began with his conviction for a sexual offense\u201d [emphasis added]). In so holding, the Appeals Court stressed that the defendant\u2019s consecutive sentence prevented the Commonwealth from filing a meaningful SDP petition while he was serving his sexual offense sentence \u2014 it would simply have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>to renew the petition years later at the time of the defendant\u2019s release. Here, nothing prevented the Commonwealth from petitioning for the SDP commitment of the defendants under G. L. c. 123A prior to the completion of their criminal sentences, rather than having them civilly committed under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Furthermore, the Commonwealth concedes that the statute does not provide for SDP commitment of a one-time convicted sex offender who, long after release from a term of incarceration, is committed to a mental facility. Rather, the Commonwealth urges that we construe the statute to apply only to those individuals who are subject to a period of <em>continuous </em>confinement beginning with a term of incarceration. In so arguing, however, the Commonwealth asks us to read an element of \u201ccontinuous confinement\u201d into the statute that simply is not there. Where, as here, the statutory text is clear, \u201c[w]e are not free simply to add language to a statute for the purpose of \u2018interpret[ing] [the statute] according to [the Legislature\u2019s] perceived objectives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1980 Volvo Auto., </em>388 Mass. 1014, 1015-1016 (1983), quoting <em>James J. Welch &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Deputy Comm\u2019r of Capital Planning &amp; Operations, </em>387 Mass. 662, 666 (1982).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The plain language of G. L. c. 123A does not provide for SDP commitment of individuals who have completed a criminal sentence and have no pending charges, but who are civilly committed to Bridgewater State Hospital under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8. Indeed, there is no indication that the Legislature even contemplated this eventuality, and \u201can event or contingency for which no provision is made does not justify judicial legislation.\u201d <em>Leopoldstadt, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Div. of Health Care Fin. &amp; Policy, </em>436 Mass. 80, 92 (2002), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>quoting <em>Prudential Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>369 Mass. 542, 547 (1976). The fact that the current SDP statute applies only to those serving a term of penal confinement may very well reflect a legislative judgment that those who are merely civilly committed due to mental illness should not be subject to SDP commitment. In any case, \u201cif this conclusion does not reflect the mind of the Legislature, it is free to change the law . . . .\u201d <em>Nei </em>v. <em>Burley, </em>388 Mass. 307, 315 (1983). The SDP statute, as a statute in derogation of liberty, must be strictly construed, and \u201cany broadening of the statute would be the province of the Legislature, not this court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLeod, supra </em>at 294.

App. Ct. 445 (2003), clearly could have been the subject of an SDP petition while serving his sentence for the nonsexual offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We are puzzled by the Commonwealth\u2019s concern that our decision today will encourage prisoners purposefully to seek transfer to Bridgewater State Hospital to avoid potential SDP commitment. The defendants concede that, under the current statute, a prisoner serving a criminal sentence who is placed at Bridgewater State Hospital under G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 18, is still a \u201cprisoner\u201d subject to SDP commitment until the expiration of his sentence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Geary, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 931 (1991) (inmate serving life sentence transferred to SDP treatment center at Bridgewater was still \u201cprisoner\u201d). For purposes of the SDP statute, a prisoner thus has nothing to gain from transfer to Bridgewater State Hospital.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
