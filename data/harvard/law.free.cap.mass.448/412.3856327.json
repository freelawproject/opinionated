Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00 (1994) (DSU regulations), before being segregated in restrictive conditions in the so-called East Wing of the prison for nondisciplinary reasons. <em>Id. </em>at 762-763. In separate actions filed in the Superior Court, the plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages for the time they spent confined in the East Wing alleging that they had been deprived of the procedural safeguards to which they were entitled. The defendants raised, by means of motions to dismiss filed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), the affirmative defenses of res judicata and qualified immunity. After hearing arguments on both motions, a judge in the Superior Court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for damages were not barred by their prior class action for declaratory and injunctive relief. The judge, however, allowed the defendants\u2019 motions on the ground of qualified immunity, concluding that the defendants had not violated \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights\u201d when they assigned prisoners to the East Wing in disregard of the DSU regulations. The parties filed cross appeals, and the appeals were consolidated in the Appeals Court. We transferred the cases here on our own motion and now affirm the judgments of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">1. A description of the background events precipitating these appeals is recited in full in <em>Haverty. </em>See <em>id. </em>at 741-747. We summarize the material facts. Litigation challenging conditions in the State correctional system, in which inmates were held in near solitary confinement in the DSU at Cedar Junction and at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Norfolk, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>indeterminate periods of time and for reasons other than disciplinary sanctions, resulted in a single justice of this court directing the department to promulgate new regulations, applicable to all State correctional facilities, governing the transfer of inmates from the general prison population to any DSU unit. See Hoffer vs. Fair, No. SJ-85-0071 (Mar. 3, 1988). In 1993, those regulations were enacted and are now codified at 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.00.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In 1995, in response to escalating levels of gang-related incidents, and an increasingly violent prison population throughout the department, the commissioner decided to eliminate use of the DSU and to divide Cedar Junction (at that time the Commonwealth\u2019s only maximum security prison) into two \u201cwings,\u201d the East Wing and the West Wing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The East Wing consists of eight units, each with forty-five one-man cells; the West Wing has three units, each with seventy-two one-man cells. Conditions are materially more restrictive in the East Wing. There, inmates are held in virtual solitary confinement for twenty-two and one-half hours each day; have only limited recreational time and few job opportunities; and eat all meals in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>their cells.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Inmates housed in the West Wing, by contrast, are allowed out of their cells for as much as fifteen hours each day (all day on weekends) and interact with other prisoners throughout those times. They eat meals in a communal dining hall and enjoy greater visitor privileges than those in the East Wing. Assignment to the East Wing generally is not imposed for a specific disciplinary offense, but rather to allow prison officials to maintain control of the prison population and to secure the safety of prisoners and staff. Until the time of our decision in <em>Haverty, </em>no procedural protections were provided before a prisoner was placed in the East Wing, or during the time he remained there, beyond the six-month classification review received by all prisoners in the system pursuant to 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 420.09 (1995) (entitling all prisoners housed in any correctional facility in Commonwealth, no matter the level of security, to receive review of their status every six months). Placement in the East Wing, and the amount of time a prisoner remained there, was solely at the discretion of the superintendent of Cedar Junction. See <em>Haverty, supra </em>at 746. The <em>Haverty </em>plaintiffs, certified as a class of \u201call prisoners who are now confined or may at some point be confined at [Cedar Junction] in any housing unit other than the DDU\u201d (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>sought injunctive relief against the practice of placing prisoners in segregated confinement in the East Wing for nondisciplinary reasons, absent compliance with the DSU regulations. Relying on numerous decisions of this court, and of the Appeals Court, suggesting, in essence, that, where conditions in a segregated unit, however named by correction officials, are substantially similar to those in the DSU, the unit must be dealt with as a DSU, at least for purposes of procedural requirements, the plaintiffs contended that the conditions of isolation in the East Wing were nearly identical to those in the DSU and, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>that the department\u2019s failure fully to comply with DSU regulations before placing or transferring an inmate to the East Wing was unlawful. See, e.g., <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325, 330 (1989) (to prevail on State due process claim, plaintiff required to show substantial similarity between DSU and administrative segregation unit at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord); <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>393 Mass. 28, 34 (1984) (inmate may be transferred to DSU only in compliance with departmental regulations); <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 429-430 (1983) (prison officials may not abuse discretion by confining inmates in restrictive housing under \u201cawaiting action status\u201d as means to accomplish punishment immune to procedures set forth in [former] DSU regulations); <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 60 (1999); <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 353, 355-358 (1999); <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 721 (1994). We agreed with this position and, in a divided decision, held that the department may not lawfully place prisoners in the East Wing without first affording them the procedural protections required by the DSU regulations. See <em>Haverty, supra </em>at 740.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In order to effectuate our decision in \u201can orderly and safe manner,\u201d we remanded the case to the Superior Court to determine the timing and manner of implementing the procedures required by the regulations. See <em>id. </em>at 764. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">2. As the parties moving for dismissal on res judicata grounds, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the defendants have the burden of establishing the elements of claim preclusion. See <em>Kobrin </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Med., </em>444 Mass. 837, 843 (2005). The defendants have not met their burden in this case. Although our cases in this area are few, we see no reason why the doctrine of claim preclusion would not apply to class action litigation, so that a valid, final judgment is conclusive on all of the members of a plaintiff class. See <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., </em>442 Mass. 381, 397 n.19 (2004). The doctrine only operates, however, to bar further litigation of \u201call matters that were or should have been adjudicated in the [original class] action.\u201d <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 23, 24 (1988) (explaining doctrine as ramification of policy considerations underlying mie against splitting cause of action). See <em>O\u2019Neill </em>v. <em>City Manager of Cambridge, </em>428 Mass. 257, 259 (1998). It does not apply in circumstances where a party has neither the incentive, nor the opportunity, to raise the claim in an earlier lawsuit. See <em>id., </em>and cases cited. In <em>Aspinall </em>v. <em>Philip Morris Cos., supra, </em>we suggested that, in circumstances where the unique experiences of potential members of a plaintiff class would defeat the \u201ccommonality of interests\u201d requirement for class certification pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, principles of claim preclusion would not operate to bar a class member from future pursuit of claims for personal injury unsuitable for class treatment. The same principles of fairness and judicial efficiency hold true with respect to a class certified, as was the <em>Haverty </em>class, under Mass. R. Civ. P. 23, 365 Mass. 767 (1974), a rule which, like G. L. c. 93A, does not allow a member of a certified class not wishing to be bound by the class litigation to \u201copt out.\u201d See J.W. Smith &amp; H.B. Zobel, Rules Practice \u00a7 23.2, at 94 (1975) (\u201cthe standard for binding absentees by a class action judgment is simply fundamental fairness\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">This position accords with Federal law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact, it appears that \u201cevery federal court of appeals that has considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>question has held that a class action seeking only declaratory or injunctive relief does not bar subsequent individual suits for damages.\u201d <em>Hiser </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>94 F.3d 1287, 1291 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103 (1997). See <em>Fortner </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>983 F.2d 1024, 1030-1032 (11th Cir. 1993) (\u201cIt is clear that a prisoner\u2019s claim for monetary damages or other particularized relief is not barred if the class representative sought only declaratory and injunctive relief, even if the prisoner is a member of a pending class action\u201d); 18A C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller, &amp; E.H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4455, at 460-464 (2d ed. 2002) (\u201can individual who has suffered particular injury as a result of practices enjoined in a class action should remain free to seek a damages remedy even though claim preclusion would defeat a second action had the first action been an individual suit for the same injunctive relief\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">3. We turn now to the defendants\u2019 claim of qualified immunity. \u201c[Gjovemment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Rodriques </em>v. <em>Furtado, </em>410 Mass. 878, 882 (1991), quoting <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). See <em>Shedlock </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>442 Mass. 844, 859 (2004). The standard is entirely objective. See <em>Harlow </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, supra </em>at 815-816 (subjective standard incompatible with policy rationale of precluding insubstantial lawsuits from proceeding to trial); <em>Clancy </em>v. <em>McCabe, </em>441 Mass. 311, 322-323 (2004), quoting <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 640 n.2 (1987) (objective standard promotes policy that \u201cinsubstantial claims against government officials be resolved prior to discovery and on summary judgment if possible\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In order to overcome an asserted defense of qualified immunity, the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>must be clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. See <em>Siegert </em>v. <em>Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991). To be \u201cclearly established\u201d for purposes of qualified immunity, the contours of the right allegedly violated must be sufficiently definite so that a reasonable official would appreciate that the conduct in question was unlawful. See <em>Shedlock </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, supra, </em>citing <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Creighton, supra </em>at 640. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has noted that \u201cqualified immunity sweeps so broadly that \u2018all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law\u2019 are protected from civil rights suits for money damages.\u201d <em>Hegarty </em>v. <em>Somerset County, </em>53 F.3d 1367, 1373 (1st Cir. 1995), quoting <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 229 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Analysis of the qualified immunity defense generally requires a two-part inquiry into whether, \u201c[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury ... the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right,\u201d and, if so, whether the right was clearly established so that \u201cit would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>437 Mass. 396, 403-404 (2002), quoting <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 202 (2001). In light of our holding in <em>Haverty, </em>only the second inquiry is in issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">As far back as 1983, a reasonable prison official would have known that a prisoner could not lawfully be assigned to the DSU without abiding by mandatory language contained in regulations, then in effect, governing the placement of prisoners in the DSU. See <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>390 Mass. 425, 427-428 (1983) (\u201cOnce an agency has seen fit to promulgate regulations, it must comply with those regulations,\u201d citing regulations governing DSU placement then in effect, 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.01 et seq. [1978]). See also <em>Kenney </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>393 Mass. 28, 34 (1984) (inmate may be transferred to DSU only in compliance with departmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>regulations). In 1989, we reaffirmed this principle and extended its application to a challenge, brought by the plaintiff Longval, to his transfer, on two occasions, to an administrative segregation unit at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord (Concord), without a hearing and the prior authorization of the commissioner, as required by G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 39, and by DSU regulations then in effect. See <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325, 327 (1989). We held that, in order to prevail on that aspect of his summary judgment motion concerned with violations of DSU regulations, the plaintiff was required to show that there was no dispute of material fact as to the \u201csubstantial similarity\u201d between the DSU and the administrative segregation unit in which he had been held. See <em>id. </em>at 330. We cautioned that \u201c[c]ertainly, the department and the commissioner may not sidestep statutory and regulatory provisions stating the rights of an inmate as to his placement in a DSU by assigning as a pretext another name to such a unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328-329, citing <em>Royce </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 429-430.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Hoffer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>412 Mass. 450 (1992), we again clarified that departmental compliance with DSU regulations, before removing a prisoner from the general prison population and isolating him in the DSU, is constitutionally required and emphasized that the department\u2019s failure to so comply would, in appropriate cases, entitle a prisoner to \u201ccompensation, beyond nominal damages, for the loss of liberties which resulted from the deprivation of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In 1995, in <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472 (1995), the Supreme Court of the United States abandoned its prior methodology for analyzing claims brought by State prisoners alleging that conditions of their confinement amounted to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>unconstitutional deprivation of due process, and concluded that the due process clause is implicated only when the challenged deprivation involves an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484. See <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 353, 355-358 (1999) (providing in-depth <em>Sandin </em>analysis). In subsequent actions brought by prison inmates alleging due process violations for noncompliance with procedures allegedly due them, the plaintiffs generally attempted to demonstrate, as a factual matter, that the conditions of their confinement imposed an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d that created a protected liberty interest under <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, supra, </em>or that the conditions were substantially the same as those in the former DSU and, thus, compliance with DSU regulations was mandatory under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In 1996, on consideration of a motion for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff in <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 60 (1999), a judge in the Superior Court issued a declaratory judgment stating that placement of prisoners in the so-called \u201cPhase III\u201d unit of the East Wing (a designated restrictive unit that, apparently, was the product of organizational changes preceding the 1995 reorganization at Cedar Junction), absent compliance with the DSU regulations, was unlawful. See <em>id. </em>at 62. The judge enjoined the commissioner and prison officials from placing the <em>Gilchrist </em>plaintiff in the Phase BJ unit without affording him those rights contained in the DSU regulations. See <em>id. </em>In 1999, the Appeals Court vacated the declaration and the injunction, concluding that there was a genuine issue whether conditions in the Phase IB unit were, in fact, the \u201csubstantial equivalent\u201d of the DSU and remanded the case to the Superior Court for such a determination. <em>Id. </em>at 64-66 (\u201cthe factual material upon which the judge based her conclusion . . . while indicating that the restrictions imposed on the two groups of inmates may be equally harsh, does not present a sufficiently full picture of their living conditions to justify the award of summary judgment\u201d). In another case decided by the Appeals Court earlier that year, <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 353, 355, 357 (1999), the focus was on whether the plaintiffs \u201cpunitive segregation\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>a \u201cmodular unit\u201d at Cedar Junction imposed an \u201catypical and significant hardship\u201d that would create a liberty interest under <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, supra. </em>The Appeals Court again remanded the case to the Superior Court for a factual analysis of the particular conditions of the plaintiffs confinement. See <em>DeLong </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, supra </em>at 357-358. See also <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 710, 721 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Consideration of the above cases leads us to conclude that, at the time that the plaintiffs were held in segregated confinement in the East Wing, in 1996 and throughout October, 2002, it was \u201cclearly established\u201d that the law required department officials to afford inmates the procedural protections contained in the DSU regulations before placing them in segregated conditions that were substantially similar to those in the former DSU. It remained a legitimate factual question, however, whether the <em>conditions </em>in the East Wing, under which the plaintiffs were held, sufficiently mirrored those in the former DSU so as to make compliance with the DSU regulations mandatory, as a matter of \u201cclearly established\u201d State law, before prisoners were placed there.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While <em>Haverty </em>resolved that question, the defendants could have reasonably (but we now know mistakenly) concluded, prior to October 10, 2002, the date the <em>Haverty </em>opinion was issued, that the law did not compel their compliance with the DSU regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Even then, in a strongly worded dissent in <em>Haverty, </em>three Justices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>of this court stood by the position that DSU regulations were not applicable to the East Wing and that the court\u2019s holding otherwise was, in fact, \u201ccontrary to their purpose and the judicial and regulatory history leading to their enactment.\u201d <em>Haverty, supra </em>at 764 (Cordy, J., dissenting, with whom Cowin and Sosman, JJ., joined). Although the dissenting Justices acknowledged points of similarity between conditions in the East Wing and the DSU, they also argued the existence of what were, in their views, significant and material differences between the two units. See <em>id. </em>at 767-768 (Cordy, J., dissenting, with whom Cowin and Sosman, JJ., joined).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In <em>Haverty, </em>we declared in unambiguous terms that compliance with DSU regulations is mandatory, under State law, before prison officials may transfer a prisoner to the East Wing. See <em>id. </em>at 762-763. If Justices on this court reasonably could differ as to whether conditions in the East Wing call DSU regulations into play, however, it cannot fairly be said that a reasonable official would have understood their applicability. In the wake of <em>Haverty, </em>when a different member of the <em>Haverty </em>plaintiff class, Kevin Dahl, sought monetary compensation, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000), for his invalid confinement in the East Wing absent compliance with DSU regulations, the Appeals Court, in an unpublished memorandum of decision, concluded that qualified immunity was available to the defendants because the law, before our decision in <em>Haverty, </em>was not \u201cclearly established.\u201d See <em>Dahl </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 1118 (2004). This result was so obvious that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Justices, on the panel decided the appeal under the court\u2019s rule 1:28, a matter of disposition reserved for cases and issues lacking substantial merit. The conclusion in the <em>Dahl </em>case was correct. Based on the law discussed, the defendants have the benefit of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">4.

Regs. \u00a7 421.01 (1994). The provisions set forth substantive criteria that must be met before placement of any prisoner in a DSU, see 103 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 421.07, 421.09 (1994), and set forth procedural rights that must be afforded any prisoner so placed. See 103 Code Mass.

See also <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>431 Mass. 1, 4-5 (2000) (commissioner has broad discretion to transfer inmates, within prison system or within particular institution, for disciplinary reasons or as investigative tool).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The <em>Haverty </em>plaintiffs also argued that the conditions of confinement in the East Wing rose to the level described by the Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Sandin </em>v. <em>Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472 (1995), as an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\u201d which, the <em>Sandin </em>Court recognized, might create a liberty interest under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 484 (setting forth new standard for determining whether there has been deprivation of liberty interest in State prison context). Our conclusion that the relief sought was warranted by the defendants\u2019 unlawful disregard of required procedures set forth in the DSU regulations made unnecessary our consideration of the plaintiffs\u2019 alternative argument based on constitutional principles set forth in the <em>Sandin </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b434-12\">A judge in the Superior Court subsequently ordered that \u201cgood time credit\u201d be awarded to compensate inmates who had been unlawfully confined in the East Wing. This order was struck down by this court in <em>Haverty </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>440 Mass. 1, 7 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b435-6\">We note that the plaintiff Longval did attempt to intervene in the <em>Haverty </em>lawsuit, ostensibly to litigate an asserted damage claim. The motion appears to have been filed in the Superior Court ten months after the case was argued before this court and one month before the <em>Haverty </em>decision was released. It is hardly surprising that the motion was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b435-7\">We have noted that Mass. R. Civ. P. 23, 365 Mass. 767 (1974), \u201c \u2018was written in the light of the Federal rule,\u2019 <em>Baldassari </em>v. <em>Public Fin. Trust, </em>369 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Mass. 33, 40 (1975), hence case law construing the Federal rule is analogous and extremely useful.\u201d <em>Weld </em>v. <em>Glaxo Wellcome Inc., </em>434 Mass. 81, 86 n.7 (2001). There is some dissimilarity, however, between the two rules. One difference, which has relevance to (but does not alter) the above analysis, is that the Federal class action rule, unlike our own, permits a judge to allow members of the class to exclude themselves. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 (c) (2) (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The matter of qualified immunity usually is decided on a motion for sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>mary judgment. As has been indicated, these cases were decided on the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). This is acceptable in circumstances, as here, where the applicability of the qualified immunity defense is clear from allegations contained in the complaint. See <em>Gutierrez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>437 Mass. 396, 404 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b438-6\"> We affirmed the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment based on the ground of qualified immunity not, as suggested by the plaintiffs in their brief, \u201cbecause the facts, taken in a light most favorable to Longval, were sufficient to show a violation of his clearly established rights,\u201d but because a determination on the qualified immunity issue \u201cwould not bar a court from declaring that Longval\u2019s rights under [State law] had been violated or from granting injunctive relief. It would only preclude the recovery of damages against the defendants.\u201d <em>Longval </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>404 Mass. 325, 332 (1989). In the instant appeals, of course, it is only damages being sought by the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In August of 1996, a judge in the Superior Court found the defendants in contempt for having transferred the plaintiff in <em>Gilchrist </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>48 Mass. App. Ct. 60 (1999), to a \u201crestrictive confinement\u201d in the \u201cPhase HI\u201d unit at Cedar Junction in defiance of her prior order enjoining the defendants from doing so without compliance with the DSU regulations. The contempt order was stayed pending appeal. See <em>id. </em>at 62. As stated above, the Appeals Court concluded that summary judgment had not properly entered on the plaintiff\u2019s claims and, in remanding the case to the Superior Court, suggested that the contempt order be vacated. See <em>id. </em>at 66. Even assuming identical conditions in the Phase in unit and the East Wing, for purposes of this case, we can state with confidence that the applicability of DSU regulations to the East Wing was not a \u201cclearly established\u201d principle of law before, or after, any of the cases decided before <em>Haverty. </em>As we explained in <em>Shedlock </em>v. <em>Department of Correction, </em>442 Mass. 844, 861 n.13 (2004), \u201cthe issue whether a statutory right is \u2018clearly established\u2019 for purposes of overcoming qualified immunity is not a matter of counting up the number of decisions that have gone each way and treating as \u2018clearly established\u2019 whichever position has garnered the greatest number of opinions in support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 861 n.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We take note of the fact, as did the Superior Court judge in <em>Haverty, </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>decisions in Superior Court cases alleging substantial similarities between conditions in the East Wing and in the DSU had been split and, thus, cannot stand for the proposition that the law in this area was \u201cclearly established.\u201d The judge stayed his decision requiring the defendants to provide procedural protections pursuant to the DSU regulations and, so that the defendants could appeal from his decision, issued an order for entry of a separate and final judgment. In his order, the judge acknowledged that he had \u201cbeen informed that the due process issues in this case are similar to the due process issues raised in another case heard in the Superior Court, Tibbs <em>vs. </em>Duval (Superior Court No. MJCV1997-05295 [May 11, 1998]), where the judge made a ruling contrary to my decision in this case.\u201d See Johnson vs. Dubois, Superior Court No. MJCV1995-01385 (Sept. 24, 1996) (finding that inmates\u2019 confinement in West Wing segregation unit, pending outcome of disciplinary hearings, did not offend due process clause because, among other reasons, that unit was not \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of DSU).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
