Stat., p. </em>2016, \u00a7 213A. Hence, it is not open to the Supreme Court on appeal to reverse a judgment of the District Court upon the theory that the damages awarded by the jury were excessive, unless there was legal error as to the rule of damages. <em>Delaney </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>434; <em>Oppicci </em>v. <em>Erie Railroad Co., </em>93 <em>Id. </em>394. Here there was no such error. Moreover, there was evidence relative to the amount of damage resulting to both plaintiffs. The argument of the defendant mistakenly treats the case as if it were before this court on a rule to show cause instead of a statutory appeal..</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
