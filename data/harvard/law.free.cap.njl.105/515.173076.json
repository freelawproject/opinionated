D. 1928.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The summons issued on the complaint calls upon the prosecutor to answer, touching a certain offense, \u201calleged to have been committed by you\u201d * * * violation city ordinance, on complaint of Commissioner Cox, and thereof fail not under penalty of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The record of conviction returned by the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">\u201cRecorder\u2019s Record\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">\u201cRecorder\u2019s court, city of Union City Case No. 2323</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">Arrested</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-14\">Name of person, Norman Cohn Summons</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-15\">Residence, 939 Bergenline avenue, city Age 35 \u2014 Nationality, U.

The first ground relied on to that end, in the brief of counsel of prosecutor, is that the complaint is fatally defective, in that it fails to state what act or acts the prosecutor committed in violation of the city ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">I think this point is well taken. The ordinance specifies the various acts, which, if committed between certain hours, as declared in the ordinance shall constitute violations thereof. It is therefore obvious that the mere statement in the complaint that the accused violated the ordinance without further stating in what respect he did so, whether by offering to sell, or by selling gold, diamonds, jewelry, &amp;e., at auction, or by offering to sell or selling at auction any other kind of merchandise between the hours mentioned in' the ordinance, during which hours such sales at auction are interdicted, fails to state with legal certainty the offense which the prosecutor is called upon to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">It is further contended, on behalf of the prosecutor, that the summons issued on the complaint of the prosecutor is invalid and of no legal effect, because it does not state therein, as required by the statute, the ordinance which has been violated by the defendant, and such omission is fatal and renders the entire proceedings against him void.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Thus, the summons commands the prosecutor \u201cto personally appear before the subscriber, recorder of the city of Union City, &amp;c., on the 14th day of November, 1928, at nine o\u2019clock in the forenoon touching a certain alleged offense alleged to have been committed by him. Violation city ordinance on complaint of Com. Cox, and thereof fail not under penalty of $100.\u201d The contention madie is well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Lastly, a perusal of the record of conviction, <em>supra, </em>discloses that it is fatally defective under settled decisions of the courts of this state. <em>Owens </em>v. <em>City of Camden, </em>and cases there cited, 141 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>24; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Kinkead et </em>al., 104 N. <em>J. L. </em>457.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The conviction is set aside, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
