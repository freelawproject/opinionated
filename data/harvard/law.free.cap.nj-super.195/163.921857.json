The robberies occurred on July 28, 1981, August 21, 1981 and August 22,1981. Defendant was sentenced to three concurrent 15 year custodial terms- with five years of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Defendant, who is black, was tried by an all white jury. Defense counsel was black and the assistant prosecutor was white. During the jury selection, nine black potential jurors were seated in the jury box at different times. Two of them were excused for reasons unrelated to race. The assistant prosecutor used 11 peremptory challenges. See <em>R. </em>l:8-3(d). He excused the remaining seven black prospective jurors. Defense counsel exhausted his peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">At the conclusion of the jury selection, defense counsel made a motion for a mistrial. He contended that the assistant prosecutor had used his peremptory challenges to excuse seven black prospective jurors based on race alone. He argued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">... the total number of black jurors that were in the panel were nine, that one lady was excused because of physical incapacity. Another lady indicated, in fact, that she could not serve and be observant because she had been the victim of a theft of a radio from her car. And the other seven, your Honor, seated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the jury panel, it is that the prosecutor used out of his 12 challenges seven to excuse those blacks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In response to the motion for a mistrial, the assistant prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">It's my understanding of the rules that I can exercise my peremptory challenges as I see fit. It\u2019s my judgment that the people I have excused, the majority are blacks, but I did excuse certain whites. I have a right to excuse them, just as [defense counsel] had a right to excuse some of the older white businessmen on the jury. He exhausted his challenges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The trial judge relied heavily on <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>202, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>824, 13 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>759 (1965) and <em>State v. Smith, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>476 (1970), <em>cert. </em>den. 400 <em>U.S. </em>949, 91 <em>S.Ct. </em>232, 27 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>256 (1970) in rejecting defendant\u2019s constitutional argument. In <em>Swain </em>the majority conceded that circumstances might arise where \u201cThe purposes of the peremptory challenge are being diverted.\u201d 380 <em>U.S. </em>at 224, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 838. Recently, Justices Marshall and Brennan voted to grant a petition for a writ of certiorari in <em>McCray v. New York, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2438, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1322 (1983), while Justices Stevens, Blackmun and Powell voted to deny the petition. Even those who voted to deny the petition, strongly recommended that state courts should serve \u201cas laboratories in which the issue receives further study before it is addressed by this [Supreme] Court.\u201d \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2439, 77 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">We are persuaded that New Jersey courts should become \u201claboratories\u201d to reexamine the use of peremptory challenges to exclude blacks, or other cognizable groups, from serving on petit juries solely because of their group association. We do not read <em>State v. Smith, supra, </em>as precluding this reexamination under N.J. Const.1947, Art. 1, 11 5, 11 9 and 1110. Three leading states have already started to operate such \u201claboratories\u201d in their state courts. <em>People v. Wheeler, </em>22 <em>Cal.3d </em>258, 148 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>890, 583 <em>P.2d </em>748 (1978); <em>Commonwealth v. Soares, </em>377 <em>Mass. </em>461, 387 <em>N.E.2d </em>499 (1979), <em>cert. </em>den. 444 <em>U.S. </em>881, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>170, 62 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>110 (1979); <em>State v. Crespin, </em>94 <em>N.M. </em>486, 612 P.2d 716 (Ct.App.1980). See also <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>monwealth v. Martin, </em>461 <em>Pa. </em>289, 299, 336 <em>A.</em>2d 290, 295 (1975) (Nix, J., dissenting). Also, a good deal of commentary has been written on the subject. See Note, \u201cLimiting the Peremptory Challenge: Representation of Groups on Petit Juries,\u201d 86 <em>Yale L.J. </em>1715 (1977); Note, \u201cRacial Discrimination in Jury Selection,\u201d 41 <em>Alb.L.Rev. </em>623 (1977); Comment, \u201cThe Prosecutor\u2019s Exercise of the Peremptory Challenge to Exclude Non-White Jurors: A Valued Common Law Privilege in Conflict with the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d 46 <em>U.Cin.L.Rev. </em>554 (1977); Comment, \u201cA Case Study of the Peremptory Challenge: A Subtle Strike at Equal Protection and Due Process,\u201d 18 <em>St. Louis U.L.J. </em>662 (1974); Note, \u201cPeremptory Challenge \u2014 Systematic Exclusion of Prospective Jurors on the Basis of Race,\u201d 39 <em>Miss.L.J. </em>157 (1967); Comment, <em>\u201cSwain v. </em>Alabama: A Constitutional Blueprint for the Perpetration of the All White Jury,\u201d 52 <em>Va.L.Rev. </em>1157 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">At the time of trial in this case, the assistant prosecutor was not required to explain why he used a peremptory challenge (see <em>R. </em>1:8-3(d)) to excuse a prospective petit juror. Consequently, he declined to articulate any reasons, if indeed there were reasons other than race, for excusing the seven blacks. Given the state of the record, we are unable to perform our appellate function. At oral argument, counsel for defendant conceded that a remand is required before addressing the issues. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Accordingly, the case is remanded to the Law Division to conduct a hearing to establish the identity of the black prospective jurors and to afford the assistant prosecutor an opportunity to establish his motive or reasons for excusing each of the seven prospective black jurors. This hearing shall be concluded by May 31, 1984. The record of the remand and any supplemental briefs shall be filed with each judge\u2019s respective chambers and the Clerk of the Appellate Division by June 10, 1984. We retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
