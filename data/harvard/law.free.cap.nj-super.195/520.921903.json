The appeal is taken from a summary judgment in favor of defendant Playboy Enterprises, Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that defendants\u2019 agents negligently misrepresented plaintiff Carolyn Berry\u2019s options for a health-benefit plan when she was hired as a cook at Playboy\u2019s Great Gorge Resort in Sussex County. Plaintiffs claim that as a result they suffered money damages because they were without family medical benefits for the first 90 days of Carolyn Berry\u2019s employment. Her husband, plaintiff Lawrence Berry, was injured during that period and was without medical insurance. We conclude that defendant had a duty to use reasonable care in explaining employment benefit options. Because the record before us seems to generate factual conflict, because the issue is somewhat novel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and because the parties\u2019 credibility is critical to the dispositive issue, we reverse and remand for a plenary hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">This is the factual background. Carolyn Berry was hired as a banquet cook by Playboy on March 4, 1981. At that time she signed this document called \u201cPlayboy Benefit Program Enrollment and Record Card\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b553-36\">From this card it is unclear whether dependent coverage was declined or accepted. The entry for \u201cDependent Coverage\u201d is marked \u201cSpouse Only\u201d but Carolyn Berry also signed the entry declining dependent coverage. She also signed an \u201cEmployee Record Card\u201d on the same date, electing union status with the local of the Hotel-Restaurant Employees and Bartenders Union, and indicating that she chose dependent coverage with an effective date of June 4, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-37\">According to the collective bargaining agreement between Playboy and the union local, the \u201chealth, hospitalization and life insurance benefits are reserved for all full-time employees who have completed at least ninety (90) continuous calendar days of service.\u201d During the 90-day period, on March 24, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Lawrence Berry was injured in an accident. The Berrys\u2019 claim that the medical plan refused to pay his medical bills because of the 90-day waiting period. Of further note, Carolyn Berry never filed a grievance under her union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. The core of the dispute is plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Carolyn Berry was never told that she could have chosen either salary or hourly status and that in a salaried status she would have had immediate health care benefits for herself and her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The transcript of argument in the Law Division reveals that summary judgment was granted solely because Carolyn Berry was a union member and therefore subject to the collective bargaining agreement, which the trial judge interpreted as requiring recourse to prescribed grievance procedures. That Carolyn Berry was a union member is beyond cavil on this record and the trial judge correctly so found. However, this finding does not necessarily mean that the present dispute is the proper subject of a grievance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The Berrys\u2019 complaint sounds in tort. They claim that they incurred extensive medical expenses because of defendants\u2019 \u201cnegligence, misrepresentation and misconduct.\u201d Specifically, they allege in the complaint that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">1. On or about the latter part of February, 1981, the plaintiff, Carolyn Berry, interviewed for a job at Playboy Club, Great Gorge, Sussex County, New Jersey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">2. At that time, she was interviewed by the personnel department and the chef, Peter Enbler, all agents, servants or employees of Playboy Enterprises, Inc., Playboy of Sussex Inc., and/or ABC Corporation, a fictitious name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">********</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">4. This plaintiff was advised by the above persons to receive her compensation by hourly wage, rather than the salary rate for her position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">5. As a result of this instruction, and unknown to the plaintiff, she became eligible for a medical benefits plan requiring a ninety-day waiting period, rather than a medical benefit plan with no waiting period. The plaintiff was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>advised of the second medical plan, until several weeks after employment by Todd Feit, Broiler Chef.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">7. On or about March 24, 1981, the plaintiff, Lawrence Berry, suffered injuries and required medical care. As a result, medical bills were incurred by the plaintiffs. These medical bills would not be paid by the medical benefit plan because of the ninety-day waiting period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">8. As a result of the negligence, misrepresentation and misconduct of the defendants, these plaintiffs were caused to incur extensive medical expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\"> We conclude that the claim alleged by plaintiff does not fall within the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s mandatory grievance procedure. Courts must decide if a dispute is within the scope of a collective-bargaining agreement. <em>Machine Printers, U.S. v. Merrill Works, Inc., </em>12 <em>N.J.Super. </em>26, 31 (App.Div.1951). \u201cIf the subject matter of the claim is not dealt with in any of the provisions of the contract, expressly or by implication, the inference is permissible that the claim, because not within the contemplation of the contracting parties, is outside the scope of the arbitration agreement.\u201d Annotation, \u201cCollective Labor Contract-Arbitration\u201d 24 A.L.R.2d 752, 756 (1952). <em>See Harmuth Eng. Co. v. Franklin Universal Bldg. Corp., </em>178 <em>N.J.Super. </em>380, 384 (App.Div.), certif. den. 87 <em>N.J. </em>390 (1981); <em>Polshek v. Bergen Cty. Iron Works, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516, 521-522 (Ch.Div.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">The grievance and arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement between Local 69 and Playboy provided, in pertinent part, that \u201cshould differences arise between the Company, the Union, or any employee as to the meaning or application of this Agreement, the following procedures shall be followed.\u201d The prescribed procedures begin with informal steps to resolve the matter, and ultimately provide for binding arbitration if the grievance is not settled. The important thing to note is that the procedures only govern \u201cdifferences ... as to the meaning or application of\u201d the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>We find that appellants\u2019 complaint does not implicate a dispute as to the meaning or application of the collective bargaining agreement. The only provision of the agreement dealing with medical benefits is Article XVIII entitled \u2014 \u201cHealth and Welfare,\u201d which states, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">The Company agrees to maintain its present health, hospitalization and life insurance benefits for all full-time employees who have completed at least ninety (90) continuous calendar days of service. The Company shall pay the full cost of such coverage for all eligible employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-6\">Eligible employees who elect to have dependent coverage shall contribute Five ($5.00) dollars per week toward the cost of such dependent coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The complaint does not invoke a claim as to the meaning or application of the collective bargaining agreement. The language from Article XVIII of the agreement is concerned with health benefits to be maintained for employees and their dependents. Plaintiffs do not call in question the meaning or application of this provision; rather, the complaint alleges \u201cnegligence, misrepresentation and misconduct\u201d on the part of employees of respondents in failing to advise Carolyn Berry of an alternative medical benefit plan under a salaried rather than hourly status. The statement in the complaint that the medical bills incurred \u201cwould not be paid by the medical plan because of the ninety-day waiting period\u201d clearly indicates that there is no difference between the parties as to the meaning or application of Article XVIII. Appellants implicitly admit that they are not entitled to payment for the medical bills under the union\u2019s health plan; their complaint does not dispute the 90-day waiting period, but seeks to hold respondents liable for breaching an alleged duty to fully advise Carolyn Berry of the alternate medical benefit plan she could have opted for at the time she was hired. The collective bargaining agreement is silent regarding any such duty of Playboy.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">We therefore find that appellants\u2019 complaint does not implicate a dispute as to the meaning or application of the collective bargaining agreement and thus does not fall within the agreement\u2019s mandatory grievance procedure. The Law Division judge erred insofar as he concluded that the grievance proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>dure under the collective bargaining unit was plaintiff\u2019s sole remedy, especially since any alleged breach of duty occurred before the formal employment relationship began.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The plaintiffs have adequately pleaded a prima facie case of negligent misrepresentation. As noted, the complaint alleges that plaintiff Carolyn Berry was \u201cinterviewed by the personnel department and the chef\u201d of Playboy and \u201cwas advised ... to receive her compensation by hourly wage rather than the salary rate.\u201d She further asserts that \u201cas a result of this instruction and unknown to the plaintiff, she became eligible for medical benefits requiring a ninety-day waiting period, rather than a medical benefit plan with no waiting period\u201d and that she \u201cwas never advised of the second medical plan.\u201d This, she contends, was \u201cnegligence, misrepresentation and misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Moreover, the form Carolyn Berry signed was ambiguous on the point of election of benefits for her family. Upon oral examination by deposition, she claimed: \u201cI think I signed for a uniform and I signed to have my husband put on insurance benefits and a statement saying, yes, it was okay for them to take the benefit out of my wages. Other than that, I don\u2019t recall signing anything else, no.\u201d We find that a factual hearing is required to determine whether as a banquet cook she had an option to choose between benefit plans, (which defendants deny), and if so whether Playboy\u2019s agents properly explained Carolyn Berry\u2019s benefit options to her, as she contends they existed, and whether she was misinformed of the opportunity to elect salary status with immediate benefits. The actual merit of the Berrys\u2019 claim is, of course, for the trier of fact after development of a full record.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">We find precedent for plaintiffs\u2019 claim in <em>Wells v. Wilbur B. Driver Co., </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>185 (Law Div.1972). There a widow-beneficiary brought an action on a group life insurance policy issued by Prudential to defendant Driver for the benefit of Driver\u2019s employees, including her deceased husband, Wells. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>The proofs showed that before Wells\u2019 retirement, he met with Driver\u2019s personnel director and discussed his employment status. He was not advised as to any specific date that his retirement would become effective so he could not calculate the period during which he would remain protected on the group policy and have the option to convert to an individual policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Justice Handler of our Supreme Court, then a judge of the Superior Court, found that Driver\u2019s failure to advise Wells of the date of termination of his employment was a breach of its implied obligation to properly advise him. The defendant employer\u2019s dereliction in this regard was held actionable. On the question of negligence, Judge Handler wrote</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">Plaintiff has moved for summary judgment with respect to count two of the complaint sounding in negligence; Prudential has cross-moved on this issue. Plaintiff contends that if there were a loss of insurance contract by virtue of decedent\u2019s failure to exercise his privilege to convert, decedent had not been properly or carefully advised as to his insurance protection by Driver\u2019s representatives and this negligence occasioned the loss. Defendants urge that neither Driver nor Prudential owed an antecedent duty to Wells, the negligent discharge of which can give rise to liability in tort.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">An individual may not be obligated to perform a service for another, yet, upon his voluntary undertaking to act, may be found liable in tort for negligently performing or failing to perform the service gratuitously assumed, even in the absence of a contractual undertaking. <em>Valdez v. Taylor Automobile Co., </em>129 <em>Cal.App.2d </em>810, 278 ,P.2d 91 (D.Ct.App.1954); <em>Prosser, Torts, </em>\u00a7 32 at 190 (1941). The principle that a volunteer must act with due care recurs in all areas of the tort field. <em>E.g., O'Neill v. Suburban Terrace Apts., Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541 (App.Div.1970); <em>Barbarisi v. Caruso, </em>47 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125 (App.Div.1957); <em>Freddi-Gail, Inc. v. Royal Holding Corp., </em>45 <em>N.J.Super. </em>471 (App.Div.1957); <em>LaBrasca v. Hinchman, </em>81 <em>N.J.L. </em>367 (Sup.Ct.1911); <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 324 at 139 (1965); <em>Restatement, Agency, </em>2d \u00a7 378 at 175 (1958); Seavey, \u201cReliance Upon Gratuitous Promises or Other Conduct,\u201d 64 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>913 (1951).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">In the present case a triable issue of fact endures with respect to whether, by virtue of any express contractual undertakings, including the employer-employee relationship or because of a course of dealing with its employees, Driver owed Wells, as its employee, a duty to give adequate advice concerning his options upon retirement including his insurance protection. Such an issue at trial would involve an elucidation of the duties of Driver\u2019s personnel officers vis-a-vis employees, the administration of the group insurance policies, the purpose and nature of the meeting with the Wellses on November 10, 1969, and the extent to which the Wellses relied upon the superior knowledge of Driver\u2019s representatives. A trier of fact might well conclude that there was a duty on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the part of Driver to guide Wells through the maze of his retirement and insurance options, or that there was a voluntary undertaking sufficient to posit such a duty on the part of Driver. That being so, the employer was bound to exercise reasonable care in the discharge of that duty, and liability would attach if it were determined that reasonable care was not exercised and Wells suffered a loss of insurance as a proximate result thereby. This would be within the parameters of the common law doctrine that one who undertakes to perform an act and performs it negligently is liable for his malfeasance. <em>Dudley v. Victor Lynn Lines, Inc., </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457 (App.Div.1958), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 32 <em>N.J. </em>479 (1960); <em>LaBrasca v. Hinchman, supra; cf. Stockmen\u2019s Nat. Bank of Casper v. Richardson, </em>45 <em>Wyo. </em>306, 18 P.2d 635 (Sup.Ct.1933); <em>Carr v. Maine Central R. Co., </em>78 <em>N.H. </em>502, 102 <em>A. </em>532 (Sup.Ct.1917). No such course of action, however, was undertaken by Prudential. Nor is there any factual or other basis to imply an antecedent duty owed by it to Wells. Moreover, the facts do not suggest that in advising Wells as to his status and rights as a retired employee, Driver through its representatives acted as the agent for Prudential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">Summary judgment in favor of Prudential with respect to plaintiff\u2019s complaint of negligence is granted. Summary judgment in favor of plaintiff against Driver on the issue of negligence is denied, there being genuine issues of material facts to be tried. <em>[Id. </em>at 203-204]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In the present case, the Berrys\u2019 complaint against Playboy is based upon a duty akin to that discussed in <em>Wells. </em>Carolyn Berry alleges that she was advised to become an hourly rather than a salaried employee. The trier of fact must determine whether Playboy\u2019s representatives gave this advice and failed to make an adequate disclosure of alternatives. The trier of fact must then determine whether respondents failed \u201cto exercise reasonable care in the discharge of that duty\u201d and whether the Berrys\u2019 lack of coverage was caused thereby. * The question of whether such a result was a recognizable and foreseeable risk of respondents\u2019 allegedly negligent conduct is an issue properly reserved to the trier of fact. <em>Carrino v. Novotny, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>355, 365 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">Several decisions in other jurisdictions hold that an employer may be liable for its negligence in circumstances similar to the instant case and <em>Wells. </em>In <em>Erion v. Timken Co., </em>52 <em>Ohio App.</em>2d 123, 368 <em>N.E.</em>2d 312 (Ohio App.1976), plaintiff brought an action against her deceased husband\u2019s former employer for benefits under a pension plan. The proofs showed Mr. Erion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>retired on July 25, 1969 and died in 1974. Seeking survivors\u2019 benefits, Mrs. Erion contacted Hoy, the employer\u2019s staff member who advised employees on the pension plan, but was informed that she was not entitled to any benefits because her husband had retired before the August 1, 1969 qualifying date. Hoy testified that he had met with decedent on July 3, 1969 but had not discussed this matter because it was company policy to respond to direct inquiries, but not to voluntarily offer suggestions, advice or assistance to a potential retiree. Hoy further testified that he was aware that decedent would have had to remain at work until August 1, 1969 in order for his widow to qualify for survivors\u2019 benefits. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s proofs the trial court directed a verdict for the employer on the claim that it had failed to advise decedent on the effect of retiring before August 1. The widow appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The Ohio Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court erred in directing a verdict on this issue. It stated, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">... under the facts of this case, there was a fiduciary relationship established between the Timken Company and the employees in regard to the consultations it had through its insurance department with the prospective retirees. Although we would not hold the Timken Company to the duty of explaining every conceivable legal ramification of the pension plan to its employees, certainly the more obvious and pertinent points should have been brought to the attention of the employees without the requirement of a specific question on the subject by the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">We hold that defendant Timken Company should have informed that [sic] Mr. Erion that his retirement before August 1, 1969, would deny his wife the survivors\u2019 benefits under the new plan, which would otherwise have been available to her had retirement been delayed until after August 1, 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">Not having carried out this responsibility to one of its employees in this regard, under the facts of this ease, would constitute negligence on the part of the employer Timkin Company. [368 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 317.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-9\"><em>See Boucher v. Valus, </em>6 <em>Conn.Cir.Ct. </em>661, 298 <em>A.2d </em>238 (1972), where an employer was held liable for negligently misrepresenting the nature of insurance coverage to the detriment of an employee. Also, see <em>Schlansky v. United Merchants &amp; Manufacturers, Inc., </em>443 <em>F.Supp. </em>1054, 1059-1060, 1064 (S.D.N.Y. 1977), where an employer\u2019s motion to dismiss a former employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ee\u2019s claim of negligent misrepresentation as to a pension plan was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In <em>Gediman v. Amheuser Busch, Inc., </em>299 <em>F.</em>2d 537 (2nd Cir.1962), Judge Friendly, applying New York law, held that the failure of the employer\u2019s pension consultants to warn an employee that an election to take cash distributions at a later date would enormously reduce the death benefit on the event of employee\u2019s death before that date allowed a recovery in tort against the employer. To reach this holding, Judge Friendly relied in part on \u00a7 552 of the Restatement of Torts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, and Judge Cardozo\u2019s famous opinion in <em>Glanzer v. Shepard, </em>233 <em>N.Y. </em>236, 135 <em>N.E. </em>275 (1922). <em>Glanzer </em>was a case where the public weigher was liable for furnishing an erroneous weight certificate causing the plaintiff, who had not employed him, to overpay for a purchase of beans. <em>Glanzer </em>has been cited with approval by our Supreme Court as recently as <em>Rosenblum v. Adler, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>324, 337-338 (1983). In <em>Gediman </em>Judge Friendly stated that the relationship between defendant, its pension consultants and the deceased \u201cwas plainly of the sort, described in the Restatement, where negligent communication, or failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to communicate with clarity, may give rise to liability.\u201d 299 <em>F.</em>2d at 544. \u201cHaving undertaken to advise, defendant was bound to advise clearly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546. Citing <em>Glanzer, </em>135 <em>N.E. </em>at 275, the court observed \u201cthat one who assumed to act, even though gratuitously, may thereby become subject to the duty of acting carefully, if he acts at all.\u201d 299 <em>F.2d </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Because material issues of fact appear to exist on this record as to whether Playboy adequately advised Carolyn Berry as to her options for supplementary benefits upon her assumption of employment, we reverse and remand for plenary hearing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"><em>Beadling v. Sirotta, </em>39 <em>N.J. </em>34, 35 (1962) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The legal issue which the parties seek to present carry important implications and they should not be determined in a vacuum or in academic fashion; the preferable procedure is to permit the matter to be tried and determined in regular course. <em>Cf.
