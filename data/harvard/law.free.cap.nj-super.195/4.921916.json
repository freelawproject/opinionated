Property Liab., etc. v. State, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>348 (Ch.Div.1982), and need only be summarized here. The Bells were approved foster parents for the State of New Jersey. In 1978, two apparently abandoned juveniles, Nathaniel Rodger Murray and his sibling, were found and turned over to the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS). DYFS placed the children with the Bells on a temporary basis while the natural parents were sought. During this time, Nathaniel was accidently injured. When his parents were located and Nathaniel returned to them, they instituted a negligence suit in the Law Division against both the State and the Bells. The State refused to defend or indemnify the Bells, and their insurance carrier, plaintiffs New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association and the Long Island Insurance Company in liquidation, then instituted suit in the Chancery Division against the State, the Bells and the Murrays, seeking a declaration that the State was obligated to defend and indemnify the Bells. The two actions were consolidated and the Chancery Division entered judgment declaring that the Bells were State employees and thus entitled to defense and indemnification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>The New Jersey Tort Claims Act requires the Attorney General to defend any State employee who is sued on account of an act or omission occurring in the scope of his employment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:10A-1. Indemnification for the State employee is authorized both when the Attorney General provides for the employee\u2019s defense, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:10-1, and when the Attorney General refuses to provide for the employee\u2019s defense. <em>N.J. S.A. </em>59:10-2. \u201cEmployee\u201d is defined to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">... an officer, employee or servant, whether or not compensated or part-time, who is authorized to perform any act or service; provided, however, that the term does not include an independent contractor. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The few reported decisions involving \u201cemployee\u201d as it is used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3 shed little light on how the word should be construed. <em>See Woodsum v. Pemberton Tp., </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 521 (Law Div.1980), aff\u2019d 177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>639 (App.Div. 1981); <em>Malloy v. State, </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 24 (App.Div.1977), rev\u2019d 76 <em>N.J. </em>515 (1978); <em>Girard v. Alverez, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>259, 262 (App.Div.1976). <em>See also Vacirca v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 417 (Law Div.1983); <em>Martin v. Tp. of Rochelle Park, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>216, 221 (App.Div.1976). Guidance must therefore be sought from common-law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">It has long been recognized that control by the master over the servant is the essence of the master-servant relationship on which the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>is based. <em>See, e.g., Cuff v. Newark &amp; New York R. Co., </em>35 <em>N.J.L. </em>17, 23 (Sup.Ct.1870), aff\u2019d o.b., 35 <em>N.J.L. </em>574 (E. &amp; A. 1871); <em>Courtinard v. Gray Burial Co., </em>98 <em>N.J.L. </em>493, 495 (E. &amp; A. 1922). Under the control test, \u201c[t]he relation of master and servant exists whenever the employer retains the right to direct the manner in which the business shall be done, as well as the result to be accomplished, or in other words, not only what shall be done, but how it shall be done.\u201d <em>Errickson v. Schwiers Co., </em>108 <em>N.J.L. </em>481, 483 (E. &amp; A. 1931). In contrast to a servant, an independent contractor is defined as \u201cone who, carrying on an independent business, contracts to do a piece of work according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>to his own methods, and without being subject to the control of his employer as to the means by which the result is to be accomplished, but only as to the result of the work.\u201d <em>Errickson, supra; accord, Wilson v. Kelleher Motor Freight Lines, Inc., </em>12 <em>N.J. </em>261, 264 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Following enactment in this State of workers\u2019 compensation legislation, our courts applied the control test \u2014 used to identify the master-servant relationship \u2014 in order to determine whether a claimant is an \u201cemployee\u201d as it was defined in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36, <em>L. </em>1911, c. 95, \u00a7 23, as amended.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., DeMonaco v. Renton, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>352, 355 (1955); <em>Piantanida v. Bennett, </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>291, 294-295 (1955); <em>Wilson, supra; Errickson, supra; Essbee Amusement Corp. v. Greenhaus, </em>114 <em>N.J.L. </em>492, 493 (Sup.Ct.1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">However, use of the control test to determine whether one is an employee for purposes of social legislation such as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is inapposite because <em>\u201c[the basic purpose for which the definition is used in compensation law is entirely different from the common-law purpose].\u201d Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 43.42 at 8-16 (1982) (emphasis in original). Although it is logical to condition the master\u2019s liability to a third party for the torts of a servant on the control over the servant which the master has the right to exercise, absence of control is not necessarily significant where the employee himself seeks compensation for work-related injuries. <em>See Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, supra; Brower v. Rossmy, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395, 404 (App.Div.1960), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>certif. den. 34 <em>N.J. </em>65 (1961); <em>Marcus v. Eastern Agricultural Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>584, 602 (App.Div.1959) (Conford, J.A.D., dissenting), rev\u2019d on dissent, 32 <em>N.J. </em>460 (1960). As Judge Conford observed in his dissent in <em>Marcus:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\"><em>... </em>there are various situations in which the control test does not emerge as the dispositive factor. For example, where it is not in the nature of the work for the manner of its performance to be within the hiring party\u2019s direct control, the factor of control can obviously not be the critical one in the resolution of the case, but takes its place as only one of the various potential <em>indicia </em>of the relationship which must be balanced and weighed in determining what, under the totality of the circumstances, the character of that relationship really is. [58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 597]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-7\"><em>Accord, DeMonaco, supra, </em>18 <em>N.J. </em>at 357; <em>Hannigan v. Goldfarb, </em>53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 196-197 (App.Div.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division on the basis of Judge Conford\u2019s dissent, the Supreme Court adopted a new test of the employer-employee relationship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">... the test in the type of case before us here must, therefore, be essentially an economic and functional one, and the determinative <em>criteria </em>not the inconclusive details of the arrangement between the parties, but rather the extent of the economic dependence of the worker upon the business he serves and the relationship of the nature of his work to the operation of that business. [58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 603]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">It has been repeatedly recognized, both implicitly and explicitly, that the \u201crelative nature of the work\u201d test was adopted in <em>Marcus </em>for purposes of defining the employer-employee relationship in workers\u2019 compensation cases. <em>See, e.g., Caicco v. Toto Brothers, Inc., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>305, 309 (1973); <em>Kalnas v. Layne of New York Co., </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>492, 497 (App.Div.1980); <em>Smith v. E.T.L. Enterprises, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 351 (App.Div.1978); <em>Rossnagle v. Capra and Shell Oil Co., </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>507, 517 (App.Div.1973), affd o.b. 64 <em>N.J. </em>549 (1974); <em>Tofani v. LoBiondo Brothers Motor Express, Inc., </em>83 <em>N.J.Super. </em>480, 486 (App.Div.1964), aff\u2019d o.b. 43 <em>N.J. </em>494 (1964); <em>Buchner v. Bergen Evening Record, </em>81 <em>N.J.Super. </em>121, 130 (App.Div.1963); <em>Brower, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 404. The rationale behind allowing a broader test of \u201cemployee\u201d in the context of workers\u2019 compensation cases is grounded in the fact that, as social legislation, the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tion Act is to be liberally construed in order that its beneficent purposes may be accomplished. <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Restaurant Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>72, 88 (1957); <em>Gargiulo v. Gargiulo, </em>13 <em>N.J. 8, </em>13 (1953). For example, in <em>Hannigan, supra, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"An\">The term \u201cemployee\u201d in our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is not limited to narrow common-law concepts for, in addition to servants, it \u201cincludes all natural persons * * * who perform service for an employer for financial consideration.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-36. This is a broad definition which includes relationships not ordinarily considered to constitute employment. Our act is construed to bring as many cases as possible within its coverage____ [53 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 195; citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">It is clear from the above analysis that the trial court here mistakenly applied the relative nature of the work test to a situation not involving a workers\u2019 compensation action. The analysis should have been based on the control test alone. Although we recognize that there may be non-compensation cases involving social legislation where public policy considerations require that the control test be supplemented by the relative nature of the work standard, <em>see, e.g., Pelliccioni v. Schuyler Packing Co., </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 199 (App.Div.1976) (employee of trucking company which was wholly owned subsidiary of railroad brought action against railroad under Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 51 to 60), the instant appeal does not present such a case. The fact that the legislation underlying DYFS is to be liberally construed, <em>N.J. S.A. </em>30:40-10, does not require us to apply the relative nature of the work standard to determine whether foster parents are employees for purposes of the Tort Claims Act. That act was designed to limit, not broaden, governmental liability, and we construe it accordingly. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-2; <em>Woodsum, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 517; <em>Burg v. State, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>316, 320 (App.Div.1977), certif. den. 75 <em>N.J. </em>11 (1977). We therefore hold to the view that the proper standard to determine whether the Bells, as foster parents, are employees of the state as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:1-3 is a test of control.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">We now turn to the facts of the instant case as they bear upon the question of control. DYFS is directed to provide care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>and custody for children \u201cin such manner that the children may, so far as practicable, continue to live in their own homes and family life be thereby preserved and strengthened...\u201d <em>N.J. S.A. </em>30:4C-3(a). It is statutorily empowered to place a child in a foster home whenever it appears that his needs cannot be adequately met in his own home. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-26(a). \u201cFoster care is designed as a temporary palliative to care for children whose parents are unable to do so for one or more reasons----\u201d <em>W.C. v. P.M., </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 565 (App.Div. 1978), certif. den. 75 <em>N.J. </em>606 (1978). DYFS is authorized to make necessary payments for maintenance of any child in its care, including board, lodging, clothing, medical, dental and hospital expenses. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-27. In its administrative capacity, DYFS has discretionary authority to remove children from the foster home and reunite them with their natural family whenever it is deemed appropriate. <em>W.C. v. P.M., supra, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 562-563.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">A foster parent is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">any person other than a natural or adoptive parent with whom a child in the care, custody or guardianship of [DYFS] is placed by said division, or with its approval, for temporary or long term care, but shall not include any persons with whom a child is placed for the purpose of adoption. <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-2(h); <em>see </em>30:40-26.4; 30:40-26.6; 30:40-27.1]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The responsibilities of the foster parent include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">accepting the child as a temporary member of his family and involving the child in family activities; assisting the child in adjusting to the foster home and in forming positive relationships with the foster parent\u2019s own children and with other foster children in the home; providing the child with adequate shelter, a well-balanced diet, and appropriate clothing, providing the child with a homelife that will meet his emotional needs for acceptance, guidance, stability, and security; enabling the child\u2019s cultural heritage and religious beliefs to be practiced; respecting the child\u2019s need for privacy and independence; assisting the child in adjusting to his school and encouraging his participation in school and community activities; and encouraging and promoting the child\u2019s relationship with his own family, if appropriate to the case plan. [Policy and Procedures Manual, \u00a7 902]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4027, DYFS is authorized to provide maintenance payments to foster parents for the benefit of children under its jurisdiction. <em>See also N.J.A. C. </em>10:122A-1.5. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>That same statute provides \u201c[w]henever a child under care, custody or guardianship is in need of operation, anaesthesia, diagnostic tests or treatment, [DYFS] may give its consent thereto.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:40-27. In the written agreement entered into between DYFS and the Bells, as foster parents, the Bells agree to \u201cconsult\u201d with an agency social worker \u201cbefore making important decisions.\u201d They will \u201csecure consent\u201d from DYFS before taking the child outside the city or county for extended visits or vacations. The foster parents agree not to make independent plans concerning the child either with his parents or others, and to notify DYFS immediately if the child develops abnormal behavior or illness. In addition to paying for the foster child\u2019s board, clothing and medical expenses, DYFS agrees to visit the child and foster home \u201cregularly\u201d and \u201cbe available to give any service needed for the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d DYFS will also assist the foster parents in \u201ccarrying out [their] responsibility toward the child by giving [them] information regarding the child\u2019s needs through suggestions and consultation regarding care of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">We find that these circumstances do not denote a degree of control by DYFS over foster parents sufficient to confer employee status on the Bells under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act. While DYFS has authority to direct the result to be accomplished \u2014 providing foster children with a normal, wholesome home life \u2014 it does not retain control over the means by which this was to be done. In filling parental roles, the Bells enjoyed considerable autonomy regarding the details of day-today supervision of foster children in their home. By the terms of their agreement with DYFS, the Bells were to be <em>assisted </em>in carrying out their responsibility to foster children, and were required merely to <em>consult </em>DYFS before making important decisions. The words \u201cassist\u201d and \u201cconsult\u201d clearly reflect the diminished control DYFS exercised over the Bells regarding the means (as compared with the ends) of foster care. <em>Cf. Marion v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>72 <em>N.J.Super. </em>146, 154-155 (App.Div.1962) (the word \u201cguided\u201d connotes something differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ent than \u201cdirected\u201d and should not be interpreted as signifying a right of control). The agreement thus casts the Bells in a unique role more akin to that of independent contractors than servants. Although the Bells must obtain consent from DYFS for medical treatments to a child under their care and removal of the child outside the county for extended visits or vacations, such situations do not ordinarily arise in the course of day-today routine and are peripheral to the question of <em>how </em>the Bells satisfy the needs of the foster child. Expressed differently, the consent requirements here vest DYFS with only negligible control over the way the Bells structure and carry out the work or caring for the foster child.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Other <em>indicia </em>of control tend to support this conclusion as well. Among the factors our courts have considered to infer an employer\u2019s right of control over an employee (aside from direct evidence of control and exercise of control) are the method of payment; who furnishes the equipment, and right of termination. <em>Tofani, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 486. <em>Cf </em>1 <em>Restatement Agency </em>2d, \u00a7 220 at 485-486 (1958). Since foster parents receive no compensation other than renumeration for expenses incurred in the course of foster care, the \u201cmethod of payment\u201d criterion mitigates against a finding that the Bells are employees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, DYFS does not furnish \u201cequipment\u201d to foster parents; it merely provides maintenance payments for clothing, board, lodging, etc. The true \u201cequipment\u201d of foster care is the home and houseware, tableware, bedding and utilities furnished by the foster parents themselves. <em>Cf. Tofani, supra, </em>83 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 486. The discretionary authority vested in DYFS to remove children from the foster home when it deems such action appropriate does not indicate a right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>control sufficient to transform the Bells into employees where the majority of factors point to the contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Looking to the decisions of other jurisdictions, we find only one case adequately addressing the issue presented here. <em>See generally </em>Annotation, \u201cNegligence in placement of children,\u201d 90 <em>A.L.R.Bd </em>1214 (1979). In <em>Kern v. Steele County, </em>322 <em>N.W. </em>2d 187 (Minn.Sup.Ct.1982), a foster child was injured while in the Kern\u2019s care, and her mother brought suit against them. The Kerns unsuccessfully tendered defense of the suit to Steele County and its insurer. The Kerns then brought a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that they were employees of Steele County within the meaning of an insurance policy covering Steele County and \u201cany employee.\u201d The trial court so found, and the liability insurer of Steele County appealed. The Minnesota Supreme Court considered five factors in determining the existence of an employment relationship: \u201c(1) The right of the employer to control the manner and means of performance of the work; (2) The mode of payment; (3) Furnishing of materials or tools; (4) Control of the premises where the work is to be performed; and (5) Right of discharge.\u201d <em>Kern, supra, </em>322 <em>N.</em>W.2d at 189. There, as here, each of these considerations except the right of discharge indicated that an employment relationship did not exist, and the Court concluded that the right of discharge alone cannot overcome the weight of the other factors. The Court therefore held that \u201cthe Kerns, in their capacity as foster parents, were not employees of Steele County.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>In other cases where a state or county (or an agency thereof) is held vicariously liable for the torts of foster parents, that holding has been based upon a non-delegable duty of care to the child. <em>See, e.g., Bartels v. County of Westchester, </em>76 A.D.2d 517, 429 <em>N.Y.S. </em>906 (N.Y.App.Div.1980); <em>Vonner v. State Department of Public Welfare, </em>273 <em>So. </em>2d 252 (La.Sup.Ct.1973). In fact, we note that the <em>Vonner </em>court expressly refrained from reaching a determination of whether foster parents were servants of the Department of Public Welfare. <em>Vonner, supra, </em>273 So.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>256, n. 3. Although in at least one case, <em>Pickett v. Washington Cty., </em>31 <em>Or.App. </em>1263, 572 P.2d 1070 (Or.App.1977), the court appears to assume the employee status of foster parents, we are convinced that such a finding would be ill-founded in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Moreover, we cannot conceive that our Legislature intended that foster parents be State employees within the purview of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act. A legal theory conferring employee status on foster parents would not only render the State liable for injuries suffered by foster children while in the care of foster parents, but also would expose the State to liability for injuries suffered by third parties as a result of the foster parents\u2019 torts. To adopt such a theory would place an intolerable burden upon the State and might well diminish the beneficial effects of the foster parent program and compel a return to institutional .care as the sole means of addressing the plight of abused and neglected children.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">We therefore hold that the Bells, as foster parents, are not employees of the State for purposes of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, and thus are not entitled to indemnification under that act. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Subsequent to this judgment, the Law Division entered an order approving settlement of the case in chief in favor of the Murrays.
