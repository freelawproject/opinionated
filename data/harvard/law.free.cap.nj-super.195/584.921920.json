Under the terms of the plea agreement, the State agreed to recommend that any custodial term imposed should \u201c... be to Yardville and not to exceed ten years.\u201d In addition, the State agreed to dismiss other counts of the indictment against defendant, which counts stemmed from the same criminal episode as the robbery. The State also stipulated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Graves Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c, was inapplicable because the gun used by defendant or one of the codefendants, and described by defendant and one of the codefendants as a \u201ctoy gun,\u201d had not been recovered and could not be proved to be an operable handgun. The trial judge sentenced defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections at Yardville for an indeterminate term not to exceed seven years. This is defendant\u2019s accelerated appeal from his sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Due to traumatic injuries which he sustained at the age of five, defendant suffers from left hemiplegia, meaning that he is partially paralyzed on the left side. Additionally, he suffers frequent seizures of the grand mal type. His seizures are treated by the medication phenobarbital, although not totally controlled by this medication. The pre-sentence report states that \u201c[i]f the Graves Act were not applicable, this writer would recommend a probation term, to include occupational therapy in a sheltered workshop.\u201d The pre-sentence report reveals that \u201c... defendant attended A. Harry Moore Laboratory School ... and Hudson County Vo-Tech School, graduating in 1982,\u201d and that \u201che performed well in school.\u201d Attached to the pre-sentence report is a letter to the probation officer from the School Social Worker of the A. Harry Moore Laboratory School, expressing the opinion that a jail sentence can neither \u201cdeter or rehabilitate\u201d defendant and stating that \u201c[ajlthough he has had an uneven success rate with a sheltered workshop placement, I do feel strongly that he is a candidate for a rehabilitative sheltered workshop setting such as may be offered in New York City.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">At the time of sentence, the trial judge referred to <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334 (1984), and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">Frankly, if it weren\u2019t for the Roth Case, I would probably follow \u2014 I would follow the recommendation of the Probation Department in this case. As I read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>the Roth Case, I don\u2019t have the authority to do so. I have to give a custodial sentence under the law. If the defendant wants to take an appeal and clarify the Roth Case, that is up to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">As I see it, I have to give it a custodial sentence. I\u2019m going to impose the presumptive custodial sentence for a second-degree offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Furthermore, in the judgment of conviction the trial judge gave the following statement of reasons pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:21-4(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">1. The nature of the offense, 1st degree robbery, justifies confinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">2. This is defendant\u2019s first conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">3. The Graves Act is not applicable in the case of a toy gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">4. The defendant\u2019s health problems do not excuse him but can be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">5. An older co-defendant had the major role.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-12\">6. Defendant is not likely to commit another offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">7. The mitigating factors justify a sentence for 2nd degree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">8. I would consider a different type of sentence in view of his medical and intellectual problems. <em>I interpret the recent Roth case as preventing me from doing so </em>[emphasis supplied].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\">9. It is requested that the Department of Corrections give special consideration to the defendant\u2019s medical history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-16\">In concluding that under no circumstances could he dispense with a custodial term in sentencing a defendant on a crime of the first or second degree, the trial judge misread <em>State v. Roth, </em>supra. In <em>Roth, </em>the Court dealt with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(d), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-17\">The court shall deal with a person who has been convicted of a crime of the first or second degree by imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that his imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-18\">In discussing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(d), the Court declared the legislation vested a \u201cresiduum of power\u201d in the trial courts, but one to be exercised \u201conly under the narrow exception of the statute____\u201d With reference to the statutory exception under which the trial court may decide that \u201c... imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others,\u201d the <em>Roth </em>court declared that this standard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>is met only in \u201ctruly extraordinary and unanticipated circumstances.\u201d 95 <em>N.J. </em>at 358. Thus, the Court stated that \u201c[a]bsent a proper determination of \u2018serious injustice\u2019 considering the character and condition of the defendant, the trial court must impose a custodial sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358-59. As stated in <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 378-79 (1984), \u201c... the severity of the crime is now the single most important factor in the sentencing process.\u201d However, when a sentencing judge justifiably decides that imprisonment would be a serious injustice under the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(d), the judge need not be a computer automatically imposing a custodial sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\"> We wish to make it clear that we have not decided here that the trial judge abused his discretion when he imposed a custodial sentence upon defendant. Similarly, it would not be an abuse of discretion if the trial judge should forgo the imposition of a custodial sentence because he \u201c... is of the opinion that his [defendant\u2019s] imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(d). Within the constraints of the statute, there is still some discretion reposed in the sentencing judge. We should not disturb the trial judge\u2019s exercise of that discretion absent a clear abuse, <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 363 and we will not substitute our discretion for that of the trial judge. Our intention is merely that he should sentence defendant with a proper understanding of the holding in <em>State v. Roth, supra, </em>and not under the misconception that <em>Roth </em>mandates a custodial sentence for crimes of the first and second degree no matter what the circumstances may be. Accordingly, we remand the matter to the trial court for resentencing of defendant in keeping with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1(d) as explicated in <em>State v. Roth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b617-10\">We have previously granted defendant's motion for bail pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
