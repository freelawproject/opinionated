For the reasons expressed in his opinion reported at 186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>262 (1982), Judge Newman invoked <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2G:44-3d to impose an extended term of imprisonment of 25 years with 8V3 years of parole ineligibility. See <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7c. On this appeal from the judgment of conviction, defendant urges only that he is not subject to a mandatory sentence under either <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3d.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Defendant\u2019s conviction rests upon proofs, unchallenged on this appeal, that he and an unidentified man asked Joseph Mann for a ride in his van. As they were driving, the unidentified person told Mann to \u201cGive up your money, brother.\u201d Mann asked defendant \u201cwhat is going on?\u201d and defendant told him \u2022 \u201cto shut ... up\u201d and give over the money. Mann saw that the unidentified man had \u201ca small handgun in his hand.\u201d The man took Mann\u2019s wallet from his pocket. Defendant then turned the ignition off and took the key, and he and his cohort fled the vehicle. Neither the handgun nor the unidentified man was ever found.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Defendant acknowledges that the evidence sufficed to establish his guilt of armed robbery. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1. He also does not dispute Judge Newman\u2019s finding that the jury had before it \u201cno testimony to contradict the conclusion that the gun was real.\u201d 186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 267. However, he argues that mandatory sentences may be imposed under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3d only upon a showing of use or possession of a \u201cfirearm as defined in 2C:39-lf\u201d and that the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d requires a showing of operability. Since the handgun here was never proved operable, defendant urges, he was not subject to the mandatory sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The contention is unpersuasive. \u201cFirearm\u201d is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf to include \u201cany hand gun, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, automatic or semi-automatic rifle____\u201d \u201cHand gun,\u201d in turn, is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-8\">\u2018Hand gun\u2019 means any pistol, revolver or other firearm originally designed or manufactured to be fired by the use of a single hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">This definition of \u201chand gun\u201d does not require any showing of present operability but only that the gun was \u201coriginally designed or manufactured\u201d to be operable in a particular manner. Given Judge Newman\u2019s finding, not disputed by defendant, that the gun here was \u201creal,\u201d the conclusion is unavoidable that it was a \u201chand gun\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lk, and thus was a \u201cfirearm\u201d as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39 \u2014 If.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Defendant urges that operability must be proved because the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d also includes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-11\">... any gun, device or instrument in the nature of a weapon from which may be fired or ejected any solid projectible ball, slug, pellet, missile or bullet, or any gas, vapor or other noxious thing, by means of a cartridge or shell or by the action of an explosive or the igniting of flammable or explosive substances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am-\">This language, we are satisfied, is intended to describe the many kinds of devices which do not have all of the attributes of \u201creal\u201d guns but which have similar characteristics and dangers. Such \u201cfirearms\u201d can best, and perhaps only, be described in terms of their operation. But \u201chand gun,\u201d \u201crifle,\u201d \u201cshotgun\u201d and \u201cmachine gun\u201d are all specifically defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-1 in terms of their design, not their operability. We find no reason to supplement any of those statutory definitions with the descriptive language which brings another kind of \u201cgun, device or instrument\u201d within the statutory definition of \u201cfirearm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">Defendant urges that, even if the handgun is a \u201cfirearm,\u201d he neither used nor possessed it within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c or ALAS'.A 2C:44-3d. The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>It is undisputed that the principal \u201cused or was in possession of\u201d a handgun, within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c, in the course of committing a robbery. <em>Cf. State v. Stewart, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>596 (1984) (slip op. at 2) (determining what constitutes a principal\u2019s \u201cpossession\u201d under that section). And defendant does not challenge the jury\u2019s finding that he was guilty as an accomplice to that armed robbery. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C: 15-lb. The question presented here is whether defendant\u2019s role as an accomplice subjects him to the same mandatory penalties as a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Although the co-felon held the gun and took the victim\u2019s wallet, defendant is \u201clegally accountable\u201d for the conduct of his co-participant <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6b) because he aided in planning or committing the armed robbery \u201c[wjith the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission\u201d of the offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-6c(l)(b). Since defendant is thus legally accountable for both the robbery and the use of the firearm, we perceive no reason why he should not be equally subject to the mandatory sentences of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3d.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Those sentences are designed \u201cat the very least, to ensure incarceration for those who arm themselves before going forth to commit crimes.\u201d <em>State v. Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>62, 68 (1983). The possession of firearms \u201cpresents definable dangers\u201d and the mandatory sentences seek to end \u201cthe mere presence of guns at the scene of crimes ____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70. Where accomplices undertake to commit an offense with a firearm, it is surely irrelevant who has physical possession of the weapon. Each is responsible for the danger, each is legally accountable for the offense and each is properly subject to the same penalty. To conclude otherwise would be to subvert the legislative design and to permit penal consequences to turn on mere fortuities.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\"> We therefore hold that (1) neither a hand gun <em>(N.J. S.A. </em>2C:39-lk), nor a rifle <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lm), nor a shotgun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-ln) nor a machine gun <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-li) need be operable for that weapon to qualify as a firearm within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:39-lf; (2) where an unarmed accomplice is legally accountable for the use or possession of a firearm in committing any offense enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6c, he \u201cused\u201d or \u201cwas in possession\u201d of the firearm within the meaning of that provision; and (3) where an unarmed accomplice was held legally accountable for the use or possession of a firearm in committing any offense enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3d, he \u201cused\u201d or \u201cpossessed\u201d the firearm within the meaning of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The judgment of conviction and order of commitment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
