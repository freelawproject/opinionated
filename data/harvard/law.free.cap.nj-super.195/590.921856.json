Plaintiff\u2019s complaint asserted claims for defamation, invasion of privacy, and assault. The case was tried as if it included a count for false imprisonment, and that claim was also dismissed. This appeal followed, and we now reverse the dismissal of the defamation count but affirm the dismissal of the other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">Plaintiff, a long time resident of Montclair, testified that she regularly shopped at an Acme supermarket in Clifton. The store was operated by defendant Acme Markets, Inc. On September 3,1981 plaintiff went there to buy two gallon bottles of spring water on sale. She was accompanied by her friend Ivy Cruickshank. Plaintiff asked Ivy to get the water while she waited in the car and she gave Ivy $1.10 for the purchase. Ivy came back and said she did not see any bottles of water in the store. Plaintiff and Ivy then returned to the store to look for the water. When they arrived at the location where the bottled water was kept they found none there. They left the store, without making any purchase, by walking through the aisle of a closed check-out booth. Plaintiff was carrying a pocketbook at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">Testimony of defendant John Heavey given in depositions was introduced by plaintiff. Heavey was the grocery manager and was in charge of the store on September 3, 1981. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ing to Heavey\u2019s testimony, a cashier reported to him that a woman had pushed aside a candy rack, passed a register, and walked out of the store. Heavey asked if the cashier had seen the woman take anything and he replied that he did not, but that she was carrying a large bag. Heavey said there was nothing they could do, but he asked to be notified if the woman returned. Shortly thereafter the cashier told Heavey that the woman returned and that another woman was with her on the far side of the store in aisle #1. Heavey walked toward the aisle and saw plaintiff and Ivy coming out of the aisle. He observed them walk \u201cthrough the check-outs and outside the store.\u201d Heavey followed them. Ivy entered a car and plaintiff was getting into the driver\u2019s seat when Heavey confronted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Ivy and plaintiff testified that there were people in the parking area when Heavey approached plaintiff. According to Ivy, Heavey said to plaintiff, \u201cOpen your pocketbook, open your pocketbook, I saw you take it.\u201d Plaintiff testified that Heavey said, \u201cI saw you; I saw you take it off the shelf.\u201d She said he was screaming at her and she heard someone in the crowd say, \u201cShe stole something from the store.\u201d Although she first said Heavey \u201csnatched\u201d her pocketbook from her, when confronted with her prior testimony in depositions when she had testified that she gave her pocketbook to him, she said on cross-examination, \u201cI gave it to him but he snatched it.\u201d She testified further, \u201cI handed the bag to him and he snatched it out of my hands. So I gave it to him. I didn\u2019t wrestle for it.\u201d She also testified that Heavey never touched her.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In his deposition Heavey testified that he did not see the two women take anything from the store, nor did the cashier report that they had done so. He testified that he approached plaintiff and asked her if he \u201cmight look inside her pocketbook.\u201d He testified that he thought something may have been taken and he felt that he could ask plaintiff if she would open her pocketbook so that he could look into it. He denied accusing or indicating to plaintiff that he thought that she had taken anything, but he was looking for merchandise that may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>been taken from the store. Heavey found no merchandise in the purse and returned it to plaintiff. He made a note of the license plate on plaintiffs car and then returned to the store. According to plaintiff, Heavey was wearing an Acme uniform at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Plaintiff then went back into the store to speak with Heavey. She said that she asked him to show her what she had taken from the store and he said in a nasty way, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She said she asked for his name and the manager\u2019s name but he refused to give her that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Plaintiff claimed that she was slandered by Heavey in that he had, in effect, called her a thief in the presence of other people. She said she felt humiliated and hurt. However, no special damages were proved. The trial judge ruled that an imputation of shoplifting does not constitute slander <em>per se </em>because shoplifting is a disorderly persons offense and not an indictable crime. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-11(c); <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-4(a) and (b). Therefore, he ruled that without special damages plaintiff had not proved an actionable claim for defamation. Reliance was placed on <em>Sokolay v. Edlin, </em>65 <em>N.J.Super. </em>112, 121, (App.Div.1961), in which the court said: \u201cOne who falsely, and without privilege to do so, publishes a slander which imputes to another conduct constituting a criminal offense is liable to the other, without proving special damages, if the offense charged is of a type which ... would be chargeable by indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\"> In our view a charge of theft can be slanderous <em>per se </em>whether or not the specific nature of the theft is designated an indictable crime or a lesser offense. Defamation is insult to someone\u2019s reputation and good name caused by uttering words which tend to hold plaintiff up to contempt, hatred, ridicule, aversion or disgrace. <em>Prosser, Torts </em>(4 ed.1971), \u00a7 111 at 737-739. Because of the reluctance to accept the action of slander, the rule developed that the action would not lie without proof of special damages. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 112 at 754. However, excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>tions were created to allow the claim if the \u201cwords clearly \u2018sound to the disreputation\u2019 of the plaintiff,\u201d making them \u201cdefamatory on their face and actionable <em>per se.\u201d Shaw v. Bender, </em>90 <em>N.J.L. </em>147, 149 (E. &amp; A. 1917). When words are uttered which are so injurious that the court will \u201cpresume, without proof, that plaintiff\u2019s reputation has been thereby impaired,\u201d the words are defamatory <em>per se. Ibid. </em>In this category are indictable offenses, such as larceny. <em>Ibid. </em>Other categories are the imputation of a loathesome disease, misconduct affecting one\u2019s business, trade, profession, office or calling, and, in some jurisdictions, serious sexual misconduct. <em>Prosser, Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 111 at 754; 3 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 520 at 186 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">For the purposes of the rule a distinction was once made between indictable crimes and lesser offenses. In its original form, \u00a7 571 of the <em>Restatement of Torts </em>required that the crime be \u201cchargeable by indictment or its modern equivalent\u201d as well as punishable by death or imprisonment otherwise than in lieu of fine. 3 <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>\u00a7 571 at 171 (1938). The present version of Section 571 defines the criminal offense as one that is \u201c(a) punishable by imprisonment in a state or federal institution\u201d <em>or </em>\u201c(b) regarded by public opinion as involving moral turpitude.\u201d 3 <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 571 at 186 (1977). The offense charged must be \u201ccriminal in character,\u201d and need not be of a type that is subject to indictment if it meets either of these tests. <em>Id. </em>at 187-188. The <em>Restatment </em>includes as examples of offenses <em>of </em>moral turpitude \u201cletting a house for purposes of prostitution ... or uttering a bad check\u201d which are not subject to indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 188, 190. Other charges that the <em>Restatement </em>deems actionable <em>per se </em>because they are offenses of moral turpitude include larceny, malicious mischief and indecent exposure. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">A number of cases in New Jersey have treated a charge of larceny as slander <em>per se </em>without regard to the value of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>property stolen. <em>Shaw v. Bender, supra, </em>held that \u201cto call one a thief\u201d is actionable because larceny, an indictable offense, is clearly imputed. 90 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 149. The goods stolen in that case were apparently of little value. Similarly, in <em>Jorgensen v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., </em>25 N.J. 541, 563-564 (1958), the accusation that plaintiff, an employee, had stolen company property, a quantity of ham wrapped in a napkin, was held to be defamatory <em>per se. </em>In <em>Murphy v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>45 <em>N.J. Super </em>478, 488 (App.Div.), certif. den. 25 <em>N.J. </em>55 (1957), a charge that an employee had stolen three wire brushes and 18 sheets of emery cloth was deemed actionable <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Under Title 2A, the crime of theft was a misdemeanor or high misdemeanor until 1972 when the theft of property valued at less than $200 was made a disorderly persons offense. <em>N.J. S.A. </em>2A:119-2; <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:170-30.1, both repealed; <em>see State v. King, </em>164 <em>N.J. Super </em>330 (App.Div.1978), <em>certif. den. </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>54 (1979). Thus, when <em>Shaw, Jorgensen </em>and <em>Murphy </em>were decided the theft of property was a crime regardless of its value. Under Title 2C, thefts of goods worth $200 or more are crimes, but the theft of goods worth less than $200 is a disorderly persons offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2(b). \u201cShoplifting\u201d was a disorderly persons offense under Title 2A, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:170-98, and still is. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-ll(e). For a definition of shoplifting see Annot., \u201cDefamation: Actionability of Accusation or Imputation of Shoplifting,\u201d 29 <em>A.L.R. </em>3d 961, 963, n. 6 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">For the purposes of the law of defamation, distinctions between the terms larceny, theft and shoplifting, whether crimes or lesser offenses, are not significant in our opinion. The Code of Criminal Justice applies the term theft to various unlawful takings of property. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-2; <em>State v. Talley, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>385, 390-393 (1983). For the law of defamation it should make little difference if a person\u2019s reputation is ruined by an unwarranted charge of theft of goods worth more or less than $200 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>of taking merchandise from a store without paying for it. Clearly the accusation of theft involves a criminal offense of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Thus, we hold that the false, unprivileged imputation of theft or larceny is slanderous <em>per se, </em>whether the offense is indictable or not. This is consistent with the current <em>Restatement </em>position and the rule in some states that the imputation of an offense of moral turpitude which subjects a person to punishment and \u201cbrings disgrace upon the party falsely accused\u201d is actionable <em>per se. Kelly v. Flaherty, </em>16 <em>R.I. </em>234, 14 <em>A. </em>876 (Sup.Ct.1888), quoting from <em>Miller v. Parish, </em>25 <em>Mass. </em>384 (Sup.Jud.Ct.1829); see <em>Powers v. Carvalho, </em>117 <em>R.I. </em>519, 368 A.2d 1242 (Sup.Ct.1977); <em>cf. Edwards v. Ideal Food Stores, </em>499 <em>S.</em>W.2d 343 (Ct.Civ.App.Tex.1973); <em>Wilkerson v. Carlo, </em>101 <em>Mich.App. </em>629, 300 <em>N</em>.W.2d 658 (Ct.App.1980); <em>Zayre of Virginia, Inc. v. Gowdy, </em>207 <em>Va. </em>47, 147 S.E.2d 710 (Sup.Ct. of App.1966); <em>Prosser, supra, </em>\u00a7 112 at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The other points raised on appeal concern the dismissal of plaintiffs claim for damages based on invasion of privacy, assault, and false imprisonment. The trial judge found that plaintiff had consented to the search of her pocketbook which negated the invasion of privacy claim. On the evidence presented, the trial judge properly dismissed this claim. <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b); <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 5 (1969). We reach the same conclusion with respect to the claims for assault and for false imprisonment. There was no proof of an assault, nor of an unlawful detention by force or threats. <em>See Earl v. Winne, </em>14 <em>N.J. </em>119, 128 (1953); <em>Cannon v. Krakowitch, </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>93, 98 (App.Div.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">We affirm the judgment in part and reverse in part. The case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial on the defamation count only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
