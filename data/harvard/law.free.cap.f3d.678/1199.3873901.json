The district court found that the Tribe was not a \u201cprevailing party\u201d because, although the district court had ruled in its favor, the decision was overturned on appeal. After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-4\">The complex history of this case is set out in <em>Friends of Everglades v. South Florida Water Management District, </em>570 F.3d 1210, 1213-15 (11th Cir.2009). In short, the Friends of the Everglades and Fishermen Against the Destruction of the Environment filed suit against the South Florida Water Management District (the Water District) under the Clean Water Act to enjoin the Water District from pumping polluted canal water into Lake Okeechobee. The Tribe joined the suit on the plaintiffs\u2019 side. After a two-month bench trial, the district court found in favor of the plaintiffs and issued an injunction to the executive director of the Water District, requiring him to apply for a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, this court reversed and remanded in relevant part, deferring to a recently-enacted EPA regulation that confirmed the permit was not required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1241-5\">While the case was pending on appeal, the Tribe filed a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs totaling over $1.4 million. The Tribe asserted that it was the prevailing party and thus was entitled to fees under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(d). After this court reversed the district court\u2019s order on the injunction, the district court denied the motion for fees and costs, concluding that the Tribe was not the prevailing party and that equity did not call for the Tribe to obtain fees. This is the Tribe\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-6\">The Tribe argues that it was entitled to fees as the \u201cprevailing party\u201d because it achieved some form of relief, namely an injunction and the promulgation of the EPA\u2019s new rules. The Tribe further argues that equity required the court grant the motion for fees, as the Tribe had no control over the promulgation of the new rules and the court should consider the Water District\u2019s influence on the EPA to enact the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-8\">We review the denial of a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for abuse of discretion. <em>Sahyers v. Prugh, Holliday &amp; Karatinos, P.L., </em>560 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2009). We will find an abuse of discretion only when a decision is in clear error, the district court applied an incorrect legal standard or followed improper procedures, or when neither the district court\u2019s decision nor the record provide sufficient explanation to enable meaningful appellate review. <em>Peer v. Lewis, </em>606 F.3d 1306, 1311 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Cox Enters., Inc. v. News-Journal Corp., </em>510 F.3d 1350, 1360 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1241-9\">Generally, parties pay their own fees and costs in connection with bringing a law suit unless some statutory fee-shifting provision permits the court to award fees to a \u201cprevailing party.\u201d <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 247, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); <em>Loggerhead Turtle v. Cnty. Council of Volusia Cnty., Fla., </em>307 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2002). Absent a contrary legislative directive, a \u201cprevailing party\u201d is one who prevails on \u201cany significant issue\u201d and thereby achieves some of the benefits sought by bringing suit. <em>Tex. State Teachers Ass\u2019n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>489 U.S. 782, 791-92, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989). Here, the Clean Water Act specifically allows the court to award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to \u201cany prevailing or substantially prevailing party, whenever the court determines that such award is appropriate.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(d). A prevailing or substantially prevailing party is one who prevailed \u201cin what the lawsuit originally sought to accomplish.\u201d <em>Hughey v. JMS Dev. Corp., </em>78 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>F.3d 1523, 1532 (11th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). In other words, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in a Clean Water Act suit is appropriate when the moving party has advanced the goals of the Act. <em>Chemical Mfrs. Ass\u2019n v. United States Envtl. Prot. Agency, </em>885 F.2d 1276, 1279 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-4\">In addition to the \u201cprevailing party\u201d requirement, the district court must determine that the award is \u201cappropriate.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(d); <em>Loggerhead Turtle, </em>307 F.3d at 1323 (citing <em>Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, </em>463 U.S. 680, 103 S.Ct. 3274, 77 L.Ed.2d 938 (1983)). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cthe term \u2018appropriate\u2019 modifies but does not completely reject the traditional rule that a fee claimant must \u2018prevail\u2019 before it may recover attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>463 U.S. at 686, 103 S.Ct. 3274. Thus, \u201cabsent some degree of success on the merits by the claimant, it is not \u2018appropriate\u2019 for a federal court to award attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 103 S.Ct. 3274; <em>see also id. </em>at 688 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 3274 (\u201c[TJrivial success on the merits, or purely procedural victories, would [not] justify an award of fees under statutes setting out the \u201cwhen appropriate\u2019 [sic] standard.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, \u201cthere is unambiguous evidence that Congress intended the \u2018whenever ... appropriate\u2019 fee provisions of the ... Clean Water Act to allow fee awards to plaintiffs who do not obtain court-ordered relief but whose suit has a positive catalytic effect.\u201d <em>Loggerhead Turtle, </em>307 F.3d at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-5\">The crux of the Tribe\u2019s argument on appeal is that it substantially prevailed because its lawsuit was the catalyst that prompted the EPA to enact the new rules, even though those rules were contrary to the Tribe\u2019s position. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-9\">The Tribe did not prevail, or substantially prevail, in its suit. It did not obtain an injunction or a declaratory judgment entered in its favor; nor was there a settlement or consent decree. <em>See Hewitt v. Helms, </em>482 U.S. 755, 760, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987) (discussing \u201cprevailing party\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and concluding that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party because he did not obtain any relief on the merits of his claim); <em>see also Falanga v. State Bar of Ga., </em>150 F.3d 1333, 1347 (11th Cir.1998) (reversing award of attorneys\u2019 fees because once the court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s judgment, the plaintiffs were no longer the prevailing party). Indeed, the result the Tribe sought\u2014an injunction requiring the Water District to obtain a permit\u2014is exactly what the Tribe did not receive. All that can be said of the Tribe\u2019s action is that it led the EPA to promulgate rules contrary to the Tribe\u2019s position. We do not think this renders the Tribe a \u201csubstantially prevailing\u201d party; nor is this is what was intended by the idea that a law suit has a positive catalytic effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1242-10\">The inclusion of the term \u201cwhenever ... appropriate\u201d supports our conclusion here. Although Congress intended to permit courts to award fees \u201cto plaintiffs who do not obtain court-ordered relief but whose suit has a positive catalytic effect,\u201d it did not intend for this provision to extend to unsuccessful parties. <em>See Loggerhead Turtle, </em>307 F.3d at 1326 (citing <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>463 U.S. at 686 n. 8, 103 S.Ct. 3274). Essentially, the Tribe, as the losing party, seeks to obtain fees and costs from the winning party. We cannot conclude that Congress intended such a result. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number><em>Ruckelshaus, </em>463 U.S. at 684, 103 S.Ct. 3274.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-5\">We also disagree with the Tribe that equity demands it receive fees and costs. The Tribe bases its equity argument on its belief that the Water District influenced the EPA to enact a new rule contrary to the Tribe\u2019s position. The Tribe cites no law in support of its claim on fees in this regard. Given the level of deference in our review, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1243-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1242-6\">. <em>Ruckelshaus </em>was a Clean Air Act case, but the Court explained that its holding applied to the use of \"appropriate\u201d in all statutes containing the \"whenever ... appropriate\u201d standard. <em>Ruckelshaus, </em>463 U.S. at 682 n. 1, 103 S.Ct. 3274. Because the Clean Water Act uses this term, we apply <em>Ruckelshaus </em>here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
