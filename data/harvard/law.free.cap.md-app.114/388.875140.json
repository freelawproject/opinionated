With certain exceptions, section 10-703(a) provides taxpayers with a credit against Maryland income tax \u201cfor tax on income paid to another state.\u201d The amount of this credit is determined under section 10 \u2014 703(c)(1). This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">[T]he credit allowed a resident under subsection (a) of this section is the lesser of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">(i) the amount of allowable tax on income that the resident paid to another state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">(ii) an amount that does not reduce the State income tax to an amount less than would be payable if the income subjected to tax in the other state were disregarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">Md.Code (1988, 1996 Supp.), \u00a7 10-703(c)(l) of the Tax-General Article (TG).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Mr. and Mrs. Robert Hickey, appellees, are residents of Maryland. During the relevant tax years, 1988 to 1990, Mr. Hickey was a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of a law firm that maintained offices in both New York and Washington. Although Mr. Hickey worked exclusively in Washington, some of his income was deemed taxable by the State of New York.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellees filed nonresident New York State income tax returns for the years 1988 to 1990 and paid New York income tax. Pursuant to section 10-703(c)(l)(i) of the Tax-General Article, appellees claimed a credit on their Maryland Tax returns for the years 1988 to 1990 that was equal to the amount of income tax paid to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">The Comptroller of the Treasury (the Comptroller), appellant, reduced appellees\u2019 credits for the relevant tax years. The Comptroller asserted that a credit could not be claimed for the entire amount of income tax paid to New York and reduced appellees\u2019 credits by applying section 10-703(c)(l)(ii) of the Tax-General Article, as interpreted by the Comptroller. This reduction in the tax credits for the tax years 1988 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>through 1990 caused a reduction in appellees\u2019 tax refunds for those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Appellees, asserting that the Comptroller improperly applied section 10-703(c)(l)(ii) of the Tax-General Article and that the Comptroller improperly denied their refund claims, filed a Petition of Appeal in the Maryland Tax Court. In ruling in favor of the Comptroller, the Tax Court interpreted section 10 \u2014 703(c)(1) so that \u201cthe amount of tax due the State of Maryland cannot be reduced below a number that would be payable to the State of Maryland if the income from the other state had not been received by the taxpayer at all.\u201d Appellees thereafter appealed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, which reversed the Tax Court\u2019s decision. In reversing the Tax Court, the circuit court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">The objective of income tax credit provisions is to avoid double taxation by providing for a credit against the Maryland income tax liability to the extent that income taxed by Maryland is also taxed in another jurisdiction. Section 10-703 of the Tax-General Article achieves this objective by focusing on the income tax subjected to tax by another state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">[Appellees] argue that Section 10 \u2014 703(c)[ (1) J (i) applies to the case <em>sub judice </em>and that the Comptroller\u2019s interpretation of the statute, therefore, violates the plain meaning of the language of the statute; whereas, the Comptroller claims that Section 10-703(c)[ (1) ] (ii) applies because New York State\u2019s method of taxing non-resident income does in fact lower the Maryland income tax which would be payable if the income subject to New York State income tax was disregarded. This Court finds that the Comptroller\u2019s and the Tax Court\u2019s reading of the statute is in stark contrast with public policy and Maryland law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">The purpose of section 10-703 is to avoid double taxation. If the Tax Court\u2019s decision is permitted to stand, [appel-lees\u2019] and all similarly situated taxpayers will be subject, in varying degrees, to double taxation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">The Comptroller presents one question on appeal:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Did the Circuit Court err when it allowed New York\u2019s distinctive method of tax calculation to effectively repeal the Maryland statutory limitation on credit for income taxes paid to another state?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We answer this question in the affirmative and shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The controversy in the case <em>sub judice </em>involves the application of section 10 \u2014 703(c)(1) (particularly subsection (c)(l)(ii)) of the Tax-General Article, which provides for the amount of credit that a taxpayer may take for income tax paid to another state. The credit is equal to the lesser of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">(i) the amount of allowable tax on income that the resident <em>paid </em>to another state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">(ii) an amount that does not reduce the State income tax to an amount less than would be payable if <em>the income subjected to tax in the other state </em>were disregarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">TG \u00a7 10-703(c)(l)(emphasis added). Appellees argue that the application of this section to their factual situation permits them to take a credit pursuant to section 10-703(c)(l)(i). They aver this is so because of the method by which New York taxes nonresidents. New York determines a nonresident taxpayer\u2019s tax rate, and therefore his or her tax liability, referred to in New York as a taxpayer\u2019s \u201ctax base,\u201d based upon all of a nonresident taxpayer\u2019s income, including that actually taxable in New York and all other income as well. The tax liability, tax base, is then reduced by multiplying the tax liability by a percentage equal to the income earned in New York divided by the taxpayer\u2019s total income. Appellees argue that under New York\u2019s tax laws, all of their income was \u201csubject to tax\u201d in New York.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They further argue that the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>section 10-703(c)(l)(ii) results in an amount which is greater than the amount obtained by application of section 10-703(c)(l)(i). Appellees thus assert that they correctly claimed a credit pursuant to section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(i) for the entire amount of income taxes paid to New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The Comptroller disagrees with appellees\u2019 application of section 10-703(c)(l)(ii). The Comptroller asserts that, although New York determines a nonresident taxpayer\u2019s income tax rate and income tax liability (tax base) based upon all of his or her income, the income tax liability (tax base) is then reduced by multiplying the tax liability (tax base) by a percentage, which is obtained by dividing the income allocable to New York by the taxpayer\u2019s total income. Therefore, the Comptroller asserts, all of a taxpayer\u2019s income is not \u201csubject to tax\u201d in New York and this percentage should be multiplied by the amount appellees claimed was \u201csubject to tax\u201d in New York. The Comptroller\u2019s application of section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(ii) results in a lesser credit than that claimed by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">APPLICATION AND PURPOSE OF SECTION 10-703(c)(l)</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Section 10~703(c)(l) of the Tax-General Article provides the amount of credit a taxpayer may take if that taxpayer paid income tax to another state. The credit is limited to the lesser of the amount of income tax paid to the other state or \u201can amount that does not reduce the State income tax to an amount less than would be payable if the income subjected to tax in the other state were disregarded.\u201d TG \u00a7 10-703(c)(l)(i)-(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The amount of income tax paid to another state is generally obtained by multiplying the income allocable to the other state by the appropriate income tax rate. There are states, however, such as New York, that impose an income tax rate on nonresidents based on all income and then reduce that tax liability (tax base) by multiplying the tax liability by a percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The following example illustrates the application of section 10-703(c)(l)(i) in states that calculate a taxpayer\u2019s income tax according to the income allocable to that state, i.e.., non New York-type tax structures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-5\"><em>Example </em>1 \u2014 TP earned $100,000; of this, $60,000 was earned in Maryland, and $40,000 was earned in State X. State X taxes the income earned in that state at 10%. TP would pay $4,000 ($40,000 * .10) of tax to State X, and this would be the tax credit TP would be permitted to take under section 10-703(c)(l)(i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Calculating the tax credit under section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(ii) is slightly more complicated. The credit under this section is equal to \u201can amount that does not reduce the State income tax to an amount less than would be payable if the income subjected to tax in the other state were disregarded.\u201d TG \u00a7 10-703(c)(l)(ii). The language of this section indicates that the credit is equal to the Maryland State income tax payable less the Maryland State income tax that would be payable if the income \u201csubject to tax\u201d in the other state were disregarded. The example below illustrates the application of section 10-703(c)(l)(ii):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\"><em>Example </em>2 \u2014 TP earned $100,000; of this, $60,000 was earned in Maryland, and $40,000 was earned in State X. State X taxes the income earned in that state at 10%. Maryland also taxes its income at 10%. Under section 10-703(c)(l)(ii), TP would be permitted to take a credit of $4,000 (($100,000 * .10) \u2014 (($100,000\u2014$40,000) * .10)). Pursuant to section 10-703(c)(l)(i), the credit would be the same, $4,000 ($40,000 * .10). A Maryland taxpayer would therefore pay a Maryland income tax of $6,000 (($100,000 * .10) \u2014 $4,000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">As can be seen from the above examples, the credit is the same under both subsections (c)(l)(i) and (c)(l)(ii) of section 10-703 when the tax rate in the two states is the same. Additionally, the examples illustrate one of the purposes of section 10-703(c)(l): to avoid double taxation of income. <em>See Roach v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>327 Md. 438, 449, 610 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>A.2d 754 (1992) (\u201cThe obvious purpose of the credit granted by \u00a7 10-703 of the Tax-General Article is to avoid double taxation on the same income.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Another purpose of section 10-703(c)(l) is to ensure that Maryland collects the same amount of income tax, even though another state may impose a higher tax rate on the income allocable to that state. The example below illustrates this purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\"><em>Example </em>3 \u2014 TP earned $100,000; of this, $60,000 was earned in Maryland, and $40,000 was earned in State X. State X taxes income earned in that state at 15%. Maryland taxes income at 10%. Under section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(i), TP would pay $6,000 ($40,000 * .15) in taxes to State X. Under section 10-703(c)(l)(ii), TP\u2019s credit would be equal to $4,000 (($100,000 * .10) \u2014 (($100,000\u2014$40,000) * .10)). Therefore, TP\u2019s credit would be limited to $4,000. TP would have to pay $6,000 (($100,000 * .10) \u2014 $4,000) in taxes to Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akj\">As this example, when compared with Example 2, illustrates, Maryland receives the same amount of income tax ($6,000) even though the other state taxes income allocable to that state at a rate higher than the Maryland rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">THE PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">The disagreement in this case revolves around the application of section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(ii) to states, such as New York, that determine a taxpayer\u2019s tax rate and tax liability (tax base) based upon all of his or her income, regardless of where that income was earned. That tax liability (tax base) is then reduced by multiplying it by a percentage.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">The Court of Appeals of New York described its tax laws relative to nonresident taxpayers in <em>Brady v. State, </em>80 N.Y.2d 596, 592 N.Y.S.2d 955, 607 N.E.2d 1060, 1061-62 (1992):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkU\">Under Tax Law \u00a7 601(e)(1), the tax of a nonresident is first calculated \u201cas if [the taxpayer] were a resident.\u201d Thus, the nonresident\u2019s tax base ... is determined by applying the appropriate graduated rate in Tax Law \u00a7 601(a) through (c) to the taxpayer\u2019s total income from all sources (less any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>statutory deductions, exemptions or credits). The taxpayer\u2019s total income is derived from \u201cNew York adjusted gross income\u201d, which is determined by reference to the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cfederal adjusted gross income\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">Residents pay their entire tax base. For nonresidents, however, the amount is reduced by the percentage of income earned in New York compared to total income. Therefore, while residents and nonresidents with the same total income are taxed at the same rate, the nonresident pays tax only on the percentage of income attributable to New York. [Brackets in original; citations omitted; footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Appellees argue that, in such states, all of a taxpayer\u2019s income is \u201csubject to tax.\u201d Therefore, the application of section 10-703(c)(l)(ii) yields a larger credit than does section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(i). The example below illustrates appellees\u2019 contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\"><em>Example </em>J+ \u2014 TP earned $100,000; of this, $60,000 was earned due to activities in Maryland, and $40,000 was earned due to activities in New York. Maryland imposes a tax rate of 10%, while New York imposes a tax rate of 15%. The tax payable in New York would be $6,000 (($100,000 * .15) * ($40,000 / $100,000)). This would also be the amount of TP\u2019s credit under section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(i). The amount of the credit under section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(ii) would be $10,000 (($100,000 * .10) \u2014 (($100,000\u2014$100,000) * .10)). The amount of the credit under section 10-703(c)(l)(i) is less, and therefore, TP would be able to take a credit for all the income tax paid to New York and pay $4,000 (($100,000 * .10) \u2014 $6,000) of tax to Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The Comptroller disagrees with appellees\u2019 application of section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(ii). The Comptroller argues that in calculating the credit under section 10-703(c)(l)(ii) of the Tax-General Article, if a taxpayer pays income tax to states such as New York (where all of a taxpayer\u2019s income is used to calculate his or her tax rate and tax liability (tax base)), the percentage used to reduce the tax liability (tax base) should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>used to reduce the net income, which includes all income, in the other state. The following example illustrates the Comptroller\u2019s application of section 10-703(c)(l)(ii):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\"><em>Example </em>5 \u2014 TP earned $100,000; of this, $60,000 was earned due to activities in Maryland, and $40,000 was earned due to activities in New York. Maryland imposes a tax rate of 10%, while New York imposes a tax rate of 15%. The tax payable in New York would be $6,000 (($100,000 * .15) * ($40,000 / $100,000)). This would be the amount of TP\u2019s credit under section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(i). The percentage of income attributable to New York would be 40% ($40,000 / $100,000). The income subject to tax in New York would therefore be $40,000 ($100,000 * .40). The amount of the credit under section 10-703(c)(l)(ii) would be $4,000 (($100,-000 * .10) \u2014 (($100,000-\u2014$40,000) * .10)). The amount of the credit under section 10-703(c)(l)(ii) is less, and therefore, TP would pay $6,000 (($100,000 * .10) \u2014 $4,000) of income tax to Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">RESOLUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">The Court of Appeals recently addressed whether the District of Columbia\u2019s tax on unincorporated businesses was a \u201ctax on income\u201d so that a taxpayer could claim a credit pursuant to section 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article in <em>Roach, supra. </em>In the resolution of that case, it was necessary for the Court to determine whether the District of Columbia tax was an \u201cincome tax\u201d or a \u201cfranchise tax.\u201d The <em>Roach </em>Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">[W]e take that characterization [of the tax] from the interpretation of the statute by the highest court of the District of Columbia. While the nature of another jurisdiction\u2019s statute for purposes of Maryland law is for this Court to decide, nevertheless, to the extent that we rely on the other jurisdiction\u2019s characterization of its statute in deciding that issue of Maryland law, we take the statute with whatever interpretive gloss has been placed upon it by the highest court of the other jurisdiction. This principle was set forth long ago by Chief Justice Marshall for the Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>in <em>Elmendorf v. Taylor, </em>10 Wheat. 152, 159-160 [6 L.Ed. 289] (1825)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">327 Md. at 444-45, 610 A.2d 754 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The Court of Appeals of New York, New York\u2019s highest court, addressed the state\u2019s income tax on nonresident taxpayers in <em>Brady supra. </em>In that case, the plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of New York\u2019s method of determining the income tax on nonresidents. As relevant to this case, the plaintiffs alleged that the New York tax provisions \u201cviolate due process because presumably higher taxes arising from higher tax rates demonstrate that New York is in effect impermissibly taxing out-of-State income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>592 N.Y.S.2d at 957, 607 N.E.2d at 1062. In discussing New York\u2019s tax structure, the court stated: \u201c[WJhile residents and nonresidents with the same total income are taxed at the same rate, <em>the nonresident pays tax only on the percentage of income attributable to New York.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The New York court framed the plaintiffs\u2019 due process challenge as the following question: \u201c[I]n these circumstances, is out-of-State income being impermissibly taxed?\u201d <em>Id. </em>592 N.Y.S.2d at 957, 607 N.E.2d at 1063. It answered the question in the negative and held that \u201cthe subject matter here regulated is a tax on in-State income, which is within the jurisdiction of the State.\u201d Id. 592 N.Y.S.2d at 959, 607 N.E.2d at 1064. After addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional challenge based on the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 real quarrel, in the end, is with the graduated tax. A system of progressive taxation apportions the tax burden based on ability to pay \u2014 higher income taxpayers can pay more and are therefore taxed at a higher rate than lower income taxpayers. This system does not implicate the State or Federal Constitution so long as the rates are applied, as here, in a nondiscriminatory manner and <em>only to taxable New York income.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-8\"><em>Brady, </em>592 N.Y.S.2d at 960, 607 N.E.2d at 1065. (emphasis added). Other states that tax nonresident taxpayers in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>manner similar to New York are in accord with the holding of the <em>Brady </em>court that the tax structure does not tax out-of-state income. <em>See Stevens v. State Tax Assessor, </em>571 A.2d 1195, 1197 (Me.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 819, 111 S.Ct. 65, 112 L.Ed.2d 40 (1990); <em>Wheeler v. State, </em>127 Vt. 361, 249 A.2d 887, 890 (Vt.), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 4, 90 S.Ct. 24, 24 L.Ed.2d 4 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The decision of the Court of Appeals of New York clearly demonstrates that New York does not tax out-of-state income. New York only taxes income allocable to New York. As indicated by the Court of Appeals of New York, the out-of-state income is included in a nonresident\u2019s New York tax return in order to determine the proper tax rate. It, in effect, then uses that rate to tax only New York income. New York does not tax income derived from non-New York activities. Therefore, appellees\u2019 contention that New York \u201csubjects to tax\u201d all of a nonresident taxpayers\u2019 income is erroneous. The income \u201csubject to tax\u201d in New York is determined, as argued by the Comptroller, by multiplying the New York taxable income, as derived from the New York tax return, by the percentage used to reduce the New York tax liability (tax base).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Examining the nature and purpose of section 10-703(c)(1) of the Tax-General Article, we also conclude that all of appellees\u2019 income was not \u201csubject to tax\u201d in New York. We recently stated the rules of statutory construction in <em>Lombardi v. Montgomery County, </em>108 Md.App. 695, 702-03, 673 A.2d 762 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-7\">In undertaking an analysis of this section, we must first set forth the principles that guide our interpretation of a statute.

Comptroller of Treasury, </em>265 Md. 3, 6, 288 A.2d 187 (1972),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The cases hold that we should shun a construction of a statute which will lead to absurd consequences. It is a hornbook rule of statutory construction that in ascertaining the intention of the General Assembly all parts of a statute are to be read together to find the intention as to any one part, and that all parts are to be reconciled and harmonized if possible. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In construing section 10 \u2014 703(c)(1), we must reconcile and harmonize both subsections so as to effectuate the plain language of the statute and the statute\u2019s purpose. As we indicated above, the language of section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(ii) indicates that its purpose is to require that Maryland receive, at a minimum, the income tax due on income attributable to Maryland regardless of another State\u2019s method or rate of taxation. The Comptroller\u2019s interpretation of section 10 \u2014 703(c)(1) leads to a result that is consistent with the purposes of the statute; it prevents the double taxation of Maryland income and permits Maryland to receive income tax on income attributable to Maryland. To hold as appellees suggest would permit them to pay less tax in Maryland in reliance on New York\u2019s artifice of first establishing the tax rate based on all income, in order to establish a higher rate, thus enabling New York to tax its income at a higher rate than it would otherwise be able to if the New York income alone was considered in establishing the rate. Stated differently, it combines the Maryland income with the New York income only temporarily and for the sole purpose of \u201cjacking up\u201d the rate. Once it has taken that taxpayer unfriendly step, it then determines a taxpayer\u2019s tax liability (tax base) and reduces the tax liability (tax base) so that it only taxes New York income. New York never taxes Maryland income.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">We also note the anomaly in appellees\u2019 interpretation of section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l )(ii) when one compares Example 3 with Example 4 above. In Example 3, a taxpayer who earns $100,000 ($60,000 of which is attributable to Maryland) pays $6,000 in taxes to the other state and $6,000 in taxes to Maryland. In Example 4, which illustrates appellees\u2019 application of section 10 \u2014 703(c)(l)(ii), a taxpayer who also earns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>$100,000 ($60,000 of which is attributable to Maryland), pays $6,000 of taxes to New York, but only pays $4,000 of taxes in Maryland. As this example demonstrates, were we to adopt appellees\u2019 approach, a Maryland resident taxpayer with income from a state that directly taxes the income allocable to that state, i.e., a state with a tax structure unlike the New York-type structure, would receive a $4,000 credit, while a Maryland resident taxpayer with New York income, with the same amount of income and subject to the same tax liability, would receive a $6,000 credit. The result would be that the taxpayer who ultimately pays income taxes in New York on that state\u2019s income would pay less income tax to Maryland merely because New York initially uses Maryland income to \u201cjack up\u201d the rate that is applied only to New York income.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The Comptroller\u2019s application of section 10-703(c)(l)(ii) does not lead to such anomaly. If Example 3 is compared with Example 5, one notes that the taxpayer, regardless of the foreign state to which he or she pays income taxes, receives the same credit and pays the same amount of Maryland income tax when the total income is the same, the tax rate is the same, and the percentage of total income allocable to the foreign state is the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Accordingly, we hold that in states where the taxpayer\u2019s tax rate and tax liability (tax base) is computed on all income and the tax liability is thereafter reduced by a percentage, that percentage is used to calculate the income subject to tax by the foreign state under section 10-703(c)(l)(ii). Thus, the Comptroller correctly reduced appellees\u2019 tax credits for the tax years 1988 to 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT IS REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b416-12\">. We shall discuss New York's income tax structure infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-10\">. New York computes a tax, referred to in New York as the \"tax base,\u201d on all income wherever earned, then reduces the tax actually due to reflect New York\u2019s portion of total income. Appellees, in calculating their credit in Maryland, utilized the figure used to compute the New York \"tax base\u201d on the New York State tax return without any reduction to reflect that portion of income not attributable to New York. As we shall discuss later. New York does not tax the portion of income not attributable to New York.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">. In <em>Coerper v.
