The affidavit required by Rule 121 of this court in cases of <em>scire facias </em>on judgment applies as well to a plea of <em>nul tiel record </em>as other pleas.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b17-12\">.2. Where in an action against two or mor\u00e9 a judgment by default is taken, against one, and subsequently the declaration is amended and the case proceeded with against the remaining defendants, the amendment does not operate to set aside the judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b17-13\">.3. Where the defendant was personally served and filed a plea, notwithstanding which a judgment was taken against him as for want of a plea, upon which judgment, after the lapse of nine years, a <em>scire facias </em>to revive is.issued, judgment of revivor should follow unless the defendant files with his plea an affidavit under Rule 121 showing a defense to the action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b17-14\">4. Nor would error, however gross in the rendition of the original judgment, be a defense if it fall short of showing a want of jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action or of the person of the defendant; such a defense should have been made either by appeal from the original'judgment or in some direct proceeding to set it aside.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-15\">At Law.</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"AO\">No. 17,756.</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AX\">Decided March 9, 1891.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-16\">The Chief Justice and Justices James and Montgomery sitting.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-17\">Appeal from judgment on <em>scire facias.

John Miller for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-19\">The pleas of defendant Moore to the writ of <em>scire facias </em>\u25a0are not supported by an affidavit of defens\u00e9 under the 121st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Rule of Practice, and hence the Court did not err in granting judgment in favor of plaintiff on the writ of <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-4\">It was claimed below that error was committed by the court in granting the original judgment, because it was said that there was a variance between the promissory notes sued on and the declaration \u2014 in the words <em>\u201corder of\" </em>in the notes; and not in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-5\">It has been shown that the original judgment against defendant Moore (the maker of the notes), was rendered on the-8th February, 1879. No appeal was taken from that judgment, and no motion made to set aside the judgment, hence-that j udgment <em>became final, </em>and <em>no matter </em>what error (and we deny there was any error) there was in the declaration, or in. granting the original judgment, it having been rendered by a; competent court having jurisdiction of the person and subject-matter, cannot be reviewed upon a <em>scire facias. </em>Qauw <em>vs. </em>Lameraux, 36 Wis., 629; \u00c6tna Life Ins. Co. <em>vs. </em>McCormick, 20 Wis., 283; Pettus <em>vs. </em>McClannahan, 52 Ala., 57; Bank of U. S. <em>vs. </em>Moss, 6 How., 31.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-6\">Again, when a declaration sets out an instrument, and such instrument purports a consideration or shows upon its face that the assumpsit was for a consideration, the judgment will not be arrested because the declaration does not aver a consideration. Kimble <em>vs. </em>Lull, 3 McLean, 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-7\">The plaintiff (appellee) also contends that upon a writ of <em>scire facias </em>to revive a judgment, and plea thereto of <em>\u201c nul tiel' </em>record\u201d (and that is really def\u00e9ndant Moore\u2019s plea to the <em>scirefacias), </em>this court cannot go behind the original record of the-judgment. Henry <em>vs. </em>Brothers, 48 Pa. St., 71; Carr <em>vs. </em>Townsend, 63 Pa. St., 20; U. S. <em>vs. </em>Thompson, Gilpin, 614; Brown <em>vs. </em>Banner, 45 Miss.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-8\">Mr. Leigh Robinson for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b18-9\">This is a judgment by default against a defendant shown by the record to have been in no default whatever; a judgment: for want of a plea, when plainly there was one. It being manifest from an inspection of the record, that there was no-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>jurisdiction to enter such a judgment, and that the express ground of the judgment is contradicted by the record to which it refers, it follows that the alleged judgment is no judgment, but is intrinsically and absolutely void. Meloy <em>vs. </em>Grant, 4 Mackey, 488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-4\">It is erroneous to take judgment by default where a plea of <em>non assumpsit </em>is interposed. Covell <em>vs. </em>Marks, 2 Ill. (I Scam.), 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-5\">This is true even though the plea interposed be itself defective and exceptionable. If defendant, when under an order to plead issuably put in a plea, though informal, which goes to the substance of the action, the plaintiff cannot sign judgment as. for want of a plea. Thellusson <em>vs. </em>Smith, 5 T. R., 152; Mackey <em>vs. </em>Mettler, 1 Iowa, 528; Canal Bank <em>vs. </em>Newbury, 7 Iowa, 4; Levi <em>vs. </em>Monroe, 11 Iowa, 453; Ser <em>vs. </em>Robst, 8 Mo., 507; Dewort <em>vs. </em>Mosser, 40 Pa. St., 302.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK\">The rule under which, in this jurisdiction, a plaintiff may-have judgment for want of a duly verified plea, has no application to a judgment by default for want of plea, as the present is. Meloy <em>vs. </em>Grant, 4 Mackey, 488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">But the alleged judgment, if it ever existed, was either revoked or ignored as void by the subsequent amendment of the-declaration upon which it professes to be founded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">Leave may be granted a plaintiff to amend his declaration! after verdict, the former verdict being at the same time set aside. Tomlinson <em>vs. </em>Blacksmith, 7 T. R., 131. Lord Kenyon, C. J.: \u201c It would be going too far to make the amendment without sending the cause to a new trial.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>133.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-9\">Leave may be granted to plaintiffs to amend the declaration after judgment, the judgment and verdict being set aside. Wilson <em>vs. </em>Bowen, 5 T. B. Mon., 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-10\">A plea may be amended,.after replication, demurrer, joinder in demurrer and judgment in Supreme Court for defendant, but after the judgment has been set aside. Utica Ins. Co. <em>vs. </em>Scott, 6 Cow., 605.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-11\">Where judgment by default is rendered on such defective declaration, it is competent for the co\u00fcrt to amend the dec\u00eda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ration after judgment,but such amendment should not be permitted without giving defendant leave, on application, to plead. Neidenberger <em>vs. </em>Campbell, McNiff and Barnes, 11 Mo., 359.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-4\">\u201cThe application of the plaintiff to be permitted to file an amended declaration, and of the defendant for leave to plead thereto, will amount to a mutual voluntary abandonment of all the previous pleadings on both sides.\u201d Robinson <em>vs. </em>Keys, 28 Tenn., 144.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">\u201cA valid subsisting judgment against one, merges his origijoint contract, he cannot recover against the other.\u201d Maghee nal contract in the judgment, and as the plaintiff by taking judgment has put it out of his power to prove a subsisting <em>vs. </em>Collins, 27 Ind., 85.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">\u201cA recovery against one of several persons who are only jointly liable for the payment of the debt, or the discharge of a legal liability, releases the others, and <em>forms </em>a complete bar to a recovery at law against them.\u201d The People <em>vs. </em>Harrison Adm\u2019r, 82 Ill., 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">\u201c The rule of the common law declared in this case to be that a judgment against one, upon a contract merely joint of several persons, bars an action against the others, and that the entire cause of action is merged in the judgment.\u201d Mason <em>vs. </em>Eldred <em>et al., 6 </em>Wall., 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-8\">A debt is not merged in a judgment until a valid judgment has been obtained upon it. Wixom <em>vs. </em>Stephens, 17 Mich., 518; Goodrich <em>vs. </em>Bodure, 6 Gray, 323; Maghee <em>vs. </em>Collins, 27 Ind., 83; 9 Moore, 413; 3 Lev., 234; <em>id., </em>243.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-9\">But the judgment against Moore and Cerf Solomon (even had the same been valid), being an entirety, if revoked as to one, is revoked as for the other; and, for the same reason, if it be void as to one it is void as to both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-10\">A judgment is an entire thing, and cannot be separated into parts. Hanley <em>vs. </em>Donoghue, 59 Md., 239. Hence it is true of every judgment, that \u201c it must either be affirmed as a whole, or reversed as a whole.\u201d <em>Id., </em>243. Hence, if a judgment against several persons be vacated as to one, it must be vacated as to all. Starbird <em>vs. </em>Moore, 21 Vt., 530. Hence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>if in a judgment against two the court has no jurisdiction against one defendant, the judgment being entire and unqualified, is void against both. Wright <em>vs. </em>Andrews, 130 Mass., 149, 151.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-4\">There can be no severance after j udgment of the defendants against whom that judgment has been rendered. It cannot be revoked as to one and retained as to another. Cruikshank <em>vs. </em>Gardner, 2 Hill (N. Y.), 334. Hence, if \u201ca judgment rendered jointly against the maker and endorser of a promissory note,\u201d is void as to the maker, it is erroneous against the endorser, for the reason that \u201c a judgment at law is an entirety, good as to all or bad as to all the defendants.\u201d Cov. Mut. Life Ins. Co. <em>vs. </em>Glover <em>et al., </em>36 Mo., 392. Hence in an action on a judgment against several, who sever in their defence, if the plea of one be adjudged good, and the judgment as to him pronounced void, it is void as to all because the judgment is entire. Holbrook <em>vs. </em>Murray, 5 Wend., 163. In any and every case where an entire judgment against several is erroneous as to one, it is equally erroneous as to all. Herman <em>vs. </em>Brotherson, 1 Denio, 537.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-5\">It appears from the record that the ground on which the j udgment on the <em>scire facias </em>was asked and allowed was the want of a verified plea to said writ.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">Whenever a declaration avers that a material fact appears by a record, the proper plea is <em>nul tiel record. </em>Bohannon <em>vs. </em>Broadwell, 7 J. J. Mar., 32. On issue of <em>nul tiel record, </em>day should be given the party to produce the record; and if not produced, judgment of failure of recqrd. Brady <em>vs. </em>Commonwealth, 4 <em>id., </em>517. When there is a plea of <em>nul tiel record </em>in a case, the issue upon it can only be tried by the court. Gray <em>vs. </em>Pingry, 17 Vt., 419. Therefore such plea ought not to conclude to the country, but praying judgment, &amp;c. Eppes\u2019 Adm\u2019rs <em>vs. </em>Smith, 4 Munf., 466; 2 Chitty, 488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-7\">At common law, when the existence of a judgment is put in issue upon a plea or replication of <em>nul tiel record, </em>it must be proved by the production of the'record itself, which is inspected by the court wherein it is, if it be a record of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>court.\u201d Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 417 ; Tidd\u2019s Pr., 943 ; Greenl. Ev., Vol. 1, 501 and 502.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-4\">If the record produced shows that the court did not have jurisdiction of either the person of the defendant, or the subject of the controversy, it must be disregarded. Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7 459; Thompson <em>vs. </em>Emmert, 4 McL., 98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-5\">The plea of <em>nul tiel record </em>merely puts ip issue the existence \u25a0of the record as stated. The plea, if pleaded alone, need not be signed. 3 Chitty PL, 995. Chitty gives a form for the plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>concluding with a verification, but adds, in a note, that this is unnecessary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-6\">On a previous page, the same writer says, where the declaration is founded on matter of record, which is traversed in the plea, a verification is unnecessary, as the plea is in the negative. <em>Id., </em>556.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-7\">In Wright <em>vs. </em>Weisinger, exception was taken to the form of a plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>because it <em>did </em>conclude with a verification, but the court said :</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-8\">\u201c The rule is that in a plea of <em>nul tiel record </em>a verification is unnecessary, because the plea is in the negative. An unnecessary averment may be rejected as surplusage and does not vitiate.\u201d 5 Sm. &amp; M., 215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-9\">So, when to a plea of <em>nul tiel record </em>it was replied that there was \u201csuch record,\u201d and the same concluded with a verification, the court said:</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-10\">\u201c It is true that in the replication there has not been that attention to form that a correct practice requires; but it contains all the substance necessary, and if the improper conclusion, which is surplusage, was stricken out, the issue, though informal, would be substantially good.\u201d Cole <em>vs. </em>Driskill, 1 Blackf., 16.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b22-11\">Mr. Chief Justice Bingham</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">delivered the opinion of the \u25a0court :</p>\n<p id=\"b22-12\">The record shows that the plaintiff, on May 15, 1877, filed liis declaration against Cerf Solomon, Jacob Solomon and Michael Hannan, trading under the firm name of Cerf Solo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>mon and John A. Moore, upon three promissory notes, transferred to the plaintiff for goods and chattels sold and delivered by the plaintiff to said firm of Cerf Solomon; that to this declaration the defendants other than Cerf Solomon filed their pleas in due season, but that the said Cerf Solomon filed none. The pleas of the defendant, John A. Moore, were filed June 5, 1877. To these pleas no replication was ever filed, nor was issue ever joined upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">On March 8, 1879, there appears in the record what purports to be a judgment against the defendants,- Cerf Solomon and John A. Moore, for the amount claimed in the declaration, reciting that the said defendants, \u201cthough served with \u2022copies of the declaration, notice to plead and summons, hath not pleaded to the declaration,\u201d in consequence whereof it is considered that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and judgment is entered accordingly. This recital appears to be true an respect to the defendant, Cerf Solomon, but the reverse in \u2022respect to the defendant, John A. Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The notes were made by the defendant, John A. Moore, payable to the order of defendants, Cerf Solomon, Jacob Solomon and Michael Hannan, trading under the firm name of \u2022Cerf Solomon.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The original declaration did not set out the notes as payable to order.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">On the 25th day of July, 1879, the plaintiff, by leave of the court, filed an amendment to his declaration, in which the notes are described as payable to the order of Cerf Solomon, Jacob Solomon and Michael Hannan.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">On the 7th of November the plaintiff dismissed the suit as to Michael Hannan, and submitting the cause to a jury, as against Jacob Solomon, obtained a verdict and judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">On the 1st day of February, 1888, the plaintiff caused to be issued against Cerf Solomon, Jacob Solomon and John A. Moore a writ of <em>scire facias </em>to revive a judgment recovered .against them on the 8th day of March, 1879, for <em>$602.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">The defendant, John A. Moore, on the 6th of March, 1888, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>filed his plea to this writ, and says \u201cthere is no such judgment against him in said cause upon which an execution cans or ought to move against him,\u201d but to this plea did' not attach any affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">On the 14th of March, 1888, the plaintiff filed a motion to-strike Moore\u2019s plea to the writ of <em>scire facias </em>from the record, because not supported by affidavit, and (2) for judgment on the writ of <em>scire facias </em>for want of a duly verified plea; and (3)' for revivor of the judgment, a notice of which motion was duly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">On the 28th day of April, 1888, this motion was sustained and judgment of revivor entered against Moore. From this, judgment and order Moore appeals to the General Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Rule 121 of this court is as follows: \u201cIn cases of <em>scire facias </em>on judgment and in actions on judgments from a State-court or a court of the United States, any plea thereto shall be treated as a nullity, unless an affidavit accompany the plea showing a defense to the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">It is insisted by the defendant Moore\u2019s counsel that this rule does not apply to a plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>and in support of this position a number of authorities are cited to the effect that such pleas should not conclude to the country, but by praying judgment of the court, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">We think that the rule being general, must be complied' with, and that the authorities cited do not apply to a case like-the one at bar in this jurisdiction, even though the issue be-one for the court, yet it involves a question of fact as well as-law, and the plea should be verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">It is insisted that the judgment sought to be revived was invalid because taken while there was a plea by defendant,, although not verified, as though no plea had been filed. Also that the declaration was defective, and that the declaration subsequently to the judgment against Moore was amended. As to the latter claim it will be observed that no step was-taken or attempted against Moore after the amendment. The <em>scire facias </em>is to revive the judgment of March 8, 1877, against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>We are of the opinion that the amendment could not have the effect to set aside the judgment, even though it should be admitted that it was error not to set it aside before amending the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">The Circuit Court could not refuse to revive the judgment because of any errors appearing in the record prior or subsequent to the judgment, provided it appeared that the court, when it rendered judgment, had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action and of the person of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The record showing that the defendant was personally served and that he appeared, and that the declaration stated a cause of action (defectively, it may be admitted) of which the court had jurisdiction, the defendant should have appealed from the original judgment or in some way proceeded directly to set it aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Having waited, he cannot in this proceeding be allowed b&gt; show error, however gross, falling short of showing a want of jurisdiction in the court to render the judgment.
