An <em>alias </em>writ of <em>sci. fa. </em>must be tested as of the return day of original writ of <em>sci. fa.; </em>therefore, a <em>sci. fa. </em>issued over twelve years after a return of <em>nihil </em>to the original <em>sci. fa. </em>will not be considered as an <em>alias, </em>even though it purport to be such.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-9\">3.

The only continuance possible in the case of a return of <em>nihil </em>to a <em>sci. fa. </em>on a judgment, is by an <em>alias </em>writ, the omission to issue whish is a discontinuance of all process ill the proceedings. After twelve years from the date of such return, without the issuance of other process, the judgment is no longer good or pleadable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-13\">5. The return of <em>scire feci </em>to a writ of <em>sci. fa. </em>with a suspension of further proceedings does not constitute a pending action of indefinite duration. The statute begins to run from the date of such return.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b450-15\">6.

Walter. D. Davidge and H. O. Claughton for plaintiff (appellee):</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-4\">The court had power to allow the amendment to the writ of <em>sci. fa. </em>Judiciary Act, 1789, Ch. 20, Sec. 32; R. S. U. S., Sec. 954; Rule 7 of this court; Reintzell <em>vs. </em>Beatty, 3 H. &amp; McH. 6; Hazeldine <em>vs. </em>Walker, 1 H. &amp; J. 487; Prather <em>vs. </em>Munroe, 11 G. &amp; J. 262; Byrne <em>vs. </em>McPherson, 12 G. &amp; J. 157; 2 Poe\u2019s Pl. &amp; Pr., 597; Taylor <em>vs. </em>Wharfield\u2019s bail, 2 Cr. C. C., 248; Brown <em>vs. </em>Gilles, 3 Cr. C. C., 363.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\">The thing to amend by was a record of the court. Rven without amendment there would be no variance. Walden <em>vs. </em>Craig, 14 Pet., 147.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-6\">The <em>scire facias </em>issued August 25, 1873. This <em>scire facias </em>was duly placed in the hands of the proper officer, and on August 26, 1873, returned <em>\u201cscire </em>feci\u201d as to Henry and \u201cnihil\u201d as to Benjamin. Thus, whatever other objection may be urged it cannot be pretended that the plaintiff failed duly to commence a judicial proceeding for the revival of the judgment. Wood on Rims., Sec. 289, p. 619; Bank U. S. <em>vs. </em>Lyles, 10 G. &amp; J., 326.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">The thing in action is not of \u201cmore than twelve years standing\u2019 \u2019 when within that time a proceeding has been instituted and is pending for its enforcement, and especially when such pending proceeding is the very one in which the objection of lapse of time is taken. Thomson <em>vs. </em>Beveridge, 3 Mackey, 174; Diggs <em>vs. </em>Eliason, 4 Cranch C. C., 619, 622.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-8\">And see particularly Hammond <em>vs. </em>Denton, 1 H. &amp; McH., 200 (1755), and Lamar <em>vs. </em>Manro, 10 G. &amp;. J., 61, that in a suit on a bond brought within the twelve years the bond is admissible in evidence after the expiration of that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-9\">The defense of limitations in cases under the sixth section is governed by the same rules as are applicable to the first section. Mullikin <em>vs. </em>Duvall, 7 G. &amp; J., 355; Rambson <em>vs. </em>Moffett, 61 Md., 431; 2 Poe\u2019s Pl. &amp; Pr., Secs. 590, 606.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-10\"><em>Scire facias </em>is ah action and the writ a declaration. Although a judicial writ \u201cas the defendant may plead thereto, it is considered in law as an action and in the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>of a new original.\u201d 2 Will. Sauud., 72, note 4; Winder <em>vs. </em>Caldwell, 15 How., 443; Evan\u2019s Pr., 45, 171; 2 Poe\u2019s Pl. &amp; Pr., Sec. 585.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-4\">The design of the Statute of Westminister (13 Ed. I,, Stat. 1, Ch. 45) was to superadd to the common law remedy of an action of debt, requiring a new original, the more simple and convenient proceeding by <em>scire facias </em>based upon the record of the court issuing the judicial process.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-5\">In Lambson <em>vs. </em>Moffet, 61 Md., 431-2, the question was whether the action of <em>scire, facias </em>would lie where there was a right to execution, and the sole purpose of the action was to obtain a new judgment reviving the old. The court held that the action lay and was concurrent with debt and the safer and more convenient method of reviving.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-6\">The judgment entered up in a <em>scire facias </em>is not a mere award of execution but a <em>new </em>judgment having the legal attributes of the original judgment. Lambson <em>vs. </em>Moffett, 61 Md., 430; Mullikin <em>vs. </em>Duvall, 7 G. &amp; J., 360; Shafer <em>vs. </em>Shafer, 6 Md., 518; 2 Poe\u2019s Pl. &amp; Pr. S. 609.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-7\">The law did not require the plaintiff to accept other than personal service on the defendant, Henry, but it was his legal right to have personal service on both defendants so as to bind both by the new judgment in such manner as would be available not only in this jurisdiction but elsewhere. D\u2019Arcy and Welch <em>vs. </em>Ketchum, 11 How., 165, 174, 176; Hanley and Welch <em>vs. </em>Donoghue, 59 Md., 244; Jackson <em>vs. </em>Hulse, 6 Mackey, 548; Weaver <em>vs. </em>Boggs, 38 Md., 255, 261; Bruen <em>vs. </em>Bokee, 4 Denio, 56; Oakley <em>vs. </em>Aspinwall, 4 Comst., 514; Denny <em>ns. </em>Smith, 18 N. Y., 569.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\">The plaintiff duly proceeded against the defendant Benjamin as will appear hereafter. Gorham <em>vs. </em>Shepherd, 6 Mackey, 596.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-9\">Before the Act of 1867 the law recognized the right of an obligor in a\u2019 joint obligation to have a co-obligor impleaded with him. The right, however, was not matter of contract but only of procedure and yet an obligor was regarded as having such an interest in the joinder of his co-obligor that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>this was omitted he could object by plea. i Chitty PL, 42. But the objection could only be made by plea in abatement duly verified, alleging that a co-obligor not joined <em>was alive and in the jurisdiction </em>and if the plea was not interposed there was an end of the objection. Id.,. 46. The strictness required in the case of non-joinder of defendants had its origin in the fact that the objection went to the mode of procedure and not to the obligation. <em>Id.; </em>Wilson <em>vs. </em>Nevers, 20 Pick., 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">In the case of non-rejoinder of plaintiffs the objection was based on the obligation itself and hence involved a different rule. 1 Ch. P. 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-6\">After the above act the interest of a party in the joinder of his co-obligor ceased to exist. By the very terms of that law a creditor may sue alone one of several co-obligors in a joint obligation, subject only to the restriction that whilst the litigation continues it may be pleaded in bar of an action against an obligor not sued. R. S. D. C., Sec. 827; Burdette <em>vs. </em>Bartlett, 95 U. S., 639; Keyser <em>vs. </em>Fendall, 5 Mackey, 55.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-7\">The Act of 1867 in letter and spirit abrogates the preexisting interest of one obligor in the joinder of another and allows a creditor to recover against either, leaving them to settle as between themselves. Minor <em>vs. </em>Mechanic\u2019s Bank, 1 Pet., 73.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-8\">The Statute of Anne was not applicable to the province of Maryland, but the provision of the above section was substantially enacted by the Act of 1765, Ch. 12. This statute by its preamble declares that the Act of 1715 relates only to persons <em>absenting themselves from </em>the province <em>after debt con</em>tracted, and then makes a provision for saving a right of action against all persons in fact absent at the time of action accrued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-9\">The question has arisen under the above section of the statute of Anne, and similar enactments, whether the running of the statute was prevented when the obligation was joint, and one of several obligors was absent at the time of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>accrued, and it has been settled that'such action saved the statute as to all, as the plaintiff was under no obligation to commence his action unless he could have a complete remedy against all he was entitled to sue. Fannin <em>vs: </em>Anderson, 7 Ad. &amp; El., N. S., 53 F. C. L., 811, 822, 823; Tours <em>vs. </em>Mead., 29 Law and Eq., 271; Denny <em>vs. </em>Smith, 18 New York, 569.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-3\">Upon the application of Henry B. Otterback alone, the judgment was set aside as to both defendants. The appeal from this vacation order was dismissed by the General Term upon the ground that it was not an appealable order. As the whole record is now before the court upon an appeal from a final judgment, the court will correct any error apparent upon the record. \u201cWhatever error of the court is apparent in the record, whether it be in the foundation proceedings, judgment or execution of the suit, may be re-examined and corrected.\u201d Suydenham <em>vs. </em>Williamson, 20 How., 433; Storm <em>vs. </em>The United States, 84 U. S., 76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-4\">Inasmuch as the proceeding was begun before the bar of the statute, the Statute of Fimitations would not apply, no matter how long the proceedings were pending. The court of last resort in the State of New York in a recent case has asserted this doctrine in the most positive manner:</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\">\u2018 \u2018It is impossible to perceive how any lapse of time subsequent to the commencement of the action could bar the action under a statute which prescribes a limit of time only before the commencement of the action.\u201d Evans <em>vs. </em>Cleveland, 73 N. Y., 486; Bank of the U. S. <em>vs. </em>Lyle, 10 Gill &amp; Johns., 326; Mayo <em>vs. </em>Rogers, 14 East, 538; Ontario Bank <em>vs. </em>Rathburn, 19 Wend., 291.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-6\">It may not be inappropriate to inquire what the law of this District is as to the question of whether a judgment by default in any proceeding will be set aside for the purpose of allowing the defendant to plead the Statute of Fimitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-7\">Mr. Freeman, in his work on Judgments, discussing the statutes, which, like our rule, require an affidavit of merits, on a motion to vacate a judgment by default, saj^s: \u201cThese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>statutes\u201d (the rule) \u201care to be employed only in the furtherance of justice. Even where they do not so expressly direct, no judgment will be opened unless it is shown to be unjust.\u201d Freeman on Judgments, Sec. 108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-4\">So it has been decided that \u2018the entry of continuances is not necessary to prevent the running of the Statute of Limitations. Whenever a writ has not <em>actually </em>abated it remains the commencement of the action as to the Statute of Limitations.\u201d Sclosser <em>vs. </em>Lesher, 1 Dall., 434, (Ct. Com. Pleas, Phila.); Brown <em>vs. </em>Sutter, 1 Dall., 259; Gorham <em>vs. </em>Shepherd, 5 Mackey, 576; 20 Ohio St., 208; 4 East, 538.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-5\">\u2018 \u2018The court will not permit the amendment of pleas so as to set up the Statute of Limitations.\u201d 3 Harr. &amp; McHenry, 384.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">\u2018 \u2018The Statute of Limitations should be regarded as a strict defense, and if the party lets it slip the court ought not to relieve him.\u201d West Hoboken <em>vs. </em>Simms, 49 N. J. L., 546.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\">\u201cIf the defence of the Statute of Limitations is not raised by either demurrer or answer before judgment, it is lost.\u201d Upton <em>vs. </em>McLaughlin, 105 U. S., 645.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-8\">Messrs Ridule and Davis and Westel Willoughby for defendants (appellants):</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-9\">There never was such a judgment as described in the writs \u2014a judgment for debt and damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-10\">Had there been, the first writ of August 27, 1873, was ineffective, for want of prosecution. From the day of its return no action was had for twelve years and three months, when under the Maryland statute of limitations, the judgment was as extinct as if it had been satisfied on payment. (1 Dorsey Stats., p. 11, act of 1715, section 5; see Thomp. Dig., p. 289, section 5.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-11\">In the absence of special rules for pleading, a given case falls under the old common-law rule of a year and a day. This rule has been applied in a <em>scire facias </em>case directly. The New York court said: \u201cIf the plaintiff who sues out a writ of <em>scifa. </em>to revive a judgment does not proceed upon it within a year and a day, it is a discontinuance of it, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>plaintiff must commence by <em>sci fa. de novo.\u201d </em>Vanderheyden <em>vs. </em>Gardner, 9 John., 79. In that case there was an interval of two years and five months.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-4\">A plaintiff must proceed under his <em>sci. fa </em>in a year and a day. Bank <em>vs. </em>Frederickson, 2 Miles, 70.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-5\">At common law, as stated above, after the return of a writ, a plaintiff has a year and a day in which to file a declaration. If he does not it works a discontinuance. Kennedy <em>vs. </em>Smith, 2 Bay., 414. In this case seven years had elapsed. The court held that the writ died in a year and a day, quoting the third of Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-6\">At common law a judgment became dormant after a year and a day without execution. 2 Tidd, 4 Am. Ed., 1101.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-7\">After a judgment has been revived by <em>sci fa., </em>if the plaintiff does not cause execution to issue within the year, he must have a new <em>sci. fa. Id., </em>1106; Foster on <em>Sci Fa., </em>27. See also Vanderheyden <em>vs. </em>Gardner, 9 Johns., cited above; Freeman on Executions, sec. 93, and Freeman on judgments, sec. 442.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-8\">It was held in Maryland that a judgment could not be revived after twelve years, <em>although a fi. fa. had been issued and levied on lands not sold for want of bidders. </em>Mullikin, for use, <em>vs. </em>Duval, 7 Gill and J. 355. Same, 19 and 20, vol. 249.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-9\">This case was reviewed and approved and the same question squarely ruled the same way in Johnson- <em>vs. </em>Hines, 61 Md., 122. And see Thompson <em>vs. </em>Beveridge, 3 Mackey, 170.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-10\">A writ of <em>sci. fa. </em>on a judgment for $26,500 and $11,50 cost is ineffectual when the judgment in fact was for $26,500, subject to be released on payment of a different amount. McKnew <em>vs. </em>Duvall, 45 Md., 501. See Moore <em>vs. </em>Garrettson, 6 Md., 444.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-12\">And the second writ is equally ineffectual, because it is not sufficient in itself. It should have <em>recited the former </em>writ, and also it should have recited the original judgment correctly. Bowie <em>vs. </em>Neal, 41 Md., 124; McKnew <em>vs. </em>Duvall, 45 Md., 501.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The <em>scire facias </em>could not be amended after pleas pleaded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-4\">In England a <em>scire facias </em>was not amendable, and a plaintiff was first to quash his own writ. 2 Tidd, 1123. But there are cases where a <em>sci. fa. </em>has been amended not only when bad <em>on its </em>face by mistake of the clerk, but also for variance where there was <em>not a plea of nul tiel record. (Id.). </em>Villars <em>vs. </em>Parry, 1 Ed. Ray., 182; Bucksome <em>vs. </em>Hoskin, 2 Ed. Ray., 1157. See <em>amendment 1 </em>Salkeld, several cases, p. 47-52. Two in <em>sci. fa., </em>p. 51. See also Hiller <em>vs. </em>Frost, 1 Strange, 401; Baynes <em>vs. </em>Forrest, 2 <em>Id,, </em>892.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-5\">There are many cases that go .the extent of denying amendments in any stage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-6\">The English courts in <em>scire facias </em>on bail bonds, sometimes relaxed the rule, and Mansfield, in one such case, permitted an amendment after plea, and the defendant had leave to plead <em>de novo. </em>Charles <em>vs. </em>Marsden, 1 Taunt., 224.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-7\">In England the writ was held to be in the nature of an original writ, and was followed by a declaration always.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-8\">In a suit on a bond the declaration cannot be amended after <em>issue joined. </em>In this instance it was to correct a misrecital of the date only. Proprietary <em>vs. </em>Pearce, 1 H. &amp; McH., 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-9\">Under the Maryland Statutes of 1785, chapter 80, and of 1809, chapter 153, which authorize amendments \u201cin all proceedings whatsoever before verdict.\u201d &amp;c., the court held that this had reference to all the proceedings after the writ. The court made this decision more to settle the law than because the case before it required a decision of this point. Stoddard <em>vs. </em>Newman, 7 H. &amp; J., 251; op., 256. See volumes 11 and 12, 190-194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-10\">This construction applies to our rule 7 (page 3, rules Supreme Court), as the court gives excellent reasons for not amending a writ. That a writ is also a declaration in <em>scire facias </em>in our practice is no reason for amending it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b457-11\">In Nisbit <em>vs. </em>Manro, 11 Gill and J., 261, the court below permitted the <em>scire facias </em>to be amended after plea of <em>nul tiel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>record, it appearing that the clerk in filling out the writ had omitted inadvertently a name he had been directed to insert. The defendant then demurred. The court held the amendment properly made, but found the description still defective, and decided that <em>no further amendment </em>could be made and refused a <em>procedendo. </em>See Id., 179-83.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-3\">This matter of amending a <em>scire facias </em>came incidentally before the court again, and the court found that under the <em>Maryland Code </em>an amendment might have been made, but it was not, and the court sustained the demurrer of the defendant. Bowie <em>vs. </em>Neal, 41 Md. 124.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b458-4\">Mr. Justice Cox</author>\n<p id=\"AsW\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">This case involves sundry questions of minor importance, but the principal and important question involved may be presented by a brief statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">On the 20th of January, 1862, the plaintiff, Crumbaugh, recovered a judgment, on a partnership debt, against Henry B. and Benjamin Bouis Otterbaclc in the Circuit Court of this District, for <em>$10,000 </em>damages, to be released on payment of a smaller amount. A writ of <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued thereon in May, which was returned <em>nulla bona, </em>to October Term, 1862.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">No further step was taken to enforce the judgment until August 25, 1873, nearly 'eleven years after the return of the <em>fi. fa., </em>when <em>&amp; scire facias </em>was issued against both defendants, which was returned on the 29th of that month, <em>scire feci, </em>as to Henry, and <em>nihil </em>as to Benjamin B-</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">A further suspension of proceedings took place, until November 30, 1885, twelve years and three months since the last step, when a new <em>scire facias </em>was issued against both defendants, but was not served on Henry and was returned <em>nihil </em>as to Benjamin B- on January 9, 1886.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">On the 14th of June, 1889, nearly three years and a half after this, on the basis of the return of <em>scire feci </em>as to Henry, made nearly sixteen years before, and the second return of <em>nihil </em>as to Benjamin, made after an interval of over twelve years between that and the first return, a <em>fiat </em>was entered against both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>This, however, was set aside on motion and the defendants allowed to plead to the <em>scire facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Besides the plea of <em>nul tiel </em>record, both the defendants pleaded to the <em>scire </em>facias, in substance, that the judgment was of more than twelve years\u2019 standing when the present writ was issued, and that the plaintiff, by reason of his failure to follow up his <em>sci. fa </em>of 1873, had discontinued the proceedings thereunder. These pleas were demurred to, the demurrer sustained and judgment given for plaintiff, from which an appeal was taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The language of the Act of Assembly of 1715, Ch. 23, Sec. 6, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\"><em>\u201cNo </em>bill, bond, judgment, statute merchant or of the staple, or other specialty whatsoever, except such as shall be taken in the name or for the use of our Sovereign Ford the King, his heirs and successors, shall be good and plead-able or admitted in evidence against any person or persons of this province, after the principal debtor and creditor have both been dead twelve years, or the debtor thing in action above twelve years standing; saving, etc., etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">What is the meaning of the terms \u201ctwelve years standing?\u201d At first blush it would seem to be <em>twelve years of existence, </em>so that the period should be counted from the date of the judgment. And such was the holding of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in the first case before them, in which the question arose, viz., Mulliken <em>vs. </em>Duvall, 7 Gill &amp; Johnson, 355, decided in 1835, in which the court held that although a <em>ft. fa. </em>had been issued and levied on lands and so returned, the twelve years should count from the date of the judgment, and not from that of the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">But in the case of Digges <em>vs. </em>Eliason 4 Cranch, C. C., 619, decided in the same year as the last case, the Circuit Court of the District construed the statute more liberally, and held, substantially, that every new act done towards the execution of the judgment gave it a new lease of life, and that the \u201ctwelve years standing\u201d should be counted from the last proceeding towards the enforcement of the judgment, and, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>that case, it should run from the date of a <em>fiat </em>rendered on it within twelve years before the <em>set. fa. </em>by which that suit was begun, and not from the original judgment. It was suggested that a party might be diligently pursuing his remedies all through the twelve years \u2014 perhaps making partial collections during the period \u2014 and the twelve years might expire in the midst of his efforts, and it would be unjust to hold that, under such circumstances, his debt had become extinct. The <em>twelve years </em>standing, therefore, ought to mean, <em>standing without any effort to collect.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Tested by this rule, how does the present case stand?</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The practice in <em>scire facias </em>is thus stated in 2 Tidd\u2019s Practice, p. 1038. \u201cWhere the sheriff returns <em>nihil, </em>the plaintiff must sue out a second or alias writ of <em>scire facias, </em>commanding the sheriff as <em>before </em>he was commanded, etc., and if upon this second writ the sheriff also return <em>nihil, </em>and the bail or defendants do not appear, there shall be judgment against them; two <em>nihils </em>being deemed equivalent to a <em>scire feci. </em>It was formerly usual to sue out both writs of <em>scire facias </em>together, making the <em>teste </em>of the second as if the first had been actually returned; but now there is a rule of court requiring that no writ of <em>alias scire facias </em>shall issue until the first writ be returnable.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Where there are two writs of <em>scire facias, the second should be tested on the return day, </em>or by <em>original, </em>on the <em>quartodie post of the return of the </em>first, except in error, or the return day happen on Sunday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">In this case, it appears that on a judgment rendered on the 20th of January, 1862, against Henry D. Otterback and Benjamin T. Otterback, in which a <em>fi.fa. </em>had been issued, and returned <em>nulla bona </em>to October Term 1862, afterwards a <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the 25th of August, 1873, nearly twelve years after the judgment, and nearly eleven years after the <em>fi. fa. </em>was returned <em>nulla bona, </em>which <em>scire facias </em>was returned by the Marshal, <em>scire feci </em>as to Henry, and <em>nihil </em>as to Benjamin T. on the 29th of the same month. No steps were taken to enforce the judgment until November 30, 1885, twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>years and three months after the return aforesaid, when the <em>scire facias </em>was issued against both defendants, was not served in Henry and was returned <em>nihil </em>as to Benjamin.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The only object of a <em>scire facias </em>on judgment is to obtain a <em>fiat. </em>As we have seen, if the defendant is not found, this can only be had on two returns of <em>nihil. </em>The single return of nihil, therefore, as to Benjamin E- was ineffective and inoperative for any purpose. The <em>scire facias </em>issued in November, 1885, was as good as an original <em>scire </em>facias, if the judgment was still alive, but, in no sense can it be considered as an <em>alias, </em>because it was issued long after an <em>alias </em>could have issued, which, as we have seen, must have been tested as of the return day of the original. And, besides, it does not purport to be an <em>alias. </em>It cannot be connected with or deemed a continuation of the original, and, therefore, the return of <em>nihil </em>in August, 1873, must be deemed the last proceeding in the direction of enforcing the judgment, before the present <em>sci.fa. </em>was issued, more than twelve years afterwards, <em>unless </em>a further contention of the plaintiff be well founded, which we now proceed to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In Evans\u2019 Practice, p. 104, it is said: \u201cConnected with the subject of renewals is the rather curious subject of a mode of evading the Statute of Eimitations, which the English judges have suffered to grow up, and, indeed, fostered although it palpably amounts to a judicial repeal of the statute. Nevertheless, the English courts have so thoroughly established it that the Court of Appeals of this State have felt themselves bound not to disturb the current of authority. We allude to the mode of evading the Statute of Eimitations by what is sometimes called <em>entering a writ, and continuances, to save the statide. </em>To effect this object, it is necessary, in the first instance, to issue a writ and procure it to be returned \u2018not served.\u2019 This writ must be issued before the statute has attached. If it were really followed up by a series of writs, <em>bona fide </em>continuing the action, it would be a fair compliance with the statute. But the'English courts have decided that it is not necessary to issue any more writs until it is convenient to have one served; but that entries, of what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>they call <em>continuances, </em>that is, entries of the award of <em>fictitious </em>writs, and of the fact that the sheriff did not send the writ, at the proper time, may be made out at any time, connecting the two real writs together. It is even said that these continuances may be made out in the attorney\u2019s office. It is clear that this absolutely puts an end to the protection of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The author does not refer to any case in which the Court of Appeals recognized this practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Now, it is claimed that the course pursued in the present case is that which is approved as legal by Evans. This is to say, the <em>sci. fia. </em>issued in 1873 was returned nihil, which is equivalent to 1 \u2018not served\u2019 \u2019 or \u2018 \u2018not to be found, \u201d as to Benjamin Louis Otterback, and the continuances may be entered up from that return to the issue of the present <em>sci. fia. </em>in 1885 and the proceeding treated as a pending and continuous action.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">And we are referred to the case of Gorham <em>vs. </em>Shepherd, 6 Mackey, 596, as showing that the practice outlined by Evans has been sanctioned in this District.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In that case, however, no such question was made. It is true that a writ was issued and returned not to be found, and <em>sub silentio, </em>an alias was issued some years afterwards without having regularly renewed the first writ from term to term in the meantime. But the defendant accepted service of the last writ and then raised the single question whether suit could be brought at all against a <em>non-resident, </em>and whether the original writ was not forbidden by section 767, Rev. Stat. D. C., which says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">\u201cNo action or suit shall be brought in the Supreme Court by original process against any person, who shall not be an inhabitant of, or found within the District, except as otherwise specially provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">And this question alone was decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">And it is remarkable that the practice in question has been entirely repudiated by the Court of Appeals of Maryland in the case of Hazlehurst <em>vs. </em>Morris, 28 Md., 67, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>decided in 1867. That was an action of assumpsit; a writ issued to September Term, 1862, was returned <em>tarde. </em>It was not renewed to the next term. About a year after the first writ, a second was issued and returned <em>\u201csummoned.'\u201d </em>The court directed the continuances to be entered up as if there had been no omission to renew the writs. From this the defendant appealed, claiming that this omission was a discontinuance. After referring to certain citations, from Tidd\u2019s Practice, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">\u201cIt is urged by the appellees that the passages above quoted show it to be the practice to keep alive judgments by the issue and return of one <em>fi. fa., </em>and then by merely entering continuances upon the record, without renewing the executions, and that the same practice <em>prevails as to suits. </em>We know of no such practice in this State, as applicable either <em>to suits or exectdions, </em>and are of opinion' that this court announced the only practice when it stated that a judgment might be kept alive for an indefinite time by issuing a <em>fi. fa. </em>and having it returned, and then <em>regtdarly renewing it from term to term.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">After referring to an unreported case, Dennison, Administrator, <em>vs. </em>Trull, they add:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cSo far from that case sustaining the views of the appellees, it shows the practice to have been exactly the reverse of that contended for by them. We do not find any authority for such practice, but are of opinion that such an one ought not to be tolerated. Plaintiff might lie by for years and then bring the defendants into court, after their witnessess were dead or their proofs lost or destroyed, and obtain judgments against them upon claims not founded in justice; and the practice be thus used as a means of injustice and oppression. This court could not sanction a practice so fraught with mischief, unless it were so long and so clearly established as to have the force of positive law. Where a party institutes a suit and the summons proves ineffectual to bring the defendant into court, and is returned by the sheriff, in order to keep the suit alive, the summons <em>must be regularly renewed from </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>term to term </em>until the defendant is taken. <em>The omission to renew it operates as a discontinuance of the action. </em>There is, therefore, error in the order of the court below.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-3\">Though Evans\u2019 Practice and the decision in question differ, they may both be said to be authority for the proposition that the practice in question is not to be extended to any class of cases in which there is no precedent for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">If I may be allowed a brief digression here, I would say, that an expression in the opinion of the court in Thompson <em>vs. </em>Beveridge, 3 Mackey, 170, was probably too broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">After discussing the English practice of having a <em>fi. fa. </em>returned, and afterward entering \u00fap the continuances at any time, the opinion, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cThis condition of the common law obtained in the State of Maryland, and was derived from Maryland by us, qualified, however, by the Act of Assembly in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The case of Hazlehurst <em>vs. </em>Morris denies that such practice exists in Maryland, and on referring to Evans\u2019 Practice I find that he states, page 55:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">1 \u2018 The English mode is to issue one execution, procure it to be returned and filed, and afterwards continue it to the time when a real execution is wanted, by fictitious entries on the record, which are not made until they are required to be used. The Maryland mode is <em>to renew the execution every </em>court, by an order to the clerk to issue execution 1 <em>to lie. </em>\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The expression used in the case of Thompson <em>vs. </em>Beveridge, supra, however, had no bearing on the result of the case, because the plaintiff had delayed his proceedings until the judgment was no longer good and pleadable, and the entering up of continuances could do him no good.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">To resume: There is really, then, no satisfactory authority for the practice in question, even in regard to <em>original </em>writs, either in Maryland or the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">How is it with regard to writs of <em>scire </em>facias? It is very clear that no such practice ever could have existed as to such proceeding, at common law, for the simple reason that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>was no necessity for it. The Statute of ^imitations of James first did not apply to judgments or other specialties. They never became extinct. A <em>sci. fa. </em>could be issued on a judgment at any time, except that after ten years from the date of judgment, a motion had to be made for it, with an affidavit that it had not been paid, and after fifteen years, a rule <em>nisi </em>had to issue first. There was no necessity for issuing a <em>sci. fa', </em>or bringing an action of debt, <em>to save the bar of the statute. </em>And therefore there is no trace of such a practice, involving the entry of continuances, as in the case of original process, designed to evade the statute, as far as we are informed. The practice described by Tidd,- as to original process, was only supposed to exist in Maryland as a part of the common law. Any such practice in reference to <em>scire facias </em>was certainly, not so derived. If it ever existed in Maryland, it was indigenous to that State, but we know of no precedent for it in that State or this District. As we have already seen, the only continuance possible in the case of a return of <em>nihil </em>to a <em>sci. fa. </em>is an <em>alias </em>writ. And as that was omitted in this case there was simply a discontinuance of all process as against Benjamin D- If a second return of <em>nihil </em>had been had and a <em>fiat </em>entered, the judgment would have died out in twelve years from that date. And yet the argument for the plaintiff gives more effect, in the way of continuing the life of the judgment to a mere return of <em>nihil </em>than to a judgment of <em>fiat, </em>which seems altogether unreasonable. The date of the last proceeding to enforce the judgment against him must be considered to be the date of the return of <em>nihil </em>as to him, August 29, 1873, which was more than twelve years before the present <em>sci. fa. </em>was issued, and therefore, as to him, the judgment was then no longer good or pleadable and his plea must be adjudged good, and the demurrer to it overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The next question relates to the position of Henry B. Otterback.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">It is claimed that, at least in his case, there was a pending cause all the way up to the issue of the <em>sci. fa. </em>in November, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The nature of the writ of <em>scire facias </em>is thus described in Foster on Scire Facias, pp. n, 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">\u201cIn all cases where the writ of <em>sci.fa </em>is required, either to revive a previous judgment above a year old, or where a person has become interested in the suit, who was not a party to the judgment, it is a <em>jzidicial </em>writ, to warn the defendant to plead any matter in bar of the execution; and in these cases it is only a <em>quasi continuance of the former </em>writ, brought merely to revive the former judgment, and <em>is then properly called a writ of </em>execution.\u201d Again, \u201cthe writ in all cases is <em>in the nature of an action, becatise the defendant may plead to it; </em>for whenever the defendant may plead to any writ, whether original' or judicial, it is in law an action; and although to revive an action it is a judicial writ to continue the effect of, and have execution of, the former judgment, <em>yet it is in the nature of an action, </em>because the defendant may plead any matter <em>in bar of the execution </em>upon the first judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">It is, then, both an <em>execution </em>and <em>in the nature of an action. </em>And the only reason for the latter branch of the proposition, as stated both in Foster and other works is, <em>that the defendant may plead to it.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">If, in this case, Henry Otterback had appeared and pleaded, an issue would have been joined, and there would have been a pending cause which would have been calendared and continued from term to term until tried, and the defendant could only have rid himself of it by a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">But when the defendant, though duly summoned, declined to appear and defend, there was no issue joined, nothing to calendar for trial or continuance. The next step in the proceeding was simply to obtain the <em>fiat </em>or order for execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">There was no occasion for delaying this longer than to obtain a second return of <em>nihil </em>as to Benjamin T.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">Fven in the case of original writs, there is no such practice as entering up continuances from term to term, where the defendant, being duly summoned, has defaulted and the plaintiff is entitled to take judgment. In such case the process is executed and satisfied, and there is no occasion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>for renewals or continuances; so as to a <em>scire facias </em>which has been served and is not defended.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The <em>sci. fa. </em>has ceased to perforar the functions or answer the purposes of <em>an action </em>and remained <em>an execution, </em>pure and simple, and, it would seem, ought to have the same effect as the issue of a <em>fi. fa., </em>not followed up by any further proceeding. We have not been referred to a single case, English or American, which countenances the idea that, under such circumstances the <em>sci. fa. </em>is to be considered a running or continuing action, to have the same effect as if writs had been constantly renewed up to the issue of the present <em>sci. fa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">On the contrary, in the case of Vanderheyden <em>vs. </em>Gardener, 9 Johnson\u2019s R., p. 79, it was held, that where a <em>sci. fa. </em>was issued and returned in November, 1808, <em>scire feci, </em>but a <em>fiat </em>was not had until the 13'th day of May, 1811, the <em>fiat </em>must be struck out because the omission to enter it promptly after the return of the <em>fi. fa. </em>was a discontinuance. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cIf the plaintiff who sues out a <em>sci. fa. </em>to revive a judgment does not proceed upon it within a year and a day, it is <em>a discontinuance </em>of it and the plaintiff must commence by <em>scire facias de </em>novo.\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\u201cThis cause comes within the rule, for between the entry of default and entry of judgment there was an interval of two years and five months, and any other view taken by the court would really operate as a judicial repeal of the Act of Eimitation of Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The last proceeding to enforce this judgment before the <em>sci. fa. </em>of 1873, was the return of the <em>fi.fa. </em>to October Term, 1862, According to the rule laid down in Digges <em>vs. </em>Eliason, the judgment would cease to be good and pleadable in <em>October, 1874, </em>but for <em>the sci. fa. </em>of August, 1873. If that had been defended, and the controversy had lasted for several years, it might be reasonable enough to hold that it was a continuing proceeding to enforce the judgment, up to its close.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">But to hold that a mere return of service to a <em>sci. fa., </em>with a suspension of further proceedings,- constitutes a pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>action of indefinite duration would make the Act of Ifimitations a mere nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">No other claims than specialties expire <em>of themselves, </em>but the statute merely bars the remedy upon them, <em>by action, </em>if the defendant choose to insist on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">But as to judgments and other specialties, the Maryland statute introduces a new feature by extinguishing the cause of action itself after it has been standing twelve years. It is a very liberal interpretation of the statute to make the limitation count from the last proceeding taken to enforce the judgment. According to this, if two <em>nihils </em>had been returned as to Benjamin, and the plaintiff had taken <em>his fiat in </em>1873, his judgment would have been good for twelve years from that date only.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">But, according to the argument for the plaintiff, if he is able to ask a <em>fiat, </em>but chooses not to do it, or to take any other step whatever, his omission to take a <em>fiat </em>is more efficacious in prolonging the life of the judgment than the <em>fiat </em>itself. He has initiated a self-perpetuating proceeding, and the judgment never can be <em>standing </em>for any time after it, because it <em>has no termination. </em>So that, by the election of the plaintiff not to take his <em>fiat </em>when he might do so, he gives his judgment a vitality of indefinite duration and makes the statute a dead letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">We do not think that this claim is maintainable on principle or authority, but hold that the <em>sci.fa., </em>as against Henry, must be held to have stopped short .with the return of <em>scire feci </em>in 1873. .</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Another question is presented. This judgment was for a partnership debt, which, at that time, was strictly <em>joint. </em>On a joint judgment, where the debt is joint, and not joint and several, the <em>sci. fa. </em>is joint and must follow the judgment. Foster on Scire Facias, pp. 20, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">And in such case, if a plaintiff voluntarily discontinues or abates as to one, the rule seems to be that it is a discontinuance as to all.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">The rule of the common law was that in a joint action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>if one defendant is not served, the plaintiff must exhaust his process against that one before he can ask judgment against the others. And hence it was held by the Supreme Court of the United States in Barton <em>vs. </em>Petit &amp; Bayard, 7 Cranch, 194, that in an action of debt on a judgment against two, where it appeared that the plaintiff had abated as to one, and obtained judgment on verdict against the other, and the defendant moved <em>in </em>arrest, without success, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">So, in Coleman <em>vs. </em>Edwards, 2 Bibb, 595, and Williams <em>vs. </em>Fowler, 37 B. Monroe, 47, it was held that a discontinuance as to one of two defendants to a <em>sci. fa. </em>was a discontinuance as to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In answer to this it is said that under Section 827, Rev. Stat., D. C., the plaintiff may elect to sue all or any of joint obligors.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">It is obvious, however, that this applies to the original action only.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u201cWhere <em>money is payable </em>by two or more persons, etc., one action may be sustained and <em>judgment recovered </em>against all or any of the parties, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The object of the <em>sci. fa. </em>is to have execution on a judgment already recovered, and we do not think it is within the purview of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The plaintiff alleges, as an excuse for not proceeding to <em>fiat </em>against Benjamin E- Otterback, that he had a right to wait until personal service could be had upon him, so that the <em>fiat </em>would be binding on him in any other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">If this is not a far-fetched excuse devised by the ingenuity of counsel, it is, at least, one of which the common law takes no note; and, moreover, it does not seem to be founded on any good reason. There was no necessity to suspend proceedings until Benjamin E- Otterback could be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">The rule of diligence required that the plaintiff should go on and have his <em>fiat </em>against both parties, and then, at any time within twelve years thereafter, he might issue a new <em>sci. fa. </em>and have it served personally if the defendants could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>be found. There was no necessity to suspend proceedings in order to secure personal service. The conclusion on the whole is, that the proceeding to enforce this judgment before the present <em>sci. fa. </em>was issued, terminated in August, 1873, more than twelve years before; that the defendant\u2019s pleas were good in law, and <em>tlie judgment against the defendants must be reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
