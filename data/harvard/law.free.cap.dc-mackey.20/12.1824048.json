As was said in Yarnall\u2019s Case,- 4 Rawle, 45, \u201cIt must plainly appear that the instrument proposed to be proved contains at least the true substance and the import of the declaration made by the deceased.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-6\">Nuncupative wills, if in force in- this District, are made so by virtue of the Statute 29th Charles II., ch. 3, secs. 19-21, Thompson\u2019s Digest, 352.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-7\">The 20th section of that statute provides\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-8\">\u201cThat after six months passed after the speaking of the pretended testamentary words, no testimony shall be received to prove any will nuncupative, except the said testimony, or the substance thereof, were committed to writing within six days after the making of the said will.\u201d \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-9\">The alleged nuncupation in this case states that Askins died April 18, 1890. It was filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court April 22, 1890, or four days after the death of the deceased. It was not offered to the court for probate until the 24th day of October, 1890, that is to say, six months and six days \u201c after the speaking of the pretended testamentary words.\u201d In the meantime there was nothing \u201c committed to writing\u201d except what is contained in this paper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-10\">It is plain, therefore, that no oral testimony could supply what was lacking in the paper itself. Newman <em>vs. </em>Colbert, 13 Ga., 38.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-11\">This paper, then, even if it be established by the testimony of the witnesses, would not show a nuncupative will. In the first place it has neither the <em>rogatio testium nor any </em>other evidence of <em>animus testandi.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b29-12\">\u201c It is indispensable to the validity of a nuncupative will that the testator should request those present to bear witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number><em>(rogatio testium) </em>that such was his -last will, or that he should say or do something equivalent to such an expression.\u201d Arnett <em>vs. </em>Arnett, 27 Ill., 247; Morgan <em>vs. </em>Stevens, 78 Ill.; Sampson <em>vs. </em>Browning, 22 Ga., 293; Babineau <em>vs. </em>Le Blanc, 14 La.

Ed.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-4\">\u25a0 -The paper in question says that <em>\u201cseveral </em>times before his. death he spoke about making a will, and. stated how he wanted it <em>writtenl' </em>Then the paper goes on to state what he said, viz., at these <em>several </em>times.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-5\">Certainly this paper contains none of the requisites of a. nuncupative will. It does not state that the testator was even <em>sick </em>at the time of uttering the alleged words, and unless he-were <em>in extremis </em>it would be of no effect. It does not show that he called these witnesses around him and requested them to' testify that this was his will. On the contrary, the paper-on its face negatives any idea on the part of the deceased that: he intended to make a nuncupative will. No doubt (if what is said in the paper be true) he wanted to have a will <em>written,. </em>but that is not a nuncupative will. <em>\u201cSeveral </em>times before his death he spoke about making a will, and stated how he wanted, it <em>written.\u201d </em>Thousands of men have not only <em>several </em>times, but <em>many </em>times before their death, spoken about making a will, and stated how they wanted it <em>writteii, </em>and yet have failed for some reason or other to have it written, and as a consequence died intestate \u2014 but it was never until now contended that such action on their part constituted a nuncupative will.. To execute a nuncupative will a man must be in his <em>last </em>sickness. He must call the witnesses about him and request, them to witness <em>(rogatio </em>testium) that he is about to make his will, and all this must appear, at least in' substance, in the-paper offered for probate. Nothing of the sort appears here, and the court properly refused probate.of the paper offered-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Mr. R.

The heirs of the alleged testator filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court a petition contesting its validity, and the proceeding appears to have been intended to be plenary; but this petition and the order of the court refusing to admit the will are the only facts disclosed by the printed record. We are compelled to make out the case partly by inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">The subject of nuncupative wills is regulated by sections 19 and 20 of the statute of 29 Chas. II, ch. 3. Section 19-provides that: \u201c No nuncupative will shall be good, where the estate thereby bequeathed shall exceed the value of A30, that is not proven by the oaths of three witnesses (at the least) that were present at the making thereof; nor unless it be proved that testator, at the time of pronouncing the same, did bid the persons present, or some of them, to bear witness that such was his will, or to that effect; nor unless such nuncupative will were made in the time of the-last sickness of the deceased, and in the house of his or their habitation or dwelling, or where he or she have been a resident for the space of ten days or more next before the making of such will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Section 20 provides: \u201cThat after six months after the speaking of the pretended testamentary words, no testimony shall be received to prove any will nuncupative, except the said testimony, or the substance thereof, were committed to writing within six days after the making, of said will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The only testimony that appears by this record to have been produced at the hearing in the Orphans\u2019 Court was the following paper:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201cBushrod W. Askins departed this life on the 18th day of April, 1890, aged 85 years, at the residence of Mrs. Louisa Shoemaker, in the County of Washington, District of Columbia; that several times before his death he spoke about making a will, and stated how he wanted it written. He said he devised all his property, which was personal, to those he knew best, viz: William Shoemaker, Harriet Shoemaker, Edith Shoemaker and Mary Balanger, to be equally divided between them, and William Shoemaker to be executor of his estate; he was at the time of speaking the above words of sound and disposing mind and memory, and every way capable of knowing what he was saying. He stated that he had distant relatives, but as they never came to see him, and appeared to care nothing about him, he would not leave them anything, except Mary Balanger. He was a bachelor, never having been married, and lived in the Shoemaker family for 58 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u201c Witnesses: William Shoemaker, Harriet Shoemaker, Edith Shoemaker, Mary Balanger, 1024 Congress street; William Jackson; John G. Bohrer, Bethesda; George W. Balanger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">This paper was filed on April 22, 1890, four days after the death of the alleged testator; the caveat was filed on the 18th of July, 1890; but the case was not heard on the testimony until the 24th of October, 1890, about five days after the lapse of six months after the death of Askins. At that hearing no testimony establishing the fact of a nuncupative will could be received, unless it had been reduced to writing within the time limited by the 20th section of the statute; and it does not appear by any affirmative statement of the record that the proponent of the alleged will either possessed or offered to produce any other testimony so written than the paper above recited. If that writing did not show that all of the conditions necessary to the validity of a nuncupative will had been complied with the proponent could not prove such compliance by testimony which had not been reduced to writing within the prescribed time. The only question, then, which could be considered by the Orphans\u2019 Court was, whether the writing set forth in the record showed the necessary facts. The statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>requires proof that at the time of-pronouncing the alleged testamentary words, the testator \u201c did bid the persons present, or some of them, to bear witness that such was his will,\u201d and proof that such nuncupative will was made \u201cin the time of the last sickness of the deceased;\u201d and neither of these facts is. stated in the writing submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The court therefore had no proof of these necessary facts, and it must be assumed that there was no proof of them which it could at that time receive. The written testimony which it could receive, and did actually admit, was. defective as to another essential matter. The paper before us states that \u201c several times before his death, he (the deceased) <em>spoke about making a will </em>and stated <em>how he wanted it </em>written.\u201d Instead of showing that he intended to be understood to announce a. will as then and there finally made, this .statement indicates-the contrary, and shows ari intention to make a will in writing-at some other time. In other words, it is shown by the proponent himself that the statements of the deceased did not-constitute the making of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">We observe that the judgment of the Orphans\u2019 Court seems-to describe the paper in question as if it was offered as the-written will of the deceased. Although inartificial, this form, appears to have been commonly used in the Maryland practice under this statute. It sufficiently expresses the fact that: alleged announcements of the deceased did not constitute his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b33-7\">Mr. Justice Montgomery</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">I am not able to fully agree to the conclusion which has been reached by my brethren in this case, and I will briefly state my reasons why.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The memoranda quoted by Mr. Justice James, .which was-filed by <em>someone, </em>and which purports to be a <em>statement, </em>or an abstract of a statement of what deceased is alleged-to have said in the <em>presence </em>of witnesses in regard to the disposition of his property, seems to have been treated throughout the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ceedings as the alleged <em>will </em>itself, and when the matter came on for hearing in the Orphans\u2019 Court, instead of proceeding to hear the evidence, the \u201c decree\u201d indicates that the presiding justice simply considered whether or not <em>that paper </em>should be admitted to \u201c probate and record * * * as the nuncupative will of the said Bushrod W. Askins,\u201d and very properly decided that it should not be so admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">Of course everybody understands that a nuncupative will is one which is \u201c made by word, or without writing.\u201d \u201cAn oral will made by the testator <em>in extremis.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Manifestly it was not the intention of the statute which has been quoted by Mr. Justice James to require that the will <em>itself </em>should be reduced to writing, and yet for some (to me) wholly unaccountable reason, learned authors and commentators have declared that the statute did \u201c enact * * * that no nuncupative will shall be proved by the witnesses after six months from the making, unless <em>it </em>were put in writing, within six days.\u201d 2 Black. Com., 501; 4 Kent. Com., 517; 2 Bouv:, L. D., 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">These authorities are so eminent that I should not venture to intimate that they were in error were it a question of construction or of legal judgment, or indeed <em>anything </em>beyond what it is, \u2014 a simple accurate reading of the words of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">-If, then, the statute means, as we all agree that it does, that the will itself need not be written, and that in case the hearing occurs within six months after the speaking of the \u201c pretended testamentary words,\u201d <em>any </em>witness may depose, even though nothing of his testimony, or of its substance, has been \u201ccommitted to writing,\u201d and if, as we also all agree, in case such hearing take place after the expiration of such six months; then any witness whose testimony or <em>substance </em>of which was within the six days \u201c committed to writing,\u201d may testify to <em>such facts </em>so committed, whether such testimony or substance be in one or any number of different papers, and whether filed before such hearing or <em>not, </em>then I am sure it follows that whenever such hearing comes on the propounder should be allowed an opportunity to present his <em>testimony, </em>and <em>all </em>his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u25a0competent material testimony, and if he fails to establish the fact that the deceased said or did that which amounts to the making of a nuncupative will, it should be so decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">The record and files which we have' before us in this case \u25a0do not indicate that any testimony whatever was heard or offered, but as said above, that the <em>paper </em>itself was treated as the alleged will, and on its face, it clearly failing to exhibit such facts as would establish the making of a nuncupative will, the decree was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In my opinion the cause should go back to the Orphans\u2019 \u25a0Court, and the propounder of this alleged nuncupative will be afforded an opportunity to present his <em>testimony, </em>if he have \u25a0any, and <em>all </em>of it which is under the statute competent, and whether its substance be or be not on file in the case. We \u25a0are all agreed, however, that after the expiration of the six months, no witness can be heard unless his testimony or its .substance were committed to writing within the six days.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
