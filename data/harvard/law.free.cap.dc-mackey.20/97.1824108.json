The statute, Section 772 of the \u201cRevised Statutes relating to the District of Columbia,\u201d provides that \u201cany party aggrieved by any order, judgment or decree, made or pronounced, at any special term, may, <em>if the same involve the merits of the action, </em>appeal therefrom to the General Term,\u201d and there is no other statute and no rule of Court affecting this question. Now, does this order of denial involve the \u201cmerits of the action ? \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We think that it plainly does not. We are therefore not required to determine whether the order sought to be appealed from was a \u201cdiscretionary\u201d one, or when or how such an order may, if ever, be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We are all of opinion that no authority exists for an appeal in such a case as this, and therefore we can neither affirm nor' reverse the action of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\n<em>The appeal must be dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
