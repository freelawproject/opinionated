There is nothing to sustain such a contention except the English rule, which whenever cited is coupled with the explanation; that such rule will yield \u201cto a very faint glimpse of a different intention.\u201d 2d Jarman on Wills, 1st Am. Ed. 111.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-13\">American courts have ignored the English rule. The Supreme Court of Connecticut, rejecting the said rule, say \u201c the English rule, <em>that referring to children is the same as if they were individually named in the will, </em>in view of the exceptions which so easily set it aside, <em>is of little practical importance, </em>and it <em>does not seem to have been recognised in this State, </em>although cases have been discussed and decided where its application would have been controlling.\u201d Raymond <em>vs. </em>Hillhouse, 45 Conn. 474.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b553-14\">And the court, continuing, say, \u2018 \u2018 In Tallcott <em>vs. </em>Tallcott, 39 Conn. 186, the devise was to the children of one Mrs. Burke, deceased; and <em>though the names of each of the children were given, </em>yet it was held that they took as a class, and <em>not per </em>capita.\u201d Id. 475.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>The Supreme Court of New York, disregarding said rule, say, \u201cthe rule referred to has, in modern times, been applied with reluctance by some courts, because it had become a rule of property, and by others out of deference to its supposed authority; but, in many, if not in all cases, with open protest, while by others it has been <em>wholly rejected.\u201d </em>Ferrer <em>vs. </em>Pyne 81 N.Y.284 (citing Mintern\u2019s Appeal 40 Penn. 111,) and Raymond <em>vs. </em>Hillhouse, 45 Conn. 474.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-4\">It is reasonable to assume that in such cases, affection induces the bequest, and, also, that other things being equal, the ties of affection are stronger in proportion to the degree of kinship.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-5\">Following this reasoning, it has been well observed that \u201cthe taking <em>per stirpes always presupposes an inequality of relationship.\u201d </em>. Roper on Regacies 1st vol. (2d Am. Ed.,) 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-6\">In the case at bar, it is admitted, by stipulation of record, that the complainants are only the <em>g rand-nephews </em>and the <em>grand-nieces </em>of testatrix, while the defendants Atkinson and Jones are respectively <em>niece and nephew </em>of testatrix, and the defendant Thornton is the husband of a <em>niece </em>of testatrix.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b554-7\">The principle above referred to has been adopted by the Supreme Court of New York, and, that court, in disposing of a case in which were circumstances similar to those of the case at bar, in holding that the distribution should be <em>per </em>stripes, say that, 1 \u2018a contrary construction would be at variance with the natural disposition of mankind.\u201d Ferrer <em>vs. </em>Pyne 81 N.

Atkinson, and the wife of Thornton who was an invalid and incapable of managing her affairs) their names (as set forth in the will) their relations to others by marriage (the marriage of her niece Annie to Thornton) the death of some (the death of her niece, Ella M. Turley) and with these incidents before her, making a distribution of her estate. The living nephew and niece are named hy her (as set forth in will) while the children of the niece who is dead (the complainants in this case) are spoken of <em>not by name-, </em>but <em>as the children of </em>her late niece, Ella M. Turley; evidently given to them the place as recipients of her bounty, which Ella M. Turley, if living, would have filled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-4\">She designates the children of Ella M.

The Supreme Court of Connecticut in holding that the distribution should be <em>per stirpes, </em>laid stress upon a feature incident to the case at bar. In that case, the will having disclosed that certain of the legatees were the special objects of testatrix\u2019 bounty, the court, in referring to the legatees thus specially favored, say \u201cwe think it improbable that he (testator) intended to make their shares as small as any one of his nineteen great-nephews and great-nieces.\u201d Raymond <em>vs. </em>Hillhouse, 45 Conn. 474.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b555-6\">In the case at the bar the defendant Jennie B. Atkinson, (apart from the money bequest which was in aggregate $6,000) was the object of special favor of testatrix, as is manifest from the provisions of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaE\">Passing from consideration of the special favor shown to Jennie B. Atkinson in the bequest to her of the portrait of testatrix\u2019 father; replete as such bequest is with favor immeasurable in money value; we will consider the bequest to said legatee of the furniture and wearing apparel of testatrix; and, thereof, it may be assumed that the apparel and furni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>ture of one who could afford to keep <em>$6,000 </em>idle in bank are of sufficient value to be regarded as a special favor to the legatee, and, in that regard, of the importance of the construction of the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-4\">In the case of Raymond <em>vs. </em>Hillhouse, <em>supra </em>where, as in this case, it was contended that the use by testator of the words \u201c <em>to be equally divided \u2019 \u2019 among the children of &amp;c. </em>was equivalent to naming them individually; the court in repudiating such theory, say \u201cNeither do the words to be divided equally among them necessarily import a division of the property among individuals, for, they apply just as readily and appropriately to a division among classes.\u201d Raymond <em>vs. </em>Hillhouse, <em>supra, </em>473. Reason, principle and precedent indicate that the complainants take <em>per stirpes, </em>and not <em>per capita.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b556-5\">M. W. A. Johnston for complainants (appellees):</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-6\">A gift to \u2018 \u2018 children \u201d or to \u201c grand children \u201d or to any class described by its members related to the testator, is a gift to them individually. This is especially true when the technical words, \u201cto be equally divided among them,\u201d are employed. 45 Conn. 468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-7\">Regatees will take <em>per capita </em>and not <em>per stirpes </em>where it is apparent that upon comparing the various clauses of a will that such was clearly the intention of the testator. Re Verplank, 91 N. Y. 439.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-8\">The general rule is, that where several persons are named in a legacy with the children of another, they will all take per capita an equal share, (but where they, the children, are <em>several times mentioned as a class in other </em>clauses of the <em>same </em>will and equality requires that they should be so treated in the clause in question, they will- be decreed to take <em>per stirpes). </em>3 Jones Bq. 100.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b556-9\">The rule of distribution as laid down in Powell on Devises Vol. 2 p. 331, says: \u201cIt is now to be observed that where a gift is made to the children of several persons whether it be to the children of A, B, or to the children of A, and the children of B, they take <em>per capita </em>not <em>per </em>stirpes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>No distinction can be taken between real and personal estate.

Eq., 437; 4 Ired., 244.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-6\">The word \u2018 \u2018heirs\u2019 \u2019 when used in a devise (there being no other words to control the presumption), the legal inference is that it is <em>nomen </em>collectivum, that it designates the persons whom the law appoints to succeed to the inheritance in cases of intestacy, and that legatees thus designated take by representation and not in their own right. Where he says, that a devise to heirs, whether to ones own, or the heirs of a third person designated not only the persons who are to take, but the manner and proportion in which they are to take.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-7\">When there are no words to control the presumption, the law presumes the intention to be that they take as heirs would take by the rules of descent. Although a different intention may be inferred and a different rule of distribution may be applied where the word \u201cchildren\u201d is used instead of \u201cheirs,\u201d and in the absence of any thing to control the division, it may in such cases be <em>per capita. </em>In all cases, it is believed without exception, in which it is held, that .where a gift is made to one person standing in a certain relation to the testator, and to the children or heirs of another person standing in the same relation to him, the beneficiaries take <em>per </em>capita, it will be found that the words \u201cto be equally divided\u201d or \u201c in equal shares,\u201d or words of similar import, have also been employed in the will, and have been deemed by the courts of controlling significance in ascertaining and determining the intent of the testator. 46 Barb., 81 and 82.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-8\">A testator directed that his property should be divided equally \u201cbetween my wife M, and my daughters I and E.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b557-9\">Held, that \u2018 \u2018between\u2019 \u2019 meant \u2018 \u2018among\u2019 \u2019 and that the intention was that the estate should be divided into three equal shares. Hicks\u2019 Estate, 8 Pa. Co. Ct. Rep, 30.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The mere grouping of children into a class as the children of A or B, instead of naming them individually does not alter the rights of each. 39 Barb., 172.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b558-4\">The result of the authorities would seem to accord with what is correct upon principle, viz., that in a gift to relations (whether the testator has added the words, \u201cequally to be divided\u201d or not) the distribution among the relations within the statute must be made <em>per capita </em>and not <em>per stirpes. </em>Lewin on Trusts, 843.

Atkinson my clothes and what furniture I may leave; to Miss Maggie Mitchell, of Georgetown, my books, pictures and little fancy articles; my watch to Bolling Thornton; silver napkin ring and fork to little Mamie Cobb, daughter of Norvell Cobb. What money may be in Johnson\u2019s Bank to be equally divided between Jennie B. Atkinson, Paul Jones, P. R. W. Thorntoti and the children of my late niece, Ella M. Turley; G. R. Atkinson to hold Paul <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Jones\u2019 in trust for him, paying him a certain sum per month; what he thinks will do for his support. Ann Jonbs.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">\u201cI wish my large shawl and white spread given to Mrs. Mary H. Brown, of Georgetown, D. C. A. J ones .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">\u201cIf my birds are living to be given to Miss Isa Mitchell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201cMy father\u2019s picture to Jennie B. Atkinson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The complainants, two of whom are infants, suing by their next friend, are the children of Ella M. Turley referred to in the will, and grandnieces of the testatrix. They claim that the testatrix intended that each of them should share equally with the defendants Atkinson, Jones and Thornton in the money left in the bank; in other words, that each of them should have one-eighth thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The answer shows that the defendant Atkinson and the wife of defendant Thornton are nieces, and that the defendant Paul Jones is a nephew of the testatrix; and claims that it was the intent of her last will that each of them should have one-fourth of the money in question, and that the children of her other niece should stand in the place of their deceased mother, and should together take one fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The question to be determined is whether, ,in the mind of this testatrix-, the children of her niece Ella were a <em>group, </em>succeeding to her place, or were thought of by her as individuals, in j ust the same way that she thought of her niece Atkinson and nephew Jones. And it seems that, before we decide this question, we have to consider a preliminary question, namely, whether we are bound by the authority of any judicial rule by which the intention of a testator in such provisions is to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">Ever since the statute of wills was enacted the courts have said that the intention of the testator was the one subject of inquiry, and was to control, provided his intent was lawful; and then they proceeded to gather from interpretations and constructions already made in what seemed to them to be analogous cases, positive rules by which the intention of each later testator must be determined. The effect of this has been that each testator was obliged to mean what other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>testators had meant in what was adjudged to be a like case. To a certain extent this method was inevitable. For example, the courts must presume that a testator uses, in the sense established by common usage, the words of the language in which he expresses his intention. On the same ground it must be presumed that he uses in their technical sense phrases which have an established technical meaning. The presumption in both cases is that everybody uses language in its common sense; and it is reasonable that a rule to that effect should be stated as a judicial rule of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">But in England, and in some of the States in this country, the courts have gone quite beyond this necessary process. When they found that the testator had been held in previous cases to have intended a certain distribution of his property by a certain provision, they held that it was a rule that all testators had that intention when they employed similar language. It might be that the circumstances would suggest that the same expressions had in view a different result in a particular case, and that the courts had a shrewd perception of a different intention in a particular case, and would have been guided by that perception if there had been no rule for ascertaining the intention; but the effect has been that the testator\u2019s intention has been determined for him according to the general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We can readily understand that a judicial discussion of one will should throw light upon the construction of another, and suggest methods of inquiry and of reasoning which would be applicable in a new case; but we do not perceive that earlier interpretations can have an authority which forces upon a later testator an intention which he may not have had. Other courts have felt that the formulation of rules for ascertaining particular intentions has been carried too far, and have sought to free themselves from an obligation to follow them in disregard of what they believed to be the personal intent of a particular testator. This indisposition to measure intention by an alleged rule has been shown in reference to the very questions now before us. In Raymond <em>vs. </em>Hillhouse, 45 Conn., 474, the court said: \u201cThe English rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>that referring to children is the same as if they were individually named in the will, in view of the exceptions which so easily set it aside, is of little practical importance, and it does not seem to have been recognized in this State, although cases have been discussed and decided where its application would have been controlling.\u201d In Ferrer <em>vs. </em>Payn, 81 N. Y., 284, the court said: \u201cThe rule referred to has, in modern times, been applied with reluctance by some courts, because it had become a rule of property, and by others out of deference to its supposed author^; but in many, if not in all cases, with open protest, while by others it has been wholly rejected.\u201d Mintern\u2019s Appeal, 40 Pa. St., 111, 114, was one of the cases in which the rule was wholly rejected, or rather was simply ignored without being discussed. The bequest was 1 \u2018share and share alike among the children of my brother Adam and the children of my brother Martin and to my sister Barbara.\u201d The court said: \u201cIf he meant that his nephews should each be equal to his sister\u2019s, the word <em>each </em>would have made his meaning clear,.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">If the question whether the old rule is of binding authority were to be decided by weight of authority, we should not feel bound to conform to it; but apart from the weight of authority, we conceive that the intent of such a provision as this is not the proper subject of a <em>rule </em>of interpretation. We feel at liberty, therefore, to consider the circumstances of this bequest, as well as its language. It is manifest that family affection was the controlling impulse of this bequest, and this element is to be considered in determining what the testatrix intended to do in accordance with that motive. It is, on the one hand, consistent with that motive that the children of a niece whom the testatrix remembered with affection should be placed in their mother\u2019s stead, and on the other, improbable that the shares of the beneficiaries should increase as their consanguinity became more remote. At the same time equal division wasqust as applicable to <em>the objects </em>of her care, if we suppose three of those objects to have been individuals and the fourth a group, as it would be if we suppose all the parties to have been intended individually. It may be said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>further that, while it is not probable that the testatrix would enlarge her gift as the kinship of the recipients receded, it is not natural, and therefore not probable, that those who remained nearest should suffer diminution of her regard by the appearance of more remote kindred. In the absence of distinct expressions to the contrary, we think that these considerations are a safer guide in determining what the testatrix meant by an equal division between her nearest kindred and the children of one who had stood in the same degree, than the English rule would be. We are of opinion that'the kindly aunt actually did mean what was most natural that she should mean, if her words are fairly consistent with such an intention. Inasmuch as it was natural that her near kindred should retain their places in her regard after their sister Ella had departed, and the language of her will is not inconsistent with an intention that they should do so, we think it was her intention that equality of division 'was attained by giving them undiminished the shares of nieces and nephew, and by giving to the children of the departed niece their mother\u2019s share. The decree will be that the complainants are entitled to receive together one-fourth part of the money in bank, and that the defendants are entitled to receive three-fourths thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\n<em>The decree is reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
