The district court sentenced her to a term of fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-17\">Smith advances three arguments on appeal. First, she contends the district court erred by admitting expert testimony that she claims exceeded the scope of the government\u2019s pretrial disclosure. Second, Smith challenges the sufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence, arguing that the district court erred when it denied her motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. Finally, Smith contends the district court erred in rejecting one of her proposed jury instructions. We conclude that the district court committed no reversible error and that sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">On appeal from a criminal conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Herder, 594 </em>F.3d 352, 358 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">At about 3:00 a.m. on October 31, 2009, Amber Howard was driving south from Maryland into the District of Columbia along the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, a federal area maintained by the National Park Service. As she approached D.C., she saw a car\u2019s lights coming toward her from the northbound side of the highway. She watched that car drive over the median, flip several times, and crash into the highway\u2019s southbound-side embankment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">Howard pulled over and dialed 911, then ran to check on the accident. She approached the car and heard a woman screaming for help. As Howard tried to indicate that help was on the way, the woman, appellant Kristen Smith, exited the wrecked vehicle through its rear passenger window and walked toward Howard. As Smith approached, Howard heard her say: \u201cI never drink. I never drink. I didn\u2019t want to go out. I never drink. I only had one drink.\u201d Howard also saw the arm of Smith\u2019s passenger, Jabari Outz, hanging out the car window.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-8\">While waiting for the police to arrive, a distressed and disoriented Smith repeatedly wandered onto the highway, forcing Howard to pull her out of the road several times. Howard also smelled the odor of \u201cwhite liquor\u201d emanating from Smith. \u201cWhite liquor,\u201d as Howard explained at trial, is alcohol such as vodka, gin, or tequila, and in Howard\u2019s experience as a bartender, has a smell distinct from dark liquor or beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-10\">United States Park Police Officer Gary Hatch arrived on the scene at about 3:30 a.m. and found Smith\u2019s car on its side, leaning against a stone wall. By this time, Outz had been pronounced dead on the scene by emergency medical services. Officer Hatch, who had some experience as an accident reconstructionist, analyzed the scene and determined that Smith\u2019s car had left the northbound roadway, flipped after crossing the median, and crashed into the stone wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-11\">Smith was taken to Prince George\u2019s County Hospital, where she submitted to a routine blood test.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> U.S. Park Police Officer David Lorde was dispatched to stay with Smith while she received treatment in the emergency room. He testified that Smith was writhing in bed and making unsolicited statements, three of which he recalled in particular: \u201cDon\u2019t ever drink and drive,\u201d \u201cI just hope he\u2019s okay,\u201d and \u201cLock me up and throw away the key.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-12\">Some time later, U.S. Park Police Officer Ernest Patrick arrived at the emergency room to oversee a second blood draw, which was conducted at 5:47 a.m. The blood sample from this draw, which showed a blood alcohol content of .09 grams per 100 milliliters, was furnished to Lucas Zarwell, the Deputy Chief Toxicologist at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-14\">The government charged Smith in a single-count indictment for homicide during the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(a). The underlying unlawful act was an alleged violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2), which provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>\u201c[operating or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle is prohibited while ... [t]he alcohol concentration in the operator\u2019s blood or breath is 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood[.]\u201d Notably, the government chose not to charge Smith with a violation of 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(1), which prohibits operating a motor vehicle while \u201c[u]nder the influence of alcohol ... to a degree that renders the operator incapable of safe operation[.]\u201d Unlike the \u201cper se\u201d \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) violation, \u00a7 4.23(a)(1) does not require the government to prove the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">Deputy Chief Toxicologist Zarwell testified as an expert witness on the results of the 5:47 a.m. blood sample, stating that it contained .09 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood. Over the defense\u2019s objection, Zarwell also gave generalized testimony about how the human body metabolizes alcohol, including the average duration of alcohol absorption and rate of elimination. He indicated that typically people continue to absorb alcohol for \u201cabout 30 minutes\u201d after they stop drinking and that females eliminate alcohol at an average rate of about .017 grams per 100 milliliters per hour. J.A. 120-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Prior to cross-examination, Smith renewed her objection to Zarwell\u2019s statements on alcohol metabolization, moving to strike this line of testimony on the ground that it exceeded the scope of the pretrial notice provided by the government. Pointing to a series of letters exchanged between counsel before trial, the defense charged that the government had represented that Zarwell\u2019s testimony would be limited to the results of Smith\u2019s 5:47 a.m. blood test. The defense argued that without explicit notice that Zarwell would be testifying about metabolization rates more generally, it was unprepared to effectively cross-examine Zarwell and unable to realistically procure a rebuttal witness. Smith did not move for a continuance or otherwise indicate that she wanted time to procure her own expert witness regarding blood alcohol absorption rates, although the court indicated that she could call her own witness in response to Zarwell\u2019s broadened testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">The district court denied the motion to strike, holding that the government\u2019s disclosures were sufficient. Zarwell\u2019s generic testimony, the court explained, was within his area of expertise and served as necessary background to his testimony on Smith\u2019s blood test result. Nor did the court find the admission of Zarwell\u2019s testimony to be unduly prejudicial, since Smith had the opportunity to cross-examine him and to find her own toxicology expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-9\">The district court also rejected the defense\u2019s alternative contention that Zarwell\u2019s testimony on generic human alcohol metabolization was irrelevant as to Smith\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of the accident. Even though Zarwell had not offered an opinion as to Smith\u2019s blood alcohol content at 3:00 a.m., the court reasoned that the jury was not prohibited from making inferences on that issue based on Zarwell\u2019s generic metabolization testimony and the results of the 5:47 a.m. test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">During cross-examination, Zarwell confirmed that his blood alcohol analysis showed the quantity of alcohol in Smith\u2019s blood only at the time of the 5:47 a.m. test, not beforehand. He also conceded, notwithstanding his earlier testimony about typical alcohol absorption and elimination rates, that those rates are highly variable among individuals. Zarwell stated that although he would have been able to conduct an individualized analysis of Smith\u2019s absorption and elimination rates, he had not done so. Zarwell also confirmed that he had not performed a retrograde extrapolation of Smith\u2019s blood alcohol level at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>time of the crash and did not offer any opinion about her blood alcohol level at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">At the close of the government\u2019s case in chief, Smith moved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, arguing that the evidence produced by the government was insufficient to show her blood alcohol level exceeded .08 at the time of the accident, almost three hours before the blood test. The district court denied the motion, concluding that based upon the 5:47 a.m. blood test result, the evidence of Smith\u2019s erratic driving and behavior, and the statements she made at the hospital, a rational jury could reasonably infer that she had violated \u00a7 4.23(a)(2). Smith offered no evidence and renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal, which the district court again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">At the charge conference, Smith requested several supplemental jury instructions, one of which proposed to instruct the jury, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1018-6\">As you heard, the rates of alcohol absorption and elimination can vary between persons. Therefore, the practice of extrapolating a person\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of driving from a test of a blood sample taken at a later time requires careful consideration of many factors.... I instruct you that you should not attempt to extrapolate the blood alcohol of the accused at the time of driving from the result of a blood test from samples taken at a later time unless sufficient evidence has been presented to you with regard to the aforementioned factors.... You may not infer from the test of defendant\u2019s blood samples taken at 5:47 a.m. on October 31, 2009, in this case \u2014 without more, as I have described above \u2014 what defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of driving around 3:00 a.m. might have been.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">S.J.A. 3; J.A. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">The district court rejected this instruction. It explained that the jury already knew that there was no piece of evidence, standing alone, showing that Smith\u2019s blood alcohol content exceeded .08 at the time of the crash \u2014 an element the existing jury instructions already established was essential to the crime. But because there were other facts in the record from which the jury might reasonably infer the \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) violation, the court allowed the jury to draw those inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-11\">The jury returned a guilty verdict on the sole count of the indictment. Prior to sentencing, Smith renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal and moved for a new trial. The district court denied both motions and imposed its sentence. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">The issues before us are (1) whether the district court erred in permitting the government\u2019s toxicology expert to testify about generic alcohol metabolization rates; (2) whether Smith was entitled to a judgment of acquittal due to insufficient evidence; and (3) whether the district court erred in refusing to give Smith\u2019s requested jury instruction concerning blood alcohol level extrapolation. We consider each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-15\">Smith contends the district court erred in permitting the government\u2019s toxicology expert to testify about generic alcohol metabolization rates. We review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Basham, </em>561 F.3d 302, 325 (4th Cir.2009), and generally will not reverse absent a show<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>ing of prejudice, <em>United States v. Durham, </em>319 F.2d 590, 592 (4th Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">Smith argues that she was unfairly surprised by toxicologist Lucas Zarwell\u2019s testimony regarding average human alcohol metabolization rates because this testimony exceeded the scope of the pretrial notice provided by the government pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 16. As she did at trial, Smith points to the series of letters exchanged between counsel during discovery that comprised the parties\u2019 Rule 16 communications. J.A. 351-61. The government\u2019s initial written disclosure included Zarwell\u2019s <em>curriculum vitae </em>and named him as the likely toxicology expert. In response, Smith\u2019s counsel wrote: \u201cIt is assumed from your discovery response that the expert evidence would be limited to testimony ... that [Smith\u2019s 5:47 a.m.] blood sample revealed an ethanol level of .09%.\u201d J.A. 359. The government\u2019s reply confirmed that Smith\u2019s characterization was \u201ccorrect as to the toxicology expert testimony[.]\u201d J.A. 361. Smith argues that since Zarwell\u2019s testimony was not confined to the results of the blood test, as the letters suggested it would be, the district court abused its discretion by admitting it. As a result, Smith claims she was unable to effectively cross-examine Zarwell on the intricacies of \u201crelation-back\u201d science<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or prepare her own expert to rebut Zarwell\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">The government echoes the district court\u2019s justification for admitting the evidence, arguing that Zarwell gave no testimony about Smith\u2019s personal alcohol elimination rate and that Zarwell\u2019s testimony concerning typical human alcohol metabolization was general background information within the scope of both the notice and his expertise. It notes that Smith never objected to Zarwell\u2019s qualifications as a toxicology expert and that, having sat down with Zarwell before trial for an in-person interview, Smith\u2019s counsel had ample opportunity to prepare for cross-examination. Finally, the government asserts that even assuming error, Smith has failed to demonstrate how she suffered any prejudice as a result of the testimony or the wording of the government\u2019s pretrial disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(G) requires the government to give, at the defendant\u2019s request, a written summary of any expert testimony that it intends to use during its case-in-chief at trial. This summary \u201cmust describe the witness\u2019s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness\u2019s qualifications.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G). As the rule\u2019s Advisory Committee Notes explain, Rule 16(a)(1)(G) \u201cis intended to minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony ... and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert\u2019s testimony through focused cross-examination.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(G) Advisory Comm. Note to the 1993 amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-10\">On the one hand, we do not fault Smith for taking issue with the government\u2019s less than fulsome pretrial summary of Zarwell\u2019s planned expert testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>other hand, consistent with the government\u2019s Rule 16 disclosure, Zarwell declined to offer any opinion on Smith\u2019s personal metabolization rate, and did not attempt to extrapolate what her blood alcohol content might have been at 3:00 a.m. And although full disclosure by the government would have .been more in keeping with the spirit of Rule 16, we think it fair to characterize Zarwell\u2019s testimony on typical human alcohol absorption and elimination rates as generic background information that fell within the scope of Zarwell\u2019s expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">In any event, we need not decide whether the district court erred in concluding that the Government did not violate Rule 16(a)(1)(G), because any error was harmless. In addition to showing the district court\u2019s error, a defendant seeking reversal under Rule 16(a)(1)(G) must also \u201cdemonstrate prejudice resulting from the district court\u2019s decision to admit the contested testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Buchanan, </em>604 F.3d 517; 526 (8th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Charley, </em>189 F.3d 1251, 1261-62 (10th Cir.1999) (affirming a district court decision despite a Rule 16 violation, due to absence of prejudice to defendant).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">Smith fails to make that showing here. Although Smith claims that the government\u2019s incomplete Rule 16 disclosure prevented her from effectively cross-examining Zarwell on the intricacies of relation-back science, Zarwell never offered any such evidence. Further, Smith interviewed Zarwell prior to the trial, and extensively cross-examined him at trial regarding the numerous factors that determine an individual\u2019s blood alcohol absorption rate, the nuances of his generalized direct testimony, and whether it was possible that a person\u2019s blood alcohol level would continue to increase for a few hours after consumption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And to the extent Smith disagreed with Zarwell\u2019s testimony regarding general metabolization rates, the district court gave her ample opportunity to call her own rebuttal expert. Smith simply chose not to pursue that avenue or ask for a continuance to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-8\">For these reasons, we conclude that the district court did not commit reversible error in permitting Zarwell\u2019s expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-10\">We next consider Smith\u2019s argument that she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal because the <em>government </em>offered insufficient evidence to support her conviction. We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a defendant\u2019s Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.2006). On an appeal challenging the sufficiency of evidence, we assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and' the jury\u2019s verdict must stand unless we determine that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Young, </em>609 F.3d 348, 355 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>Smith concedes that the government presented evidence that she was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. She also concedes that the government\u2019s evidence established that her blood contained .09 grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters at 5:47 a.m., nearly three hours after the crash. Smith contends, however, that the government did not offer sufficient evidence upon which a rational finder of fact could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that, <em>at the time she was operating her vehicle, </em>her blood alcohol concentration was .08 percent or more, as a 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) \u201cper se\u201d violation requires. Absent such direct evidence, Smith insists, she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-5\">The government responds that its evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. It argues that the fact that Smith had a blood alcohol content exceeding .08 percent within a reasonable period of the time after driving sufficed to show a violation of the \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) \u201cper se\u201d offense, without any need for relation-back evidence, which it argues is unreliable and impractical to obtain. While acknowledging that \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) does require a showing that a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content exceeded .08 at the time of driving, the government suggests it would be absurd to hold that the \u201cper se\u201d offense requires the government to prove precisely the blood alcohol level at the time of driving. Instead, the government asks us to hold that a blood alcohol test taken within a reasonable time after driving satisfies the \u201cper se\u201d statute. Finally, the government points to other evidence supporting the jury\u2019s finding that Smith violated \u00a7 4.23(a)(2): evidence that Smith was driving recklessly, testimony that she was behaving erratically and that she smelled of \u201cwhite liquor,\u201d and statements she made at the scene of the accident and at the hospital about her own drinking and driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">Section 4.23(a)(2) provides that \u201c[o]perating or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle is prohibited while ... [t]he alcohol concentration in the operator\u2019s blood or breath is 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood[.]\u201d Unlike some comparable state statutes, \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) sets no explicit time limit for the taking of a blood alcohol test that may be used at trial to show a defendant\u2019s alcohol concentration. <em>Compare </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2), <em>with </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-268.2A (setting a three-hour limit between \u201cthe offense\u201d and the taking of the sample), <em>and </em>Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 10-303(a)(2) (setting a two-hour limit after the person has been \u201capprehended\u201d). Section 4.23(a)(2) is also silent as to the regulation\u2019s proof requirements, and we have found no published authority from our sister circuits on this question, which has become the subject of some debate among other lower courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Some courts have interpreted \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) to mean that the government must directly prove a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time he or she was driving, often through relation-back testimony. For example, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada has twice refused to find later-administered breath tests sufficient to support a \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) conviction. <em>See United States v. French, </em>No. 2:08-MJ-726-GWF, 2010 WL 1633456 (D.Nev. Apr. 10, 2010) (unpublished); <em>United States v. Stout, </em>No. 2:09-MJ-00146-GWF, 2009 WL 5217047 (D.Nev. Dec. 28, 2009) (unpublished). As the <em>Stout </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1021-9\">Unlike some state DUI laws, 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) does not make it unlawful to have a blood alcohol level above the legal limit within a specified time after operating a motor vehicle. Nor does it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>contain a presumption regarding the person\u2019s blood alcohol at the time he was operating or in physical control of a vehicle based on subsequently obtained breath or blood test results. Because there is no presumption based on the test results, the Government is required to prove that a defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content was above the legal limit at the time of operating the vehicle and not merely at the time the breath or blood sample was taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">2010 WL 1633456, at *6. Courts interpreting \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) to require relation-back evidence have also noted the availability to the government of proceeding under \u00a7 4.23(a)(1), which has no blood alcohol content requirement. <em>See United States v. Wight, </em>884 F.Supp. 400, 402 (D.Colo.1995). By choosing to proceed on the \u201cper se\u201d violation, the <em>Wight </em>court explained, the government</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-5\">had an obligation under the regulation to establish the alcohol concentration at the time of driving or actual physical control. The test result at 8:27 a.m. was insufficient, in and of itself, to establish what Defendant\u2019s concentration was at 6:15 a.m., or even at 7:00 a.m. Once [the government] chose to proceed on the \u201cper se\u201d violation, it had to present qualified evidence that \u201crelated back\u201d the test results to the time of driving or actual physical control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-7\">Meanwhile, other courts dealing with similar \u201cper se\u201d statutes have held that relation-back testimony is unnecessary to prove the offense. And where, as here, those statutes impose no time limit on the blood alcohol test, courts have also regularly found that violations may be established as long as the government produces evidence of blood alcohol levels within a reasonable time after driving. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Colturi, </em>448 Mass. 809, 864 N.E.2d 498, 500 (2007); <em>State v. McGowan, </em>332 Mont. 490, 139 P.3d 841, 844 (2006); <em>Ransford, </em>583 A.2d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">For example, in a case cited by the district court below, the Montana Supreme Court concluded that a comparable state \u201cper se\u201d statute could not be read literally \u201cto require law enforcement officers to determine a person\u2019s alcohol concentration while driving ..., as it would be impossible for an officer to administer a test while the suspect was driving.\u201d <em>McGowan, </em>139 P.3d at 844. Nor, <em>McGowan </em>concluded, should the government be required to meet what it characterized as the \u201cimpossible burden\u201d of presenting relation-back evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 845. Such extrapolation, the court explained, would require difficult-to-obtain evidence falling within a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent, such as when and in what amounts the defendant consumed alcohol, and whether the defendant had recently consumed any food. <em>Id. </em>Another court, reaching the same conclusion, pointed out that even if the prosecution could obtain this information, \u201cconclusive evidence of the blood alcohol content at the time of driving could still not be offered to the jury ... because the rate of absorption of alcohol varies between individuals.\u201d <em>Ransford, </em>583 A.2d at 190. These courts have concluded that legislatures could not have intended to impose such evidentiary hurdles on the prosecution. <em>Id.; McGowan, </em>139 P.3d at 844-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">We need not decide whether, on its own, a blood alcohol test taken within a \u201creasonable time\u201d after driving can satisfy the proof requirement of \u00a7 4.23(a)(2)\u2019s \u201cper se\u201d offense. Rather, it is enough for us to say that the government may, in some circumstances, establish a \u201cper se\u201d violation without direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content while ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>tually driving and without introduction of relation-back evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">In the instant case, we are satisfied that a rational finder of fact could have determined beyond a reasonable doubt that Smith violated the \u201cper se\u201d regulation. Even if Smith is correct that, standing alone, her 5:47 a.m. blood alcohol result was insufficient to establish the violation, this evidence did not actually stand alone. The government presented myriad other evidence supporting the jury\u2019s conclusion that Smith\u2019s blood alcohol level was over the legal limit while she was driving. Most notably, Zarwell\u2019s unrebutted testimony about typical alcohol absorption durations and elimination rates established that it was extremely unlikely that Smith could have registered a .09 percent blood alcohol content at 5:47 a.m. without having exceeded the .08 percent threshold at the time of the crash nearly three hours earlier.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even accounting for the wide range of individual alcohol metabolization rates to which Zarwell attested, and even assuming that Smith absorbs and eliminates alcohol much more slowly than the average woman, a rational juror could still have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that a \u201cper se\u201d violation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">This is particularly true, as the district court noted, given the abundant other indicia of Smith\u2019s guilt. The evidence established that Smith was driving erratically and that she flipped her car over the highway\u2019s median strip. Howard testified that Smith was behaving erratically, wandering into the road, and that she smelled strongly of \u201cwhite liquor.\u201d Smith also made statements to two witnesses about her own drinking and driving. To be sure, none of this evidence points definitively to Smith\u2019s precise blood alcohol level at the time of the accident. When coupled, however, with the result of the 5:47 a.m. blood alcohol test and Zarwell\u2019s generic metabolization testimony, this evidence could lead a rational juror to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Smith had violated the regulation\u2019s .08 threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Accordingly, we conclude that Smith was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Finally, we address Smith\u2019s contention that the district court erred in refusing to give her requested jury instruction concerning blood alcohol level extrapolation. We review a district court\u2019s decision to give or refuse to give a jury instruction for abuse of discretion, and reverse only when the rejected instruction \u201c(1) was correct; (2) was not substantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury; and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important, that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Passaro, </em>577 F.3d 207, 221 (4th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cMoreover, we do not view a single instruction in isolation; rather we consider whether taken as a whole and in the context of the entire charge, the instructions accurately and fairly state the controlling law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>Smith contends that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that it could not infer her guilt from the result of her 5:47 a.m. blood test, \u201cwithout more.\u201d Absent this instruction, Smith argues, the jury was left to engage in conjecture and speculation about the results of the blood sample and its evidentiary value to the elements of the crime charged. The government responds that the court\u2019s instructions were complete and correct, and that they sufficiently explained to the jury that it could decide whether Smith had a .08 percent or more blood alcohol content at the time of the crash, based on all the evidence it heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give Smith\u2019s proposed instruction, because that instruction was not necessarily correct and, in any event, was \u201csubstantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury.\u201d <em>Passaro, </em>577 F.3d at 221. As the district court noted, Smith\u2019s proposed instruction that the jury could not infer guilt from the 5:47 a.m. blood test, \u201cwithout more,\u201d could easily have led to confusion about what other evidence the jury was allowed to consider. By the same token, the proposed instruction also improperly implied that, beyond the 5:47 a.m. blood test, there was no other evidence supporting an inference of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The district court\u2019s instructions set forth the elements of the crime and made clear the government\u2019s burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the accident Smith\u2019s blood alcohol content was .08 or higher. Even as it recognized that there was no direct evidence that Smith\u2019s blood alcohol content exceeded the .08 threshold while she was driving, the district court rightly concluded that there were facts in the record from which the jury might reasonably infer the violation and instructed the jury that it was free to either make that inference or not. Ultimately, when \u201c[tjaken as a whole and in the context of the entire charge, the instructions accurately and fairly state[d] the controlling law.\u201d <em>Passaro, </em>577 F.3d at 221. As a result, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s proposed instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">In sum, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the toxicologist\u2019s generic testimony on alcohol metabolization. Nor was Smith entitled to judgment of acquittal, because the government\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Smith\u2019s proposed jury instruction. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1016-9\">. Because the government was unable to establish the chain of custody of this blood sample, it did not attempt to introduce any evidence of its blood alcohol results.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1019-7\">. ''Relation-back\u201d science attempts to extrapolate \u2014 or relate back \u2014 the results of a blood alcohol test administered after a person\u2019s arrest to his or her blood alcohol level at the time of operation of the vehicle. <em>See Ransford v.

To be fair, the government\u2019s Rule 16 disclosure should be read in context; it was drafted in part to inform Smith that it would not be introducing the results of the earlier blood alcohol test, but would only be introducing the results of the second test. At trial, the government contended that one reason it sought to elicit Zarwell\u2019s generic testimony regarding blood alcohol absorption was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>Smith\u2019s sole defense. \u2014 articulated during opening statements \u2014 that the toxicology report only reflected Smith\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time it was taken and was Irrelevant to her blood alcohol level at the time of the accident. <em>See United States v. Basic Constr. Co., </em>711 F.2d 570, 574 (4th Cir.1984) (observing that while the practice of permitting evidence in the government's case-in-chief based on arguments made during a defendant's opening statement should be \"discouraged,\u201d it may be harmless where the defendant \"followed through on its articulated defense\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">. Indeed, some of the testimony Smith elicited from Zarwell on cross-examination was favorable to her case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">. As the district court noted and as the government told the jury in its closing argument, there was no evidence that Smith had consumed any alcohol between the time of the accident and the time her blood was drawn. The jury could therefore reasonably infer that any alcohol that appeared in her 5:47 a.m. blood sample had been in her system at the time she was operating the vehicle, and that apart from the absorption of previously-consumed alcohol that Zarwell had described, there was no reason why Smith\u2019s blood alcohol concentration would have increased during that interim period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
