The district court denied Carpio-Leon\u2019s motion, and Carpio-Leon then pleaded guilty to that charge, as well as to an illegal entry charge, reserving, as part of his plea agreement, the right to appeal the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 922(g)(5) is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Concluding that \u00a7 922(g)(5) is constitutional, we affirm. On Carpio-Leon\u2019s Second Amendment challenge, we conclude that the scope of the Second Amendment does not extend to provide protection to illegal aliens, because illegal aliens are not law-abiding members of the political community and aliens who have entered the United States unlawfully have no more rights under the Second Amendment than do aliens outside of the United States seeking admittance. On Carpio-Leon\u2019s Fifth Amendment challenge, we conclude that prohibiting illegal aliens, as a class, from possessing firearms is rationally related to Congress\u2019 legitimate interest in public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">Following a consensual search of Carpio-Leon\u2019s home on February 24, 2011, in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recovered a .22 caliber Marlin rifle, a 9 mm Hi-Point model C pistol, and ammunition. Carpio-Leon admitted that he had stored the firearms in his master bedroom and that he was in the United States illegally. He was thereafter indicted in two counts charging him with (1) possession of a firearm by an alien \u201cillegally or unlawfully in the United States,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A); and (2) illegal entry into the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">Carpio-Leon filed, a motion to dismiss Count I .on the ground that \u00a7 922(g)(5) violates his rights under the Second Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. At the hearing on the motion, .he introduced evidence that he and his wife had lived in Orangeburg for some 13 years and had three children, all of whom were born in the United States; that he had no prior criminal record; that he had filed income tax returns; and that \u201ca .22 caliber and a 9 mm pistol could be the type of arms one would use for protection of their homes and children.\u201d He also stipulated that he was in the United States illegally and that he had used a false social security number to obtain a driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>The district court denied Carpio-Leon\u2019s motion, concluding that <em>\u201cHeller </em>[554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (2008) ] and other Supreme Court precedent foreclose [his] argument that aliens illegally present in the United States are among those protected by the Second Amendment.\u201d Alternatively, the court ruled that \u00a7 922(g)(5) survives intermediate scrutiny, the relevant standard, because \u201c[g]iven Congress\u2019s legitimate concerns about the dangers potentially posed by individuals who have violated this country\u2019s immigration laws and either entered or remain present inside its borders illegally, \u00a7 922(g)(5)(A) reasonably addresses the governmental objective of keeping firearms out of the possession of illegal aliens.\u201d The court rejected Carpio-Leon\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim because it found, for the same reasons given in its analysis of his Second Amendment claim, that \u00a7 922(g)(5) does not deprive Carpio-Leon of any fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">After the court denied his motion to dismiss, Carpio-Leon entered a conditional guilty plea to both counts of the indictment, reserving the right to appeal the issue of \u00a7 922(g)(5)\u2019s constitutionality. The court sentenced Carpio-Leon on October 25, 2011, to time served on Count I and to six months\u2019 imprisonment on Count II, with both sentences to run concurrently. It ordered two years\u2019 supervised release on Count I and, as additional conditions, directed Carpio-Leon (1) \u201cto surrender to a duly-authorized immigration official for deportation consideration in accordance with established procedures provided by the Immigration and Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.\u201d and (2) \u201cnot [to] re-enter the United States for the duration of supervised release and not without the approval of the United States Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">Carpio-Leon contends that possession of firearms typically used for self-defense in one\u2019s home is protected by the Second Amendment, even when such possession is by an illegal alien. Recognizing the historical analysis required in construing the Second Amendment, he argues that the Second Amendment could not have been intended to exclude illegal aliens from its scope because \u201cin 1791, attitudes toward immigration were the reverse of today\u2019s attitudes\u201d and \u201cimmigrants \u2014 also known as \u2018settlers\u2019 \u2014 were deemed absolutely necessary to the development and survival of the new nation.\u201d Carpio-Leon also argues that \u201cthere is no empirical evidence demonstrating that undocumented workers (in their homes)[,] the classification into which [he] falls[,] are any more dangerous to society than legal aliens or, for that matter, native born United States citizens.\u201d Thus, he asserts, \u00a7 922(g)(5) is not narrowly tailored \u201cto serve a compelling government interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">The government contends that the Second Amendment does not protect illegal aliens because it \u201ccodified a preexisting right [to bear arms] that historically has been enjoyed [only] by <em>law-abiding, </em>responsible citizens, and illegal aliens are necessarily not law abiding.\u201d In any event, it argues that \u00a7 922(g)(5) survives intermediate scrutiny by serving an important interest in public safety. It also notes that Congress has \u201cbroad power over immigration-related matters and can choose to disarm illegal aliens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">We have not had occasion to address a Second Amendment challenge to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5). The Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, however, have upheld the provision in the face of a Second Amendment challenge, and we have found no court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>appeals decision that has found it unconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit held that the protection of the Second Amendment does not extend to illegal aliens. <em>See United States v. Portillo-Munoz, </em>643 F.3d 437, 442 (5th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1969, 182 L.Ed.2d 821 (2012); <em>United States v. Flores, </em>663 F.3d 1022, 1023 (8th Cir.2011) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 133 S.Ct. 28, 183 L.Ed.2d 681 (2012). And the Tenth Circuit avoided the question of whether illegal aliens are protected by the Second Amendment and upheld \u00a7 922(g)(5) because it passed intermediate scrutiny. <em>See United States v. Huitron-Guizar, </em>678 F.3d 1164, 1169-70 (10th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">As we have previously observed, \u201c[a]ny Second Amendment analysis must now begin with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent seminal decision in <em>Heller, </em>which held that the Second Amendment [providing that \u2018the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed\u2019] codified a <em>\u2018preexisting\u2019 </em>right that allows individuals to keep and bear arms.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>669 F.3d 411, 414 (4th Cir.2012) (citing <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 592, 595, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008)). In <em>Heller, </em>the Court, finding that the Second Amendment protects an <em>individual </em>right to bear arms, struck down the District of Columbia\u2019s bans on handgun possession in the home and on having a firearm in the home that is immediately operable. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783. But in doing so, the Court cautioned that the right to bear arms has limits. \u201cOf course the right [to bear arms] [is] not unlimited, just as the First Amendment\u2019s right of free speech [is] not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 128 S.Ct. 2783.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">Thus, the Second Amendment does not guarantee the right to possess for <em>every purpose, </em>to possess <em>every type of weapon, </em>to possess at <em>every place, </em>or to possess by <em>every person. See United States v. Chester, </em>628 F.3d 673, 676 (4th Cir.2010) (\u201cSignificantly, <em>Heller </em>recognized that the right to keep and bear arms, like other Constitutional rights, is limited in scope and subject to some regulation\u201d); <em>Carter, </em>669 F.3d at 415 (explaining that under <em>Heller, </em>\u201cthe right to keep and bear arms depends not only on the purpose for which it is exercised but also on the relevant characteristics of the person invoking the right\u201d); <em>Huitron-Guizar, </em>678 F.3d at 1166 (\u201cThe right to bear arms, however venerable, is qualified by what one might call the \u2018who,\u2019 \u2018what,\u2019 \u2018where,\u2019 \u2018when,\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019 \u201d). As the <em>Heller </em>Court itself enumerated the limitations, the Constitution does not \u201cprotect the right of citizens to carry arms for <em>any sort </em>of confrontation,\u201d 554 U.S. at 595, 128 S.Ct. 2783; the right to bear \u201carms\u201d does not guarantee the right to possess every type of weapon, <em>id. </em>at 627, 128 S.Ct. 2783; and not every person has the right to possess a firearm \u2014 \u201c[N]othing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on long-standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 626-27, 128 S.Ct. 2783. The Court also noted that the \u201cpresumptively lawful regulatory measures\u201d it identified were only \u201cexamples\u201d and that its list did \u201cnot purport to be exhaustive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627 n. 26, 128 S.Ct. 2783.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">To apply <em>Heller, </em>we follow the two-step approach set forth in <em>Chester, </em>asking first</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-13\">whether the challenged law imposes a burden on conduct falling within the scope of the Second Amendment\u2019s guarantee. This historical inquiry seeks to determine whether the conduct at issue was understood to be within the scope of the right at the time of ratification. If it was not, then the challenged law is valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number><em>Chester, </em>628 F.3d at 680 (internal quotation marks and \u25a0 citations omitted). If, however, the regulation is found to burden conduct that falls within the scope of the Second Amendment\u2019s protections, . \u201cwe move to the second step of applying an appropriate form of means-end scrutiny.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Employing this analytical structure here, we start by determining whether the scope of the Second Amendment includes the protection of aliens who are illegally, in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Beginning with the text, the Second Amendment provides that \u201cthe right <em>of the people </em>to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. II (emphasis added). In providing its protection to \u201cthe people,\u201d the Amendment is distinguishable from the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which provide protections to \u201cpersons.\u201d As <em>Heller </em>noted, the term \u201cthe people\u201d is a \u201c \u2018term of art,\u2019 \u201d which is also used in the First and Fourth Amendments, that \u201c \u2018refers to a class of persons who are part of a national community or who have otherwise developed sufficient connection with this country to be considered part of that community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 580, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (quoting <em>United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, </em>494 U.S. 259, 265, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\"><em>Heller </em>does not make clear, however, whether illegal aliens can ever be part of the political community and therefore be included in the class of persons labeled \u201cthe people.\u201d Heller does frequently connect arms-bearing and \u201ccitizenship.\u201d For example, its analysis of the phrase \u201cright of the people\u201d ends by concluding, \u201cWe start therefore with a strong presumption that the Second Amendment right is exercised individually and belongs to all <em>Amer</em>icans.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 581, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 595, 625, 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (connecting citizenship and the right to bear arms). We should be cautious, however, in assuming that the Court defined \u201cthe people\u201d as excluding illegal aliens because the Court used <em>Verdugo-Urquidez </em>to explain the meaning of \u201cthe people.\u201d In <em>Verdugo-Urquidez, </em>the Court noted that its assumption in <em>I.N.S. v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984), that the Fourth Amendment' applies to illegal aliens is not \u201cdispositive of how the Court would rule on a Fourth Amendment claim by illegal aliens in the United States if such a claim were squarely before [it].\u201d <em>Verdugo-Urquidez, </em>494 U.S. at 272, 110 S.Ct. 1056. Though <em>Verdugo-Urquidez </em>certainly did not rule out the possibility that illegal aliens have only limited Fourth Amendment rights, it did not rule on whether illegal aliens were part of \u201cthe people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272-73, 110 S.Ct. 1056. The Supreme Court\u2019s precedent is therefore not clear on whether \u201cthe people\u201d includes illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Here, we need not limit our analysis to the scope of the term \u201cthe people\u201d and thereby become enmeshed in the question of whether \u201cthe people\u201d includes illegal aliens or whether the term has the same scope in each of its constitutional uses.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>This is because <em>Heller </em>concludes, through a distinct analysis, that the core right historically protected by the Second Amendment is the right of self-defense by \u201c <em>\u2018law-abiding, </em>responsible citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carter, </em>669 F.3d at 416 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783); <em>see also United States v. Moore, </em>666 F.3d 313, 319 (4th Cir.2012) (holding that a defendant with prior felony and violent crime convictions \u201csimply does not fall within the category of citizens to which the <em>Heller </em>court ascribed the Second Amendment protection of \u2018the right of <em>law-abiding responsible </em>citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783)); <em>United States v. Masciandaro, </em>638 F.3d 458, 470 (4th Cir.2011) (identifying the \u201cfundamental,\u201d core right of the Second Amendment as self-defense in the home by a <em>law-abiding </em>citizen) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 756, 181 L.Ed.2d 482 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The <em>Heller </em>Court reached the Second Amendment\u2019s connection to law-abiding citizens through a historical analysis, independent of its discussion about who constitutes \u201cthe people.\u201d <em>See Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 579-81, 128 S.Ct. 2783. The Court read <em>United States v. Miller, </em>307 U.S. 174, 59 S.Ct. 816, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939), to say that \u201cthe Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by <em>law-abiding </em>citizens for lawful purposes.\u201d <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 625, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (emphasis added). When looking at prior gun regulation, the Court found that \u201c[fjor most of our history, the Bill of Rights was not thought applicable to the States, and the Federal Government did not significantly regulate the possession of firearms by <em>law-abiding </em>citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The Court was careful to note that its opinion should not be read to limit the government\u2019s ability to disarm individuals who cannot be trusted with firearms. <em>See id. </em>at 626, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (stating that \u201cnothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill\u201d). Finally, the Court concluded that \u201cwhatever else [the Second Amendment] leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other interests the right of <em>law-abiding, responsible citizens </em>to use arms in defense of hearth and home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Even though the <em>Heller </em>Court stressed that the core right of the Second Amendment protects law-abiding members of the political community, it did not face a law prohibiting firearms possession by a particular class of persons. Nonetheless, we can employ the historical analysis it prescribed to apply its observations to this case, <em>see Chester, </em>628 F.3d at 680, and thus to reach the conclusion that we do \u2014 that illegal aliens do not belong to the class of law-abiding members of the political community to whom the Second Amendment gives protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">\u201c[M]ost scholars of the Second Amendment agree that the right to bear arms was tied to the concept of a virtuous citizenry and that, accordingly, the government could disarm \u2018unvirtuous citizens.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Yancey, </em>621 F.3d 681, 684-85 (7th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number><em>States v. Vongxay, </em>594 F.3d 1111, 1118 (9th Cir.2010) (citing Glenn Harlan Reynolds, <em>A Critical Guide to the Second Amendment, </em>62 Tenn. L. Rev. 461, 480 (1995); Don B. Kates, Jr., <em>The Second Amendment: A Dialogue, </em>Law <em>&amp; </em>Contemp. Probs., Winter 1986, at 143, 146)). For example, felons \u201cwere excluded from the right to arms\u201d because they were deemed unvirtuous. Reynolds, <em>supra, </em>at 480; <em>see also </em>David Yassky, <em>The Second Amendment: Structure, History, and Constitutional Change, </em>99 Mich. L. Rev. 588, 626 (2000) (\u201cThe average citizen whom the Founders wished to see armed was a man of republican virtue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Colonial governments often barred \u201cpotential subversives\u201d from owning firearms. Joyce Lee Malcolm, <em>To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right </em>140-41 (1994) (detailing colonial laws preventing \u201csuspect populations\u201d from owning firearms). In several colonial states, refusal to swear allegiance to the state or the country warranted disarmament. Saul Cornell <em>&amp; </em>Nathan DeDino, <em>A Well Regulated Right: The Early American Origins of Gun Control, </em>73 Fordham L. Rev. 487, 506 (2004) (\u201cDuring the American Revolution, several states passed laws providing for the confiscation of weapons owned by persons refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the state or the United States\u201d); see also Saul Cornell, <em>\u201cDon\u2019t Know Much About History\u201d: The Current Crisis in Second Amendment Scholarship, </em>29 N. Ky. L. Rev. 657, 671 (2002) (describing the right to bear arms in colonial Pennsylvania as a \u201ccivic right, one that was limited to those members of the polity who were deemed capable of exercising it in a virtuous manner\u201d). Similarly, after Shays\u2019 Rebellion, to obtain a pardon for taking up arms against the state, Massachusetts required swearing allegiance to the state and giving up firearms for three years. Cornell <em>&amp; </em>DeDino, <em>supra, </em>at 507-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">Also, several early proposals for the Bill of Rights demonstrate the understanding that the core protection of the Second Amendment belongs to law-abiding citizens. Delegates asked the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention to recommend barring Congress from \u201cpreventing] the people of the United States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms.\u201d 2 Bernard Schwartz, <em>The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History </em>681 (Leon Friedman et al. eds., 1971). The New Hampshire convention similarly proposed that \u201cCongress shall never disarm any Citizen unless such as are or have been in Actual Rebellion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">Finally, the prefounding English right to bear arms supports this limitation of Second Amendment rights. <em>Cf. Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 592-93, 128 S.Ct. 2783 (analyzing the English law prior to the founding to interpret the operative clause of the Second Amendment). In England, the right to bear arms allowed the government to disarm those it considered disloyal or dangerous. <em>See </em>Patrick J. Charles, <em>\u201cArms for Their Defense\u201d?: An Historical, Legal, and Textual Analysis of the English Right to Have Arms and Whether the Second Amendment Should Be Incorporated in McDonald v. City of Chicago, </em>57 Clev. St. L. Rev. 351, 376, 382-83 (2009); Malcolm, <em>supra, </em>at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">Carpio-Leon\u2019s historical evidence does not controvert the historical evidence supporting the notion that the government could disarm individuals who are not law-abiding members of the political community. Carpio-Leon argues that the historical \u201cattitudes toward immigration were the reverse of today\u2019s attitudes\u201d and that \u201c[c]onsidering the country\u2019s need for immigrants to settle frontier areas[,] ... denying immigrants the right to defend them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>selves and their families would have been unthinkable.\u201d While this observation may be true, it does not suggest that individuals who were not considered to be part of the political community and who did not follow the community\u2019s rules were guaranteed the right to bear arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">In reaching our conclusion that illegal aliens do not belong to the class of law-abiding members of the political community to whom the protection of the Second Amendment is given, we do not hold that any person committing any crime automatically loses the protection of the Second Amendment. The <em>Heller </em>Court\u2019s holding that defines the core right to bear arms by law-abiding, responsible citizens does not preclude some future determination that persons who commit some offenses might nonetheless remain in the protected class of \u201claw-abiding, responsible\u201d persons. We only hold here that <em>illegal aliens </em>do not fall in the class of persons who are classified as law-abiding members of the political community for the purpose of defining the Second Amendment\u2019s scope. <em>See Portillo-Munoz, </em>643 F.3d at 440 (concluding that illegal aliens are not protected by the Second Amendment because \u201c[i]llegal aliens are not \u2018law-abiding, responsible citizens\u2019 \u201d); <em>Moore, </em>666 F.3d at 319-20 (\u201cMoore\u2019s three prior felony convictions for common law robbery and two prior convictions for assault with a deadly weapon on a government official clearly demonstrate that he is far from a law-abiding, responsible citizen\u201d and therefore is not protected by the Second Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">And we readily confirm our limited holding as to illegal aliens by their particular relationship to the United States. Defining aliens as illegal emanates from \u201cthe power to expel or exclude aliens [which is] a fundamental <em>sovereign attribute </em>exercised by the Government\u2019s political departments [that is] largely immune from judicial control.\u201d <em>Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, </em>345 U.S. 206, 210, 73 S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953) (emphasis added). Thus, the crime of illegal entry inherently carries this additional aspect that leaves an illegal alien\u2019s status substantially unprotected by the Constitution in many respects. <em>See, e.g., Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 693, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001) (noting that in <em>Kaplan v. Tod, </em>267 U.S. 228, 230, 45 S.Ct. 257, 69 L.Ed. 585 (1925), \u201cdespite nine years\u2019 presence in the United States, an \u2018excluded\u2019 alien \u2018was still in theory of law at the boundary line and had gained no foothold in the United States\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 693, 121 S.Ct. 2491 (noting the distinction between aliens who have and have not \u201ceffected an entry into the United States\u201d and citing <em>Leng May Ma v. Barber, </em>357 U.S. 185, 188-90, 78 S.Ct. 1072, 2 L.Ed.2d 1246 (1958) for the proposition that there is a difference between an alien only \u201cparoled\u201d into the United States and one who has \u201ceffected an entry\u201d); <em>Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, </em>525 U.S. 471, 488, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999) (\u201cAs a general matter \u2014 and assuredly in the context of claims such as those put forward in the present case \u2014 an alien unlawfully in this country has no constitutional right to assert selective enforcement as a defense against his deportation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">And because the regulation of aliens\u2019 entry into the United States draws on the exercise of national sovereignty, \u201cthe responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches of the Federal Government.\u201d <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 81, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976). It is well settled that decisions made by the political branches on immigration are subject only to a \u201cnarrow standard of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82, 96 S.Ct. 1883. The Supreme Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>resting on the sovereign aspect of regulating aliens, \u201chas repeatedly emphasized that \u2018over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete than it is over\u2019 the admission of aliens.\u201d <em>Fiallo v. Bell, </em>430 U.S. 787, 792, 97 S.Ct. 1473, 52 L.Ed.2d 50 (1977) (quoting <em>Oceanic Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, </em>214 U.S. 320, 339, 29 S.Ct. 671, 53 L.Ed. 1013 (1909)).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">Thus, when Congress regulates illegal aliens by prohibiting them from possessing firearms, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5), it is functioning in a special area of law committed largely to the political branches, <em>see Shaughnessy, </em>345 U.S. at 210, 73 S.Ct. 625, and on which we owe Congress special deference, <em>Fiallo, </em>430 U.S. at 792, 97 S.Ct. 1473. Indeed, in addition to making the possession of firearms by illegal aliens a crime, Congress has also made CarpioLeon\u2019s unexamined entry into the United States a crime. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(a); <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 219 n. 19, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (noting that \u201centry into the class [of illegal aliens] is itself a crime\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">For the reasons given, we hold that the Second Amendment right to bear arms does not extend to <em>illegal </em>aliens, and therefore, without the need of proceeding to the second step of <em>Chester, </em>we conclude that Carpio-Leon\u2019s constitutional challenge under the Second Amendment must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Carpio-Leon also contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5) violates his right to equal protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Based on his claim that the right to bear arms in one\u2019s home for protection is a <em>fundamental </em>constitutional right, he argues that we should apply strict scrutiny in evaluating \u00a7 922(g)(5). Under strict scrutiny, he maintains, the statute is unconstitutional because no empirical evidence exists to justify \u201cthe statutory ban on undocumented workers\u2019 right to bear arms in their homes for the protection of their families.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">The government contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5) is subject to a rational basis review because illegal aliens do not have a fundamental right to bear arms. Under the rational-basis level of scrutiny, which is a low hurdle, it notes that the government has a legitimate interest in public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">There is no disputing that illegal aliens are \u201cpersons\u201d protected by the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Mathews, </em>426 U.S. at 77, 96 S.Ct. 1883 (\u201cEven one whose presence in this country is unlawful, involuntary, or transitory is entitled to [the] constitutional protection\u201d of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments); <em>Plyler, </em>457 U.S. at 210, 102 S.Ct. 2382 (\u201c[E]ven aliens whose presence in this country is unlawful, have long been recognized as \u2018persons\u2019 guaranteed due process of law by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\u201d). And when, as here, no fundamental constitutional right is at stake, the appropriate standard of review is the rational-basis review. <em>See Mathews, </em>426 U.S. at 82-83, 96 S.Ct. 1883; <em>Huitron-Guizar, 678 </em>F.3d at 1167 (applying rational basis review to equal protection challenge of \u00a7 922(g)(5)); <em>Vongxay, </em>594 F.3d at 1119 (applying rational basis review to prohibition against felons possessing firearms \u201cbecause the right established by <em>Heller </em>does not apply to felons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">Carpio-Leon cannot show that there is no rational relationship between prohibiting illegal aliens from bearing firearms and the legitimate government goal of public safety. To the contrary, courts have identified numerous legitimate reasons why it would be dangerous to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>illegal aliens to arm themselves. For instance, illegal aliens are \u201charder to trace and more likely to assume a false identity!),] [o]r Congress may have concluded that those who show a willingness to defy our law are candidates for further misfeasance or at least a group that ought not be armed when authorities seek them.\u201d <em>Huitron-Guizar, </em>678 F.3d at 1170. Illegal aliens are \u201clikely to maintain no permanent address in this country, elude detection through an assumed identity, and\u2014 already living outside the law \u2014 resort to illegal activities to maintain a livelihood.\u201d <em>United States v. Toner, </em>728 F.2d 115, 128-29 (2d Cir.1984) (internal quotation marks omitted) (upholding precursor to \u00a7 922(g)(5)). More generally, the Supreme Court has \u201cfirmly and repeatedly endorsed the proposition that Congress may make rules as to aliens that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.\u201d <em>Demore v. Kim, </em>538 U.S. 510, 522, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003). Congress therefore surely can rationally distinguish between legal aliens and illegal aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 itself advances a rational basis for \u00a7 922(g)(5)\u2019s prohibitions, finding that the possession of firearms by certain classes of persons, including \u201caliens who are illegally in the country\u201d creates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-6\">(1) a burden on commerce or threat affecting the free flow of commerce,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-7\">(2) a threat to the safety of the President of the United States and Vice President of the United States,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-8\">(4) a threat to the continued and effective operation of the Government of the United States and of the government of each State guaranteed by article IV of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Pub. L. No. 90-351, \u00a7 1201, 82 Stat. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">Carpio-Leon cites empirical studies that, he contends, show that undocumented workers are no more dangerous to society than are native born United States citizens. But the usefulness of such studies are at best limited and certainly do not focus on the class of <em>illegal </em>aliens, which is the basis for \u00a7 922(g)(5). Comparing incarceration rates of men born in the United States with the incarceration rates of foreign-born men does not establish that <em>unlawful </em>entrants are less dangerous. Those data compare incarceration rates based on a person\u2019s place of birth, not on whether a person is lawfully or unlawfully present in the United States. The other evidence cited by Carpio-Leon is a comparison between the overall level of crime in the United States with the number of unlawful entrants. But again, this comparison is not useful because of the high number of variables. Carpio-Leon simply cannot show that Congress acted irrationally in concluding that those who are in the United States <em>illegally </em>should not be allowed to possess firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">Accordingly, we conclude that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(5) survives rational scrutiny and is, therefore, also constitutional under the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b995-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b990-7\"> Were we to limit our analysis to the scope of the term \"the people,\u201d we would also have to recognize that groups like women, Native Americans, and blacks may not have been part of the political community at the time of the founding but are today within the class that we refer to as \"the people.\u201d In this same vein, it was understood that Catholics could be disarmed in England prior to the founding, but again today they are within the class that we refer to as \"the people.\u201d The <em>Heller </em>Court accepted this analytical approach when it determined what today may be classified as \"arms.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b990-11\">Some have made the argument, bordering on the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the Second Amendment. We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of communications, e.g., <em>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, </em>521 U.S. 844, 849, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997), and the Fourth Amendment applies to modern forms of search, e.g., <em>Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 35-36, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001), the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-12\"><em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. at 582, 128 S.Ct. 2783.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
