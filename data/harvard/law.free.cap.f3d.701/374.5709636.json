Berry, a federal prisoner convicted of a crack cocaine offense, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which revised the crack cocaine quantity tables in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. App. C, amend. 750 (Nov. 2011). After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). The grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are quite narrow. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 909 (11th Cir.2003). The Sentencing Commission must have amended the Sentencing Guidelines, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(o), that guidelines amendment must have lowered the defendant\u2019s sentencing range, and it must also be one that is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. n. 1(A); <em>see also Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">Furthermore, \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). In other words, a reduction is not authorized if the amendment does not actually lower a defendant\u2019s applicable guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision,\u201d such as a statutory mandatory minimum prison term. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A). For this reason, when a defendant\u2019s guidelines sentence of life was based on the statutory mandatory minimum in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), Amendment 750 does not lower that guidelines sentence, and the defendant is not eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction. <em>See United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1207-08 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">Here, the district court did not err in denying Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Berry was convicted and sentenced back in 2002. Berry\u2019s offense level of 37 and initial guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment were not based on \u00a7 2Dl.l\u2019s drug quantity tables, but on Berry\u2019s status as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). More importantly, because Berry had two prior felony drug convictions, Berry was subject to a <em>statutory </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>mandatory minimum life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2009), and thus his guidelines sentence became life imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Amendment 750 had no effect on Berry\u2019s initial guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment or Berry\u2019s guidelines sentence of life imprisonment, and the district court did not have the authority to grant Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1207-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Berry argues that he is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d), which became effective on August 3, 2010. The FSA lowered the statutory mandatory minimum penalties for crack cocaine offenses in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). <em>See </em>Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). The problem for Berry is the FSA is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress, and thus it does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Berry\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Berry, as he asserts, could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, Berry\u2019s FSA claim still fails because he was convicted and sentenced in 2002, and the FSA does not apply retroactively to his 2002 sentences. The general savings clause in 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 provides that \u201c[t]he repeal of any statute shall not have the effect to release or extinguish any penalty ... incurred under such statute, unless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide, and such statute shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper action or prosecution for the enforcement of such penalty .... \u201d 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109. <em>See United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343, 1346 (11th Cir.2010) (discussing 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1833, 179 L.Ed.2d 788 (2011). Nothing in the FSA extinguishes the statutory mandatory minimum sentence or penalty already imposed in Berry\u2019s case before the FSA\u2019s enactment. We agree with every other circuit to address the issue that there is \u201cno evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u201d <em>United States v. Baptist, </em>646 F.3d 1225, 1229 (9th Cir.2011) (citing decisions from every Circuit, including <em>Gomes, </em>except the D.C. Circuit and the Federal Circuit), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1053, 181 L.Ed.2d 773 (2012); <em>United States v. Bigesby, </em>685 F.3d 1060, 1066 (D.C.Cir.2012) (subsequently agreeing the FSA does not apply to sentences imposed prior to August 3, 2010); <em>United States v. Fields, </em>699 F.3d 518, 521-23, No. 09-3137, 2012 WL 5457682, at *3-4 (D.C.Cir. Nov. 9, 2012) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">Berry cites <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that the FSA\u2019s lower mandatory m\u00ednimums apply to a defendant who committed his offense before, but was sentenced <em>after, </em>the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). But, <em>Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new mandatory m\u00ednimums should apply to defendants, like Berry, who were sentenced long before the FSA\u2019s effective date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To the contrary, the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Court in <em>Dorsey </em>noted that the disparities between these two kinds of defendants \u201creflect[ ] a line-drawing effort, [that] will exist whenever Congress enacts a new law changing sentences,\u201d and that \u201cin federal sentencing the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties to defendants not yet sentenced, while withholding that change from defendants already sentenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2335. The Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey </em>carefully confined its application of the FSA to pre-Act offenders who were sentenced after the Act\u2019s effective date. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>697 F.3d 443, 444-45 (7th Cir.2012) (\u201cThe Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey </em>held only that \u2018Congress intended the Fair Sentencing Act\u2019s new, lower mandatory m\u00ednimums to apply to the posi-Act sentencing of pre-Act offenders.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Dorsey, </em>132 S.Ct. at 2335)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">For all these reasons, the district court properly denied Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-13\">. \"We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>548 F.3d 1366, 1368 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\">. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), the district court assigned Berry an offense level of 37 based on a statutory maximum life sentence. Berry\u2019s offense level 37 and criminal history category of VI yielded a guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment. However, by operation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2), Berry's guidelines sentence was life because that was also his statutory mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-17\">. After the FSA, a \u00a7 841(a) defendant with one or more prior convictions for a felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>drug offense is subject to a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence and a maximum of life imprisonment if his offense involved 28 grams or more of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). If Berry were re-sentenced under the FSA, his statutory maximum sentence would remain life and, thus, his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) would remain 37. Even if Berry's new statutory mandatory minimum were ten years under the FSA, his sentencing guidelines range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1 would be 360 months to life. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"A1b\">Further, after the FSA, a \u00a7 841(a) defendant still faces a mandatory minimum life sentence if he has two prior felony drug convictions and his current offense involved 280 grams or more of crack cocaine. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). Berry was convicted of distributing 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, and the sentencing court found that his offense involved 161.7 grams of crack cocaine, less than the 280-gram amount now needed for a mandatory minimum life sentence under the FSA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
