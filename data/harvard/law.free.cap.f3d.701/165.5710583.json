When sentencing him, the district court found that his previous state conviction for a criminal threat categorically constituted a prior \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d justifying a substantial enhancement of his sentence. The court then sentenced Torres-Miguel, with this enhancement, to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. For the reasons that follow, we must vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-16\">In its presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), the probation officer recommended a sixteen-level increase to Torres-Miguel\u2019s base offense level on the basis of his prior conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 422(a). That statute prohibits, as a felony, willfully threatening to commit a crime that would result in death or great bodily injury. CahPenal Code \u00a7 422(a). (The record in this case contains no facts as to this underlying conviction.)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-17\">Over Torres-Miguel\u2019s objection, the district court determined that the California threat conviction categorically constituted a crime of violence justifying a sentencing enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d). <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2011). The sentencing enhancement increased Torres-Miguel\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range from a period of fifteen to twenty-one months to a period of fifty-seven to seventy-one months. The PSR mistakenly calculated the Guidelines range, after the enhancement, as fifty-one to seventy-one months, rather than fifty-seven to seventy-one months. The court then sentenced Torres-Miguel to the low-end of the enhanced Guidelines range as calculated in the PSR: fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. Torres-Miguel timely noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>\u201cIn assessing whether a sentencing court has properly applied the Guidelines, we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Llamas, </em>599 F.3d 381, 387 (4th Cir.2010). This appeal involves a purely legal question of interpretation of the Guidelines, which we therefore subject to de novo review.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The single question on appeal is: did the district court properly count Torres-Miguel\u2019s prior conviction for a violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 422(a) as a crime of violence, justifying a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines? To determine whether a prior state conviction constitutes a predicate crime of violence justifying an enhanced federal sentence, we generally follow the categorical approach. <em>United States v. Seay, </em>553 F.3d 732, 737 (4th Cir.2009); <em>see also Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). This approach \u201clook[s] only to the statutory definition of the state crime and the fact of conviction to determine whether the conduct criminalized by the statute, including the most innocent conduct, qualifies as a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Ibarra, </em>522 F.3d 343, 348 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">In a \u201cnarrow range of cases,\u201d however, we may apply a modified categorical approach. <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143. The modified categorical approach permits a court to consider whether the specific conduct underlying a defendant\u2019s prior state conviction constitutes a crime of violence by examining \u201cthe terms of the charging document, ... a plea agreement, ... [a] transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant, ... or ... some comparable judicial record\u201d revealing the \u201cfactual basis for the plea.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">We can apply the modified categorical approach only if the prior state conviction rests on a statute that \u201ccontains divisible categories of proscribed conduct, at least one of which constitutes\u2014by its elements\u2014a violent felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Gomez, </em>690 F.3d 194, 199 (4th Cir.2012). The predicate state statute at issue here, California Penal Code \u00a7 422(a), includes no such \u201cdivisible categories.\u201d Therefore, as the parties agree, we cannot apply the modified categorical approach in this case. (We note that even if \u00a7 422(a) contained \u201cdivisible categories of proscribed conduct,\u201d <em>Gomez, </em>690 F.3d at 199, we could not apply the modified categorical approach here because the record contains no charging document, plea agreement, or other document approved in <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254.)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Thus, we proceed to consider whether Torres-Miguel\u2019s prior conviction under \u00a7 422(a) <em>categorically </em>constitutes a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">Section 422(a), the California statute under which Torres-Miguel was previously convicted, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">Any person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which <em>will result </em>in death or great bodily injury to another person, with the specific intent that the statement ... is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out, which, on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>cution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety, shall be punished by imprisonment....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 <em>422(a) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The applicable Sentencing Guideline defines a crime of violence as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">[A]ny of the following offenses ...: murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses ..., statutory rape, sexual abuse of a minor, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, burglary of a dwelling, or <em>any other offense </em>... <em>that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We have not previously considered whether California Penal Code \u00a7 422(a) categorically constitutes a crime of violence under this definition. Our sister circuits have divided on the question. <em>Compare United States v. Cruz-Rodriguez, </em>625 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2010) (holding a conviction under \u00a7 422(a) not categorically a crime of violence), <em>with United States v. Villavicencio-Burruel, </em>608 F.3d 556, 563 (9th Cir.2010) (holding a conviction under \u00a7 422(a) categorically a crime of violence).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We now turn to that question, particularly focusing on the rationale offered by the Ninth Circuit in reaching its conclusion that \u00a7 422(a) categorically constitutes a crime of violence, a rationale on which the Government heavily relies before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">The Ninth Circuit expressly \u201crestfed]\u201d its holding on the \u201cplain text\u201d or \u201cplain language\u201d of \u00a7 422(a). <em>Villavicencio-Burruel, </em>608 F.3d at 562. The court reasoned that because the elements of \u00a7 422(a) \u201cnecessarily include a threatened use of physical force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person,\u201d the statute necessarily constituted a crime of violence for purposes of the Guidelines enhancement. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">That rationale relies on a fundamental misreading of \u00a7 422(a). The plain language of the statute requires only that the offender \u201cthreatens to commit a crime which will <em>result </em>in death or great bodily injury to another.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 422(a) (emphasis added). Contrary to the suggestion of the Ninth Circuit, no element of \u00a7 422(a) \u201cnecessarily include[s] a threatened <em>use </em>of physical force\u201d to accomplish that \u201cresult.\u201d This misreading of \u00a7 422(a) is critical, for the Guidelines provide that, to constitute a crime of violence, a prior offense must have \u201cas an element the <em>use </em>or ... threatened <em>use </em>of physical force.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii) (emphasis added). An offense that <em>results </em>in physical injury, but does not involve the use or threatened use of force, simply does not meet the Guidelines definition of a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-13\">Of course, a crime may <em>result </em>in death or serious injury without involving <em>use </em>of physical force. For example, as the Fifth Circuit has noted, a defendant can violate statutes like \u00a7 422(a) by threatening to poison another, which involves no use or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>threatened use of force. <em>See Cruz-Rodriguez, </em>625 F.3d at 276 (adopting the reasoning of <em>United States v. De La Rosa-Hernandez, </em>264 Fed.Appx. 446, 449 (5th Cir.2008)); <em>see also United States v. Ortiz-Gomez, </em>562 F.3d 683, 687 (5th Cir.2009) (holding Pennsylvania terroristic threat conviction not a predicate crime of violence under the Guidelines because the statute \u201cdoes not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of force\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Other courts have similarly recognized that, to constitute a predicate crime of violence justifying a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines, a state offense must constitute a <em>use </em>or <em>threatened use </em>of violent force, not simply <em>result </em>in physical injury or death. Thus, the Second Circuit has held that Connecticut third degree assault does not constitute a crime of violence justifying a sentencing enhancement because \u201cthere is a difference between the causation of an injury,\u201d which is all that the Connecticut statute (like \u00a7 422(a)) required, \u201cand an injury\u2019s causation by the use of physical force.\u201d <em>Chrzanoski v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 188, 194 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Dalton v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 200, 207 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201cThere are many crimes that involve a substantial risk of injury but do not involve the use of force. Crimes of gross negligence or reckless endangerment, such as leaving an infant alone near a pool, involve a risk of injury without the use of force.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">For the same reasons, the Tenth Circuit has held that Colorado third degree assault does not categorically constitute a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Perez-Vargas, </em>414 F.3d 1282, 1287 (10th Cir.2005). The court explained that, although the Colorado statute required bodily injury, imposing that injury does not \u201cnecessarily include the use or threatened use of \u2018physical force\u2019 as required by the Guidelines,\u201d and so the Colorado crime was not \u201ccategorically a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Not to recognize the distinction between a <em>use </em>of force and a <em>result </em>of injury is not to recognize the \u201clogical fallacy ... that simply because all conduct involving a risk of the use of physical force also involves a risk of injury then the converse must also be true.\u201d <em>Dalton, </em>257 F.3d at 207. Accordingly, we must conclude that, contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding, the plain language of \u00a7 422(a) does not contain an element requiring the use or threatened use of physical force. Thus, it seems clear that \u00a7 422(a) is not categorically a crime of violence as defined in Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Although, as noted above, the Ninth Circuit expressly \u201crest[ed]\u201d its holding on its view of the \u201cplain language\u201d of \u00a7 422(a), a view we find erroneous, it also quoted a portion of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007), suggesting it believed that case lent sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>port to its holding. Before us, the Government heavily relies on this alternative rationale. But the argument fails because it wrenches the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Duenas-Alvarez </em>from its context.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In the paragraph on which the Ninth Circuit relied, the Supreme Court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">To find a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a <em>listed crime ... </em>requires a realistic probability ... that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the <em>generic </em>definition of a crime. To show that realistic possibility, an offender ... must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the State courts in fact did apply the statute in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\"><em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815 (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit appeared to believe that this language created a rule applicable even when the prior state offense is not a \u201clisted crime\u201d (i.e., a crime enumerated in a list of predicate state offenses in a federal statute or Sentencing Guideline) with a \u201cgeneric definition.\u201d <em>See Villavicencio-Burruel, </em>608 F.3d at 561. But the quoted language, by its own terms, applies <em>only </em>to determinations of whether \u201ca state statute creates a crime outside the <em>generic </em>definition of a <em>listed crime,\u201d </em>not to <em>every </em>possible state predicate. <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\"><em>Duenas-Alvarez </em>involved just such a listed crime \u2014 theft. <em>See id. </em>at 185, 127 S.Ct. 815. \u201cTheft\u201d has a generic definition. <em>See id. </em>at 189-90, 127 S.Ct. 815. Thus the Supreme Court cautioned that a defendant could avoid treatment of his pri- or state offense as a predicate crime for federal purposes only by demonstrating that the state offense did not fit within the generic definition of theft. <em>See id. </em>at 193-94, 127 S.Ct. 815. Similarly, when we have applied this teaching from <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>the state predicate crime was another listed crime \u2014 \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d\u2014 that has a generic definition. <em>See Diaz-Ibarra, </em>522 F.3d at 349. The defendant in that case maintained that his prior convictions were not crimes of violence because they fell outside the generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor. <em>See id. </em>at 347. There, requiring the defendant <em>to show </em>that the state statute realistically covered conduct falling outside the generic definition of the listed crime was both mandated by <em>Duenas-Alvarez </em>and entirely logical.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">But \u00a7 422(a) is not a \u201clisted crime\u201d with a \u201cgeneric definition.\u201d Neither the Government nor the Ninth Circuit suggests that it is. Section 422(a) qualifies as a crime of violence only if it fits in the <em>residual category </em>of violent crimes, i.e., \u201cany other offense ... that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. l(B)(iii). To require a defendant to demonstrate that his prior state offense does not fall within this residual category by proving that it is not a \u201cgeneric\u201d \u201cother offense\u201d is to require the impossible, for there is no generic \u201cother offense,\u201d or even a generic \u201cthreat\u201d crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Accordingly, we must conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>DuenasAlvarez </em>involving \u201clisted crimes,\u201d on which the Ninth Circuit appeared to rely, simply does not apply to \u00a7 422(a), which is not a listed crime with a generic definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In sum, we reject both rationales suggested by the Ninth Circuit and adopted by the Government as to why \u00a7 422(a) categorically constitutes a crime of violence. We are left with a case in which \u201cthe full range of conduct covered by the [predicate] state statute\u201d does not fall within the Guidelines definition of crime of violence. <em>See Villavicencio-Burruel, </em>608 F.3d at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Ninth Circuit itself has recognized, in such a situation, a court must find \u2014 as the Fifth Circuit did \u2014 that a conviction under the predicate state statute is not, categorically, a crime of violence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Therefore, Torres-Miguel\u2019s sixteen-level sentencing enhancement cannot stand. For these reasons, we must vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-9\">. The Government suggests that the Eighth Circuit has also held that conviction under \u00a7 422(a) categorically constitutes a crime of violence. But actually the Eighth Circuit only stated, when denying a defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on habeas review, that \"[a]t the time of [the defendant\u2019s] sentencing, violation of [\u00a7 422(a) ] constituted a violent felony\u201d <em>under Ninth Circuit law. Toledo v. United States, </em>581 F.3d 678, 680 (8th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">. The drafters of the Guidelines certainly understood the difference between use or threatened use of physical force, on the one hand, and causation of injury, on the other, because on multiple occasions they have revised the Guidelines to reflect this difference. Before 1989, the Guidelines definition of crime of violence under the career offender provision referred to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, requiring use of force. <em>See Chrzanoski, </em>327 F.3d at 195 n. 11. In 1989, the drafters broadened the crime of violence definition to require resultant injury, but not necessarily use of force. <em>See id. </em>More recently, the drafters changed the Guidelines definition back to one requiring use of force. Thus the Sentencing Commission has repeatedly recognized the important distinction between use of force and injury caused by force. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\">. We note that even if there were a generic \"threat\u201d crime, it is hardly clear that this generic threat crime would constitute a crime of violence. Indeed, states have frequently explicitly outlawed threat crimes that involve <em>no </em>threat of physical force. <em>See, e.g., </em>Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 621 (criminalizing false statements \"likely to cause evacuation\u201d or other \u201cserious inconvenience\u201d and acts committed \"with intent of causing an individual to believe that the individual has been exposed to a substance that will cause the individual death or serious injury\u201d); Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-ll-37(a) (criminalizing threats to release hazardous substances or burn or damage property); Kan.
