Caporale finished serving his prison sentence for child molestation in 2008, but he has remained incarcerated while the government seeks to have him declared a \u201csexually dangerous person\u201d pursuant to the civil-commitment provisions of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (the \u201cWalsh Act\u201d), Pub.L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587, as specifically set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">A sexually dangerous person under the Walsh Act means one \u201cwho has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who is sexually dangerous to others.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(a)(5). A person is sexually dangerous to others insofar as he or she \u201csuffers from a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder,\u201d and, as a result, \u201cwould have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4247(a)(6). The parties have never disputed that, as evidenced by his several convictions, discussed <em>infra, </em>Caporale satisfies the first, prior-conduct element of \u00a7 4247(a)(5) by having engaged in child molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">Following an evidentiary hearing whose scope was thereby limited to the second element of \u00a7 4247(a)(5), the district court ruled that, as a matter of law, the government had not proved that Caporale suffers from a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder. The court perceived in the alternative that even if Caporale were so afflicted, his commitment was not required because the government had also failed to sufficiently show that Caporale will experience serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">We conclude that, contrary to the district court\u2019s legal determination and as established by the evidence, Caporale indeed suffers from a qualifying mental impairment. We nevertheless affirm the judgment below, discerning no clear error in the court\u2019s alternative rationale that the government fell short of carrying its burden to demonstrate a relative likelihood that Caporale will reoffend.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">Caporale, fifty-nine, has a history of sexual offenses involving minors. In 1980, he pleaded guilty in New York to fourth-degree criminal facilitation for recruiting about twenty boys, aged thirteen to sixteen, to have sex with an adult female acquaintance. Then, in 1984, Caporale pleaded guilty to state charges of second-degree sexual abuse for subjecting a thirteen-year-old boy to sexual contact and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>masturbating another boy, twelve years old. In 1986, Caporale again pleaded guilty in state court to acting in a manner injurious to a child, after having persuaded three boys (age fifteen to sixteen) and a girl (age sixteen) to have sex in his apartment while he watched.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Similar conduct in Maine involving a seventeen-year-old boy and the boy\u2019s underage female acquaintances \u2014 this time evidenced by photographs and videotapes \u2014 resulted in Caporale\u2019s 1992 federal indictment for child molestation and for possession of child pornography. Caporale pleaded guilty to six counts of using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct, for which he was sentenced to eighty-four months in prison; he served most of that sentence before being granted supervised release in August 1998. On December 14, 1999, Caporale was arrested and charged with endangering the welfare of a minor following the discovery by local authorities that he had discussed masturbation with a fourteen-year-old male neighbor. The charge was a parole violation, for which Caporale was returned to prison in September 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Caporale was again released to supervision in June 2001, and, two years later, was once more found to have violated his conditions of release by associating with a felon, a man who Caporale described as a pedophile. On September 12, 2003, federal probation officers arrived unannounced at Caporale\u2019s residence and arrested him upon finding numerous videotapes and photographic depictions of underage boys engaged in sexual activity. Caporale subsequently pleaded guilty in New York to a single count of possessing photographs of an obscene performance of a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Caporale\u2019s myriad violations ultimately resulted in the revocation of his supervised release. Consequently, Caporale returned to federal prison in 2003 to serve out the sentence imposed on his 1992 conviction. Caporale completed his sentence on March 21, 2008, and he would have been released but for the government\u2019s filing that day of a certification pursuant to the Walsh Act, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">In relation to a person who is in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, ... the Attorney General ... may certify that the person is a sexually dangerous person, and transmit the certificate to the clerk of the court for the district in which the person is confined.... The court shall order a hearing to determine whether the person is a sexually dangerous person. A certificate filed under this subsection shall stay the release of the person pending completion of procedures contained in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">The district court was thus required to convene a hearing to afford the government the opportunity to prove the ultimate truth of its certification, i.e., that Caporale is sexually dangerous. An inmate so declared must be kept in federal custody until the danger has passed, or until a state agrees to assume responsibility for the inmate\u2019s custody, care, and treatment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4248(d). As it was uncontested that Caporale\u2019s criminal history satisfied the first element toward a determination of sexual dangerousness, it was the government\u2019s burden at hearing to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, both prongs of the second element: (1) that Caporale is impaired by a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder, such that (2) he would, if released, have serious difficulty refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 4247(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">All proceedings having been stayed during the pendency of constitutional chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>lenges to the commitment proceedings wrought by the Walsh Act, <em>see United States v. Hall, </em>664 F.3d 456, 461 n. 2 (4th Cir.2012) (reciting litigation history beginning with Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Comstock, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1949, 176 L.Ed.2d 878 (2010), and progressing through our decision on remand, <em>United States v. Comstock, </em>627 F.3d 513 (4th Cir.2010), and its companion case, <em>Timms v. Johns, </em>627 F.3d 525 (4th Cir.2010)); <em>see also United States v. Timms, </em>664 F.3d 436 (4th Cir.2012), Caporale\u2019s hearing at last took place on March 5, 2012. The key witnesses were Dr. Gary Zinik and Dr. Lela Demby for the government, and Dr. Joseph Plaud for the defense, all of whom are licensed psychologists and acknowledged experts. All three reviewed the available records, and Dr. Plaud personally interviewed Caporale on November 28, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">According to Dr. Plaud, Caporale is sexually interested in pubescent to post-pubescent males, \u201c12, 13 up to 16, 17 years old.\u201d J.A. 253.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Plaud explained that, inasmuch as the rate of physical maturity may differ depending on the person, stages of development defy rigid definition by age, and that it was more accurate to say that Caporale\u2019s sexual interests correspond approximately to Stages III-V on the five-stage Tanner scale of physical development. <em>See id. </em>at 253-54. Dr. Zinik essentially concurred with Dr. Plaud, noting that Caporale is attracted to \u201c[pubescent boys, ages approximately 11 to 14.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">In contrast to her two colleagues, Dr. Demby opined that Caporale prefers \u201cprepubescent boys ... who ha[ve] not yet developed the majority of their secondary sexual characteristics ... as young as 11 and 12.\u201d J.A. 207. Asked to elaborate, Dr. Demby noted that, as set forth in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\u201cDSM\u201d), age thirteen is the presumed ceiling for a diagnosis of pedophilia, a condition in which the afflicted individual is attracted to pre-pubescent children. <em>See id. </em>at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">Though not confronted directly with Dr. Demby\u2019s testimony, Dr. Plaud flatly rejected her diagnosis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">[Caporale\u2019s] not a pedophile.... [T]he DSM in the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia does in parenthesis say in terms of an age range, generally age 13 years and younger. That\u2019s worthless information. That doesn\u2019t inform a professional about anything.... We have to look at what the data are because the critical feature is whether or not the person has attained evidence of secondary sexual characteristics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">J.A. 253. Dr. Zinik agreed with the defense on this point, as confirmed by the district court\u2019s questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-14\">JUDGE BOYLE: This patient or subject is not a pedophile. You don\u2019t describe him \u2014 you don\u2019t define him a pedophilic with children who are below 11, say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-15\">[DR. ZINIK]: That\u2019s correct. I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">JUDGE BOYLE: You think his target group is the pubescent group?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-17\">THE WITNESS: Definitely those who have \u2014 boys who have reached puberty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-18\">JUDGE BOYLE: Yeah. Yeah,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>THE WITNESS: He\u2019s not interested in prepubescent children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 169. Indeed, Dr. Demby acknowledged that \u201cindividually, [puberty] can happen at different ages for different children,\u201d and she frankly admitted that it would \u201cbe possible for somebody who is say, 12 years old to be pubescent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209. Dr. Demby nonetheless diagnosed Caporale with \u201cpedophilia, sexually attracted to males exclusive type, and personality disorder not otherwise specified of dependent traits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Dr. Zinik, having ruled out pedophilia, concluded that Caporale suffers from \u201cparaphilia ... not otherwise specified\u201d (\u201cparaphilia/NOS\u201d). J.A. 161. Dr. Zinik testified that paraphilia is characterized by \u201crecurrent, intense sexual fantasies, urges or behaviors that ... last at least six months and ... cause a significant impairment or disability in the individual\u2019s life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167. Dr. Zinik occasionally referred to Caporale\u2019s affliction as \u201chebephilia,\u201d which is not a listed diagnosis in the DSM, but a colloquial term understood by mental health professionals to describe the proclivity of \u201cmen whose erotic interest centers on pubescents.\u201d Ray Blanchard et ak, <em>Pedophilia, Hebephilia, and the DSM-V, </em>38 <em>Archives of Sexual Behavior </em>335, 336 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Only eight specific manifestations of paraphilia \u2014 pedophilia, transvestic fetishism, exhibitionism, fetishism with respect to inanimate objects, voyeurism, sexual masochism, sexual sadism, and frotteurism (sexual rubbing against non-consenting persons, often in crowded areas) \u2014 are documented in the Fourth Edition of the DSM, a treatise accepted as authoritative by all the testifying experts. More generally, however, the DSM lists paraphilia/NOS, which, Dr. Zinik explained, \u201cis a residual category in which really all \u2014 any other paraphilia could be included.\u201d J.A. 167. According to Dr. Zinik, a paraphilia\u2019s inclusion within the catch-all should not depend on whether it is diagnosed with a frequency similar to those specifically listed, but should merely consider whether it impairs normal functioning to a similar extent. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">In Dr. Zinik\u2019s opinion, Caporale\u2019s paraphilia \u201chas caused serious impairment and dysfunction in his life, because he keeps getting arrested and ... he\u2019s never really done much with his life, because of this obsession.\u201d J.A. 161. Dr. Demby agreed with Dr. Zinik that impairment is the hallmark of a mental infirmity, explaining that \u201c[t]he mere presence of sexual attraction to pubescent children in and of itself does not qualify as a mental disorder. The disorder comes when it causes one to have significant impairment in major spheres of functioning in one\u2019s life.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">In opposition to the government\u2019s experts, Dr. Plaud opined that Caporale suffers from no qualifying illness, abnormality, or disorder under \u00a7 4247(a). Dr. Plaud observed that Caporale\u2019s sexual liaisons with pubescent males \u201cis illegal to a certain extent ... upwards, depending on the jurisdiction. But it is not disordered.\u201d J.A. 251. Emphasizing the lack of a discrete DSM listing for Caporale\u2019s affliction, Dr. Plaud reasoned that \u201cif it\u2019s ... truly a disorder, it should have its own diagnostic criteria. [I]f you have something that\u2019s high frequency and it\u2019s truly considered by the professional community to be a disorder, then you\u2019ve got to have a diagnosis for it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">Dr. Plaud took issue with Dr. Zinik\u2019s conclusion that, for purposes of the Walsh Act, hebephilia can be shoehorned into the DSM-listed diagnosis of paraphilia/NOS, explaining that \u201c[fit\u2019s only more recently that this has become something, I think, as a consequence of what\u2019s going on in the larger civil commitment world.... And I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>do not believe a paraphilia NOS is ... for that purpose. It\u2019s there for low frequency sexual aberration.\u201d J.A. 253. Cross-examination served to further develop Dr. Plaud\u2019s position. Asked by the government\u2019s counsel whether sexual acts with a thirteen-year-old boy are deviant, Dr. Plaud responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">They\u2019re sexually deviant in the legal sense of the term, and in the moral sense ... they can be, of course. But diagnostically, is \u2014 does he have an underlying sexual disorder? That\u2019s the issue .... The issue with sexual deviance is, is an individual attracted underneath, sexually motivated by a range of experiences that he outside of what most human beings experience.... That\u2019s what makes it not sexually deviant. It may be socially deviant. It may be morally deviant. Put any word you want on it, but I\u2019m here to talk about sexual deviance in that diagnostic sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The experts also differed on whether, upon release, Caporale would have serious difficulty in refraining from child molestation. Dr. Zinik, referring to pornographic stories about teenage boys composed in 2008 by Caporale and other inmates using a prison computer, along with suggestive photographs seized from Caporale\u2019s cell in May 2011, opined that Caporale is \u201cstill pretty charged up about pubescent boys, and that he would have, as a result of that, serious difficulty controlling himself in the community if he were in contact with pubescent boys as he has done in the past.\u201d J.A. 179. Using three actuarial scales to compute the risk of recidivism for offenders having similar characteristics, Dr. Zinik recited that two of the scales scored Caporale\u2019s profile \u201chigh risk\u201d and the third \u201cmoderate high risk.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Dr. Demby considered the stories and photos \u201cevidence of sexual preoccupation, attitudes that condone sexual contact with children as recently as 2011,\u201d which, in her opinion, \u201cexacerbates Mr. Caporale\u2019s risk.\u201d J.A. 227. Noting that Caporale had, in the past, personally taken photographs of illegal activity, Dr. Demby also took into account Caporale\u2019s more recent writings to differentiate his behavior from that typically exhibited by a passive consumer of pornography. <em>See id. </em>at 228. Dr. Demby conceded that writing such stories was not itself \u201csexually dangerous\u201d in the sense that it did not equate to molestation or violent conduct, but she offered that \u201cif someone knows that they are at risk ... of molesting children and reengaging in past behavior ... to continue to create and read ... and reiterate these themes ... it\u2019s leading him down that same path of a hands-on offense, of re-doing what ... we already know he\u2019s done in the past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Dr. Plaud, on the other hand, thought it more significant that, since 1992, Caporale had committed only noncontact offenses. Caporale had further demonstrated volitional capacity, according to Dr. Plaud, by having ceased writing stories since May 2011, almost a year prior to the hearing. <em>See </em>J.A. 255, 261, 265-66. Dr. Plaud was reluctant to use actuarial tools to predict Caporale\u2019s probability of recidivism, testifying that such tools more accurately serve to exclude test subjects as candidates to engage in molestation, rather than to pinpoint them as likely offenders. <em>See id. </em>at 258-59. Dr. Zinik also acknowledged the tools\u2019 limitations. <em>See id. </em>at 179. Dr. Plaud emphasized, moreover, that even those tools indicating that Caporale posed a \u201chigh risk\u201d of recidivism more particularly defined that risk as amounting to less than a twenty-five percent chance over eight years. Indeed, as Dr. Plaud pointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>out, the actuarial risk decreases to less than ten percent for men sixty and over, an age that Caporale has nearly attained. <em>See id. </em>at 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u25a0C.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">On April 20, 2012, the district court issued a written decision, designated its \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\u201d (the \u201cFindings\u201d), in which the court set forth its ruling against the government.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Most significantly, the court concluded that hebephilia \u2014 whether elevated to a titular condition or deemed a shorthand way to describe the behavioral predicate underlying a more formal diagnosis of paraphilia/NOS \u2014 \u201cis not an appropriate basis for civil commitment under the [Walsh] Act.\u201d Findings 6. This is so, the court reasoned, because whether hebephilia constitutes a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder \u201cis a contested issue in the mental health community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In that respect, the court found \u201cmore credible the testimony of Dr. Plaud, who opined ... that Mr. Caporale currently suffers from no sexual disorder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">The district court also regarded Dr. Plaud\u2019s testimony more credible concerning the issue of whether Caporale would have serious difficulty refraining in the future from sexually violent conduct or child molestation. The court stressed that Dr. Plaud had focused pertinently on evidence of Caporale\u2019s current condition, more so than Dr. Zinik and Dr. Demby, who based their evaluations in substantial part on Caporale\u2019s historical misconduct. <em>See </em>Findings 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Consistently with its written decision, the district court entered judgment for Caporale and ordered his release. The government timely appealed, and, contemporaneously therewith, filed an emergency motion for a stay of the district court\u2019s order, which we granted. The parties\u2019 respective arguments having thereafter been fully briefed and argued on an expedited basis, the matter is ripe for our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">To the extent that the district court\u2019s judgment in this Walsh Act proceeding rests on the accuracy of its findings of fact, our review is for clear error. <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>664 F.3d 456, 462 (4th Cir.2012). The court\u2019s legal conclusions, however, are paid no deference. <em>See id. </em>It is beyond our limited role as an appellate court to disturb the judgment below solely on the ground that we would have decided to the contrary. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Precedent dictates that \u201c \u2018[i]f the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Wooden, </em>693 F.3d 440, 451 (4th Cir.2012) (quoting <em>Bessemer City </em>at 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504). We must therefore permit the court\u2019s judgment to stand unless, with respect to its factual underpinnings, we are \u201c \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wooden, </em>693 F.3d at 451 (quoting <em>Easley v. Cromartie, </em>532 U.S. 234, 242, 121 S.Ct. 1452, 149 L.Ed.2d 430 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-15\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-16\">The experts at hearing were asked whether Caporale suffers from a serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>mental illness, abnormality, or disorder, and they each strove to answer that question within the strictures of the DSM, which is familiar territory to mental health professionals. Dr. Demby perceived Caporale\u2019s sexual aberrations as suggesting a specific DSM diagnosis, while Dr. Zinik thought the aberrant behavior corresponded more closely to a less rigorous, residual category of diagnoses yet within the DSM. Dr. Plaud was of the opinion that Caporale\u2019s condition conformed to no listed diagnosis, which in turn precluded the possibility that Caporale suffers from any serious mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The district court\u2019s resolution of the issue in reliance on Dr. Plaud\u2019s testimony cannot be squared with <em>United States v. Carta, </em>592 F.3d 34 (1st Cir.2010), another Walsh Act proceeding involving a diagnosis of hebephilia, in which the lower court\u2019s judgment on behalf of the respondent was premised on a legal analysis similar to that under review here. In <em>Carta, </em>the respondent\u2019s expert \u201casserted that hebephilia was not a generally accepted diagnosis in the mental health community, did not fit within the DSM definition of paraphilia, lacked diagnostic criteria and could not be consistently defined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38. Consistently with that testimony, the district court entered judgment in favor of the respondent, ruling that hebephilia is not a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The First Circuit vacated and remanded, observing that the lower court \u201cmay have assumed that the statutory concept is delimited by the consensus of the medical community, but this is not so. Further, a mental disorder or defect need not necessarily be one so identified in the DSM in order to meet the statutory requirement.\u201d <em>Carta, </em>592 F.3d at 39-40. The <em>Carta </em>court\u2019s rationale appears sound, as one will search \u00a7 4247(a)(6) in vain for any language purporting to confine the universe of qualifying mental impairments within clinical or pedagogical parameters. The statute could have been drafted to comport with clinical norms, but inasmuch as Congress chose not to do so, it has been left to the courts to develop the meaning of \u201cserious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder\u201d as a legal term of art. <em>See Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 U.S. 346, 359, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997) (explaining that \u201cthe term \u2018mental illness\u2019 is devoid of any talismanic significance,\u201d and instructing that legislative development of specialized \u201c[Ijegal definitions ... need not mirror those advanced by the medical profession\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Such an approach is by no means unprecedented. Under the Black Lung Act, for example, we have acknowledged that legal pneumoconiosis encompasses a more inclusive category of ailments than the purely clinical diagnosis, with the result that a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits is evaluated under the broader definition. <em>See Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Fuller, </em>180 F.3d 622, 625 (4th Cir.1999). When the presence of legal \u2014 as opposed to clinical or medical \u2014 pneumoconiosis is at issue in a black lung case, eligibility for benefits ultimately depends on whether the disease has caused a worsening of symptoms to the extent that the miner\u2019s respiratory or pulmonary functioning has been impaired. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The analogy to the Black Lung Act is especially apt here, in light of the government experts having testified without contradiction that mental infirmities in general (and paraphilia in particular) have little meaning except to the extent they are manifested by an impairment in the subject\u2019s ability to function as a normal human being. In large part for that reason, the court in <em>Carta </em>had no difficulty concluding that hebephilia is a qualifying illness, abnormality, or disorder within the meaning of \u00a7 4247(a)(6), observing that the respondent \u201chas a decades-long sexual fixation on minors that plainly has caused significant distress or impairment in his life.\u201d 592 F.3d at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The First Circuit in <em>Carta </em>made short shrift of the lower court\u2019s rejection of hebephilia as fulfilling the serious-impairment prong, reasoning that the condition also fits within the rubric of paraphilia/NOS, which \u201cis expressly a DSM-listed disorder.\u201d 592 F.3d at 40. In the case at bar, Dr. Plaud\u2019s testimony cast some doubt that hebephilia may so qualify, but the scope of \u201cillness, abnormality, or disorder\u201d in \u00a7 4247(a)(6) is certainly broad enough to include hebephilia, by its own or any other name. The district court\u2019s determination to the contrary was thus incorrect as a matter of law. Though his condition may elude definitive labeling, the evidence at hearing established beyond question that Caporale\u2019s ability to function normally in society has been preempted by his sexual fixation on underage, pubescent boys, such fixation having heretofore so dominated his psyche as to substantially impair and disrupt his life.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The substantial delays occasioned by the constitutional litigation concerning the Walsh Act, <em>see supra </em>Part I.B, resulted in a backlog of commitment proceedings in the district courts. Those proceedings now appear to be moving forward in earnest, and, as a consequence, Caporale\u2019s is already the fourth merits-based appeal of a \u00a7 4245 judgment that we have considered, all within the past year. The three previous appeals having been disposed of via published opinions, and each having required an analysis of the hearing evidence under the serious-difficulty prong of \u00a7 4247(a)(6), a review of those prior decisions is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">In <em>United States v. Hall, </em>664 F.3d 456 (4th Cir.2012), we affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling in favor of the respondent on the serious-difficulty prong. The diagnosis in <em>Hall </em>was pedophilia, and it was undisputed. The government\u2019s two experts, including Dr. Demby, based their serious-difficulty conclusions primarily on actuarial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>tools, the respondent\u2019s ongoing interest in collecting pornographic drawings and photographs, and his general noncompliance with rules and directions while on supervised release and even following his certification. <em>See id. </em>at 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The defense expert, in turn, stressed the respondent\u2019s limited history of offenses and victims, his participation in a treatment program, and his abstention from hands-on offenses during his twenty-eight months of release. <em>See Hall, </em>664 F.3d at 464. The respondent\u2019s expert pointed to recent research linking possession of pornography with a lower recidivism rate, adding that the stringent release provisions and possibility of a life sentence for further offenses would serve as powerful deterrents. <em>See id. </em>at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The district court found the defense expert to be the most credible of the three, discerning that he had more completely discussed the actuarial tools and psychological tests administered to evaluate the respondent. <em>See Hall, </em>664 F.3d at 465. These tools assessed the respondent\u2019s recidivism risk as being between ten to thirty-six percent within ten years following release. <em>See id. </em>at 466. The court relied on the defense expert\u2019s testimony regarding the respondent\u2019s control on his prior release and the deterrent effect of the conditions attached to the proposed release. <em>See id. </em>Although the government took issue with the determinative weight afforded the respondent\u2019s lack of offense conduct when released previously, we declined to assign clear error, deferring to the district court\u2019s analysis and its credibility assessments, including that of the respondent himself, who indicated remorse and an understanding of the risks of recidivism. <em>See id. </em>at 465-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Not long thereafter, in <em>United States v. Francis, </em>686 F.3d 265 (4th Cir.2012), we again affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of the respondent. In <em>Francis, </em>a government expert diagnosed the respondent with paraphilia/NOS (telephone scatalogia), i.e., the propensity to make obscene and threatening phone calls; another diagnosed sexual sadism and antisocial personality disorder. <em>Id. </em>at 271. In supporting the government\u2019s case on the serious-difficulty prong, these two experts relied heavily on actuarial tools and, to a lesser extent, on the respondent\u2019s perceived hostility toward women and his noncompliance with supervised release. <em>Id. </em>The respondent\u2019s risk of recidivism over a five-year period was actuarially projected to be between approximately thirty and sixty percent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">The two experts for the respondent, including Dr. Plaud, either agreed with or did not seriously dispute the government\u2019s diagnosis of paraphilia/NOS (telephone scatalogia). The defense instead primarily contested the serious-difficulty prong, urging the court to consider the respondent\u2019s abstention from reoffending during the seven months of his prior release and contending that the actuarial tools employed by the government\u2019s experts were of no use to predict nonphysical behavior. <em>See Francis, </em>686 F.3d at 272. Employing his own methodology, one of the defense experts testified that the respondent actually posed a low risk of recidivism. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">In evaluating the evidence, the district court assumed without deciding that the government had established the first, pri- or-conduct element. <em>See Francis, </em>686 F.3d at 272-73. No clear finding was made with respect to the serious-impairment prong of the second element, but the circumstances attendant to the court\u2019s discussion required us to assume that it had implicitly resolved the issue in favor of the respondent. <em>See id. </em>at 276. Be that as it may, the court explicitly ruled in favor of the respondent on the serious-difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>prong, according greater weight to the testimony of the defense experts. The court noted particularly those experts\u2019 evaluation of the respondent\u2019s behavior on prior release, and it credited their opinions that the government\u2019s actuarial evidence was of scant probative value. <em>Id. </em>at 273. On appeal, we concluded that the court\u2019s analysis in that regard was sufficiently cogent and thorough. <em>Id. </em>at 276-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Most recently, in <em>United States v. Wooden, </em>693 F.3d 440 (4th Cir.2012), we reversed the district court\u2019s determination in favor of the respondent on both second-element prongs, and we remanded the matter for reconsideration. Like <em>Hall, Wooden </em>involved a diagnosis of pedophilia, but on this latter occasion we observed that the court had improperly relied on the testimony of the defense expert, in that the expert could not square his opinions with the undisputed facts, particularly that the respondent: (1) was continuing to have intense fantasies and urges involving prepubescent children; (2) had offered testimony that was littered with rationalizations, denials, and other cognitive distortions or \u201cthinking errors\u201d; (3) was having difficulty distinguishing between dreams and reality with respect to an incident of molestation that was alleged \u2014 but not proved \u2014 to have occurred in 2005 during his parole period; (4) had admitted to attempting to molest another child perhaps a year before that; (5) had sent a Christmas card to the child in the alleged 2005 incident, in which he promised that, if he were out of prison, \u201cI would do a whole lot for you\u201d; and (6) had, while on parole, hired himself out as a babysitter for young children. <em>See Wooden, </em>693 F.3d at 444-45, 452-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We observed that the evidence set forth above was relevant to both the serious-impairment and serious-difficulty prongs, <em>see </em>693 F.3d at 458, and with especial regard to the latter, did not support the defense expert\u2019s fanciful theory that the respondent\u2019s tested reluctance to engage generally in impulsive behavior necessarily meant that he could exercise volitional control of his deviant sexual urges. The expert\u2019s opinion, we noted, did not account for the documented existence of patient, calculating child molesters who groom their victims. <em>See id. </em>at 457. Moreover, the record revealed that, beyond the laboratory context in which the expert had conducted his evaluation, the respondent had in fact acted impulsively during his prior crime, and had also evidenced his impulsiveness through his inability to adhere to institutional rules while incarcerated. <em>Id. </em>at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">Other reasons offered by the defense expert to support his opinions suffered from similar logical flaws. For example, the expert cited the respondent\u2019s disinterest in child pornography as evidence of docility, yet neglected to acknowledge the utter lack of evidence that the respondent had ever been so interested. <em>See Wooden, </em>693 F.3d at 448-49, 455. In addition, the expert failed to account for the respondent\u2019s attempted molestation of one child in 2004, his correspondence thereafter with another child via Christmas card, and his decision to place himself in proximity to other children through babysitting, all of which we explained \u201cspeaks directly to the serious-difficulty prong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 459. Other relevant considerations included the respondent\u2019s criminal history, <em>see id. </em>at 458, his testimonial admissions, <em>see id. </em>at 459, and any cognitive limitations, <em>see id. </em>at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">In light of all the circumstances, we concluded that the district court had clearly erred in relying upon the testimony of an expert who \u201clargely ignored all contradictory evidence\u201d and whose \u201canalysis was internally inconsistent.\u201d <em>Wooden, </em>693 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>F.3d at 455. We also determined that the court committed an error of law as to the government\u2019s burden of proof by demanding that it demonstrate, through its actuarial models, not merely that the respondent was at high or very high risk of reoffending within five years, but that the likelihood could be quantified in excess of fifty percent. <em>See id. </em>at 447-48, 450, 456-57, 460-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The foregoing recitation illustrates the principle that \u201cwhile clear-error review is deferential, it is not toothless.\u201d <em>Wooden, </em>693 F.3d at 452 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We may discern clear error when a court \u201cmakes findings without properly taking into account substantial evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 451 (quoting <em>Francis, </em>686 F.3d at 273). In <em>Wooden, </em>we reiterated the familiar principle that such error \u201coccurs when a district court\u2019s factual findings are against the clear weight of the evidence considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In support of reversing the judgment below in favor of Caporale on the serious-difficulty prong, the government contends that the district court misplaced its reliance on the expert testimony proffered by the defense, in that Dr. Plaud failed to adequately consider: (1) one of the boys victimized by Caporale\u2019s 1992 offense, though seventeen at the time, had been sexually involved with Caporale for four years; (2) Caporale\u2019s 1999 discussion of masturbation with a fourteen-year-old boy constituted grooming behavior; and (3) Caporale associated with a pedophile in 2003. The government also suggests that the court\u2019s resolution of the serious-difficulty prong was fatally colored by its misanalysis of the serious-impairment prong. <em>Cf. Wooden, </em>693 F.3d at 457 (noting government\u2019s argument \u201cthat the district court\u2019s error in concluding that Wooden does not suffer from pedophilia prevented the court from properly assessing the serious-difficulty question\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The defense case was by no means irrefutable, but, after reviewing the entire record, it would be inaccurate for us to say that Dr. Plaud was anything but thoroughly familiar with Caporale\u2019s history of molestation. Dr. Plaud readily acknowledged that Caporale was interested in boys as young as twelve or thirteen, but regarded Caporale\u2019s involvement with older minors in 1992 \u2014 though similarly unlawful and perhaps no less reprehensible \u2014 as perhaps indicating an evolving interest in those who have reached \u201can adult type of sexual maturity,\u201d J.A. 266. On cross-examination, the government specifically asked Dr. Plaud whether the 1992 incident justified enhancing his previous estimate of Caporale\u2019s recidivism risk. Dr. Plaud responded, \u201c[I]t argues quite to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">Although the government is correct that the district court did not address Caporale\u2019s supposed grooming conduct in 1999 or his prohibited association with a pedo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>phile in 2003, it is also the case that neither of those episodes featured prominently in the experts\u2019 testimony. Dr. Zinik characterized the 1999 incident as grooming in his answer to a single question on the second round of cross-examination conducted by Caporale\u2019s counsel, <em>see </em>J.A. 194-95, and, apart from the most ephemeral of allusions as part of a question posed to Dr. Demby on the subject of treatment, <em>see id. </em>at 212, the 2003 incident was not touched upon at the hearing, but discussed only in a single paragraph of Dr. Zinik\u2019s written report, <em>see id. </em>at 375. While the court\u2019s analysis would have been more comprehensive had it included a discussion of each secondary point, these particular omissions amount to little more than No. 8 needles in a stack of alfalfa.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The battleground at hearing on the serious-difficulty prong instead proceeded on two fronts: the probative value of the government\u2019s actuarial evidence, and the meaning to be accorded the pornographic materials seized from Caporale\u2019s cell during May 2011. The parties agreed that it was impossible to predict with exactitude whether Caporale would reoffend, but that his profile indicated a risk ceiling of about twenty-five percent, which would tend to decrease as he grew older.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the district court to credit Dr. Plaud\u2019s opinion that the actuarial evidence militated toward a conclusion in favor of Caporale. Given our holding in <em>Wooden </em>that a recidivism risk ceiling of fifty percent did not rule out the respondent\u2019s commitment, <em>see </em>693 F.3d at 460-61, the court may well have reasonably reached the opposite conclusion. But it was not required to.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Similarly, the evidence of Caporale\u2019s recent activities cut both ways. It is hardly surprising that Caporale\u2019s continued predilection for written pornography and suggestive photographs depicting teenage boys would generate some skepticism among the government\u2019s experts regarding his volitional control, though it might be argued as more relevant to the serious-impairment prong. At the same time, that no such materials had been found in Caporale\u2019s possession during the ten months prior to hearing plausibly supports \u2014 albeit to a limited degree \u2014 an inference of control. <em>See Francis, </em>686 F.3d at 276 (relating with approval district court\u2019s characterization of respondent\u2019s conformance with the law for more than seven months on release as \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d of his volitional control); <em>Hall, </em>664 F.3d at 465-66 (rejecting government\u2019s contention that district court clearly erred by crediting respondent\u2019s lawful behavior on release for twenty-eight months as probative of his capacity for control). The failure to discover pornographic contraband in Caporale\u2019s cell after May 2011 might also have supported the inference that he became better at concealing it, but it was manifestly the task of the factfinder to choose between competing reasonable inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The district court\u2019s analysis is not immune from attack, however, most notably its preference for Dr. Plaud\u2019s testimony based on the perception that his opinion on the serious-difficulty prong considered Caporale\u2019s current state more thoroughly than the opposing experts. <em>See </em>Findings 9-10. The court\u2019s emphasis on current information was somewhat of a straw man, inasmuch as the government\u2019s experts were not permitted access to Caporale and were therefore constrained to rely solely on their forensic reviews of the record. Moreover, we do not share the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>apparent disdain for historical evidence, having observed that a respondent\u2019s criminal record \u201cmay well be a historical factor, but it is by no means a stale or irrelevant one. When the question is whether an inmate ... will have serious difficulty refraining from re-offending if released, consideration of the nature of his prior crimes provides a critical part of the answer.\u201d <em>Wooden, </em>693 F.3d at 458.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Lastly, although the district court did not specifically indicate any reliance upon them, other aspects of the case support the underlying judgment. For instance, Caporale\u2019s deposition testimony evidenced a normal intelligence, thus allaying concerns that cognitive impairments could potentially \u201caffect [the respondent\u2019s] ability to refrain from re-offending if released.\u201d <em>Wooden, </em>693 F.3d at 460. Caporale expressed remorse for his past behavior, and he demonstrated the ability to differentiate between right and wrong. <em>See Hall, </em>664 F.3d at 466. Caporale also testified that the counseling and treatment he had received for his condition had prepared him for the rigors of release, enabling him to recognize and avoid high-risk circumstances that might otherwise tempt him to engage in wrongdoing. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Here, the relative strength of the parties\u2019 evidence and the logical force of the district court\u2019s analysis paint a picture that is more reminiscent of <em>Hall </em>and <em>Francis </em>than it is of <em>Wooden. </em>Though the government attempts to nitpick Dr. Plaud\u2019s opinions, his testimony, by and large, told \u201c \u2018a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wooden, </em>693 F.3d at 452 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). It is therefore unlikely that the court clearly erred in relying upon it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Although the district court incorrectly ruled that impairment through hebephilia cannot be, as a matter of law, a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder within the meaning of the Walsh Act, it did not commit clear error by alternatively crediting Dr. Plaud\u2019s testimony that Caporale possesses sufficient volitional control to prevent him from having serious difficulty refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation in the future. Under the circumstances, we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that the court was mistaken in concluding that the government had failed to carry its burden of proving Caporale a sexually dangerous person by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">.

In <em>Carta, </em>the court of appeals avoided the issue of whether hebephilia per se is within the ambit of \u00a7 4247(a)(6), instead holding that the underlying condition qualifies under the statute as a DSM-listed paraphilia/NOS. Here, with Dr. Zinik and Dr. Plaud being sharply at odds concerning the proper scope of a paraphilia/NOS diagnosis, <em>see supra </em>at 133-34, we think the better course is to avoid that question and simply hold that hebephilia, as colloquially understood, is a \u00a7 4247(a)(6) \"illness, abnormality, or disorder.\u201d Our holding does not mean, however, that a district court may find the first prong of the second element of \u00a7 4247(a)(5) to be satisfied simply because an expert labels the respondent a hebephile. A diagnosis of hebephilia (or pedophilia, or other mental disorder) is merely the starting point for the court to consider the true thrust of the \u00a7 4247(a)(6) inquiry \u2014 whether, on a case-specific basis, the respondent's underlying condition constitutes a serious functional impairment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\">. Insofar as the government contends that Dr. Plaud may have initially misperceived Caporale's latest \"contact offense\u201d against younger males to have occurred in 1984, rather than in 1988 or 1989 at the outset of Caporale\u2019s relationship with the male involved in the 1992 incident, Dr. Plaud's testimony on cross-examination reveals that he had become fully apprised, yet had not changed his opinion. <em>See </em>J.A. 265-66. Indeed, Dr. Plaud had testified with reasonable accuracy on direct examination that it was \"up to maybe about 1990 or so that [Caporale] was engaged in any type of contact-based offending. That's 20 or more years ago.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255.

For a court assessing the likelihood of recidivism upon a respondent\u2019s proposed release among the general public, an examination of the respondent\u2019s criminal conduct undertaken in the same setting \u2014 though having occurred a number of years past \u2014 may be the most probative predictor.

We attribute little significance to the government\u2019s contention that the district court's legal misstep with regard to the serious-impairment prong fatally poisoned its analysis of the serious-difficulty prong. We hinted at such a possibility in <em>Wooden, </em>but in that case, we traced the court\u2019s legal error to the permissible inferences and conclusions drawn from the evidence, rather than to the proper construction of statutory language. In addition, there was a great deal of evidentiary overlap in <em>Wooden </em>between the \u00a7 4247(a)(6) prongs, and less so in Caporale\u2019s case. Courts routinely offer alternative holdings in support of their judgments, a practice that facilitates review and promotes judicial efficiency. In order to encourage that beneficial practice, we should tend to refrain from placing disincentives in its path and be content, in the usual instance, to compartmentalize our review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
