The United States obtained a judgment for restitution of more than $85 million against Lawrence Duran for crimes that he committed in a conspiracy to defraud Medicare. After the United States obtained a writ of execution against an apartment that, according to property records, was owned jointly by Lawrence and his former wife, Carmen Duran, she moved to dissolve or stay the writ on the ground that she had acquired sole title to the property as part of their divorce settlement several months before his prosecution. The district court denied the motion without prejudice on the ground that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction to make findings with respect to Duran\u2019s divorce proceedings and corresponding property dispute.\u201d Carmen argues, and the United States concedes, that the district court erred in refusing to adjudicate her motion. Because the Act provides that the United States may levy only \u201cproperty in which [a] judgment debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3203(a), the district court erred in refusing to adjudicate Carmen\u2019s motion. We vacate the order that denied Carmen\u2019s motion and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b925-16\">In May 2011, Lawrence Duran pleaded guilty to 38 crimes related to his role in a conspiracy to defraud Medicare. The district court sentenced Lawrence to 50 years of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release. The district court also entered a judgment against Lawrence and in favor of the United States for $87,533,863.46 in restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>On October 19, 2011, the United States applied, under the Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act, for a writ of execution against an apartment to collect the judgment of restitution against Lawrence. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3203(c)(1). The United States alleged that Lawrence had \u201cpossession, custody, or control\u201d and \u201ca substantial nonexempt interest\u201d in an apartment in New York City. The United States stated in its certificate of service that it had \u201cfiled the [application] with the Clerk of the Court\u201d and that the application was \u201cbeing served ... by CM/ECF.\u201d Carmen was not served a copy of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">That same day, the Clerk of the district court granted the application of the United States, and the Clerk issued a- writ of execution. The writ ordered the United States Marshal to satisfy the judgment of restitution against Lawrence by \u201clevying on and selling\u201d the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">On November 17, 2011, Carmen Duran moved to dissolve or stay the writ of execution. Carmen argued that she was an \u201cinnocent owner\u201d of the apartment, and she requested an evidentiary hearing \u201con the critical issues of [her] legitimate ownership of the apartment in question, the pertinent concerns of notice and due process under Florida Law and [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 69, and [her] complete independence from [Lawrence], her former spouse.\u201d Carmen alleged that she had divorced Lawrence in June 2010; Lawrence had agreed as part of the divorce settlement to transfer his interest in the apartment to Carmen; in July 2010, Lawrence had executed a deed that conveyed his interest in the apartment to Carmen; and she had \u201cretained counsel to properly record the deed in New York.\u201d Carmen attached to her motion copies of the deed to the apartment, correspondence between attorneys in Florida and New York about recording the deed, the judgment of divorce, the divorce settlement agreement, and a financial affidavit executed by Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The United States opposed Carmen\u2019s motion to dissolve. The United States \u201c[did] not dispute that Carmen Duran [was] entitled to recover one-half of the net proceeds from the sale of the [apartment] since she was the one-half owner of the property\u201d when the United States recorded its lien. But the United States argued that its lien had priority over Carmen\u2019s unrecorded claim to sole ownership of the apartment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3203(b). The United States attached to its response a copy of its judgment lien and the deed it had found in the property records of New York, which stated that the apartment was owned jointly by Carmen and Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">Carmen replied that the United States could not levy the apartment to satisfy Lawrence\u2019s debt because he lacked any ownership interest in the apartment. Carmen alleged that she owned the apartment and that she had been unaware that her divorce attorney had failed to record the deed. Carmen attached to her reply an affidavit of her divorce attorney, which stated that he had attempted to file the deed, had mistakenly omitted a required tax return, and had later \u201cehose[n] not to complete the recording of the deed\u201d because the United States had filed criminal charges against Lawrence. Carmen also attached to the reply her affidavit, which explained how she was the lawful owner of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">The district court denied Carmen\u2019s motion \u201cwithout prejudice to re-file in a court with jurisdiction.\u201d The district court ruled that it lacked \u201cjurisdiction to make findings with respect to [Carmen\u2019s] divorce proceedings and corresponding property dispute.\u201d Carmen filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">\u201cOur review of a district court\u2019s determination of subject matter jurisdiction as well as statutory interpretation is <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">The Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act \u201cprovides \u2018the exclusive civil procedures for the United States\u2019 to obtain satisfaction of a judgment in a criminal proceeding that imposes a \u2018fine, assessment, penalty, [or] restitution\u2019 in favor of the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1309 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3001(a)(1), 3002(3)(B), 3002(8)). The Act provides the United States several remedies to satisfy a judgment, one of which is to obtain a writ of execution. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3202(a), 3203. Under section 3203(a), the United States may levy \u201c[a]ll property in which the judgment debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The Act limits the authority of the United States to levy against jointly-owned property. The United States may levy \u201cproperty which is co-owned by a debtor and any other person only to the extent allowed by the law of the State where the property is located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3010(a). With regard to levying against property under a writ of execution, \u201c[c]o-owned property [is] subject to execution [only] to the extent such property is subject to execution under the law of the State in which it is located.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3203(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">The Act provides that co-owners and other persons interested in the property have rights to receive notice of and to challenge the levy. The United States must provide notice that the property \u201cis being taken by the United States Government,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3202(b), and the United States must serve a copy of the notice and its application for the writ of execution \u201con each person whom the United States, after diligent inquiry, has reasonable cause to believe has an interest in property to which the remedy is directed,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3202(c). And after the district court issues the writ, \u201c[t]he court may[,] ... [on] the motion of any interested person, and after such notice as it may require, make an order denying, limiting, conditioning, regulating, extending, or modifying the use of any\u201d remedy available to the United States. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3013.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">The Act obliges a district court to adjudicate any contested ownership interests in property subject to a writ of execution. The Act provides that the United States may levy only property in which a judgment debtor has a \u201csubstantial nonexempt interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3203(a). To that end, the district court must determine whether the debtor has any ownership interests in the property, and the district court must determine the ownership interests of any person who moves to dissolve or modify any writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Two sister circuits also have interpreted the Act to allow nonparties to participate in these proceedings to adjudicate their interests in the property under state law. In <em>United States v. Kollintzas, </em>501 F.3d 796 (7th Cir.2007), the Seventh Circuit explained that \u201c[t]he FDCPA\u2019s third-party notice requirement and the provision regarding jointly owned property together imply that nonparties with an interest in the targeted property may participate in the collection proceedings for the purpose of asserting their interest in the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 801. And the court determined that \u201cthe government\u2019s liens were perfected and the garnishment proceedings commenced <em>before </em>[the debtor\u2019s spouse had] filed for divorce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 803; <em>see also United States v. Rogan, </em>639 F.3d 1106, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>1107-09 (7th Cir.2011) (vacating an order that granted a writ of garnishment obtained by the United States priority over creditors\u2019 claims to collect from a housing business under state law). And in <em>United States v. Coluccio, </em>51 F.3d 337 (2d Cir.1995), the Second Circuit allowed the mother of a defendant to challenge the right of the United States to seize a cost bond that the mother had posted on her son\u2019s behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 339-42. The Second Circuit remanded the case to the district court to determine, under state law, whether the mother was the beneficiary of a constructive trust on the cost bond. <em>Id. </em>at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The district court erred when it refused to adjudicate Carmen\u2019s motion to dissolve or stay the writ of execution. Because the district court had a duty to determine what, if any, \u201csubstantial nonexempt interest\u201d Lawrence held in the apartment, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3203(a), 3013, when the United States levied against the property, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3203(b), we vacate the order that denied Carmen\u2019s motion. On remand, the district court must determine the respective ownership interests, if any, of Carmen and Lawrence in the apartment when the United States obtained the writ of execution and whether Lawrence had a \u201csubstantial nonexempt interest\u201d in the apartment that the United States could levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">We VACATE the order that denied Carmen\u2019s motion to dissolve, and we REMAND for the district court to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
