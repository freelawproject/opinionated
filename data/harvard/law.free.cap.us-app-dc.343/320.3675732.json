EDWARDS, Chief Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AOT\">concurring in the denial of the petition for rehearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">In <em>United States v. Schaffer, </em>214 F.3d 1359 (D.C.Cir.2000) <em>(Schaffer II), </em>this court reversed a judgment of the District Court granting a new trial for defendant Schaffer. The trial judge had ruled that a new trial was warranted under Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because the testimony of Michael Espy, which was unavailable to the defendant during his first trial, was <em>neidy available </em>and likely to result in an acquittal if introduced in a new trial. <em>See id. </em>at 1361. We rejected this conclusion because the record revealed that Schaffer had failed to satisfy the requirements of <em>Thompson v. United States, </em>188 F.2d 652 (D.C.Cir.1951). <em>See id. </em>at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">In his petition for rehearing, Schaffer complains that, in applying the <em>Thompson </em>test of \u201cdiligence,\u201d the court in <em>Schaffer II </em>unjustly adopted a new <em>per se </em>rule with retroactive application. It is true that, in rejecting Schaffer\u2019s claim that he showed diligence in an attempt to procure Espy\u2019s testimony, the <em>Schaffer II </em>opinion states that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aey\">[w]hen, as here, a defendant believes that a particular person\u2019s testimony would be vital to his defense but either cannot locate the witness or believes it would be futile to subpoena him, the defendant has the obligation to seek a continuance of his trial or to explain to the trial court why the desired witness will not be produced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-18\"><em>Schaffer II, </em>214 F.3d at 1362. In retrospect, this could be viewed as a new <em>per se </em>rule, as Schaffer suggests. This was not the intention of the court in <em>Schaffer II, </em>however.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">The dispositive holding in <em>Schaffer II </em>on the issue of diligence is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMI\">a [mere] <em>belief </em>in the futility of ... action will not satisfy the need for a concrete attempt either to compel the production of relevant evidence or to seek some accommodation from the trial court that would preserve the defendant\u2019s right to present evidence that was critical to his case. Whatever the minimum requirement of diligence, it cannot be a purely private evaluation of the availability of the testimony or the likelihood of relief from the court. Such a standard would seriously impair the important goal of finality that the diligence requirement serves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-20\"><em>Schaffer II, </em>214 F.3d at 1362 (emphasis added). This is not a new <em>per se </em>rule retroactively applied to Schaffer. It flows directly from <em>Thompson </em>and other cases construing Rule 33. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">In order to invoke Rule 33, a \u201cparty seeking [a] new trial must [have shown] diligence in the attempt to procure the newly discovered evidence.\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>188 F.2d at 653. The District Court in the instant case opined that the record facts on diligence \u201care not in dispute.\u201d <em>United States v. Schaffer, </em>83 F.Supp.2d 52, 55 (D.D.C.1999). The trial judge went on to find \u201cno basis on which to conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>counsel\u2019s <em>wish </em>to have Espy testify was not genuine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57 (emphasis added). No one could suppose, however, that this was a finding of \u201cdiligence\u201d as required by <em>Thompson. </em>The District .Court then concluded that \u201cdiligent efforts were made to adduce Espy\u2019s testimony\u201d when Schaffer\u2019s counsel conferred with Espy\u2019s counsel and then made forthright representations to the District Court about the unavailability of Espy\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 58. The problem, however, as the District Court seemed to recognize, is that Schaffer\u2019s decision not to take concrete action to <em>procure </em>Espy\u2019s testimony was based on his personal surmise that any such action would be futile. We have no reason to doubt that Schaffer\u2019s counsel intended to be responsible and act professionally. Nonetheless, there is no evidence of \u201cdiligence in the attempt to procure\u201d Espy\u2019s testimony as <em>Thompson </em>requires. The District Court was simply wrong to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Schaffer suggests that he failed to take concrete action because he subscribed to an untested belief that it would have been futile to subpoena Espy and an unverified view that a continuance would not have been granted. That is all that he offered to show diligence, and <em>Schaffer II </em>says that it is far short of what is required by <em>Thompson. </em>There is no mistake in this conclusion. The suggestion in the petition for rehearing that the court erred in adopting a new <em>per se </em>rule in <em>Schaffer II </em>is a red herring. In any event, lest there be any confusion on this point, we make it clear now that the judgment in this case does not rest on any <em>per se </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Schaffer also complains that, in reversing the District Court, the decision in <em>Schaffer II </em>fails to give due deference to the trial judge\u2019s view that Espy\u2019s testimony would likely result in an acquittal. There is merit to this contention, for it has long been said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">findings on conflicting evidence by trial courts on motions for new trial based on newly discovered evidence remain undisturbed except for most extraordinary circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-11\"><em>United States v. Johnson, </em>327 U.S. 106, 111, 66 S.Ct. 464, 90 L.Ed. 562 (1946). \u201cIf there is an issue of credibility of the newly discovered evidence, the role of the judge is that of fact finder, and his resolution of the fact issues is ordinarily not reviewable on appeal.\u201d 3 Charles Alan Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 557, at 336 (2d ed. 1982). Thus, we review the District Court\u2019s grant or denial of a new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>See Langevine v. District of Columbia, </em>106 F.3d 1018, 1023 (D.C.Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">In cases in which a motion for a new trial is granted, \u201cthe degree of appellate scrutiny of new trial rulings should depend on the reasons given for the awarding of a new trial.\u201d <em>Vander Zee v. Karabatsos, </em>589 F.2d 723, 728 (D.C.Cir.1978). When, for example, a motion is granted on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, a higher degree of scrutiny will be applied by the appellate court, because of \u201cthe concern that a judge\u2019s nullification of the jury\u2019s verdict may encroach on the jury\u2019s important fact-finding function.\u201d <em>Tri County Indus. Inc. v. District of Columbia, </em>200 F.3d 836, 840 (D.C.Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Langevine, </em>106 F.3d at 1023 (quoting <em>Vander Zee, </em>589 F.2d at 729)), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 121 S.Ct. 29, 147 L.Ed.2d 1051 (2000). However, when the District Court orders a new trial \u201cbecause confusing testimony and events created a potential for injustice, not because the jury\u2019s verdict is against the weight of the evidence!,] ... [o]nly the grossest abuse of discretion could justify reinstating the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Schneider v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>658 F.2d 835, 849 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 994, 102 S.Ct. 1622, 71 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982). In light of this highly deferential standard of review, I cannot say that the District Court erred in applying the \u201cprobably-produce-an-aequittal\u201d prong of the <em>Thompson </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-15\">The trial judge observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>[bjecause the evidence of Schaffer\u2019s specific unlawful intent was so thin \u2014 it was an entirely circumstantial case on which the jury could have decided either way, <em>Schaffer, </em>183 F.3d at 850 \u2014 the proffered evidence about the nature of the [Arkansas Poultry Federation] meeting and Espy\u2019s reasons for attending has an important bearing on the \u201cintent question.\u201d I find it indeed to be of such nature that, in a new trial, it would probably produce an acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\"><em>United States v. Schaffer, </em>83 F.Supp.2d at 54-55. The <em>Schaffer II </em>opinion mistakenly doubts the relevance of the Espy testimony and, therefore, concludes that its introduction in a new trial \u201cwould do little to undermine the independent counsel\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Schaffer II, </em>214 F.3d at 1363. However, because the Espy testimony cannot fairly be rejected as irrelevant, and because the District Court was in the best position to evaluate Espy\u2019s believability and the likely effect of Espy\u2019s testimony on the rest of the evidence, it was a mistake for this court to second-guess the trial judge on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">This court\u2019s failure to give deference to the District Court on the probably-produce-an-acquittal prong of <em>Thompson </em>does not save the day for Schaffer, however. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Rule 33 may be applied in the absence of \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence, Schaffer\u2019s demand for a new trial nonetheless fails for want of <em>diligence. </em>Furthermore, although the decision in <em>Schaffer II </em>expresses skepticism regarding the applicability of Rule 33 in cases involving \u201cnewly available\u201d (as opposed to \u201cnewly discovered\u201d) evidence, <em>see Schaffer II, </em>214 F.3d at 1363, Schaffer\u2019s petition has not persuaded this court to perform a juridic <em>tour de force </em>as regards the contours of Rule 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">This result, admittedly, produces a curious disposition, indeed, one that is somewhat troublesome. Traditionally, we defer to the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion to grant a new trial on grounds that there is a fair likelihood of acquittal. In this case, however, we are obliged to ignore this powerful consideration. Defendant simply failed to act with the diligence required by <em>Thompson, </em>and such failure is fatal.' My concern over this curious application of the <em>Thompson </em>factors is, in my view, noteworthy, though not peremptory. In the end analysis, it is far from clear that this case involves newly discovered evidence which Rule 33 absolutely requires, so Schaffer\u2019s case fails in any event under the existing Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">In short, I can find no basis upon which to set aside the judgment of the court in <em>Schaffer II. </em>The petition for rehearing must therefore be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b341-10\">KAREN LeCRAFT HENDERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AEF\">concurring separately:</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">While I agree that Schaffer\u2019s petition for rehearing should be denied on the ground that the panel decision correctly held defense counsel failed to exercise due diligence in attempting to procure Espy\u2019s testimony, I do not believe we should uphold the district court\u2019s finding that Espy\u2019s testimony, had the jury heard it, would likely have led to Schaffer\u2019s acquittal. This trial record reveals no \u201cconfusing testimony and events.\u201d <em>See </em>Edwards Op. at 286 (quoting <em>Schneider v. Lockheed Aircraft Corp., </em>658 F.2d 835, 848 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 994, 102 S.Ct. 1622, 71 L.Ed.2d 855 (1982)). Nor was the district court called upon to assess the \u201cbelievability\u201d or \u201ccredibility\u201d of Espy\u2019s testimony. <em>See id. </em>at 286. The district court\u2019s role was simply to determine whether largely irrelevant evidence would have persuaded the jury to render a different verdict. And I continue to believe the district court got it wrong.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
