Code, \u00a7 187), and with use of a firearm in commission of the crime (Pen. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>\u00a7 12022.5). He was tried and convicted of both the offense and the enhancement. His motion for new trial was denied, and defendant has appealed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Late one Friday evening defendant Vernon McKinzie returned home from his job as security guard. For several days, the victim Linda Pallireto had been in the process of breaking off their off-and-on, live-in relationship; their last argument had occurred that Friday morning. When McKinzie arrived at the house the two shared, he found it dark. He decided to go across the street to see if Linda was at her cousin Susan\u2019s house. Linda and Susan were at home in the living room, watching television; Susan\u2019s three-year-old was asleep in another room. Linda lay on Susan\u2019s couch, her crippled leg propped up, and a partially consumed 12-pack of beer was accessible beside the sofa.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Of the next series of events, there were only two surviving witnesses, Susan and defendant, both of whom testified. By Susan\u2019s account, within minutes of defendant\u2019s arrival home, which she witnessed through her living room window, he ^/as banging at her front door, demanding to see Linda. Linda spoke to him from her position on the couch, through the door which remained closed, and told him they had nothing to talk about, and that she was not going home. The defendant left, returned to the \u201cshared\u201d house, and entered. Linda and Susan heard a crash, and could see that the window cooler had been thrown through the glass. Soon Susan saw a fire in the kitchen across the street, which, according to defendant, he had made in a pot on the stove to attract the women\u2019s attention. Susan then heard the sound of defendant\u2019s jeep being moved, and defendant again appeared, this time at the kitchen window on the side of Susan\u2019s house facing out into the darkened carport. Again he attempted to get Linda to come home, and said he needed money. The two women remained in the living room, and Linda responded from her position on the couch, asking defendant about $100 missing from her checking account. Defendant chastised Linda for her continued beer drinking. The conversation became heated, and Susan heard the sound of a window breaking. Susan\u2019s child was awakened, more acrimonious words were exchanged about the wakened child and broken window, and again defendant left Susan\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">About eight to nine minutes later, Susan heard a click which sounded like the bolt of a gun being drawn back. Apparently Linda thought the same, for she asked Susan if she had a gun in the house. The house contained no gun and no telephone. Immediately after the clicking noise, defendant called out from his position at the kitchen window, saying he would go home if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Linda gave him some beer. Linda got up, and without crutches, laboriously made her way to the kitchen window, carrying one can of beer. She arrived at the window, and held up the can of beer. A conversation of about 20 seconds ensued between defendant and Linda, which Susan did not hear. Linda pivoted on her bad leg, gave Susan a wry look which Susan interpreted as indicating that Linda had capitulated, \u201cthat she was going to go out the front door and then he was going to beat the crap out of her.\u201d According to Susan\u2019s testimony, Linda turned away from the window, and four to five shots rang out in rapid succession. In fact, three shots were fired, and Linda was hit by three hollow point fragmenting bullets, all in the abdominal area.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Defendant burst through the front door, rifle in hand, and kneeled down beside Linda, pointed the rifle at her, and said \u201cI told you. I told you. Oh God how could I have killed somebody that I love.\u201d Linda however, was not dead, and defendant picked her up, demanded the use of Susan\u2019s car, and rushed Linda to the High Desert Hospital. As he pulled up to the emergency entrance, the security guard testified that defendant handed over the victim, admitted the shooting, and asked the guard to arrest him. When the guard refused to arrest him, defendant, who feared being shot himself by the victim\u2019s mother, ran off. Defendant did not say to the guard that the shooting was accidental. Within minutes, defendant showed up at the Morongo Substation, approached the deputy on duty, and said \u201cI\u2019m in trouble. I think I\u2019ll be safer here. I love her. I don\u2019t know why I did it.\u201d Again, amid the torrent of words, there was still nothing said about the shooting having been accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Linda died approximately one month later from complications which had resulted from her wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Discussion<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Error in Involuntary Manslaughter Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">The instructions given in connection with involuntary manslaughter included an instruction on misdemeanor manslaughter, based on the inherently dangerous misdemeanor violation of Penal Code section 417, subdivision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>(a)(2), brandishing a weapon. Also given was an instruction on criminally negligent manslaughter, killing resulting from the doing of a <em>lawful </em>act in an unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection. On this point, we understand defendant\u2019s argument to be the following: defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of brandishing a weapon, therefore the jury was left to convict defendant of either first degree murder, or criminally negligent involuntary manslaughter. Because all of defendant\u2019s acts were <em>unlawful </em>(defendant lists trespass and vandalism, among others), the jury would not find the criminal negligence manslaughter instruction applicable, and would therefore convict defendant of first degree murder in order to convict him of any crime at all. Theoretically, however, if defendant had committed a <em>felony </em>not inherently dangerous to human life, but committed without due caution and circumspection, another theory of involuntary manslaughter would be available to him, resulting in the possibility of conviction of a lesser crime than first degree piurder. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Burroughs </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 824, 835 [201 Cal.Rptr. 319, 678 P.2d 894]; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(1975) 49 Cal.App.3d 134 [122 Cal.Rptr. 157].) Defendant argues, by analogy to this \u201cfelony manslaughter\u201d doctrine, that the misdemeanor manslaughter doctrine should be extended to <em>noninherently </em>dangerous misdemeanors committed without due caution and circumspection, and that he should have been given the benefit of such an extension in the instructions to the jury. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 6, 11, fn. 5 [131 Cal.Rptr. 311] for a discussion of the need to rewrite the involuntary manslaughter statute.)</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">It should be apparent from the structure of the argument outlined above, unless we find insufficient evidence to convict defendant of a violation of Penal Code section 417, subdivision (a)(2), that we never reach defendant\u2019s bid for extension of the misdemeanor manslaughter doctrine. Defendant\u2019s primary argument is that a violation of Penal Code section 417, subdivision (a)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires the brandishing of a weapon to occur in the <em>presence </em>of the victim, requires <em>awareness </em>on the victim\u2019s part that a gun is being brandished. Defendant contends that there was no such awareness on the part of Linda, and therefore insufficient evidence to support the giving of a misdemeanor manslaughter instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">We have been directed to no decided cases in which the elements of a violation of Penal Code section 417, subdivision (a)(2) were at issue. De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>fendant cites us one case, <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavira </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 988 [83 Cal.Rptr. 851], for the following language: \u201c[Defendant committed a violation of \u00a7 417], since the record clearly shows that the weapon was seen by the victims, was pointed at them, and fired; every element of a violation of section 417 appears.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>at p. 992.) Defendant would have us believe that the recitation by the court of the fact that the victim saw the weapon was sufficient to elevate that fact to \u201celement\u201d status. However, the argument clearly fails. An examination of the statute and the applicable jury instruction (CALJIC No. 16.290) discloses that neither pointing the gun at the victim, nor firing it, also mentioned by the <em>Chavira </em>court, are elements of the crime. The court is obviously reciting the facts in that case which show a <em>clear </em>violation of the statute. The court does not purport to enunciate the factual <em>minima, </em>the \u201celements,\u201d required for a violation. Defendant cannot have his cake and eat it too; if the victim\u2019s awareness of the weapon is an element, so are pointings and firings. That the latter two are not is a clear <em>reductio ad absurdum </em>of defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">We have found other cases which, although failing to consciously enunciate all elements of a Penal Code section 417, subdivision (a)(2) violation, clearly indicate that the victim\u2019s <em>awareness </em>of the weapon that is \u201cin her presence\u201d is not one of them. <em>People </em>v. <em>Norton </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d Supp. 14 [146 Cal.Rptr. 343] held that a violation of Penal Code section 417 is a general intent crime <em>(id., </em>at pp. 25-26); <em>People </em>v. <em>Mercer </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 803 [169 Cal.Rptr. 897], indicates the offense is complete on <em>exhibition </em>of the weapon in a rude, angry, or threatening manner. Finally, the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Andrade </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 963 [150 Cal.Rptr. 662], stated \u201cThis misdemeanor does not involve much more than a possession. Arguably perhaps it is but a dangerous form of possession.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 971.)  There is nothing in any of these cases to support grafting upon the \u201cin the presence of a victim\u201d language a requirement that the victim be aware of the brandishing. For purposes of the conduct which the statute is meant to deter, it is enough that the brandishing be in public, in the presence of the victim, where some third party happening along might get the idea that either the victim or brandisher need help, or might think a brawl is in the making which he might join. The thrust of the offense is to deter the public exhibition of weapons in a context of potentially volatile confrontations. The victim\u2019s unawareness of the weapon does little to mitigate the danger inherent in such situations,  Therefore, we decline to require the victim\u2019s awareness of the weapon in her presence for a violation of Penal Code section 417, subdivision (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is that there was insufficient evidence that the firing of the weapon was intentional. As we have said before, firing the weapon is not an element of a Penal Code section 417, subdivision (a)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>violation. Defendant does not claim his possession of the weapon, which <em>is </em>an element, was unintentional, therefore the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding of violating Penal Code section 417, subdivision (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The conviction is affirmed.
