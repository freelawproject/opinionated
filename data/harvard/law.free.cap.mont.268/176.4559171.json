Stuit moved for a new trial on the grounds that the prosecutor made a comment in her opening statement which should have allowed the defense to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s previous history of sexual abuse. The District Court prohibited the defense from introducing such evidence at trial. The District Court denied the motion for a new trial and Stuit appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">We frame the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">1. Did the prosecutor\u2019s comment during opening statements open the door to testimony regarding the victim\u2019s history of prior sexual abuse?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">2. Was the defendant prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s comment during opening statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>3. Did the District Court properly deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">On December 26, 1992, a Billings City Police Officer, Mark Keyes, responded to a domestic disturbance call at the residence where Stuit lived with the mother of S.M., a minor. The police placed Stuit under arrest for assault or domestic abuse and placed him in the Yellowstone County Detention Facility. Officer Keyes then returned to the residence to take an additional report. When he returned, S.M., her mother, her brother, and another person were at the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">While Officer Keyes was interviewing the mother, S.M. volunteered to him that she had been sexually abused by Stuit earlier that evening. Officer Keyes gathered more information from S.M. regarding the alleged sexual abuse and filed an initial report. Officer Keyes referred the initial report to the detective division for follow-up investigation. The Department of Family Services removed S.M. from the home, and Stuit was subsequently charged by information with four counts of sexual assault without consent and one count of witness tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Prior to trial, the State filed a motion in limine pursuant to Montana\u2019s rape shield provisions under \u00a7 45-5-511, MCA, to exclude evidence that S.M. had been sexually assaulted by another person prior to the alleged incidents with Stuit. Counsel met in the judge\u2019s chambers before trial to argue the motion. The transcript of the pretrial proceedings reveals that defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">We agree the Rape Shield Statute prevents us from bringing [S.M.\u2019s prior sexual abuse] up in our case in chief, however, we will notify the court and counsel that we intend to bring that up <em>if the door is opened. </em>We do feel especially medical personnel can open that door, and we feel \u2014 our position is that her knowledge of the sexual abuse \u2014 of sex itself can open that door through the testimony of the doctor, which is going to be offered here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">We made another motion in limine to keep out the testimony of [Dr. Johnson. If that motion is denied,] however, that testimony let\u2019s [sic] in the doctor\u2019s testimony that the child was honest; that she knew about things about sexual abuse, it\u2019s obvious that she could have gotten that information from her prior perpetrator, so we feel that if the doctor testifies to that, that opens the door and we should be able to mention that, because certainly that is something that obviously we would like to have in evidence, but we are not going to go against the Rape Shield Statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-q\">(Emphasis added). The State responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>In response to his arguments that were just made, all of the cases ... that is not admissible to impute knowledge of sexual abuse, simply isn\u2019t a way to get around the Rape Shield Statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-4\">I think the defense is trying to set up a way itself to violate the Rape Shield Statute through [D]octor Johnson. The state is not going to ask her and can\u2019t ask her, \u201cDo you think [S.M.] is being truthful\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The District Court then stated, \u201cThat certainly would be my ruling. You can\u2019t open the door. If you try, there [are] going to be some repercussions, I can assure you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The State then explained that the defendant might try to personally testify regarding S.M.\u2019s prior sexual abuse. The State argued that such testimony would not be admissible. The District Court told defense counsel to instruct the defendant that such testimony \u201cis not permissible, and that there can be other sanctions imposed if he attempts it.\u201d The District Court then granted the State\u2019s motion in limine to prohibit evidence and testimony regarding S.M.\u2019s prior sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">At trial, the prosecutor made the following comments in her opening statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-8\">During this trial you\u2019re going to find [S.M.] got to look back on childhood and get [sic] to remember a mom, as she will tell you, who was in the same bed with her when this man sexually abused her; while the person who was supposedly acting as her father, took away her innocence through sexual acts most consenting adults don\u2019t even engage in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Neither party made any objections during the other side\u2019s opening statement. At the close of defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, the State asked to approach the bench. Counsel for both parties approached and then met with the judge in chambers.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">The transcript reveals that a lengthy discussion took place in chambers. The State expressed its concern over defense counsel\u2019s opening statement, contending that he impermissibly mentioned S.M.\u2019s prior sexual abuse. Defense counsel argued that the State\u2019s reference to S.M.\u2019s innocence, in the context of this case, meant sexual innocence, and therefore, opened the door for testimony regarding S.M.\u2019s prior sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">[W]hat I couldn\u2019t quite understand is why there was no objection from the defense the moment that remark was made. Now the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>state apparently has got some objection to something you said, yet, there was no objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The attorneys attempted to explain their reasons for not objecting in a timely manner. The State argued that it did not want to call undue attention to defense counsel\u2019s mention of prior sexual abuse. Defense counsel stated that he had practiced in another state and did not think it was proper to object during the middle of opening statements. The District Court berated both sides for arguing during their opening statements and for failing to make timely objections. The District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">You have got to make the objection. If you don\u2019t, then the jury has already been tainted. I can\u2019t direct them to disregard it. Whole thing becomes moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">You\u2019re going to have to make the objection at the time so that we can handle it then, not come in chambers later in the day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The District Court finally told the State, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to open the door, you came dangerously close to doing that.\u201d However, the court concluded that \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a ruling [that] she opened the door at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">At trial, S.M. testified that during nine or more months when she was nine years old, Stuit sexually abused her approximately three times a week. S.M. testified that Stuit put his fingers and tongue into her vagina, put his penis into her mouth and ejaculated, and put his penis into her rectum. The State additionally called Dr. Linda Johnson and several law enforcement personnel, including Officer Keyes. No physical evidence of sexual abuse was produced by the State. The defense called two witnesses in addition to Duane Stuit. Stuit took the stand and denied committing the alleged acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The jury returned guilty verdicts on all four counts of sexual intercourse without consent and a not guilty verdict on the witness tampering count. Stuit moved the District Court for a new trial on the grounds that the prosecutor made an improper comment during opening statements. Both parties submitted briefs. The District Comb denied the motion and issued an order and memorandum on December 17,1993. Stuit appeals the denial of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\n<em>ISSUE 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Did the prosecutor\u2019s comment during opening statements open the door to testimony regarding S.M.\u2019s history of prior sexual abuse?</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The standard of review of discretionary district court rulings is an abuse of discretion standard, and we will affirm the district court\u2019s ruling absent a showing of clear error. <em>State v. Andersen </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 354, 358, 860 P.2d 115, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In its memorandum denying Stuit\u2019s motion for a new trial, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">Had counsel for the defendant made prompt objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statement, requesting either that it be stricken and the jury instructed to disregard it, or for a mistrial, the court would have been able to make a ruling. Moreover, defense counsel did not request such a ruling from the court, even in the hearing in chambers. As shown by the transcript of the hearing in chambers, counsel was more concerned with obtaining a ruling from the court to the effect that the remark had opened the door to evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual abuse. This, the court denied. (See page 17 of transcript.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">In essence, the defendant\u2019s motion is an attempt to get the court to reconsider its ruling denying counsel the opportunity to put in evidence the victim\u2019s past sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Section 46-20-104(2), MCA, provides that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">[u]pon appeal from a judgment, the court may review ... any alleged error objected to which involves the merits or necessarily affects the judgment. Failure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as provided in 46-20-701(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Section 46-20-701(2), MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded. No claim alleging an error affecting jurisdictional or constitutional rights may be noticed on appeal, if the alleged error was not objected to as provided in 46-20-104, unless the defendant establishes that the error was prejudicial as to his guilt or punishment <em>and that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">(a) the right asserted in the claim did not exist at the time of the trial and has been determined to be retroactive in its application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">(b) the prosecutor, the judge, or a law enforcement agency suppressed evidence from the defendant or his attorney that prevented the claim from being raised and disposed of; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-13\">(c) material and controlling facts upon which the claim is predicated were not known to the defendant or his attorney and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>We have stated that where a criminal defendant fails to make a contemporaneous objection to the prosecution\u2019s characterization of the facts during trial, this Court is precluded \u201cfrom addressing the issue under \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA, unless the criteria under \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, can be met or the comments create an exception to the \u2018plain error\u2019 doctrine.\u201d <em>State v. Arlington </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 127, 157, 875 P.2d 307, 325 (citing <em>State v. Rodgers </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 413, 417, 849 P.2d 1028, 1031). A contemporaneous objection is one which is made at trial in a timely manner and upon specific grounds, which appears on the record, and which is made as soon as the ground for the objection becomes apparent. See <em>Kizer v. Semitool, Inc. </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 199, 207, 824 P.2d 229, 234; <em>Story v. City of Bozeman </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 207, 217, 856 P.2d 202, 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Stuit asserts that \u201c[a]fter the close of opening statements by both sides, Stuit\u2019s counsel objected to the [prosecutor\u2019s] remarks\u201d regarding S.M.\u2019s innocence. Nowhere in the transcript, however, is an explicit statement made by defense counsel objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks regarding S.M.\u2019s innocence and stating the grounds for such objection. In fact, the record reveals that the discussion between counsel and the judge in chambers centered on the State\u2019s objection to defense counsel\u2019s opening statement. Stuit further asserts that the District Court \u201cacknowledged [that] the remarks were objectionable.\u201d While the District Court stated to the prosecutor, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to open the door, you came dangerously close to doing that,\u201d the court concluded that \u201cI\u2019m not going to make a ruling [that] she opened the door at this time.\u201d Stuit\u2019s assertion that the court \u201cacknowledged\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as \u201cobjectionable\u201d is a mischaracterization of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">We conclude that Stuit\u2019s counsel failed to make a contemporaneous objection to the prosecutor\u2019s comment during opening statements, that Stuit does not meet the criteria under \u00a7 46-20-701(2), and therefore, the doctrine of plain error is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Stuit further argues that the reason his</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">counsel did not move the court for a mistrial or to instruct the jury to disregard the statement [was] that neither [option] was the relief which was proper at the time. ... A new trial ... was not in Stuit\u2019s best interest at the time of the objection because it would only have the effect of putting Stuit back in the same position as he was at the start of the trial, namely, unable to explain to the jury how S.M. could be making these charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>In essence, the defense chose not to object because it hoped that the prosecution had opened the door for the defense to introduce evidence \u201cto explain to the jury how S.M. could be making these charges,\u201d that is, to explain that she had been sexually abused by another person in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Where the defendant is charged with a sex crime, \u00a7 45-5-511, MCA, governs the admissibility of evidence concerning the sexual conduct of the victim. Subsections (2) and (3) of \u00a7 45-5-511, MCA, are referred to as the \u201crape shield\u201d provisions and provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">(2) No evidence concerning the sexual conduct of the victim is admissible in prosecutions under this part except evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual conduct with the offender or evidence of specific instances of the victim\u2019s sexual activity to show the origin of semen, pregnancy, or disease which is at issue in the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">(3) If the defendant proposes for any purpose to offer evidence described in subsection (2), the trial judge shall order a hearing out of the presence of the jury to determine whether the proposed evidence is admissible under subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">The standard of review for the application of the rape shield provisions is a manifest abuse of discretion standard. <em>State v. Howell </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 438, 445, 839 P.2d 87, 91, <em>cert. denied </em>(1993), 113 S. Ct. 1862, 123 L.Ed.2d 483; <em>State v. Van Dyken </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 415, 435, 791 P.2d 1350, 1362-63, <em>cert. denied </em>(1990), 498 U.S. 920, 111 S.Ct. 297, 112 L.Ed.2d 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">It is well-settled law that the prior sexual abuse of the victim is inadmissible under the rape shield provisions. <em>Howell, </em>839 P.2d at 92; <em>State v. Rhyne </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 513, 519, 833 P.2d 1112, 1116; <em>State v. Van Pelt </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 99, 103, 805 P.2d 549, 552; <em>State v. Kao </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 263, 269-70, 800 P.2d 714, 717-18. We have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront witnesses is not violated by the exclusion of evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual abuse unless the victim\u2019s accusations or allegations of prior sexual abuse have been proven to be false or are admitted to be false.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtA\"><em>Rhyne, </em>833 P.2d at 1116; <em>Howell, </em>839 P.2d at 91; <em>Van Pelt, </em>805 P.2d at 552. Stuit does not allege that S.M.\u2019s allegations of prior sexual abuse are false.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Stuit argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">[O]bviously, in a case where a 10 year old\u2019s testimony is the only evidence for the state and that child has been a victim of the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>crime before, any implication by the prosecutor that the defendant was the only abuser is improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In <em>Van </em>Pelt, 805 P.2d at 552, this Court rejected a similar argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah_\">Appellant cannot argue ... that he does not seek to attack [the child]\u2019s credibility but rather seeks to demonstrate that [the child] could have gained her knowledge of sex outside of her contact with defendant. The major purpose in appellant\u2019s attempt to bring into evidence the incidents of prior abuse is to attack [the child]\u2019s credibility. Whether under the guise of showing the jury how [the child] may have obtained her knowledge of sex, or not, the fact is appellant wished to convince the jury that [the child] fabricated the charges against him. The only way the jury could have found appellant not guilty ... would be by finding that [the child]\u2019s allegations were false. This is not to say that [the rape shield provisions] provide]] an impenetrable wall of protection for [the child] and does not allow for her credibility to be questioned or attacked. The Montana Rules of Evidence certainly allow the credibility of a witness to be attacked, however, these rules are not without limitation. See Rule 608, M.R.Evid. <em>Excluding evidence of alleged specific instances of prior abuse was within the discretion of the District Court.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">(Emphasis added.) AccordNbo, 800 P.2d at 718 (rape shield provisions provide no exception to warrant admission of evidence of prior sexual abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We conclude that the District Court properly ruled that the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not open the door to testimony regarding S.M.\u2019s prior sexual abuse. The District Court did not manifestly abuse its discretion in prohibiting under the rape shield provisions testimony regarding S.M.\u2019s prior sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\n<em>ISSUE 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">Was the defendant prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s comment during opening statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">In <em>Rhyne, </em>833 P.2d at 1120, this Court rejected a defendant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutor, in jury voir dire, asked whether the panelists \u201cwould feel uncomfortable telling a group of people the details of his or her first sexual experience.\u201d The defendant in that case argued on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s question implied to the jury panelists that the alleged acts of incest were the child\u2019s first sexual experiences. The defendant argued that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s comment denied him a fair trial because he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>allowed to present any \u2018possible explanation for [the child\u2019s] motives, biases and prejudices other than his guilt to the offense charged.\u201d <em>Rhyne, </em>833 P.2d at 1120. In rejecting Rhyne\u2019s argument, we cited <em>State v. Miller </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 497, 507, 757 P.2d 1275, 1281, in holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">\u201c[i]t has long been the law of this state that prejudice in a criminal case will not be presumed, but must appear from the denial or invasion of a substantial right from which the law imputes prejudice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkC\"><em>Rhyne, </em>833 P.2d at 1120. In <em>Rhyne, </em>we concluded that the defendant failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s comment during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Our review of the record reveals that the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not suggest that the alleged acts were S.M.\u2019s first sexual experiences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5m\">[S.M.] doesn\u2019t care much for girl stuff. Kind of a tomboy at heart. Most of us get to look back on our childhoods; our families with love and affection. During this trial, you\u2019re going to find [S.M.] got to look back on her childhood and get [sic] to remember a mom, as she will tell you, who was in the same bed with her when this man sexually abused her; while the person who was supposedly acting as her father, took away her innocence through sexual acts most consenting adults don\u2019t even engage in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">When we look back to our childhoods, when we were nine, we get to remember things like school, picnics, softball games, being tucked into bed at night, being read bedtime stories by parents who loved us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Moreover, unlike defense counsel in <em>Rhyne, </em>defense counsel in the instant case failed to object at the time of the comment. Stuit failed to request that the District Court admonish the jury, nor did he request a mistrial. We conclude that Stuit has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s comment during her opening statement and that he was not denied a fair trial as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\n<em>ISSUE 3</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">Did the District Court properly deny Stuit\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"Af4\">\u201cThe decision to grant or deny a new trial is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Jim\u2019s Excavating Services, Inc. v. HKM Associates </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 494, 512, 878 P.2d 248, 259. For the reasons enunciated under Issue 1, we conclude that the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Court did not abuse its discretion and properly denied Stuit\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HARRISON, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
