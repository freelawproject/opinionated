SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b303-29\">Gary Faour seeks review,' pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342, of a final order of the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>(\u201cUSDA\u201d) finding that Faour was \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d with the Magnolia Fruit &amp; Vegetable Company (\u201cMagnolia\u201d) during a time when Magnolia committed \u201crepeated and flagrant\u201d violations of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (\u201cPACA\u201d), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499a <em>et seq. </em>We deny the petition for review and affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Faour started in the produce industry as a young boy, working in his parent\u2019s family business. He and his three brothers eventually inherited the business and incorporated it as Magnolia in 1969. Magnolia engaged in the wholesale purchase and sale of fruits and vegetables until it filed for bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Faour served Magnolia in various capacities. At Magnolia\u2019s inception, he was its vice-president and assistant secretary. In 1986, he was still vice-president but no longer assistant secretary. He also served as a director until 1987. In the mid-1980\u2019s, he was the food service sales manager, and in 1987 he served as manager for institutional sales. Initially, in 1969, Faour owned 27.27% of the company\u2019s outstanding stock; in 1986, he owned only 10.5%.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">On September 11, 1987, Faour left his job at Magnolia. On October 1, 1987, he wrote a letter to his brother, Kenneth, in which he submitted his resignation as a director and officer. He claimed that this resignation was effective as of September 14, 1987. The letter did not mention Faour's stock ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">In the mid-1980\u2019s, Magnolia started to encounter financial difficulties. On October 1, 1986, Faour signed a security agreement for a loan to Magnolia for $972,148.07 from Woodforest National Bank. Under the agreement, all of Faour\u2019s Magnolia stock served as security for the loan, and Faour was precluded from selling, transferring, or assigning the stock without the bank\u2019s prior written consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">Magnolia\u2019s financial problems continued, leading to its filing for bankruptcy protection in 1988. In early 1989, the USDA filed a complaint against Magnolia, alleging that it had committed fifty-four violations of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499b(4)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from August through December 1987 by failing to make full and prompt payment of a total of $213,666.07 to nineteen sellers of perishable agricultural commodities. Ten of the violations involved transactions that required Magnolia to make full payment by September 30, 1987. The payment due dates, names of the unpaid sellers, and amounts owed are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-11\">8-25-87 Nagel Produce Co. $ 1,629.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbG\">8-28-87 Live Oak Farms 53.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Auo\">9-11-87 Live Oak Farms 3,389.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE5\">9-12-87 Nagel Produce Co. 900.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAxl\">9-19-87 Live Oak Farms 4,996.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alc\">9-27-87 C.H.

The USDA affirmed the AU\u2019s decision. In <em>Magnolia Fruit &amp; Produce Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Agric. (\u201cMagnolia </em>I\u201d), No. 90-4643, slip op. at 14, 930 F.2d 916 (5th Cir. Apr. 3, 1991) (unpublished), we affirmed the USDA\u2019s determination that Magnolia had committed repeated violations during the period at issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In February 1989, the USDA notified Faour that it considered him to have been \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d with Magnolia during a time when Magnolia had committed repeated violations of PACA. Faour replied in writing that he was not responsibly connected. The Department decided Faour was responsibly connected. Faour appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On August 1, 1991, a presiding officer, assigned by the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service, held a hearing at which Faour challenged the initial \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d determination. The presiding officer found, among other things, that Faour was an officer and director of Magnolia until at least September 14, 1987, but noted that since Faour did not write his resignation letter until October 1, 1987, that date (October 1) was \u201cmore likely considered the actual date of his resignation.\u201d The presiding officer additionally found that though Faour pledged his ownership of 10.5% of Magnolia\u2019s stock as collateral for the loan, he never abandoned his stock ownership. The presiding officer concluded that because Faour was an officer, director, and holder of more than ten percent of Magnolia\u2019s stock during a time when Magnolia committed repeated violations of PACA, Faour was responsibly connected with Magnolia under section 499a(b)(9)(B). On July 24,1992, the Administrator affirmed the decision of the presiding officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">We shall uphold an agency decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). Further, we shall uphold an agency\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Federal Trade Comm\u2019n v. Indiana Fed\u2019n of Dentists, </em>476 U.S. 447, 454, 106 S.Ct. 2009, 2016, 90 L.Ed.2d 445 (1986). Legal issues, \u201cby contrast, [are] for the courts to resolve, although even in considering such issues the courts are to give some deference to the [agency\u2019s] informed judgment....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-13\">Congress has decided that no licensee under PACA shall employ any person who has been \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d with any organization which has committed any \u201cflagrant or repeated violation\u201d of section 499b. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 499h(b)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 499a(b)(9) defines \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-15\">affiliated or connected with a commission merchant, dealer, or broker as (A) partner in a partnership, or (B) officer, di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>rector, or holder of more than 10 per centum of the outstanding stock of a corporation or association.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">We find the plain meaning of this statute unambiguous. If a person is an officer or director of, or holds over ten percent of the outstanding stock of, a corporation that has been found to have committed any flagrant or repeated violation of section 499b, that person is considered \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d and subject to sanctions under PACA. The statute is explicit: If a person falls within one of the three enumerated categories, he is responsibly connected. The statute does not contemplate a defense that allows a person to show that even though he fits into one of the three categories, he never had enough actual authority to be considered truly responsibly connected.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Despite this plain language, Faour asks us to find that his actual connection to Magnolia was so \u201cnominal,\u201d and that he was so \u201cblameless\u201d for any of Magnolia\u2019s violations, that we should not find him responsibly connected under section 499h(b)(2). In essence, Faour argues that we should employ the interpretation of the statute that the District of Columbia Circuit has adopted, an interpretation that reads a re-buttable presumption into the statute. Under this presumption, we would presume a person to be responsibly connected if he fit into any of three categories listed in section 499a(b)(9) but would allow him to rebut this presumption by proving that his position was simply nominal. We reject this formulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">In <em>Quinn v. Butz, </em>510 F.2d 743, 751 (D.C.Cir.1975), a court determined, for the first time, that the presumption was rebut-table rather than absolute. The court found that a person who held the title of vice-president was not \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d to a corporation that had committed flagrant and repeated violations of PACA because he neither participated in the management of the corporation nor had the power to participate. <em>Id. </em>at 753. The court rejected an interpretation of the statute that rested upon \u201ca literal reading of the language_\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">The District of Columbia Circuit adhered to this interpretation in <em>Minotto v. United States Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>711 F.2d 406, 409 (D.C.Cir.1983). The court found that a bookkeeper of a corporation who later became one of five members of the board of directors was not \u201cresponsibly connected\u201d because her position was no more than nominal. <em>Id. </em>at 407-08. Because the defendant \u201clacked both the training and the experience to be an active director\u201d and had no real authority, the court determined that she was not responsibly connected. <em>Id. </em>at 409. To be responsibly connected, the court pronounced, there must be \u201cevidence of an actual, significant nexus with the violating company.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">Other circuits considering this issue have disagreed with the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s interpretation of section 499a(b)(9). Instead of reading a rebuttable presumption into the statute, they have adopted what has become known as the <em>\u201cper se </em>rule.\u201d The first court to consider this statute was the Third Circuit in <em>Birkenfield v. United States, </em>369 F.2d 491 (3d Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">The court in <em>Birkenfield </em>definitively rejected the argument that a treasurer, director, and stockholder of a corporation found to have violated PACA should not be found responsibly connected because he never had real responsibility in the corporation\u2019s affairs. <em>Id. </em>at 494. The court examined the history of section 499a(b)(9) and concluded that Congress had rationally crafted this statute to establish a <em>per se </em>exclusionary standard. <em>Id. </em>Simply holding the position of director or officer, or owning ten percent of the corporation\u2019s stock, was enough to be responsibly connected. Id.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">More recently, in <em>Pupillo v. United States, 755 </em>F.2d 638, 643 (8th Cir.1985), the court explicitly rejected the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s rebuttable presumption approach and embraced the <em>per se </em>rule as the \u201cpreferable approach.\u201d The court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>that a strict reading of the language of the rule added objectivity and certainty to the law. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the court noted that in drafting the statute, Congress intended to help courts avoid confusion in \u201cinterpretation by allowing a person to be found responsibly connected regardless of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 643-44. The court concluded that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\">per se analysis of Section 499a[b](9) better accomplishes Congress\u2019 objective of providing a clear definition of \u201cresponsibly connected,\u201d and that Congress did not intend to require proof of personal fault to penalize a person associated with a PACA violator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">We too reject the rebuttable presumption approach in favor of the <em>per se </em>rule that the plain language of section 499a(b)(9) commands. This language shows that Congress intended for any person who falls into any one of the three enumerated categories to be considered responsibly connected. We see no reason to look beyond the unambiguous language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Having decided to apply the <em>per se </em>rule, we examine whether Faour fits into any of the three categories. He admits that he was an officer and director of Magnolia until September 14, 1987. He argues that although Magnolia admitted committing many violations of PACA, none of them occurred before September 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Unfortunately for Faour, the facts do not support his argument. In <em>Magnolia I, </em>we affirmed the USDA\u2019s final decision to the effect that Magnolia had committed repeated violations of PACA from August through December 1987. The department\u2019s decision specifically referred to fifty-four transactions leading to violations of PACAr of which four occurred before September 14, 1987. These four violations consisted of Magnolia\u2019s failing to make full and prompt payment to produce companies as required by section 499b(4) on August 25, August 28, September 11, and Septem- ' ber 12, 1987.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">In <em>Magnolia I, </em>slip op. at 6, we pointed out that for a violation to be \u201crepeated,\u201d it \u201crequires little, if anything, beyond \u2018more than once....\u2019\u201d Magnolia committed at least four violations during the period when Faour agrees he was still a director and officer. Faour would have us determine that none of the four violations occurring prior to September 14 was actually a violation because in <em>Magnolia I, </em>we never made specific findings on the dates and amounts of individual violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">We shall not independently make a factual determination of each violation. Our standard of review requires us to uphold the department\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence. In this case, the presiding officer, relying upon our opinion in <em>Magnolia I, </em>found that Magnolia had committed repeated violations of PACA from August through December 1987. Substantial evidence supports this finding. In <em>Magnolia I, </em>we affirmed the USDA\u2019s final decision, which specifically referred to each of the four violations occurring prior to September 14. This is ample evidence for us to uphold the presiding officer\u2019s determination that violations took place while Faour was a director and officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">Finally, we note that Faour and the USDA disagree about whether Faour still owned over ten percent of Magnolia\u2019s outstanding stock during the time Magnolia committed repeated PACA violations. We need not resolve this dispute. Under section 499a(b)(9), Faour need only fall into one of three categories \u2014 either a director, an officer, <em>or </em>a holder of more than ten percent of the stock \u2014 to be found \u201cresponsibly connected.\u201d We have found that Fa-our was a vice-president and director until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>at least September 14, a period during which Magnolia committed four violations of section 499b(4). Accordingly, we DENY the petition for review and AFFIRM the Administrator\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-16\">.

We note that a controversy exists over the date Faour effectively relinquished his positions as director and officer.

The USDA counters that his resignation became effective only on October 1, the day Faour sent his letter. We need not resolve this dispute.
