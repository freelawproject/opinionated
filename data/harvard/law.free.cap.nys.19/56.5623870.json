McNeary to review the action of Charles F. Mac-Lean and others, as police commissioners, etc., in dismissing relator from his office of patrolman. Respondents moved to dismiss the writ on the ground that it was not obtained within the statutory period of four months, as required by Code Civil Froc. \u00a7 2125. Relator contended that, even though the writ was not obtained within four months, taking together sections 2133 and 413 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it was a matter of limitation, and must be pleaded. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 2125, provides: \u201cSubject to the provisions of the next section, a writ of <em>certiorari </em>to review a determination must be granted and served within four calendar months after the determination to be reviewed becomes final and binding upon the relator, or the person whom he represents, either in law or in fact.\u201d Section 2.133 provides: \u201cAny order may be made or proceeding taken in the case, in relation to any matter not provided for in this article, as a similar proceeding may be taken in an action brought in the same court.\u201d Section 413 provides: \u201cThe objection that the action was not commenced within the time limited can be taken only by answer,\u201d etc.' Respondents appeal from an order denying their motion to dismiss the writ.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AUg\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b77-6\">Argued before Van Bbttnt, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3D\">This motion was founded upon the fact that it appeared upon the face of the petition that the <em>certiorari </em>had not been granted and served within the time provided by section 2125 of the Code. It is conceded that such was the fact, but it is claimed that such objection must be raised by answer, in consequence of the provisions of section 2133 of the \u25a0Code, which is as follows: \u201c Any order may be made \u201cor proceeding taken in the cause in relation to any matter not provided for in this article, as a similar proceeding may be taken in an action brought in the same court.\u201d It is clear that this section cannot be held to require pleadings upon, a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>because <em>a certiorari </em>is a writ of review exclusively, and the return to the writ must be taken as conclusive, and acted on as true. If false in fact, the remedy is an action for a false return; and if insufficient in form, by applying for a further and more specific return. <em>People </em>v. <em>Fire Com\u2019rs, </em>73 N. Y. 437. The provisions of the section referred to apply, undoubtedly, to such proceedings as may be requisite and proper, after a return has been made, for the purpose of bringing the same on for review, or having \u25a0the return made more specific, if such relief is proper. But there is no way in which the question as to whether the court should have granted the writ can be brought up, except upon a motion to set aside the writ. It is urged that the only method in which the appellants could claim the advantage of the statute of limitations contained in section 2125 is by setting the same up in the return. It is apparent that such cannot be the rule, because the Code requires no defense to the issuance of the writ to be returned, but simply the proceedings upon which the judgment of the inferior tribunal was founded. Where it appears upon the face of the petition that the statute has run, it is not necessary that the fact should be brought before the court in any other manner. It is to be observed that the writ of <em>certiorari </em>issues out of the supreme court, and that the return is made to the supreme court, and is filed with the county clerk; and it is only the hearing of the merits which is to be had at the general term. All incidental motions should be heard at the spe\u25a0c.al term. We think, therefore, that the court was in error in denying the motion, and the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, \u2022and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
