The' summons referred to bears date April 17, 1891, and directed the defendant to answer the complaint and to'serve a copy of his answer on plaintiff\u2019s attorneys within six days after the service thereof, etc. The action was brought, as stated in the complaint, to recover the amount of two checks, drawn by defendant upon the Importers\u2019 &amp; Traders\u2019 Bank. Service of the summons, .complaint, affidavit, and order of publication and notice was made on the 9th day of September, 1891, in the state of Connecticut, on the defendant personally. An affidavit made by John Jeroloman, one of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, on the 14th day of December, 1891, states \u201cthat no answer, demurrer, or notice of appearance has been received or served in pursuance of the requirement of the summons in said action, except to appear herein by attorney on November 12, 1891, and obtain twenty days\u2019further time to answer, but that said defendant has not answered-within said extended time, and is in default herein,\u201d etc.; and on December 15, 1891, a judgment was entered by plaintiff\u2019s attorneys against said defendant for the sum of $434.78, amount claimed, interest, and costs. On December 23, 1891, an order was granted by one of the justices of this court directing plaintiff to show cause on December 28, .1891, why the service of the summons herein, and judgment entered December 15, 1891, should not be set aside upon the ground, among others, of irregularity in the form and \u2022service of the summons, etc., and an order was entered on or about January 18, 1892, whereby it was \u201cordered that said motion be, and the same hereby is, denied, with leave to defendant to move to open default on the merits in another motion if he so desire. \u201d On January 25, 1892, an order was granted requiring plaintiff to show cause on January 28, 1892, why the order entered on January 18, 1892, should not be vacated or resettled, or why a reargument should not be granted, etc. And on January 19th an order was made, as follows: \u201cOrdered that the order entered herein, on or about January 18, 1892, be resettled by the entry of this order, and that said motion to vacate the judgment entered herein be, and the same her\u00e9by is, denied, with leave to the defendant to move to open the default on the merits in another motion if he so desire. \u201d And it is from this order that defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-14\">Section 3165, subd. 2, Code Civil Proe., provides that \u201cwhen an order, directing service of the.summons without the city of New York, or by publication, is granted, the summons must state that the time within which the defendant must serve a copy of his answer is ten days after service thereof, exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>sive of the day of service;\u201d and further provides: \u201cIf the summons requiring the defendant to answer within a shorter time has been issued * * * before an order specified in this subdivision is granted, the justice granting such an order may direct that the summons be amended accordingly, and thereupon the summons published or served without that city pursuant to the order must correctly state the time.\u201d The summons served herein required the defendant to serve his answer within six days. No direction was made by the justice granting the order that the summons be amended, and the same was not amended as required by subdivision 2, \u00a7 3165, above cited. The court, for this reason, therefore, never acquired jurisdiction of the defendant. No motion has been made to amend the summons, nor could such amendment be made if such motion should be made and granted now, as the court did not acquire jurisdiction by the service of the six-days summons. Where an attachment or other provisional remedy is granted as provided by section 416 of the Code, the court acquires jurisdiction from the time of the granting of the attachment, and has control of all subsequent proceedings. In this case it does not appear from the ease on appeal that an attachment or other provisional remedy was applied for or granted. Section 3165 of the Code, forming part of article 2, tit. 1, of chapter 20, entitled \u201cThe Marine Court of the City of New York,\u201d (name changed to \u201cCity Court,\u201d\u2014Laws 1883, c. 26,) provides that \u201cthe summons in an action brought in the court must state that the time within which the defendant must serve a copy of his answer in six days after the service thereof, * * * except in one of the following cases.\u201d Subdivision 2: \u201cWhere an order, directing service of the summons without the city of New York, or by publication, is granted, the summons must state that the time within which the defendant must serve a copy of his answer is ten days,\u201d etc. Section 3170 provides that \u201can order, directing the service of a summons, either without the city of New York or by publication, may be granted by the court or by a justice thereof; but only In a case where a warrant of attachment has been issued, as prescribed in the last section, and personal service of the summons cannot be made with due diligence within that city, \u201d etc. See <em>Kierst </em>v. <em>Von Biela, </em>1 City Ct. R. 243; <em>Gibbon </em>v. <em>Freel, </em>65 How. Pr. 273. A voluntary appearance of the defendant herein, however, would cure the irregularities in the service of the summons, and confer jurisdiction. It is claimed by the plaintiff that there was an appearance herein by the defendant. Section 421 of the Code provides that \u201c the defendant\u2019s appearance must be made by serving upon the plaintiff\u2019s attorney * * * a notice of appearance, or a copy of a demurrer or of an answer. A notice or pleading so served must be subscribed by the defendant\u2019s attorney, who must add to his signature his office address,\u201d etc. It is not claimed that any such notice of appearance was served herein. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney Jeroloman swears \u201cthat on the 1st day of November, 1891, a person from the defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 office obtained twenty days\u2019 further time to answer, and at the expiration of said twenty days an application for further time to answer was applied for by a clerk from defendant\u2019s attorneys\u2019 office, and he was told by deponent to file his answer. His excuse for asking time was on account of the absence of Mr. Carpenter, the defendant\u2019s attorney; that the defendant\u2019s attorney has a paper extending defendant\u2019s time to answer 20 days from November 12, 1891.\u201d Preeman, a clerk in the office of Jeroloman &amp; Arrowsmith, plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, swears \u201cthat he remembers the time the young man called from the office of Carpenter &amp; Hassett, the attorneys for the defendant herein, and wanted to obtain further time in which to answer the complaint; * * * that he well knows the said young man, whose name is George Eckhard, * * * and knows he was then employed by the said defendant\u2019s attorneys, Carpenter &amp; Has-sett.\u201d The affidavits on the part of the defendant allege in substance that defendant never appeared in the action, and that George Eckhard, above re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ferred to, was not authorized to appear for the defendant. Philip Carpenter swears that \u201cI am one of the attorneys for the defendant in making this motion. 2To notice of appearance of the defendant in this action was served. 21 or did I, nor did the firm of Carpenter &amp; Hassett, or any other attorney to my knowledge, appear for him in the action; nor was any one in our office authorized to appear for the defendant in any way. I never asked plaintiff\u2019s attorneys for any extension of time to answer, nor authorized any such request.\u201d It appears, however, uncontradicted, that an extension of time for 20 days was given to defendant to answer, and that he received the benefit of it. Conceding that defendant\u2019s attorneys obtained an extention of time for defendant to answer as alleged in plaintiff\u2019s affidavits, after a careful examination of all the authorities referred to and cited in the briefs submitted \u00a1by the attorneys for the plaintiff and defendant, in the absence of any other evidence as to defendant\u2019s appearance, I do not think that the mere obtaining of such extension was a sufficient appearance on the part of the defendant to operate as a waiver to the irregularities in the service of the summons and to confer jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Order appealed from must be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
