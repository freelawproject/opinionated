The petitioner\u2019s claim of tenancy was obviously a mere pretense; and the respondent\u2019s conduct in foreclosing the mortgage, if rough and resolute, still lacked the element of threat and force necessary to constitute the grievance remediable by the proceeding. We are of opinion that upon both points the verdict of the jury is clearly against the evidence. If otherwise, however, still the return discloses a defect in the proceeding which is fatal to its validity. The statute of forcible entry and detainer, being in derogation of the common law, and authorizing a process by which one may b.e summarily divested of his right, is to be strictly construed, and the proceeding rigidly restrained within its prescribed limits. <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Burdick, </em>1 Hill, 131; <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Leitzman, </em>(Sup.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 434. The statute requires that in forcible entry and detainer the applicant must present to the justice \u201ca written petition describing the premises and the interest therein of the petitioner,\u201d (Code, \u00a7 2235;) which means \u201ca description of the particular title, estate, or interest under which the petitioner claims.\u201d <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Leitzman, </em>(Sup.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 434. Here the petition recites merely that the applicant \u201cis the tenant of the premises pursuant to an agreement with the landlord.\u201d Tenant <em>simpliciter </em>is \u201cone who holds or possesses lands or tenements by a kind of'title.\u201d McAdam, Landl. &amp; Ten. 45. Whether the applicant was tenant for years, or from year to year, or from month to month, or at will, or at sufferance, is not indicated by the petition; wherein, therefore, \u201cis not a description of the interest of the petitioner, but, at most, an allegation that she had some interest which entitled her to the possession.\u201d <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Leitzman, </em>(Sup.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 434. An allegation of interest is not equivalent to a description of the interest. The complainant should disclose in his petition the nature of his right to the possession, and how and from whom it was acquired; and an allegation as to his rights, without facts to sustain it, is a legal conclusion. <em>People </em>v. Field, Barb. 198. . A technical objection suffices <em>to </em>defeat the proceeding. <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>24 Barb. 16; <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>1 Thomp. &amp; C. 533. The defect in the description of petitioner\u2019s interest in the premises deprived the court of jurisdiction. <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Leitzman, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">Judgment reversed, and proceeding dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
