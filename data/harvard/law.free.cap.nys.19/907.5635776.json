This I do not think is sound, notwithstanding the opinion of the learned judge who decided <em>People ex rel. McNeary </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>(unreported.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is a broad distinction between the statute of limitations and the time provided by statute within which a proceeding must be instituted. In the former case, if the plaintiff is a nonresident, the statute does not run against him; and so in many other exceptions provided for by law. But in this case the statute makes no such ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>captions. It is more analogous to the time given in which to take an appeal. If an appeal is not taken within the, time limited, it may be dismissed on motion without waiting for the appeal to be heard. So in the case of a mechanic\u2019s lien, if it should clearly appear upon the face of the complaint that more than 90 days had expired between the entire completion of the work and the filing of the lien, the complaint would be demurrable, and the defect need not be taken advantage of by answer. And this is true of many other remedies, the time to take advantage of which is limited by law. In those eases the party seeking the remedy must bring himself within the statute before he can avail himself of it. The motion should therefore be granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 2125, provides that, subject to certain provisions as to age, insanity, or imprisonment, a writ of <em>certiorari </em>must be granted and served within four calendar months after the determination to be reviewed becomes final and binding on the relator or the person he represents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-13\"> This decision was reversed in 19 KT. <em>Y. </em>Supp. 56.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
