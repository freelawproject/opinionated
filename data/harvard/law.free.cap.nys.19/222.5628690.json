R. 298; 62 How. Pr. 304') It follows that the costs of this action, which was originally brought in a district court of this city to recover damages for a personal injury, and removed to this court, must be awarded and taxed pursuant to the above-cited provisions of the Code. The eases cited by the learned counsel for the plaintiff, namely, <em>Druckenmiller </em>v. <em>Sho</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>ninger, </em>(Com. Pl. N.

R. 217; <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Parkhurst, </em>2 Daly, 240,\u2014have no application, as they merely relate to the <em>status </em>of an action commenced in a district court after its removal to this court. The plaintiff having recovered less than $50, she defendants are entitled to costs. <em>Kaliski </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>(Com. Pl. N. Y.) 15 N. Y. Supp. 519, (Daly, C.
