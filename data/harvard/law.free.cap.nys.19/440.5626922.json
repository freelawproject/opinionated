This claim was properly allowed by the trustees of the village, and was by them directed to be paid by the treasurer, who was William J. Kage, the defendant in this action. It seems, however, that Mr. Kage, who conducted a grocery business in that village, had a claim for groceries sold and delivered to the plaintiff amounting to the sum of $16, and accordingly, when the plaintiff called upon him, as treasurer of the village of North Tonawanda, to pay the $40, the defendant, as a grocer, insisted on the right to take out .of such $40 the sum of $16 coming to him individually. The plaintiff objected to this, as was claimed at the trial, and insisted that the defendant should pay him the whole amount of the $40, less, perhaps, the sum of $5, which the plaintiff said he was willing to allow upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>his personal bill to the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony upon this point is unshaken in any respect, and is to the effect that he at no time assented to the deduction of $16 from the $40. He says, in substance, that when he called for the money, the defendant passed out to him a receipt for him to sign; but, inasmuch as he could not write, the defendant himself signed his name, and he, the plaintiff, made his customary mark, and that then the defendant passed out to him the sum of $24, and that thereupon, after expressions of surprise by the plaintiff, the defendant told him he had deducted that amount because he owed it to him for groceries. The plaintiff says: \u201cI looked at him, and said, \u2018What does this mean?\u2019 He told me, \u2018You owe me $16 for groceries.\u2019 I said, T remember that, but I am not prepared to pay you all now.\u2019 He said, \u2018I know you are not prepared, because I paid myself.\u2019 I said, \u2018I hain\u2019t going to take this amount.\u2019 Then he said, T don\u2019t care if you take it or not.\u2019 The defendant then made a receipt for the $16, which he had kept from me. I told him I wouldn\u2019t take the receipt. Said, T won\u2019t take this receipt, but I carry this on further, and sue you.\u2019 The defendant told me he didn\u2019t care. \u201d The testimony of the defendant himself is as follows: \u201c When I found out that Tobin had a bill from the village, he said he pay me. I ask him again, and he said that he pay me the bill out of the $40. The day when he came in I told him the orders was in and signed. This was in June. Plaintiff said he would pay part of the bill, and would pay the balance another time. He promised to pay the whole. I told him that I wanted the whole of it; that I had waited long enough; and he said, \u2018All right.\u2019 Then I went back to my office, and got out my.order book, and asked him to sign this order. Then he told me he couldn\u2019t write, and I wrote his name for him. 1 paid him in cash $24, and gave him a receipt of $16, as agreed. Then Tobin told me it wasn\u2019t right to take out the whole; that I told him I done just as he agreed with me. Then he said he would sue me if I didn\u2019t pay the balance. I told him I done just with him as he agreed with me. Then lie took the money.\u201d Two witnesses were called in behalf of the defendant, each of whom, however, said, in respect to the conversation at the time stated by the parties thereto themselves,\u2014one (Herman 0. Kage) that at the time the \u25a0plaintiff took the $24 he said he would sue the defendant for the balance; the other, Edward Doolan, stated that Tobin said, immediately on passing out of the store, that the money he received was only part payment, and he would sue the defendant for the rest. Upon this evidep.ce the justice ought to have rendered a judgment in behalf of the plaintiff for the recovery of the unpaid balance. The action was for conversion by the defendant of the unpaid balance of $16, which was coming to him from the village of North Tonawanda. The defendant, as treasurer of such corporation, had no right to pay himself out of the moneys which were thus passing through his hands us treasurer. It would be against public policy to permit an officer thus to coerce a debtor, and to pay himself in the manner described. This might be \u2022considered a new way of collecting old debts, except that the same method was attempted, though unsuccessfully, in the case of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>(Sup.) 14 N. Y. Supp. 53. We but reiterate what we there said, that a public officer cannot be permitted to make his opportunities thus to subserve his private and selfish ends, as was done by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">A point is made by counsel for the appellant against the judgment in re-spect to its form. It appears from the record that the justice of the peace, while disallowing the plaintiff\u2019s claim, rendered a judgment in his favor foi the costs of the action. It is suggested, however, on the part of the defend \u25a0ant, that this was a mere clerical error in writing in the word \u201cplaintiff\u201d for the word \u201cdefendant,\u201d and that there really was no intention, on the part of the justice of the peace, to award costs to the plaintiff. If this was Ike sole question in the case, we would be of the opinion that the appellant \u25a0would have no cause, to appeal, because such judgment, if it was actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>rendered, was more favorable to him than the decision of the justice would warrant. But, upon the ground above stated, we think the judgment of both the justice of the peace and the county court should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Judgment of the county court of Niagara county and of the justice of the peace reversed, with costs of the appeal in this court and in the county court. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
