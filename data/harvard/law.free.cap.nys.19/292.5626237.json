Collateral Legacy Tax\u2014Realty in Another State\u2014Equitable Conversion.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-9\">Since a succession tax is not a tax on property, hut on the privilege of succeeding to the inheritance, the fundamental test of the right to impose the tax is to ascertain the sovereign power through whose favor the property is permitted to pass; and hence the collateral legacy tax provided\" for by Laws 1887, c. 713, cannot be imposed on real estate situated without the state, though testator\u2019s will directs its conversion into personalty, and though the proceeds are brought within the state for distribution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-10\">2. Same\u2014Personalty in Another State.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-11\">Neither is personalty having its <em>situs </em>without the state subject to the collateral legacy tax, though remitted to this state, where testator resided, for distribution, since the state within whose limits it is located has entire dominion over it, and the imposition of the tax by this state might subject it to double taxation.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>3.

Same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b313-7\">Where a will bequeaths paintings, pictures, and plate to various persons, only a part of whom are subject to the collateral legacy tax, it is error to subject the aggregate value of all such property to the tax, since the portions bequeathed to persons exempt by reason of their relationship to testator, and by reason of their receiving beneficial interests less than $500, under all the provisions of the will, are not taxable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b313-8\">16 N.
