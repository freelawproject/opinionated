It was a clear case of two brokers trying to sell the same property to the same party; the one failing and the other succeeding. The rule of law in such cases has been well defined in <em>Alden </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>(Super. N. Y.) 4 N. Y. Supp. 548; affirmed in 121 N. Y. 688, 24 N. E. Rep. 705. The direction of a verdict against the plaintiffs was proper, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
