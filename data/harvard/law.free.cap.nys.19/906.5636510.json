The other allegations of the complaint refer to matters of record open to public inspection, in respect to which the denials \u201cof want of knowledge or information\u201d create no issue, for the reason that such want of knowledge and information arises from unwillingness to learn the facts. 2 Wait, Pr. 423. To hold otherwise would encourage willful and intentional ignorance, by making such deliberate want of knowledge and information a good plea. Id. The court of common pleas j ustly held that to permit a party sq circumstanced, with every means of knowledge within his power, to answer that he has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief, would be to sanction a palpable evasion; <em>Ketcham </em>v. <em>Zerega, </em>.1 E.
