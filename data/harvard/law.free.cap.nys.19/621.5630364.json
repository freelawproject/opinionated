Whether that was negligence or not was a question for the jury. The only cause of action submitted to the jury was the fire of July 6th, caused by the dry grass and brush before referred to taking fire, and such fire spreading to the plaintiff\u2019s premises. That cause of action was fairly presented to the jury. Many of the exceptions were taken in regard to evidence relating to the fire of July 16th, upon which the plaintiff was nonsuited. The other evidence in the case, to which exceptions were taken, does not seem to me to have prejudiced the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">The judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
