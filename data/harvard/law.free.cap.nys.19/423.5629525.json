Wood, as administratrix with the will annexed of Samuel Wood, deceased, against Robert M. Nesbitt. The cause was submitted on an, agreed statement under Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 1279, which provides as follows: \u201cThe parties to a question in difference, which might be the subject of an action, being of full age, may agree upon a case containing a statement of the facts upon which the controversy depends, and may present a written submission thereof to a court of record which would have jurisdiction of an action brought for the same cause. The case must be accompanied with the affidavit of one of the parties to the effect that the controversy is real, and that the submission is made in good faith, for the purpose of determining the rights of the parties. The submission must be acknowledge or proved and certified, in like manner as a deed, to be recorded in the county where it is filed.\u201d The controversy came on to be heard on such submission by the general term, where a decision was rendered in favor of plaintiff, and an opinion was filed. See 16 N. Y. Supp. 918. Charles Hewlett and others, claiming an interest in the subject-matter of the controversy, move that the submission be dismissed, and the decision heretofore made on such submission be vacated; basing the motion on the ground that the statement of facts and the briefs of the respective parties were all prepared by the same attorney, whereby the independent character of the submission contemplated by the statute was destroyed.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A16\">Motion granted.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b443-13\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

We think, therefore, that the motion should be granted, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">NOTE.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The order entered on this decision was made June 14, 1893, and is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u201cAn agreed case and a statement of facts for the submission of controversy in pursuance of section 1379 of the Code of Civil Procedure having been filed on the 34th day of October, 1891, in the office of the clerk of the county of New York, and hereafter submitted by attorneys for the respective parties to this court for its decision, and this court having at the December, 1891, term thereof, rendered its decision thereon, together with an opinion upon the questions so submitted, and no judgment having been entered thereon, and a motion having been thereafter made at a term of this court held in March, 1893, upon an order to show cause, granted upon the application of Charles Hewlett and others, claiming an interest in the subject-matter of the controversy, for the purpose of setting aside said proceedings, and such motion having come on to be heard at the April, 1893, term of this court, upon the affidavits of Edward T.
