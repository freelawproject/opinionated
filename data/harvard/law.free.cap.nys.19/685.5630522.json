And in his supplemental answer defendant sets up the following instrument in writing, bearing date the 14th day of January, 1892:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-13\">\u201cNew York, Jan. 14th, 1892.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-14\">\u201cReceived from Edward 0.

Manchester &amp; Fhilbrick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-15\">\u201cWitness: John White,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">\u2014being defendant\u2019s Exhibit 1, and alleges that thereby the time of said maker, Butcher, to pay said note was extended, and that said new agreement was substituted in the place of the note in suit, and. that the defendant herein was discharged from all liability as indorser of the note in question. The note became due on August 4, 1890, on which day it was presented for payment at the Bank of Harlem, and payment demanded, but was not paid, and was protested for nonpayment, and notice of protest mailed to defendant on the same day. Plaintiffs, on the following day, inclosed notice of protest in one of plaintiffs\u2019 business envelopes, which said, \u201cIf not called for in so many days return to us,\u201d and addressed it to defendant, \u201cThomas C. Van Brunt, 15 to 25 Whitehall Street, New York City.\u201d \u201cThat was his business address. I had been there many times, and had seen him, and had done business in his office. I put a two-cent postage stamp on, and personally dropped it in the U. S. mail box on the morning of April 5tli.\u201d \u201cThe letter was never returned.\u201d Defendant testified, \u201cI never received notice of protest of this note.\u201d The mailing of the notice, as testified to by plaintiff, was all that he was required to do, and was sufficient to charge the defendant, the indorser. See Laws 1857, c. 416, \u00a7 3; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>De Groot, </em>7 Hun, 210; <em>In re Manley, </em>(Sup.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 200. It does not appear that by reason of the return in obedience to the indorsement on the envelope the defendant failed to receive the notice, and'the service of the notice by mail was not vitiated thereby. Manchester, the plaintiff, testified that the letter was not returned to him. See <em>Gaffney </em>v. <em>Bigelow, 2 </em>Abb. N. C. 311. There was an unqualified legal obligation on the part of Butcher, the maker, and Van Brunt, the indorser, to pay the note when due; and the payment of part of the sum due on the note ($100 paid on January 14, 1892) was not a valid consideration for the extension of ,payment of the remainder. The partial payment of $100,1 even if made by Butcher, the maker, on account of the note then overdue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>was not a valid consideration for a promise of forbearance as to the residue, so as to discharge Van Brunt, the indorser. <em>Halliday </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>30 N. Y. 474. The promise to extend the time of payment of the note was void unless founded upon a good consideration, and the payment of $100, part of the amount due \u25a0on the note, was not a good consideration for such promise. See <em>Parmelee </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>45 N. Y. 58; <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Olmsted, </em>25 N. Y. 189; <em>O'Hara </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>(Sup.) 18 N. Y. Supp. 541. Daniels, in his work on Negotiable Instruments, says, (section 13176, 3d Ed.:) \u201cPart payment is not a sufficient consideration for an agreement to extend time, and, therefore, if there be no other consideration for an extension, it would not discharge a surety. \u201d The defendant testified: \u201cI think I advanced the money that was paid to Mr. Manchester at that time. I think all the money that Mr. Butcher had came from me. He was an employe, and I was paying him wages.\u201d If this be true, then the payment was made by defendant to reduce his own indebtedness upon the note long past due.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The exception taken by the defendant to the admission of the testimony of plaintiff Manchester, at folio 54, was not well taken. The testimony did not vary or contradict the written instrument; it simply showed the whole transaction at the time, the circumstance and conditions under which the instrument was made and delivered by the plaintiffs, and accepted without objection by the defendant, through his agent, White. The question as to whether White was Van Brunt\u2019s agent in the matter was left to the jury by the trial justice, and in finding for the plaintiff the jury evidently found that he was such agent. The trial justice, in his charge, submitted the issues raised upon the trial fully and fairly to the jury, and we find no error therein, and also find that the exceptions taken by defendants\u2019 attorney to the rulings made by the trial justice, and to his charge, are without merit. The judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
