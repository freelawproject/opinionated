Aldrich and others against Frank L. Davis. Defendant appeals from an order made by a special surrogate in supplementary proceedings, adjudging him guilty of contempt in disposing of certain goods in violation of the surrogate\u2019s order. The technical defense set up by defendant was that the motion to punish for contempt should have been made returnable at a term of court at which a contested motion could be heard, and. that the special surrogate had no authority to hear the same.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AP8\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b785-14\">Argued before Mayham, P.

Z. Squires, special surrogate of St. Lawrence county, under the provisions of section 2434, Code-Civil Proc. Therefore the defendant, disobeying that order, may be punished by the judge who issued it as for contempt. Section 2457, Code Civil Proc.;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fiero, Spec. Proc. p. 545. It is well settled that in supplementary proceedings the judge who made the order has full power out of court to punish for contempt. <em>Shephard </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>13 How.,Pr. 173; <em>Lathrop </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>40 N. Y. 328. We think that the affidavits presented to the special surrogate sustained his conclusion on the question of fact in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">Order affirmed, with costs and printing disbursements.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-18\">This section provides that a person who refuses to obey an order of a judge or referee in supplementary proceedings \u201cmay be punished by the judge or by the court, out of which the execution was issued, as for a contempt. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
