It is settled law that, though the bill of lading be silent as to lay days and demurrage, still the freighter \u201cis liable <em>to </em>the master of the vessel for damages for unreasonable delay in discharging the cargo after arrival.\u201d <em>Scholl </em>v. <em>Steel Co., </em>101 N. Y. 602, 5 N. E. Rep. 782; <em>Van Etten </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>(Com. Pl. N. Y.) 6 N. Y. Supp. 531, 7 N. Y. Supp. 663, and 8 N. Y. Supp. 478. Failure to provide a safe berth, and a proper dock and customary facilities for unloading, is such negligence as imposes a responsibility for damages on the freighter. <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>A Cargo of Lumber, </em>23 Fed. Rep. 301; <em>Fulton </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>5 Biss. 371. In <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Steel Co., </em>8 Fed.Rep. 447, the adjudication turned on the peculiar phraseology of the bill of lading. On the other hand, it is equally clear that for delay in unloading caused by <em>vis major, </em>the consignee is not liable. <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>26 N. Y. 85. But the <em>vis major, </em>and not the negligence <em>o\u00ed </em>the consignee, must be the cause of the tardy unloading. <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>18 Fed. Rep. 751. Which of the two causes, namely, <em>vis major </em>or defendant\u2019s negligence, was accountable for the delay in unloading plaintiff\u2019s boat, was strenuously litigated on the trial; and the decision of the justice, not being without sufficient support in the evidence, is not open to reversal by this court. <em>Scholl </em>v. <em>Steel Co., </em>101 N. Y. 602, 5 N. E. Rep. 782. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
