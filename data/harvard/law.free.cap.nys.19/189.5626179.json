Koch, surviving executor of John C.*Koch, deceased, to subject a legacy in the hands of defendant to the satisfaction of a judgment against the legatee, Herman Koch. Plaintiff demurred to the answer in so far as to set up a legal incapacity of the receiver to sue because of the omission of authority to sue in the appointing order. From an order sustaining this demurrer defendant appeals. Reversed. From an order striking out an amended complaint, and from a judgment dismissing the complaint, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"A9lm\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-14\">The following opinion was delivered by MoAdam, J., at special term: \u201cThe moneys in the hands of the defendant are held by him in trust under the will of John V. Koch. The trust is therefore one created by a person other than the judgment debtor. Code, \u00a7 1879. A judgment creditor might nevertheless by bill in equity reach any surplus that had accumulated in the hands of the trustees, and provision might be made in the judgment determining what would be a reasonable allowance for the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and directing the application towards the judgment of any future surplus until the same is fully paid, ( <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Thorn, </em>70 N. Y. 270; Wait, Fraud. Conv. \u00a7\u00a7 45, 360;) and a receiver appointed in supplementary proceedings may seemingly maintain such an action, <em>(McEwen </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>19 Hun, 337, overruling previous decision in same case reported in 17 Hun, 227.) But that is not the nature of the present suit. The complaint proceeds on the theory that the judgment debtor was entitled at the time action was commenced, as of right, to money more than sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, and the prayer is for an accounting and decree directing the defendant .to satisfy the demand at once. It appears that John C. Koch, the testator, died February 7, 1888, and by the tenth clause of his will he gives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>to his son (the judgment debtor) a legacy of $10,000, to be paid in installments of,$l,000 each year, the first to be paid in one year after the decease of the testator. Under this provision the judgment debtor became entitled to $1,000 February 7, 1889, $1,000 February 7,. 1890, and $1,000 February 7, 1891, in all $8,000. The complaint further alleges that the judgment debtor owed the testator at the time of his decease $1,829.15, and that the defendant paid the judgment debtor $1,827.10. The two sums, aggregating $3,656.25, exceed the installments due the judgment debtor when this suit was commenced; hence there was nothing owing to him or his receiver at that time. The legacy to the son did not discharge the debt he owed the testator. <em>Rickets </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>2 Johns. Cas. 97; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Bogardus, </em>2 Edw. Ch. 387; and cases collated in Redf. Pr. (3d Ed.) 579. It was the duty of defendant, as \u2022executor, to first apply the debt pro <em>tanto </em>to the extinguishment of the legacy, <em>(Stagg </em>v. <em>Beekman, </em>2 Edw. Ch. at page 92,) and he could not postpone -or avoid this duty. It is apparent, therefore, that an accounting cannot change these figures nor alter the result which follows. The plaintiff desired to amend his complaint by omitting the allegations as to the debt. This would simply impose upon the defendant the duty of pleading and burden of proving the debt, which might be accomplished by reading in evidence the original complaint, in which its existence is affirmatively alleged, <em>(Fogg </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>20 Hun. 90; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Town of Ticonderoga, </em>[Sup.] 6 N. Y. Supp. 844,) so that the amendment proposed has nothing of practical utility to commend it. The amendment could not alter the facts, and the application therefor will be denied, and the complaint dismissed, without prejudice to a new action in suitable form at the proper time. Submit findings and order embodying the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b210-4\">Argued before Sedgwick, C. J., and Dugro and Gildersleeve, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b210-5\"><em>Edward Grosse, </em>for plaintiff. <em>William O.

The others \u00b0are by the plaintiff from an order striking out his amended complaint, and from a judgment dismissing the complaint. The plaintiff\u2019s appeals are decided against him upon the opinion of the learned judge who dismissed the complaint. It follows that the order sustaining the demurrer, and the judgment thereon, must be reversed, for on a demurrer to an answer the defendant may show that on the face of the record plaintiff is not entitled to final judgment. <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>50 N.
