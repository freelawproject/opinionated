He had no warning. The court sent the question of negligence to the .jury, and they awarded his widow and administratrix' $5,000 damages. The defendant insists that it was error not to nonsuit the plaintiff, and cites <em>Besel </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>70 N. Y. 171, to sustain its claim. Whether the defendant performed its duty to its employe was, on the evidence, and the inference to be drawn from it, a question for the jury.. <em>Abel </em>v. <em>President, </em>103 N. Y. 581, 9 N. E. Rep. 325; 128 N. Y. 662, 28 N. E. Rep. 663. The jury was properly instructed as to the law, and their verdict on the facts is sufficiently supported by the proofs. True, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to show affirmatively that the negligence of the defendant was the sole cause of death. But it was unnecessary to do this by positive and direct evidence of negligence of the defendant and of freedom from negligence of the deceased. The proofs may be indirect, and the evidence had by showing circumstances from which the inference is fairly and logically to be drawn that these essential facts existed. When, from the circumstances shown, inferences are to be drawn which are not certain and incontrovertible, and may be differently made by different minds, the question is one for the jury. See note to <em>Buesching </em>v. <em>Gaslight Co., </em>39 Amer. Rep., at page 513; <em>Hays </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>70 N. Y. 112; <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>71 N. Y. 71; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>80 N. Y. 622; <em>Ochsenbein </em>v. <em>Shapley, </em>85 N. Y., at page 224. The inferences to be drawn from the evidence were sufficient to warrant the jury in finding that the defendant had not given reasonable protection to its employe while in the performance of his work, and that its breach of duty and negligence resulted in his death. The motion for a new trial must be denied. Forty days\u2019 stay of execution after notice of entry of judgment, and a like time to make a case.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b883-5\">Argued before Freedman, Dugro, and Gildersleeve, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b883-6\"><em>Prank Loomis, </em>for appellant. <em>Abram Kling, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b883-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AA48\">For the reasons set forth in the opinion of the court below the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
