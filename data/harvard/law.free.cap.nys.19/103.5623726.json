Keeffe, notary public, whose certificate of acknowledgment bears date 13th of January, 1885. The mortgage was recorded March 23, 1885. The consideration named in the mortgage was $30,-000. The condition in the mortgage, as recorded, was as follows: \u201cThis grant is intended as the security for the payment of any and all notes made by the El Oro Mining Company and indorsed by William T. Hamilton and William N. Thompson, and now held and owned by the party of the second part; and of any and all renewals of said notes; and also to secure-said second party from all loss by reason of his liability as indorser upon any and all notes made by said El Oro Mining Co., and indorsed by said Hamilton and Thompson, and any and all renewals thereof; also any and all other notes or drafts made or indorsed by said Hamilton, now or hereafter owned by said second party, or on which he may be liable as indorser. \u201d Defendant, in her answer, alleges \u201cthat said plaintiff altered or caused to be altered said mortgage in a material part after her signature was affixed thereto, and he had obtained possession thereof, by inserting at the end of the condition thereof the following words: \u2018 Also any and all other notes or drafts made or indorsed by said Hamilton, now or hereafter owned by said second party, or on which he may be liable as indorser.\u2019 That said alteration was not brought to her knowledge in any manner after the same was made, nor did she ratify the same or acknowledge such mortgage after such alteration; and said plaintiff now claims a benefit and an advantage over defendant under and by virtue of such alteration. That such alteration was made for the purpose of obtaining a benefit for the plaintiff, and was fraudulent as to this defendant; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>and said mortgage, if any such exists, thereby rendered void, and -of no effect. \u201d Other defenses are stated in the answer, among others, that the mortgage \u201cwas so executed and delivered wholly without any consideration therefor. On the 7th of September, 1889, at a special term, an order was made settling issues and directing a trial thereof at the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">The questions and the verdict of the jury thereon were as follows: <em>\u201cFirst. </em>Did the defendant execute and deliver to the plaintiff the mortgage referred to in the complaint? <em>Answer. </em>Yes. <em>Second. </em>Was any consideration paid, or did any pass, to the defendant or any other person, for the execution and delivery by her of the mortgage mentioned in the complaint? <em>A. </em>Yes. <em>Third. </em>After the execution and delivery of the mortgage referred to in the complaint, was said mortgage changed by writing therein, in the condition thereof, the following clause: \u2018 Also any and all other notes or drafts made or indorsed by said Hamilton, now or hereafter owned by said second party, or on which he may be liable as indorser? \u2019 <em>A. </em>Yes.' <em>Fourth. </em>Was said clause written in said mortgage without the knowledge or consent of the said defendant, Fannie M. Hamilton? <em>A. No. Fifth. </em>Did the said defendant,FannieM. Hamilton, after the following clause was written in said mortgage: \u2018Also any and all other notes or drafts made or indorsed by said Hamilton, now or hereafter owned by said second party, or on which he may be liable as indorser,\u2019\u2014assent to the same, or consent that the same should form a part of said mortgage? <em>A. </em>Yes.\u201d A motion for a new trial \u201cupon the minutes of the court to set aside the verdict of the jury, rendered upon the first, second, fourth, and fifth of said issues, and each of them, and that a new trial be granted as to said last-mentioned issues, and each of them, upon the grounds\u201d specified, was made at the circuit, and denied. Subsequent to such order denying a motion for a new trial, \u201cthe issues joined in this action were brought to trial at a special term of this court, and the following proceedings were thereupon had: The stenographer\u2019s minutes of the evidence and proceedings before the jury upon the trial of the issues in this action before them, and the exhibits therein referred to, and the verdict of the jury upon said issues, were introduced in evidence. Said evidence was received subject to the exceptions and objections in said minutes, the same rulings being deemed made and exceptions taken at special term as at the circuit. No further proof was offered by either party, and the foregoing case contains all the evidence given and proceedings had at the circuit and special term upon the trial of this case. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-6\">The special term found the execution of the mortgage and the consideration therefor, and the extent of the indebtedness mentioned in the complaint, and the existence of the several notes and drafts mentioned therein, and, further, as follows: \u201c(10) That on the 13th of January, 1885, for a valuable consideration, and for the purpose of securing the payment of the said several notes and drafts, the defendant, Fannie M. Hamilton, executed, duly acknowledged, and delivered to the plaintiff a mortgage, whereby she granted, bargained, and sold to the said plaintiff the following described premises with the appurtenances thereto: [Here follows description.] (11) That by the terms of said mortgage it was provided that it was intended as a security for the payment of any and all notes made by the El Oro Mining Company, and in\u00bf dorsed by William T. Hamilton and.William N. Thompson, and held and owned by the plaintiff herein, and of any and all renewals of said notes, and also to secure him from all loss by reason of his liability as indorser upon any and all notes made by the said El Oro Mining Company, and indorsed by said Hamilton and Thompson, and any and all renewals thereof; also any and all other notes and drafts made or indorsed by said Hamilton which were owned at the time of the execution of said mortgage, or which thereafter should be owned, by the plaintiff, on which he might be liable as indorser. That the said mortgage contains a further condition that, in case default should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>made in the payment of the moneys thereby intended to be secured, or in the payment of the interest thereof, \u201d a foreclosure and sale should take place. It was also found that none of the notes or drafts had been paid, and that the defendant had failed to comply with the conditions of the mortgage by omitting to pay any of said notes, and \u201cthere is now due and justly owing to the plaintiff upon the said notes, draft, and mortgage the sum of $128,-624.43 of principal and $48,081.66 interest.\u201d The court also found: \u201cAfter the execution and delivery of said mortgage hereinbefore described, the same was changed by inserting in the condition thereof the following clause, to wit: * Also any and all other notes or drafts made or indorsed by said Hamilton, now or hereafter owned by said party, or on which he may be liable as inri orser,\u2019 and that said clause was written in said mortgage with the knowledge and consent of the defendant, Fannie M. Hamilton; and after the same was written therein she assented to the same, and consented that it should form a part of said mortgage. \u201d \u201c(16) Said clause was inserted in said mortgage without the knowledge, request, or procurement of the plaintiff. After said mortgage had been executed and delivered, he did not learn of its insertion until after the commencement of this action.\u201d The court found as conclusions of law: <em>\u201cFirst. </em>That the mortgage executed by the defendant to the plaintiff was not invalidated by the insertion of the clause in question after the first execution of said mortgage by the defendant. <em>Second. </em>That said mortgage was executed and delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff for a valuable consideration, and became, in the plaintiff\u2019s hands, a valid security for the payment of the several notes and draft set forth in the complaint.\u201d Special findings were made at the request of the defendant, as follows: \u201cThat when said mortgage was returned executed by the defendant to said Doheny it did not contain the following clause in the condition thereof: <em>* </em>Also any and all notes or drafts made or indorsed by said Hamilton, now or hereafter owned by said second party, or on which he may be liable as indorser.\u2019 \u201d Also found, \u201cthat said alteration was a material one.\u201d Several other requests to find were made which were refused by the court. Exceptions were taken to the findings and to the refusals to find. November 11, 1890, judgment of foreclosure was allowed and entered. Defendant appeals from the order denying the motion for a new trial upon the minutes, and also from the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-9\">One of the defenses contained in the answer was to the effect that the \u201cmortgage was given by the wife for a precedent debt of the husband, and that there was no consideration for its execution. =5 * * The appellant \u2022does not claim, therefore, to be entitled to reverse the finding of the jury on that issue, because it is against the evidence, or without evidence to support it, but only on the ground of erroneous rulings in regard to that evidence. She \u2022claims to reverse the findings on the other issues upon the ground they are without evidence to support them and against the evidence.\u201d The property \u2022covered by the mortgage is a tract of land on James street, said to be worth from $20,000 to $30,000. It appeared in the evidence that the El Oro Mining Company is a corporation having a mine in the republic of Mexico, and that its capital stock is $10,000,000, divided into shares of $100 each. William N. Thompson, of New York, was the president of the company, and owned something over 40,000 shares of the stock. William T. Hamilton, the husband of the defendant, was its vice president, and held some 37,000 shares of the stock. The company had issued bonds upon its property, some $50,000 of which the defendant owned in 1884. Some evidence was given tending to show that the stock held by Hamilton was purchased by him with his wife\u2019s\" money, and afterwards turned over to her as collateral for his indebtedness to her. It appears that Hamilton and Thompson, in the fall of 1884, valued the property at something like $2,500,000. In 1884 the Third National Bank of Syracuse held something like $128,000 of the paper of the mining com-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>pony, indorsed by Thompson and Hamilton. The plaintiff became the owner of a large portion of this paper, and indorser upon a large amount of the paper. The mining company was unable to pay the paper when it became due. Mr. Doheny had been counsel for Mrs. Hamilton and Hamilton, and he commenced a negotiation for an extension of this paper, and made efforts to obtain security to induce the extension. An extension was agreed upon on condition that the mining company pay $5,000 per month on its indebtedness, and as part of the arrangement looking to the extension the defendant made the mortgage in suit. The mortgage was prepared under the direction of Mr. Doheny by Mr. Petit, then a clerk in Doheny\u2019s office. The acknowledgment and certificate thereof was taken and made by John C. Keeffe, a notary public, who for many years was in the employ of the defendant and her husband, and on intimate terms with them. After such acknowledgment it was delivered to Doheny for the plaintiff. At the time the mortgage was given it seems to have been understood that it should not be immediately recorded. After the mining company failed to pay $5,000 a month pursuant to the extension, the mortgage was recorded. The evidence tends to show and satisfactorily supports the finding that the plaintiff had no knowledge of the insertion of the disputed clause in the mortgage after the execution of the mortgage, and that he first learned thereof after the commencement of this action. The indebtedness which the plaintiff seeks to enforce in this action is described in the mortgage and the language used therein as the mortgage was first drawn. It is not necessary to resort to the disputed clause in order to apply the language of the mortgage to such indebtedness.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b126-5\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A45\">Evidence given before the circuit and before the special term satisfactorily establishes the fact that the plaintiff had no knowledge of the making of the alleged alteration prior to the commencement of this action; and that such alteration and addition were made without his personal request or procurement, and without any fraudulent intent on his part. The evidence and findings are entirely satisfactory that the plaintiff did not and does not rely upon the disputed words to cover the indebtedness for which the mortgage is sought to be enforced. Under such circumstances, if it be assumed that the alteration or additional clause was inserted by Doheny without an original authority from the defendant or a reacknowledgment of the execution of the instrument by her after the words were inserted, ought the mortgage, as first drawn, to be destroyed, or held for naught? Clearly the plaintiff never intended any fraud, nor consciously consented to any destruction of the instrument which gave him a lien on the defendant\u2019s property as it was first drawn and executed. Notwithstanding the additional words or alterations, the instrument as first drawn was still legible, and its meaning and purport ascertainable, and the added words should be treated \u201cthe same as if the alteration had been made by a mere stranger without the privity or consent of the party interested.\u201d <em>Henfree </em>v. <em>Bromley, </em>6 East, 309. The case last cited was referred to approvingly in <em>Rees </em>v. <em>Overbaugh, </em>6 Cow. 746. In the latter case the instrument from which the seals were torn had been left with Jackson for safe-keeping, and it was said by the court in the course of the opinion that \u201chehad no power to cancel the contract, or to interfere in any other way with the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover the remaining balance of $500. In tearing the seals from the agreement, therefore, he did not act as the authorized agent of the plaintiff, but as a stranger.\u201d The latter case was quoted approvingly by Andrews, J., in <em>Casoni </em>v. <em>Jerome, </em>58 N. Y. 321, in which case it was held that the insertion in a bond by a clerk in the surrogate\u2019s court of words unauthorized did not \u201crelieve the obligors from liability under it as originally executed.\u201d In <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>101 N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>498, 5 N. E. Rep. 338, Ruger, C. J., said: \u201cThe rule is well established that an alteration of a contract under which a plaintiff claims, made by the defendant or some third party, without the plaintiff\u2019s consent, and while the contract is not in plaintiff\u2019s hands, has no effect, and the contract will remain as it originally stood, provided the nature and extent of the alteration can be clearly ascertained, and it can be seen what the contract was at the time it was executed.\u201d In <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Stilphen, </em>35 Vt. 521, the plaintiff\u2019s agent received defendant\u2019s note for goods. The agent, without the knowledge or assent of either party, so changed the note as to make it joint and several, and payable with interest; and when an action was brought upon the note it was held that its principals could recover upon it as it stood before the alteration took place. In the course of the opinion in that case it was said: \u201cClearly it is not just that a man should be deprived of an honest debt, or have the evidence of it destroyed for all beneficial purposes in consequence of misconduct of a stranger, to whose act he did not assent, and of which he had no knowledge; \u201d and it adds: \u201cIt is the intent that gives the act its character, and avoids the instrument, and it is difficult to understand why a man who has done no wrong, nor consented that any should be done, should be punished to the extent of the amount of his demand by having his claim canceled by operation of law, solely because another has been guilty of an act for which he ought to be punished.\" Public policy does not require any such rule.\u201d And in <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Hay, </em>91 Pa. St. 242, it was held that the alterations of a mortgage were to be deemed as those of a stranger, although the alterations were made by Gill, who, as agent and attorney of the party, had possession of it. Similar doctrine was held in <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>35 N. J. Law, 227; and in <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>135 Mass. 514. Appellant calls our attention to <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Vosburgh, </em>87 N. Y. 228. That was a case where the answer alleged \u201cthat, after the making and delivery of the note, and before the commencement of this action, the note was materially altered by the plaintiff without the knowledge or consent of defendants,\u201d etc., and it was held that it was error to strike out the answer as sham and frivolous. We think the case does not aid the appellant. And <em>Benedict </em>v. <em>Cowden, </em>49 N. Y. 396, cited by the appellant, was a case where it was held the material alteration of a note took place by severance of a memorandum from the note, which was an essential part of it. We see nothing in the ease aiding the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Our attention is called to <em>Waring </em>v. <em>Smyth, </em>2 Barb. Ch. 119. In that case it appeared that Waring, the mortgagee, \u201c was guilty of the improper acts of altering a bond and mortgage,\u201d and therefore he could not foreclose the mortgage, nor could his assignee have any relief to which the assignor would not have been entitled. In that case, however, it was asserted that \u201can alteration by a stranger without the privity or consent of the party interested will not render the deed void where the contents of the same as it originally existed can be ascertained.\u201d Appellant calls our attention to <em>Marcy </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>5 Lans. 365. When the mortgage in that case was delivered, it did not describe the defendant\u2019s property. Subsequently the description was changed, and in an action to reform the mortgage by changing the description from \u201clot 26\u201d to \u201clot H,\u201d and for a foreclosure thereof, it was held that the mortgage was vitiated, and was incapable of being enforced by the plaintiffs. The case differs widely from the one before us. In the course of the opinion, however, it seems to be stated that the modern cases hold that, if the alteration is the act of amere stranger, while the deed or mortgage is out of the possession of the grantee or mortgagee, and without his knowledge or consent, it does not work a destruction of it. When the mortgage was acknowledged by the defendant it contained a clause to the effect \u201cthat the said party of the first part, in consideration of the sum of $30,000, has sold, and by these presents does grant and convey, to the said party of the second part,\u201d etc.; and the further clause that \u201cthis grant is intended as a security for the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u25a0of any and all notes made by the El Oro Mining Company, and in lorsed by William T. Hamilton and William N. Thompson, and now held and owned by the party of the second part, and of any and all renewals of said notes; and also to secure said second party from all loss by reason of his liability as indorser upon any and all notes made by said El Oro Mining Company, and indorsed by said Hamilton and Thompson, and any and all renewals thereof. \u201d The lien given to the plaintiff by the mortgage secured the indebtedness mentioned in the language we have just quoted. That indebtedness has not been discharged, and it is equitable that the mortgage should remain to the extent \u25a0of $30,000 as collateral to such indebtedness. In the event of that indebtedness being discharged, or a portion of it discharged, it may be claimed in behalf of the defendant that the lien as originally created should cease or be restricted to the amount remaining unpaid on that indebtedness. No such question, however, seems to have been presented at the special term, or provided for in the formal judgment which was entered. Perhaps the defendant, if the mortgage is held in virtue of the views already expressed, would be entitled to have the judgment qualified in that respect. We may afford her an \u25a0opportunity to have the judgment modified by an insertion of such additional provision, if she should 'be so advised. In the corroboration of the views already expressed it may be observed that on the 17th of March, 1885, the defendant and the plaintiff entered into stipulations by an instrument under seal, acknowledged on that day before the same notary who took the acknowledgment to the mortgage. In that instrument, which related to the indebtedness of the El Oro Mining Company, held by the plaintiff, and upon which the husband of defendant was liable, it was agreed, among other things, that, \u201cas long as the whole of the net proceeds of said mine are applied to the payment of said paper monthly, provided such monthly payments amount to $5,000 each, \u201d no proceedings were to be taken to enforce the payment of the commercial paper of the mining company; and in that instrument it was further provided, viz.: \u201cIt is agreed by the subscribers, W. T. Hamilton and F. M. Hamilton, that all property and security held by said Gleason or the said Third National Bank as collateral to the indebtedness or liability of said W. T. Hamilton to said bank or said Gleason shall be held, and the same is hereby pledged to said Gleason, as security for the payment of said notes so to be purchased by him, except as hereinafter provided.\u201d \u201c(5) Upon the completion of the' purchase of said notes by said Gleason in the manner aforesaid the 25 bonds of said mining company, and the stock of the Onondaga Iron Company, now held as collateral to said notes, shall be held as collateral, first, to a certain other $30,000 note of the Morris Bun Coal Company, on which said Hamilton and Lynch are liable as indorsers, and, after said last-mentioned note is paid, then said securities shall be held as collateral to the other indebtedness of said W. T. Hamilton to said Gleason or said bank. \u201d It may be said with considerable force that the effect of these stipulations on the part of the \u25a0defendant with the plaintiff tend to support the position stated above, that the plaintiff is entitled to hold the mortgage as originally drawn until the indebtedness specified in the original draft of the mortgage is paid. Surely when the instrument of March 17, 1885, was executed by the defendant, the plaintiff held the mortgage in suit as a security, and it was embraced within the expression: \u201cAll property and security held by said Gleason * * * as collateral to the indebtedness or liability of said W. T. Hamilton to said bank or said Gleason, * * * and the same is hereby pledged to said Gleason as security for the payment of said notes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">2. It was insisted upon the trial at the circuit and at the special term and in the argument before us \u201cthat the disputed clause was inserted in the mortgage with the knowledge and consent of the defendant;\u201d and the special term found \u201c that said clause was written in said mortgage with the knowledge and consent of the defendant, Fannie M. Hamilton, and after the same was writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>ten therein she assented to the same, and consented that it should form a part of said mortgage. \u201d However, it is insisted on behalf of the appellant that the finding is unsupported by evidence, and that the same is against the evidence in the case. Mr. Doheny, who was called as a witness in behalf of the defendant, testified that the mortgage was prepared in behalf of the plaintiff in his office under his supervision. He testifies: \u201cIt came back to me executed the day that it was drawn, as I remember it; and at that time the clause referred to was not in the mortgage. Some time after it came back to me this clause was written in. * * * I returned it to Mr. Hamilton, calling his attention to the interlineations, and asking for are-execution of it. * * <em>* </em>My recollection is that he took the mortgage, and went down to Mr. Hamilton\u2019s office, two floors below our own, and called his attention to some language in the addition that had been made, to the fact that we had put it in, and asked that the mortgage be re-executed; and I can tell you, if you wish, what I think his reply was. He said that John [the notary] would go over and take Mrs. Hamilton\u2019s acknowledgment just as soon as he could.\u201d \u201cA few days after that,\u201d the witness continues, \u201cI went upstairs, and found the mortgage in my office. I think I found it on my table in my room, but I am not sure about that. I was also the attorney for Mr. Hamilton at this time in various matters.\u201d In the course of the examination of the defendant it appeared that she had authorized her husband to transact business for her in respect to the matters involved, and inquired into in this action. She testified: \u201cHe managed everything. He had everything;\u201d and she added that he represented her in all transactions relating to her property. Iieeffe, the notary, was called, and while giving his testimony on the subject of whether the mortgage was reacknowledged or not, and in answer to the question whether he took a reacknowledgment, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I did;\u201d and, when asked whether he would swear positively, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I did;\u201d and, upon the question being put to him again, viz.: \u201cQuestion. Wil] you swear positively that you did not? <em>\u2022Answer. </em>Ho, I would not swear positively that I didn\u2019t. I took a great many acknowledgments about this time. \u201d And when this witness was asked if he did not, some time after the mortgage bears date, meet Mr. Doheny, and inform him as too second acknowledgment from Mrs. Hamilton, and that .the mortgage had been left in Doheny\u2019s office, his answer was: \u201cI don\u2019t remember any such conversation.\u201d He was then asked: \u201cDo you swear that such a conversation did not take place? <em>Answer. </em>Ho, I have no recollection of any such conversation.\u201d And the further question was put to him: \u201cWill you swear you didn\u2019t have such a conversation? <em>Answer. </em>I won\u2019t swear positively that I didn\u2019t or that I did. I have no recollection of any such conversation. To the best of my recollection, I didn\u2019t.\u201d When the witness, William T. Hamilton, the husband of the defendant, was upon the stand, he detailed the circumstances attending the execution of the mortgage, his knowledge thereof, and his conversation with his wife in respect thereto. He admits that Mr. Doheny afterwards called upon him, and said that he \u201c wanted to add a word to that mortgage;\u201d and he adds, \u201cThere were several conversations of the same kind,\u2014similar. \u201d On the 11th of Hovember, 1884, the defendant executed a power of attorney to her husband, which was acknowledged on the 19th of Hovember, wherein she appointed her husband her attorney, with authority as follows: \u201cForme and in my name, place, and stead to conduct, carry on, transact, and exercise the general control and supervision over all of the property, business, and interests of whatever kind and wheresoever situated that I now or may hereafter own, hold, claim, or be interested in, and to make, execute, sign, seal, and deliver for me and in my name all bills, bonds, deeds, mortgages, notes, leases, specialties, or other instruments in writing whatever, which shall be necessary to the proper conducting, carrying on, and transacting the business aforesaid, and to do and perform all and every act and deed of whatever name or nature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>in any wise appertaining to said business, property, or interests, binding me as firmly and irrevocably by such deed or performance as if I were myself present thereto consenting, hereby ratifying, confirming, and allowing whatever my said attorney shall lawfully do in the premises.\u201d This power seems to be very broad, giving him power to execute mortgages and to transact any and all kinds of business for her in respect to all property she then owned or might thereafter own, hold, claim, or be interested in. The evidence abundantly shows that she was interested in the mining company, and that she was affected by its credit, standing, and indebtedness. It is not overlooked that she as a witness, and her husband as a witness, gave evidence tending to indicate that the mortgage was not reaclmowledged after the clause in question was inserted therein. However, with all the evidence to which reference has been made before the jury and before the special term, we are not prepared to say that the finding of the jury, or the finding of the court, that the additional clause in the mortgage was inserted without her assent or subsequent ratification, which is equivalent to original authority, is unsupported. If her agent assented to it, she assented to it. It may not be said that the finding is unsupported by evidence tending to sustain it. As to whether the evidence given by her and given by her husband was sufficient to countervail the evidence to which reference has been made or not was a question for the jury and for the trial judge. He saw all the witnesses, heard all the circumstances we have alluded to, and many others. He witnessed the searching cross-examinations, and saw the bearing of the witnesses under the same; and when we give to his finding of fact such influence as we think we should, with his better opportunities to judge of the same, we are not prepared to say the finding of fact made at the special term is contrary to the weight of evidence. We do not therefore feel called upon to disturb it. The court was authorized to \u201cset aside the findings of the jury, or use some of them, and to make the finding which is now brought in question.\u201d Ham<em>mond </em>v. Morgan, 101 N. Y. 186, 4 N. E. Rep. 328; <em>Acker </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>109 N. Y. 11, 15 N. E. Rep. 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">3. numerous exceptions were taken during the progress of the trial before the jury, and apparently were renewed at the special term, and numerous exceptions were taken to the findings of fact and law as made by the trial court, and to the refusals to find, and they have been largely discussed by the appellant before us. We have looked at them. This is an equity action, and section 1003 applies; and in that section it is provided; \u201cAn error in the admission or exclusion of evidence, or in any other ruling or direction of the judge, upon the trial, may, in the discretion of the court which reviews it, be disregarded, if that court is of the.opinion that substantial justice does not require that a new trial should be granted.\u201d The views already expressed, if adopted, seem to warrant the conclusion \u201cthat substantial justice does not require that a new trial should be granted.\u201d We forbear an extended examination of the exceptions, and we are of the opinion that the orders and conclusions reached at the special term should be sustained. Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
