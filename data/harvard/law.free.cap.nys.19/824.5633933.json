In an action to recover such sum defendant set up a counterclaim for damages in that the \u201cunited societies\u201d failed to use the park as a body, part of them having gone elsewhere; and averred as a further defense that they brought their own wines and refreshments with them, and violated certain other agreements. <em>Meld, </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b844-9\">' the court properly compelled defendant to elect whether to stand on the counterclaim or the facts alleged by way of defense.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b844-10\">8.

The defense was (1) a counterclaim for damages, in that the united societies, in order to procure the contract, had falsely represented to defendant that they would as an entirety use plaintiff\u2019s park, whereas they \u201csplit up,\u201d and the greater number of the societies held their picnics elsewhere; (2) that such of the societies as did use the park brought with them their own wines and refreshments, and further violated their agreement by permitting games of chance in the park. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AUY\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b844-14\">Argued before Freedman and Dugro, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b844-15\"><em>Lorenz Zeller, </em>for appellant. <em>Warren W. Foster, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b844-16\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A2e\">The case contains no certificate or statement or other proof that the case on appeal contains all the evidence, and consequently this court cannot determine that the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, if such order was made, is erroneous, as contrary to the evidence, or as against the weight of evidence. Moreover, the case contains no order denying motion for new trial. A mere exception to the refusal to grant the motion, it has been repeatedly held, presents no question of fact for review. For the reasons stated, the exceptions only can be received, and, if they are found untenable, the verdict of the jury must be held to have conclusively established that the contract sued upon was not procured from defendant by rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>resentations of existing material facts that were false and-fraudulent,, and also that the contract was substantially performed on plaintiff\u2019s part. The trial judge properly compelled the defendant to elect either to stand on her alleged counterclaim, and to affirm the contract, or to abandon the counterclaim as such, and to stand on the alleged facts as a defense. Defendant could not have the benefits of a valid contract without bearing its burdens. She could not be permitted to affirm in part and rescind in part. To such a state of facts the case cited by appellant\u2019s counsel <em>(Bruce </em>v. <em>Burr, </em>67 N. <em>Y. </em>237) has no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The offered evidence of preparations made by the defendant for the picnic was properly excluded. The only theory on which such evidence might be admissible is that it goes to show defendant\u2019s belief in the representations made. But no representation is available for that purpose unless it is a representation as to an existing material fact. It was made to appear that the representations relied upon for rendering the excluded evidence admissible related to mere expectations, and not to existing material facts. If the defendant wished to rely on the representations of expectations which she claimed plaintiff\u2019s committee made to her, she should have exacted from the committee a guaranty of the number to be present, or a guaranty of profits. The questions at issue were fully and fairly submitted to the jury under a charge which carefully guarded every right which the defendant had, and no exception appears anywhere which calls for reversal. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
