Babcock against Fay Smith. The action was commenced by the personal service of the summons and a copy of the complaint upon the defendant. Upon the return of such summons and copy of the complaint, namely, on the 12th day of May, 1892, the defendant failed to put in an appearance, and the justice heard proof of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, which was substantially as follows: That the plaintiff was a boarding-house keeper in the city of New York; that the defendant was a boarder, occupying a room and taking his breakfast with plaintiff; that defendant, after becoming indebted to plaintiff, clandestinely left the house, unknown to plaintiff or his family, and in a secret manner removed all his baggage and wardrobe, except an old pair of pants and a vest. The fact that he had left did not become known until some time after he had gone away. When found, the defendant refused to pay his board. Plaintiff claimed a lien against the defendant\u2019s baggage and wardrobe, not in actual use, under the law giving boarding-house keepers a lien upon all baggage and personal effects of their boarders for unpaid board. Upon the close of the proofs, the justice reserved his decision, and on the 14th day of May, 1892, rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, and against the defendant, for $19.04 damages and $2.50 costs, making a total of $21.64. The counsel for the plaintiff thereupon requested the justice to render a judgment on which an execution could be issued against defendant\u2019s body, which the justice refused to do, and to which refusal the plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted. From the judgment, plaintiff thereupon appealed to this court. On the argument of the appeal, plaintiff only appeared by counsel, the defendant not appearing.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AIQ\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b837-11\">Argued before Bischoff and Gtegerich, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b837-12\"><em>John A.

The judgment is therefore reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the plaintiff to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
