That the plaintiff entered upon her employment under said agreement, and duly discharged all the duties thereof until about June 21, 1889, up to which time she received of defendant the sum of ten dollars, when she was discharged by the defendant without any fault on her, this plaintiff\u2019s, part, and that she has been ever since, and still is, ready to perform such agreement on her part, and at the time of such discharge she offered to perform said agreement on her part in full, but the defendant then refused, and still refuses, to allow her to do so, or to pay her therefor, to her damage of seventy dollars.\u201d The answer admits the payment of $10, and alleges payment \u201cfor any and all services rendered. \u201d She also sets up as a defense \u201cthat at the time of the making of the supposed contract the defendant was the wife of Charles Schlager, and said contract was not made in or about the carrying on of any trade or business by her, and did not relate to and was not for the benefit of her separate estate, and is not a charge thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-6\">The referee finds \u201cthat on and prior to May 9, 1889, the said plaintiff came from Catskill, Green county, if. Y., and entered into a contract with the said defendant, whereby the said plaintiff agreed to render services for the defendant \u2018as nurse girl, to do her own washing and ironing, keep theparlorand defendant\u2019s room in order, and take care of baby,\u2019 for the term of eight months at least, and to commence working May 13, 1889, at the price of $10 per month. * * * The said defendant agreed to pay said plaintiff for such services $10 per month for said term, and the plaintiff had no knowledge that defendant was acting as agent for any person in making such contract.\u201d The referee also found \u201cthat the defendant, I. Belie Schlager, was for several years, and prior to June 7, 1889; a married woman, residing with her husband, Charles Schlager, at So. 87 Chenango St., in the city of Binghamton, S. Y., and was supported by him, as a member of his family, and attending to the household duties of her home; and also was not engaged in any trade or business, and had no separate estate; and that on said June 7,1889, her said husband died. \u201d He also found that the plaintiff \u201centered upon the discharge of her duties under said contract May 13, 1889, and she was paid by said defendant, for one month\u2019s services June 14, 1889, and she continued working for said defendant under said contract until June 21, 1889, when the said defendant, without any just and sufficient cause, discharged the said plaintiff from any other or further services under said contract.\u201d The referee also found \u201cthat the said plaintiff was ready and willing to render the services for the defendant, as she had agreed to do under said contract, during the term for which she was employed, and was ready and willing to work during said term, but did not find the same kind of employment, but did other work during said term, for which she received the sum of eight dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-7\">As a conclusion of law the referee found \u201cthat the contract mentioned in the finding of fact herein marked \u2018second\u2019 is a good and valid contract, and was binding upon the defendant, and that upon the discharge of the plaintiff from services under said contract the said defendant became liable to the plaintiff for damages.\u201d Also, \u201cthat upon the evidence given upon the trial of this action the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendant.\u201d Upon the request of the defendant the referee found \u201cthat the said letters written by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>the defendant contained all the stipulations and agreement made by defendant in regard to hiring the plaintiff, except on May 9, 1889, defendant told plaintiff to commence work May 13, 1889.\u201d The referee also found \u201cthatsaid letters were written by defendant at the dictation and request of the husband,, the said Charles Schlager.\u201d He also found \u201cthat plaintiff had no knowledge that the letters were dictated. \u201d He declined to find \u201cthat the defendant wrote-the said letters, and proposed hiring the plaintiff, as the agent of her husband.\u201d He found \u201c that the said Charles Schlager replied to the proposition of the plaintiff, and stated when she should commence her services; that he-inclosed his mileage book on the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railroad; that she could use the mileage book to pay her fare from Albany to Binghamton.\u201d He also-found \u201cthat the plaintiff came to Binghamton, paying her fare from Albany to Binghamton with said mileage book.\u201d He also found \u201cthat the Plaintiff entered into said agreement, and undertook said services, knowing that the defendant was a married woman, residing with her husband, and that the services were to be performed in the family of said husband.\u201d Also \u201cthat the-plaintiff commenced work on the 13th day of May, and labored in the family of the said Charles Schlager, caring for his children as nurse,, and performing the duties of a domestic, until June 21st following.\u201d He refused to find \u201cthat the plaintiff has not shown an intention on the part of the defendant to become bound personally to pay the wages, or to charge herself therefor.\u201d He also refused to find \u201cthat the alleged contract was for services to be performed for the husband, Charles Schlager. \u201d He also refused to find \u201c that the services actually rendered were for the said Charles Schlager.\u201d He also refused to find that \u201cthe alleged agreement was not the defendant\u2019s, contract. \u201d He also refused to find \u201cthe alleged obligation was not created by her in or about to carry on a separate trade or business, or for the benefit of a separate estate.\u201d He also refused to find as conclusion of law \u201c that upon the evidence in this case the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.\u201d He also refused to find \u201cthat the evidence does not show or establish a liability on the part of the defendant to the plaintiff within the limits of responsibility on the part of married women.\u201d Also, \u201c that any contract of the defendant was made as the-agent of her husband, who is alone liable thereon. \u201d He also refused to find \u201cthat the defendant, being the agent of her husband, is not liable upon the alleged contract.\u201d He also refused to find \u201cthat the alleged contract having been for services in the family of the husband, and for his benefit, the plaintiff was bound to assume that the defendant was acting as the wife or agent of her husband, and the defendant cannot be held liable thereon.\u201d He also-refused to find \u201cthat, as the wife of Charles Schlager, the defendant was-authorized to hire necessary servants for tlie'family, and, as she was apparently pursuing the authority given her, she is not liable upon the .contract. \u201d He-also refused to find \u201cthat the natural and legal presumption is that the agreement of the defendant was made in properly and naturally conducting the-affairs of the family. \u201d Also, \u201cthat the marital duties of the husband required him to pay for the services of the plaintiff, and any agreement on the part of the defendant to pay the same is void.\u201d He also refused to find \u201cthat, the-alleged agreement having been for services to be rendered the husband, Charles Schlager, any agreement on the part of the defendant to pay the plaintiff therefor was void for want of consideration.\u201d Proper exceptions were taken to the findings as made, and to the refusals to find as requested.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b132-3\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0N\">Defendant\u2019s first letter to the plaintiff was dated March 13, 1889, and her second letter addressed to the plaintiff was dated April 30th. The letters stated somewhat minutely the needs and wants of the defendant in respect to a servant girl, and the duties that would be.imposed upon the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>tiff if she entered into the service proposed. It appears in the testimony of the plaintiff as a witness that the husband of the defendant, having been made aware of the negotiations had by his wife with the plaintiff, communicated with the plaintiff. Plaintiff testifies, viz.: \u201cHe, Mr. Schlager, sent me his mileage book in May, about the 7th, a few days before I started. He sent it with a letter. I have not the letter. Last saw the letter in May, 1889, at Catskill. Have not seen it since. Do not know where it is. * \"* * He said I shouldn\u2019t be in a hurry about coming; that they wa\u2019n\u2019t quite settled yet. He said book was inclosed for my fare from Albany to Binghamton, which I could use. I think of nothing else. I did use it from Albany to Binghamton. That was the first said about fare by either party. I used it and came on May 9th. At that time Mr. Schlager was living at Ho. 87 Cheaango street, with the defendant, his wife. * * * I understood he had occupied the premises for some months before I came. He said in the letter they were cleaning house. He did not say when they would be ready for me, or when they would be through cleaning house. Mr. Schlager had one child, two years old. A portion of my duties was to take care of that child, and the other duties were in his family, about the house.\u201d We think it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that her employment was by thedefendant, and not by the husband. We think the evidence indicates that the defendant was acting as the agent of her husband in writing the letters to the plaintiff, and her services were engaged for and in behalf of the husband. From the testimony of the plaintiff in respect to the letter received from the husband, together with the other facts and circumstances disclosed in the evidence, it is quite apparent that the plaintiff understood that her services were requested in the household of the husband, and for his benefit. The services to be rendered were for the benefit of the husband, therefore. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>1 Lans. 105, Johnson, J., says: \u201cGoods purchased by the wife upon credit for family use are the goods of the husband, and the husband, and not the wife, is liable to pay for them, unless there is some special agreement between the parties, by which they are sold to the wife for her exclusive use, and upon the credit of her separate property, and not upon the credit of the husband.\u201d In <em>Kegney </em>v. <em>Ovens, </em>(Sup.) 2 N. Y. Supp. 319, it was held, viz.: \u201cIf the party dealing with the wife knows she is a married woman living with her husband, and the order is of a character to indicate that it is for the benefit of her husband\u2019s family, he is bound to presume that she is acting for her husband, and cannot hold her personally liable unless she expressly agrees to become so.\u201d In <em>Dickinson </em>v. <em>Ensign, </em>(N. Y. App.) 25 N. E. Rep. 5, it appeared that the articles were charged to the defendant on the plaintiff\u2019s books, and that the plaintiff from time to time rendered statements of the account to the defend- . ant, who examined, corrected them, and made payments' thereon; and \u201cthe referee found that defendant directed that the articles should be charged to her.\u201d The case differs essentially from the one before us, and does not aid the contention of the plaintiff. In <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>116 N. Y. 310, 22 N. E. Rep. 451, it appeared the services were rendered by an architect for the benefit of the separate estate of a married woman, and she knew at the time and was consulted at length about them; and upon a review of all the evidence given in the case the court of appeals (second division) reached the conclusion that upon the whole evidence, \u201cas the services in question were rendered for the benefit of the separate estate of the defendant, and she knew at the time,\u201d a question of fact was presented which \u201cshould have been submitted to the jury.\u201d We see nothing in that case which aids the plaintiff. In <em>Van Mallen </em>v. <em>Fuhrman, </em>(Sup.) 9 N. Y. Supp. 878, the referee found that the groceries \u201cwere sold by the plaintiff, and delivered to the said testatrix, at her request, and for her benefit, and on her sole responsibility, and that during such time she was the owner of real property in her own right.\u201d The evidence before us in this case would not support a similar finding of fact, and the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>made by the referee do not come up to the finding in the ease from which the quotation is made. Although the enabling act of 1884 (chapter 381, Laws 1884) authorizes a married woman to enter into a contract, as explained in <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>114 N. Y. 408, 21 N. E. Rep. 992, and although since the passage of that act she is bound by her contracts, we think the act does not give the plaintiff the right of recovery.in this case. The important and pivotal question is whether the employment was the employment of the husband or of this defendant. <em>Tiemeyer </em>v. <em>Turnquist, </em>85 N. Y. 516. Upon the whole evidence we think the contract of employment claimed in the case was with the husband, and that the evidence fails to disclose an intention on the part of the defendant, the wife, to become personally liable upon the contract for the servant\u2019s services to be performed in the family of the husband. <em>Whitford </em>v. <em>Laidler, </em>94 N. Y. 145; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Moul, </em>(Sup.) 4 N. Y. Supp. 299. We are of the opinion that the referee fell into an error in holding that the wife, and not the husband, was liable upon the alleged contract made for the services of the plaintiff. We are therefore of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed upon the law and facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Judgment reversed on the law and facts, and a new trial ordered,1 with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
