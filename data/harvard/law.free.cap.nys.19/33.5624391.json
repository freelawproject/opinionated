Some of the alleged promises made by the defendant were to use his best endeavors to accomplish certain results, and it does not appear from the complaint but that he did perform such promises. Other promises were to do certain things which were directly in the line of his duty as a director of said company. The complaint alleges that the defendant agreed with the plaintiff to do such things, but does not state whether such agreement was in writing or oral, nor whether it was an express or an implied agreement. It is immaterial, however, whether there was an express agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant as to the performance of such acts as lay within the line of his duty as a director, for there was an implied agreement between the defendant and the plaintiff and all other stockholders that the defendant would do his duty as such director. If, therefore, the plaintiff has suffered injury because of the failure of the defendant to perform such duty, that injury is one which the plaintiff has suffered in common with all the other stockholders of the company, and the plaintiff cannot maintain a separate action to recover the depreciation of his stock. He must first request the company or its officers to bring an action, which, if successful, would inure to the benefit of all the stockholders; and if the company, or its officers, should refuse or neglect to bring such action, then he might maintain the same on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">A third class of such alleged promises was to do certain things which could only be done through the action of the board of directors. Among such things are two of the matters which are particularly specified in the complaint, and which relate to the sale of lots belonging to the company, and to the construction of an electric railroad at a reasonable expense. If the allegations of the complaint are to be regarded as setting forth an agreement on the part of the defendant-to do such things, irrespective of the action of the board of directors, such agreement would obviously be null and void; and if such allegations are to be regarded as setting forth an agreement on the part of the defendant to control the board of directors, and induce them to act entirely in accordance with the wishes of the plaintiff, such agreement was an illegal one, and cannot be enforced in this action. It appears by the complaint that lots were sold, and an electric railroad constructed, and that various other things were done, in a manner which did not meet the approval of the plaintiff. All such acts must, however, have been done by authority of the board of directors; and, if such directors were guilty of a breach of duty, they can be held responsible in a proper action; but an agreement that the defendant should control the action of the board in such manner as the plaintiff should require was against public policy, and cannot be enforced. The plaintiff was the owner of but 800 shares out of 10,000, and the defendant could not lawfully enter into an agreement which contemplated that the directors of the company should surrender their powers to the plaintiff. In Morawetz on Private Corporations (section 519) it is said: \u201cIt is clear that a director has no right to sell his influence in the management of the company, or to enter into any agreement by which his official action would be influenced or controlled.\u201d This statement of the law is supported by many authorities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>See <em>West </em>v. <em>Camden, </em>135 U. S. 507, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 838; <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Matteson, </em>45 N. Y. 22; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Dame, </em>18 Pick. 472; <em>Guernsey </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>120 Mass. 501; <em>Duncomb </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>84 N. Y. 198, (190;) <em>Hoyle </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>54 N. Y. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">It does not affect the matter that the alleged agreement has been performed' on the part of the plaintiff. As the alleged agreement is against public policy, the performance by the plaintiff does not give him any right to claim performance on the part of the'defendant. \"The judgment appealed from should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
