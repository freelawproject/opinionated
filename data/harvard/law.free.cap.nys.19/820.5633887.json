Dolbeer, assignee of F. C. Linde <em>&amp; </em>Co., against John Stout, to recover warehouse charges for storing poultry. Defendant had already brought an action in the supreme court against Linde &amp; Co. to recover for damages caused by improper storage. From an order staying proceedings until the close of the action in the supreme court, plaintiff appeals. For former reports, see 17 H. Y. Supp. 184, 186.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AsP\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b840-9\">The opinion of McAdam, J., at special term, was as follows: \u201cThe supreme court action was commenced first. It is to recover $19,546.09, and,, but for the voluntary assignment made by Linde &amp; Co., the cross demand could have been litigated in the supreme court action. If that action is stayed, the defendant here, who is the plaintiff there, can use only a small portion of his demand, ($4,811.46,) and may have to renew his litigation as. to the balance. If the supreme court action is tried first, the entire $19,-546.09 will be litigated and disposed of. The law does not encourage double-trials and multiplicity of suits, and the court will stay one action and allow the other, in which the entire relief may be awarded, to proceed. <em>People </em>v. <em>Northern R.
