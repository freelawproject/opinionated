From the evidence, which consisted entirely of the uncle\u2019s declarations, it was impossible to tell whether the consideration for this agreement was the taking of the uncle\u2019s name by plaintiff, the care which was to be given him, the perpetuation of his business, or the sacrifice of plaintiff\u2019s business. The agreement, which was paroi, contemplated certain legacies, after which it proposed without further specification to leave the residue of the estate to the plaintiff. Plaintiff received a salary while with his uncle, and could have left him at any time without violating .any engagement. The affidavits on which his application for a change of name were made did not mention any agreement on the part of the uncle to make him his heir, but only an \u201cintention\u201d to do so. Plaintiff\u2019s own affidavit stated that this was to be done, if \u201chis conduct merited. \u201d The uncle afterwards married, and had children.. <em>Held, </em>that a specific performance would not be decreed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b352-10\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-11\">Action by Charles F.

Y. 406; <em>Parsell </em>v. <em>Stryker, </em>41 N. Y. 480. Such a contract, however, especially\u2019 when it is attempted to be established by paroi, is regarded with suspicion, and not sustained, except upon the strongest evidence that it was founded upon a valuable consideration, and deliberately \u25a0entered into by the decedent. Wat. Spec. Perf. \u00a7 41. The cases in which performance of such contracts have been enforced in this state were principally cases where specific property was agreed to be devised or bequeathed upon an adequate consideration. Such was the case of <em>Parsell </em>v. <em>Stryker, </em>above cited, where, indeed, the contract sought to be enforced was in writing and entirely specific. The lands which were the subject of the agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>under consideration in <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Holloday, </em>13 Abb. N. C. 16, consisted of a definite tract called \u201cOphir Farm.\u201d This was also the case in <em>Sherman </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>(opinion of Rtjmsey, J., 13 Abb. N. C. 20, note,}, affirmed 27 Hun, 149. In <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>(Sup.) 16 FI. Y. Supp. 621, the agreement was a certain specific part of the decedent\u2019s premises and chattels. We have, however, found no case in this state where an agreement to leave the whole of one\u2019s estate, real and personal, to a particular person has been enforced. On the contrary, there are cases where specific performance of such a contract has been refused. It was refused in <em>Lisk </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>referred to in the same case, (25 Barb. 435,) when, after the dismissal of the bill, an action was brought for money compensation. The refusal was based upon the uncertainty which necessarily existed with regard to the subject-matter. This was recognized in <em>Shakespeare </em>v. <em>Markham, supra, </em>where Talcott, J., observed that \u201cthere was no restraint by the supposed contract upon the testator\u2019s power to dispose of the same, or any part thereof, during his life, and the amount which he should have at his death was therefore wholly uncertain. The contract, therefore, by reason of its uncertainty, was one which a court of equity would not be under the necessity of compelling performance of.\u201d The case of <em>Lisk </em>v. <em>Sherman </em>was approved of in the case last cited, both at general term and in the court of appeals. Talcott, J., at general term, said it was quite similar to the case then'under-consideration, as the agreement \u201cwas that the plaintiff was to live with and take care of the testatrix as long as the latter lived, and at her death was toll ave all the property which the testatrix should leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">It is vitally important that the statute of wills should be maintained in its integrity, and the courts should not, by lessening or weakening the well-defined prerequisites to specific performance, furnish a loophole for the evasion of its provisions. So important are these provisions with respect to testamentary disposition that it has been doubted whether in any case, especially when the contract is sought to be established by paroi testimony, so patent a. means for their evasion as bills for specific performance should have been allowed. <em>Shakespeare </em>v. <em>Markham, supra. </em>It is certain, however, that in this class of cases the ordinary rules which govern in actions to compel the specific performance of contracts, and which furnish reasonable safeguards, against fraud, should be rigidly applied. These rules require that the contract be certain and definite in all its parts; that it be mutual, and founded upon an adequate consideration; and that it be established by the clearest and most convincing evidence. Even then, when the contract limits a man\u2019s-right to dispose of his property by will, it is regarded with suspicion, and enforced only when it is apparent that the hand of equity is required to prevent a fraud upon the promisee. There is another rule which should be strictly adhered to in this class of cases, and that is that the remedy is a matter of judicial discretion, and that relief should be withheld, where a decree for specific performance would work injustice to innocent third persons, or where it would be contrary to public policy. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>1 N. Y. St. Rep. 531, and eases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Applying these principles to the case under consideration, we think the \u25a0 judgment of the special term dismissing the complaint was correct. In the 'first place, the contract was not established with reasonable certainty. It was not made with parents for the benefit of an infant, but directly with an adult. The proof rests entirely upon the declarations of the decedent. Some of these-declarations were, it is true, made in the presence of the plaintiff, but they were not in the nature of a present bargain. Many of these declarations were\u25a0 merely as to the decedent\u2019s intention, while others were as to what had been done. He told some witnesses that he had made a will in the plaintiff\u2019s favor, and that this was done in consideration-of the plaintiff coming to the decedent\u2019s home, and living with him, and giving up his business and home in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>San Francisco. To another witness he gave as a reason for making his will in plaintiff\u2019s favor that he wanted to perpetuate his name and also his business. To still another he said he had made his will, and had made Charlie {the plaintiff) his heir, as Charlie had given up his business interests in San Francisco, and had taken -his name to perpetuate his name and business. When the plaintiff, at decedent\u2019s request, had his name changed to Gall by a judicial order, the decedent told the attorney who attended to the matter that \u201cCharlie was to be his heir, and assume his place in the business at hisdeath.\u201d To his niece Bebecca Funkenstein he said that he made an \u201cagreement with Charlie that, if Charlie would leave his home and remain with him, he would give him everything he possessed for changing his name; he would leave him his business, his property, and everything he possessed, excepting some few legacies that he left to her sister and brother and the three cousins iu New Zealand.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s mother testified to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">It is quite uncertain from this testimony what precise agreement, if any,, was ever made between the plaintiff and the decedent. If there was any actual agreement between them, it is impossible to say whether the consideration therefor was the change of name, or the care which was to be given to the decedent, or the sacrifice of the California business. Then, too, if an actual agreement on the decedent\u2019s part is to be inferred from these declarations, such agreement was uncertain. There was a reservation of the right to make some legacies, and the complaint charges an undertaking \u201cto leave the remainder of his estate, both real and personal,\u201d to the plaintiff. Bo specific property, it will be observed, but whatever he might happen to have at the time of his death, without even a general statement as to its extent, character, or value. How is it possible, under well-settled rules, to enforce such an agreement, were it conclusively established? And, even if the consideration were clear, how can its adequacy be determined when the property to be ultimately realized therefor was necessarily unknown at the time the agreement was made? Further than this, there was no binding mutuality. The plaintiff could have left the decedent at any time without violating any \u25a0engagement on his part. The observations made in the house of lords of England in <em>Maddison </em>v. <em>Alderson, </em>8 App. Cas. 467, are pertinent on this branch of the case. There the decedent induced a woman to serve him as housekeeper, without wages, for many years, and to give up other prospects of establishment in life, by a promise to make a will leaving her a life estate in land. He in fact signed the will, but unfortunately for the woman it was \u25a0not duly attested. It was held that there was no valid or enforceable contract. One of the law lords said that \u201cthe case thus presented was manifestly one of conduct on the appellant (affecting her arrangements in life and pecuniary interests) induced by promises of her master to leave her a life estate in the Moulton Manor farm by will, rather than one of definite contract for mutual considerations, made between herself and him at any particular time. There was certainly no contract on her part which she would have broken by voluntarily leaving his service at any time during his life, and I see no evidence of any agreement by her to serve without or to release her claim for wages. If there was a contract on his part, it was conditional upon and in consideration of a series of acts to be done by her, which she was at liberty to do or not to do as she thought fit, and which, if done, would -extend over the whole remainder of his life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The present case is weaker for the appellant than that just cited, for here the plaintiff received a salary for his services in the decedent\u2019s business, and lived with the decedent. Further doubt is thrown upon the existence and precise nature of the alleged agreement by the affidavits upon which the application was made, in April, 1883, to change the plaintiff\u2019s name. The plaintiff there states \u201cthat your petitioner\u2019s reasons for assuming such name \u00abre that your petitioner is a nephew of Joseph Gall, of the city of Bew York; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>that said Gall is advanced in life, and has no wife or children, and is desirous that his name be continued, and that your petitioner should take and bear his name, and that it is the name of Gall; and that said Gall has expressed his intention to make your petitioner a legatee under his (said Gall\u2019s) will, if your petitioner shall take and bear his name.\u201d The decedent in his affidavit upon the same application states: \u201cThat he has no wife or children, and is desirous that his said nephew should assume and bear his name, and that on the condition of his so doing it is his intention to make the said Charles Funkenstein a legatee under his will.\u201d Here we have an expression of intention, but not a word in either affidavit as to any agreement, much less an agreement to make the plaintiff his residuary legatee. Further, in the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit of October 28, 1886, presented to the surrogate, he makes this statement: \u201cAbout November 10,1882, I took charge of my uncle\u2019s interest in the Union Square business. I did so at the special instance and request of my uncle and aunt, who insisted that I should remain with them and give up my position in San Francisco, and that, if my conduct would merit it, they would adopt me as their son, having no children, and thus perpetuate the name of Gall, of which name and his business the old gentleman was very proud.\u201d This statement was entirely inconsistent with the unconditional agreement set forth in the present complaint, and it throws additional doubt upon the existence of any such agreement. These considerations would have sufficed to sustain the dismissal of the complaint, but they are reinforced by the fact of the decedent\u2019s second marriage and the existence of lawful issue. The parties, whatever their original understanding, could never have contemplated a restriction upon the decedent\u2019s right to marry or to provide for his children in case such marriage was fruitful. Nor could they have contemplated the taking, by the plaintiff, of the decedent\u2019s entire estate, to the exclusion of any such future wife or child. If such an agreement had been made, it certainly would have been against public policy, and void. Whatever agreement was made was necessarily subject to such possibilities, and was limited by implication accordingly. It will not, therefore, be necessary to consider the question with regard to the statute of frauds, as, for the reasons already given, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">O\u2019Brien, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b355-6\">Yan Brunt, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQb\">I concur in the result. I do not think that the courts will enforce a contract whereby a party deprives himself of all power to bequeath or devise by will the property of which he is the owner at death, except in cases of adoption, where the contract is made for the benefit of an infant, and not to the exclusion of children. It will certainly not do so in a case where the agreement is unilateral, and where it may be terminated by the other party at will.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
