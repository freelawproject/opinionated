To this charge defendant duly excepted. A verdict having been rendered for the plaintiff, defendant\u2019s counsel moved on the trial minutes to set it aside, specifying as one of the grounds of the \u00a1motion that the verdict was contrary to law. This motion was denied, and an order to \u00a1that effect duly entered. On appeal to che general term of the court below the judgment entered for plaintiff on .the verdict, and the order denying the motion for a new \u00a1trial, were affirmed, and from the judgment of affirmance defendant appeals to this \u2022court. In <em>Torbett </em>v. <em>Godwin, </em>17 N. Y. Supp. 46, decided by the general term of the supreme court, first department, it was held that the proper construction of section 21, os. 611, Laws 1875. rendered the officers of a corporation who make and file a false resort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>liable-only for debts contracted by the corporation subsequent to the filing of the report, and while they continue to be such officers, and in this construction the general term of this court has concurred in <em>Young </em>v. <em>Godwin, </em>19 N. <em>Y. </em>Supp. 656, (the opinion wherein is handed down herewith.) It follows, therefore, that the judgment of the general and trial terms of the court below must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Judgment of the general and trial terms of the city court reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
