There is evidence which will sustain a finding that the orders were accepted. The witness Rowland states that the only difference between an order and a good order is that the latter must be accepted by the house, and that an order becomes a good order as soon as the house receives it and enters it on the books. It follows that an order which has been received and entered on the books is one that has been accepted. There is evidence that the orders were received and entered on the books. Upon the whole case the judgment should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
