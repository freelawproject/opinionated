The absence of the judgment of affirmance of the general term of the court below from the case submitted to us on this appeal, however, precludes us from an affirmance of that judgment. Buie 2 of the general term rules of this court provides that the rules of the court of appeals governing appeals to that court shall \"apply to appeals from the city court to this court; and rule 5 of the court of appeals requires that the case, on appeal, shall contain a copy of the return of the clerk of the court from which the appeal is taken. If, therefore, we assume that the case submitted complies with the rules above mentioned, there is nothing before us for review, since, pursuant to section 3191 of the Code of Civil Procedure, we may only entertain appeals from the city court when they are taken from \u201cactual determinations\u201d of that court, made at a general term thereof. On the other hand, if it is urged that the case submitted is defective, in that it does not contain a copy of the clerk\u2019s return, and omits the judgment of affirmance upon which our authority to proceed is dependent, then consistency with the rules established for the orderly transaction of judicial business and the avoidance of any appearance of having affirmed a spurious judgment require that this appeal be dismissed. <em>Bastable </em>v. <em>Syracuse, </em>72 N. Y. 64. Appeal dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
