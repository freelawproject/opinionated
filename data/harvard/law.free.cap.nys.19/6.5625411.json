Wardlaw, administratrix of James R. Wardlaw, deceased, against the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of New York to recover $5,700 and interest, aggregating $6,821, for the salary of James R. Wardlaw. as \u201cassistant engineer\u201d during the interim between the time of his suspension and discharge. The defendant concedes the appointment, the suspension, and discharge, and the readiness of Wardlaw to perform his duties at all times. It claims, however, that because Wardlaw was appointed \u201ccity surveyor\u201d in 1877 by a resolution of the common council, his attempt to hold the position of \u201cassistant engineer\u201d was the holding of two offices, which, under section 55 of the consolidation act, prevents a recovery. The court directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for the amount claimed, and the defendant moves for a new trial. The motion was denied, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AUqH\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-9\">MoAdam, J., after stating the facts as above, filed the following opinion at special term:</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-10\">\u201cWhile the defendant might have discharged the decedent, and relieved itself from liability, it could not suspend him without pay, <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>113 N. Y. 416, 21 N. E. Rep. 119; <em>Emmitt </em>v. <em>Same, </em>[Super. N. Y.] 13 N. Y. Supp. 887, affirmed, 28 N. E. Rep. 19;) and the moneys he earned in other employments during the suspension are not to be credited to the defendant, <em>(Fitzsimmons </em>v. <em>City of Brooklyn, </em>102 N. Y. 536, 7 N. E. Rep. 787; <em>Lethbridge </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc., </em>[Super. N. Y.] 15 N. Y. Supp. 562.) There is nothing in the case which shows that the decedent abandoned or relinquished the office of assistant engineer, or in any manner discharged the defendant from its obligation to pay. The real question involved turns on whether the decedent, because he held the position of \u00ab city surveyor \u2019 under a resolution of the common council passed in 1877, held an office, within the meaning of the prohibition contained in section 55 of the consolidation act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which made him ineligible to hold the position of * assistant engineer \u2019 under the defendant. There is no express authority given to the common council to appoint city surveyors, and, if the board possesses any power upon the subject, it is by implication only. But that question need not be seriously considered, for it is apparent that the appointment is not an office, within the meaning of section 55, <em>supra. </em>\u2018 Office,\u2019 in the sense there employed, embraces the idea of public station, tenure, emolument, and duties, involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>right and corresponding duty to execute some public trust.. <em>In re Hathaway, </em>71 N. Y. 238; <em>People </em>v. <em>Duane, </em>121 N. Y. 367, 24 N. E. Rep. 845; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Hartwell, </em>6 Wall. 385; <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Germaine, </em>99 U. S. 508. In legal contemplation an office is an entity, and may exist, though without an incumbent. <em>People </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>28 Cal. 382. It is an employment on behalf of government, in any station of public trust, not transient, occasional, or incidental. It is where one has to do with another\u2019s affairs against his'will, and without his leave. The position of city surveyor has no tenure or salary. It does not exist independently of the incumbent, and does not become vacant by his death, removal, or resignation. It resembles that of licensee more than anything else. Every office implies an authority to execute some portion of the sovereign power of the state, either in making, executing, or administering the laws. The question came up in this court when it held that Frederick Dwight Olmstead, in holding the position of landscape architect of public parks and commissioner of state surveys, wras not holding two offices, within the meaning of the section referred to. The court said: \u2018 One who receives no certificate of appointment, has no term or tenure of office, but performs such duties as are required of him by the persons employing him, and whose responsibility is limited to them, is not an officer, and does not hold an office.\u2019 <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>Mayor, </em>42 N. Y. Super. Ct. 488. The court of appeals has held that the legislative prohibition to the common council against creating new officers extends to clerks, but not to janitors and ordinary servants, for they are not officers. <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc., </em>53 N. Y. 652; <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Same, </em>63 N. Y. 48. The decedent, by reason of his position of city surveyor, was in no sense a clerk, city employe, or public official, and did not come within the purpose and intent of the prohibition contained in section 55, <em>supra. </em>\u2018 The distinction,\u2019 said the court in <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>Mayor, supra, </em>\u2018is plainly taken between a person acting as a servant or employe, who does not discharge independent duties, but acts by direction of others, and an officer empowered to act in the discharge of a duty or trust, under obligations imposed by the sanctions and restrains of legal authority in official life.\u2019 The verdict was properly directed, and the motion for a new trial must be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b27-5\">Argued before Sedgwick, O.
