Purcell was president' and treasurer of the defendant, and that his duty was the managing of the defendant\u2019s restaurant in Boston.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">From the testimony of the plaintiff and three of his companions the jury could find these facts: On April 6, 1940, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>party of five, including the plaintiff, ate dinner at the restaurant. There were two bars in the restaurant. After dinner the party of five ordered beers at one of the bars. One of the party named Boyd started \u201cfooling and wrestling around a little bit\u201d with the father of another of \u201cthe boys\u201d in the party and then became involved in an altercation with a \u201cmiddle aged\u201d man described as intoxicated who had \u201cinjected himself into the picture.\u201d Blows were struck, and the \u201cmiddle aged\u201d man fell to the floor. Twenty or twenty-five minutes later, while the plaintiff and Boyd were still standing at the bar, James T. Purcell, accompanied by another man, approached and beckoned to them. Purcell said, \u201cWho struck the old man? What kind of a business do you think we are running here? We have to have order in this place.\u201d Boyd said, \u201cI did it,\u201d and then started to explain what had happened. Thereupon Purcell made a motion, also described as a gesture and as a signal. At this \u201ca short, stocky individual\u201d came from behind a partition and \u201cthrew a right hook at the plaintiff.\u201d After that both the plaintiff and Boyd, who had gone to the plaintiff\u2019s assistance, were thrown to the floor and were further assaulted and beaten, the plaintiff sustaining a bilateral fracture of the mandible. ' While this was going on Purcell stood a few feet away and did nothing and said nothing and made no remonstrance. After the assault was over, still saying nothing, he assisted the plaintiff \u201caround back of a partition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\">There was evidence that a day or two later Purcell said to the plaintiff\u2019s father, \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know it was your son. ... I stepped in to stop him from getting his head kicked off.\u201d But in answer to interrogatories Purcell said that he was \u201cnot present\u201d; that he understood the plaintiff was not set upon and beaten, but that \u201che was beating an elderly man,\u201d whom he knocked to the floor; that he (Purcell), being informed that there was a \u201crumpus,\u201d immediately proceeded to the vicinity and \u201cstopped the affair and quieted everybody down\u201d; and that when he arrived \u201cit was over\u201d and he \u201cquieted the patron and then the: plaintiff and the young man left the premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>There was evidence for the jury. The somewhat conflicting statements of Purcell could be considered in connection with the testimony of the eyewitnesses. If the jury believed the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff they could find that Purcell, mistakenly believing that the plaintiff instead of Boyd had been involved in the previous altercation, or that the plaintiff had participated in it with Boyd, caused the assault to be made upon the plaintiff by giving a signal to a person or persons who obeyed Purcell\u2019s directions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>99 Mass. 433; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>1 Allen, 89, 98; <em>Barden </em>v. <em>Felch, </em>109 Mass. 154, 157; <em>Keane </em>v. <em>Main, </em>83 Conn. 200. It is true that the motion, gesture or signal made by Purcell cannot be reproduced in the record and is not particularly described in the evidence included in the bill of exceptions. But there is enough in the record, nevertheless, to warrant an inference that whatever Purcell did was intended as a direction to a person or persons in his control to attack the plaintiff, and that such person or persons so understood it and acted upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The jury could also find that Purcell was acting throughout in his capacity as manager of the defendant\u2019s restaurant and in the defendant\u2019s behalf to maintain and vindicate its authority and control of \u201corder in this place,\u201d and that he acted as he did because he believed that the plaintiff, whom he found still on the premises, had just created a disturbance in the restaurant. There is nothing to suggest personal ill will on Purcell\u2019s part. The jury could hold the defendant responsible for Purcell\u2019s conduct. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bay State Wine &amp; Spirit Co. </em>212 Mass. 285. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Jacot, </em>235 Mass. 521. <em>Fanciullo </em>v. <em>B. G. &amp; S. Theatre Corp. </em>297 Mass. 44. <em>McDermott </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co. </em>313 Mass. 736. <em>Ridge </em>v. <em>J. J. Foley Cafe, Inc. </em>318 Mass. 310. <em>Pilos </em>v. <em>First National Stores Inc. </em>319 Mass. 475, 478. The case is distinguishable from <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Boston Storage Warehouse Co. </em>189 Mass. 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The verdict entered by the judge on leave reserved is set aside. The verdict of the jury is to stand, and judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff on that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
