The insurer made payments to the maximum amount of $4,500, as provided in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 34, as amended by St. 1935, c. 332, \u00a7 2, and St. 1941, c. 624, and in addition paid $400 as specific compensation for loss of the thumb, as provided in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 36, as appearing in St. 1935, c. 333. The employee applied for further compensation under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 34A, inserted by St. 1935, c. 364 (later amended by St. 1943, c. 276)', on the ground that his incapacity is permanent and total. See as to \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 34A, St. 1945, c. 717. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>reviewing board adopted the decision of the single member denying further compensation under \u00a7 34A, and in the Superior Court a decree was entered dismissing the claim of the employee, who appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The reviewing board, by adoption of the decision of the single member, found that the motions of all four fingers are limited; that there is but little motion in the wrist, which is deformed; but that in \u201call other respects the employee is apparently all right.\u201d It was also found that \u201cthe employee has been left with a badly impaired right hand and wrist\u201d; that \u201cthis impairment does not constitute a total disability\u201d; and that \u201cthere are many types of work that the employee can do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">There was no error. The decision of the board is to stand unless it is unsupported by the evidence, including all rational inferences permitted by the testimony. <em>Sawyer\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 75, 76. <em>Amon\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 210, 214. <em>Flaherty\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 719, 722. An examination of the evidence shows ample support for the decision of the board. Dr. Mulhern, a physician and surgeon, called as a witness by the employee, testified in detail as to the physical condition of the employee. To the question, \u201cHave you an opinion as to whether he has unimpaired use of the right hand now?\u201d he answered, \u201cI have. The hand is not totally disabled by any means, but it is certainly disabled for any gainful occupation that requires nimble and dexterous use of the hand.\u201d When asked, \u201cHave you an opinion as to whether or not he is totally and permanently disabled for any gainful occupation?\u201d he testified, \u201cI have an opinion. He is not totally and permanently disabled for any gainful occupation.\u201d It is unnecessary to make recital of the other evidence, which, it suffices to say, does not sustain the employee\u2019s contention that a finding different from that of the board was required as matter of law. <em>Roney\u2019s Case, </em>316 Mass. 732, 734. The present case is governed by <em>Hummer\u2019s Case, </em>317 Mass. 617, 623-624. Nothing to the contrary is contained in <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 635, where the board, upon supporting evidence, found that there was a permanent and total incapacity. <em>*</em></p>\n<p id=\"A3C\">t-. , <em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
