The single member found that the employee was totally disabled until January 9, 1946, and for that period ordered payment of compensation at the rate of $10.43 a week in the total amount of $739.04. The single member also found that the employee suffered no loss of vision in \u2022 the right eye by reason of the injury, and made findings on which he ruled that the employee was not entitled to specific compensation for the loss of the left eye. The reviewing board, with one member dissenting as to that ruling only, adopted the decision of the single member. In the Superior Court a decree was entered ordering payment of compensation in the amount of $739.04 and stating that the employee was not entitled to specific compensation for injury to the left eye. The employee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The employee contends that he is entitled to compensation on the ground that his incapacity is permanent and total (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 152, \u00a7 34A, inserted by St. 1935, c. 364, amended by St. 1943, c. 276, and later revised by St. 1945, c. 717), and that he is entitled to specific compensation for the loss of the left eye and for loss of vision, in the right eye. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152,- \u00a7 36 (f), as appearing in St. 1935, c. 333. See now St. 1946, c. 386, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">These contentions, other than the claim to specific compensation for the loss of the left eye, offer no difficulty. The decision of the board must stand unless unsupported by the evidence, including all rational inferences permitted by the testimony. <em>Amello\u2019s Case, ante, </em>347, 348. The board found by adoption of the findings of the single member that prior to the injury- the sight in the right eye varied from time to time due to a condition for which the employee was undergoing hospital treatment; that the vision of the right eye was not affected by the injury; that the employee, who had been \u201con welfare\u201d and had worked irregularly before the injury, had since been adjudged a blind man by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>division of the blind of the department of education and as such was receiving a monthly benefit of $62 (see G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 69, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 526, as amended by St. 1945, c. 541, \u00a7 1; \u00a7 23B, as added by St. 1945, c. 541, \u00a7 2); that he no longer had the same incentive to do irregular work;' and that on January 9, 1946, he had the same limited ability to work as he had before the injury. Dr. Hawkins, who made an impartial examination at the request of the single member, in his report, dated January 9, 1946, stated that before the injury vision in each eye was \u201cnot very good\u201d and that the employee had been receiving treatment at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary; that in his opinion vision in the right eye at the time of the report was not less than it had been immediately prior to the injury; that \u201cthe loss of vision in the right eye is not related to the injury\u201d; and that the removal of the left eye \u201cdid not have any effect on the loss of vision in the right eye.\u201d This report was ample support for the findings of the board, as was the testimony of the only medical witness, Dr. Heffernan, who was called by the insurer. We do not accept the contentions of the employee that the conclusions of the report were vitiated by other statements in it or that the opinion of Dr. Heffernan should be disregarded as matter of law because of his other testimony. No useful purpose would be served by amplification of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">As to the contention that the employee is entitled to specific compensation for loss of the left eye, there has been no previous decision in this Commonwealth. Prior to St. 1946, c. 386, which increased the period for payment of compensation in cases thereafter arising, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 36, as appearing in St. 1935, c. 333, provided, \u201cIn case of the following specified injuries the sum of ten dollars a week shall be paid, in addition to all other compensation, for the following periods: ...(f) For the reduction to twenty seventieths of normal vision in either eye, with glasses, a period of fifty weeks.\u201d The board adopted the following from the decision of the single member: \u201cthe employee, prior to the injury having less than 20/70 vision in his left eye, is not entitled to specific com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>pensation.for the loss of the remaining vision.\u201d The board also made the further finding \u201con the hospital record and the opinion of the eye specialist, Dr. Heffernan, . . . that fifteen days prior to his injury the vision in the employee\u2019s injured left eye was limited to \u2018hand movements,\u2019 and that there was no vision in such eye for practical purposes.\u201d This finding was supported by the testimony of Dr. Heffernan, which was to the effect that the hospital record sets forth that on August 15, 1944, vision in the left eye was confined to \u201chand movements\u201d; that this meant that the vision was reduced so that, if one held up his hand between the employee and the light, all he could see was movement; and that there was \u201cno vision there for a practical purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The original workmen\u2019s compensation act, St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 11 (b), provided for specific compensation for the \u201centire and irrecoverable loss of the sight of either eye.\u201d Statute 1912, c. 571, entitled \u201cAn Act to perfect in detail\u201d the workmen\u2019s compensation act, by \u00a7 2 struck out the words quoted from \u00a7 11 (b) and substituted, \u201creduction to one tenth of normal vision in either eye with glasses.\u201d The section was reenacted with the words so substituted by amendment. St. 1913, c. 445, \u00a7 1; c. 696, \u00a7 1. St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 6. It thus appears in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36. By St. 1928, c. 356, the statute was amended to read substantially in its present form except for the amount and period of compensation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">It is argued that under the original act the employee would have been entitled to specific compensation for the loss of the left eye;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the present act is a liberalization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>of previous statutes; and that it follows that he must be so entitled under the present act. Whatever might have been the employee\u2019s rights under the original act, we think that the injury does not fall within the terms of the applicable statute. This clearly specifies that there be a \u201creduction to twenty seventieths of normal vision.\u201d As this amount was all the vision the employee had prior to the injury, he has not suffered the required reduction. In the light of the unambiguous language of the amended statute the contention that it is a liberalization we think is not true in the respect here contended for. The first amendatory act was passed the year following the original act, and, as its title suggests, contained perfecting amendments. By it and by the later amendments, we think, the Legislature has evinced an intent that specific compensation is not payable for an injury to an eye having only twenty seventieths of normal vision. It is for us to construe the act, not to substitute other views for the declared legislative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"An9\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-7\"> Subsequent amendments increasing the compensation are St. 1935, c. 333, and St. 1946, c. 386, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-8\"> There are a number of cases substantially to that effect. <em>Leach </em>v. <em>Grangeville Highway District, </em>55 Idaho, 307. <em>Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Commission, </em>316 Ill. 622. <em>Haas </em>v. <em>Globe Indemnity Co. </em>16 La.
