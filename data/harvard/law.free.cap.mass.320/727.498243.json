The District Court judge found for the defendant, but the Appellate Division vacated that finding and ordered the entry of a finding for the plaintiff. The \u201cfinding, decision and order\u201d of the Appellate Division was filed with the clerk of the District Court on June 27, 1946. On July 5 the defendant appealed. On July 13 the defendant filed an, \u201corder for preparation of estimate of cost of appeal,\u201d the body of which read, \u201cNow comes the defendant in the above entitled action and orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>an estimate of the cost of preparation of appeal to the Supreme Court.\u201d The Appellate Division allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal for failure to comply with G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 135, as amended by St. 1941, c. 187, \u00a7 1, and affirmed the decision from which the appeal was taken. The defendant appealed. The ruling of the Appellate Division was right. The statute requires that the appealing party shall give to the clerk, \u201cwithin ten days after the case becomes ripe for final preparation and printing of the record for the full court, an order in writing for the preparation of . . . papers ... for transmission to the full court of the supreme judicial court.\u201d This was not done by the defendant, who merely ordered the \u201cpreparation of [an] estimate.\u201d The case is indistinguishable from <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Auger, </em>300 Mass. 367. The defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory requirements was not cured by his payment of the amount of the estimate on August 10, one month and five days after the case became \u201cripe for final preparation and printing of the record.\u201d In <em>Bass River Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>302 Mass. 235, such payment was made within ten days after the case thus became ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\">\n<em>Order of Appellate Division affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
