(hereinafter called the company), received funds of the company, and \u201cwrongfully and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>wilfully converted same to his own use and refused to account for same\u201d; that \u201cdue to a suretyship agreement and because of the defendant\u2019s wilful conversion of the said funds the plaintiff was caused to pay to\u201d the company $1,000; and that \u201cthe defendant owes the plaintiff\u201d this sum with interest. The answer, in addition to a general denial, alleges that the defendant has been discharged in bankruptcy and that the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cclaim\u201d had been released. The trial judge denied certain requests for rulings presented by the defendant, and found for the plaintiff. The Appellate Division dismissed the report, and<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">The trial judge found that the plaintiff at the defendant\u2019s \u25a0request executed a bond in which the defendant was principal, the plaintiff surety, and the company obligee; \u201cthat the defendant received as collector certain funds of the obligee which he converted to his own use\u201d; that as a result the plaintiff was obliged to pay the obligee $1,000, one payment of $690.20 being made on November 16, 1942, and another of $309.80 on July 8, 1943; and that the defendant was adjudicated a bankrupt on February 9, 1943, and was discharged in bankruptcy on March 7, 1944. The trial judge stated, \u201cI find that the claim of the plaintiff was in the excepted class under the United States bankruptcy act, as amended, Tor liabilities for . . . wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The question for decision is whether the action is barred by \u00a7,17a (2) of the bankruptcy act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The governing principles are stated in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Aetna Acceptance Co. </em>293 U. S. 328, 332, as follows: \u201cThere is no doubt that an act of conversion, if wilful and malicious, is an injury to property within the scope of this exception. Such a case was <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Kavanaugh, </em>242 U. S. 138, where the wrong was unexcused and wanton. But a wilful and malicious injury does not follow as of course from every act of conversion, without reference to the circumstances. There may be a conversion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>which is innocent or technical, an unauthorized assumption of dominion without wilfulness or malice. . .. [citing cases] There may be an honest, but mistaken belief, engendered by a course of dealing, that powers have been enlarged or in-capacities removed. In these and like cases, what is done is a tort, but not a wilful and malicious one.\u201d To the same effect see <em>Probst </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>262 Mich. 678, 680; <em>Money Corp. </em>v. <em>Draggoo, </em>274 Mich. 527; <em>Continental Live Stock Co. </em>v. King, 283 Mich. 495; <em>Damato </em>v. <em>Ambrose, </em>122 N. J. L. 539, 544; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>215 N. Y. 233; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Garey, </em>267 N. Y. 167, certiorari denied 296 U. S. 615. 1 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th ed.) \u00a7 17.17. Remington on Bankruptcy (5th ed.) \u00a7 3552. 98 Am. L. R. 1454. See <em>McChristal </em>v. <em>Clisbee, </em>190 Mass. 120; <em>Clair </em>v. <em>Colmes, </em>245 Mass. 281.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa_J\">\u2022 The report purports to contain all the evidence material to the questions reported. ' That evidence so far as it relates to the subject of conversion is extremely meager. It appeared that the defendant had been engaged in business \u201cas the Worcester Freight Transfer\u201d; that he was -\u2018in the employ of the\u201d company; that in the course of business he collected freight charges for the account of the company, and from time to time remitted some of the moneys collected; that he made and delivered to the company checks payable to the company \u201crepresenting moneys collected and owed by the defendant\u201d to the company; that among such checks were three dated May 2, 4, and 13, 1942, in the respective sums of $54.76, $292.71, and $342.73, which were dishonored for insufficient funds when presented for payment; and that the defendant was \u201cindebted\u201d to the company for freight charges collected by him for its account. On this evidence it would seem that a finding that there had been a conversion could not rightly be made. The fact that the moneys were \u201cowed\u201d by the defendant, who was \u201cindebted\u201d to the company, would seem to show that the relation of debtor and creditor existed, and that the defendant had authority to mingle the sums collected with his own funds. This could have been by express agreement or by implication from the course of dealings between the company and the defendant. In these circumstances the mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>refusal or failure to pay the money to the company would not constitute a conversion. <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Bassett, </em>112 Mass. 99, 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-3\">But assuming that there was a conversion, there is nothing upon which to base a further necessary finding that the conversion was wilful and malicious. The discharge in bankruptcy being admitted, the burden was then cast upon the creditor to show by evidence that the conversion was wilful and malicious and was excepted from the operation of the discharge. <em>Kreitlein </em>v. <em>Ferger, </em>238 U. S. 21, 26. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>232 Mass. 188, 194-195, affirmed sub nomine <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>260 U. S. 592, 594-595. <em>Probst </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>262 Mich. 678, 680. <em>Money Corp. </em>v. <em>Draggoo, </em>274 Mich, 527. <em>Continental Live Stock Co. </em>v. <em>King, </em>283 Mich. 495. <em>Guindon </em>v. <em>Brusky, </em>142 Minn. 86, 89. <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>126 N. J. L. 177, 179. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Fisk, </em>215 N. Y. 233. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Garey, </em>267 N.

We are of opinion that the evidence did \"not warrant a finding that the cause of action was not released by the discharge in bankruptcy. There was error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s requests numbered 1, 4, and 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We have not found it necessary to consider questions arising out of the fact that this is an action of contract by an indemnity company rather than an action of tort by Spector Motor Service, Inc.
