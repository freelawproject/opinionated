The jury returned verdicts for the plaintiff. The defendants\u2019 exceptions, in so far as argued, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>concern rulings on evidence and the denial of their motions for directed verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"AZfV\">The jury could have found the following facts: On November 13, 1939, the plaintiff was sitting in the middle of the back seat of the bus on the way from East Taunton to Taunton. The seat ran across the rear of the bus, and there was an aisle down the middle with seats on' both sides. The bus with about six passengers crossed the Taunton River by \u201cNeck-O-Land\u201d Bridge and continued on Summer Street, rounding a curve which obstructed the view. The rate of speed was thirty-five to forty miles per hour at a point one eighth to one quarter of a mile before reaching the bridge, and that rate was not reduced until the occurrence hereinafter described. Beyond the curve the road straightened out. This was in \u201ca thickly settled district,\u201d with five or six houses and two gasoline stations. Beyond the curve the bus passed Ingell Street on the left. At that time there were some boys in both gutters and on the right sidewalk about one hundred to three hundred feet ahead. They were kicking a football from one side of the street to the other. \u201cAs the bus approached the vicinity of the children,\u201d a boy went in front of the bus after a football. The bus (which was twenty-six or twenty-seven feet long) was from one to one and one half bus lengths from the boy when the individual defendant without signal or warning put on the brakes. The \u201cbrakes were applied hard with a sudden jerk.\u201d The \u201cdriver really snapped them on.\u201d It was \u201ckind of a bad stop.\u201d The bus had \u201cdual wheels at the rear,\u201d and was equipped with four wheel hydraulic brakes. It stopped quickly about three feet from the boy. The plaintiff unsuccessfully tried to hold himself in the seat but did not have strength enough because the operator \u201cstopped so fast.\u201d When \u201cthe bus stopped it lifted\u201d the plaintiff up and he started to run. He tried to take hold of the seat in front, but it was slippery, and he \u201ckept on going.\u201d At the front of the bus he turned around, fell on his back, and struck his head against the pipe which held the fare box and then against some metal on the floor. As testified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the individual defendant, the bus stopped, and the plaintiff \u201cwas right down there almost one, two, three, like that.\u201d Two other passengers were thrown from their seats to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\">On direct examination the plaintiff was asked, \u201cOn the way down, or at least close to Neck-O-Land Bridge, did you see Mr. Zeiba [the individual defendant] or Mr. Gold-stein [a passenger], doing anything?\u201d and he answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, he was then asked, \u201cWhat did you see them do?\u201d and he answered, \u201cOne started to talk with the other and they kept going just the same.\u201d A Mrs. Dutra, a witness called by the plaintiff, subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, was asked, \u201cas the bus was approaching this curve, Neck-O-Land Bridge, did you see Mr. Zeiba do anything in reference to Mr. Goldstein?\u201d and she answered, \u201cThey were talking but the driver didn\u2019t take his eyes off the street.\u201d No objection was made on the ground that part of the answer was not responsive. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Alessi, </em>269 Mass. 433, 437. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, </em>319 Mass. 603, 610. There was no error. The evidence in each instance was admissible to show the conduct of the driver at a material time. The plaintiff testified that one of the gasoline stations, which was \u201caround the curve,\u201d was about one hundred feet from the bridge. The individual defendant testified that the accident happened about two hundred fifty feet \u201cfrom the curve.\u201d The questions were not directed to a subject matter too remote from the proper issues. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>250 Mass. 512, 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">The motions for directed verdicts were rightly denied. The jury could find that there had been an undiminished rate of speed of thirty-five to forty miles an hour for more than one eighth of a mile before reaching the bridge, which was about one hundred feet long, and that that rate was maintained in a \u201cthickly settled district\u201d around a curve with obstructed vision, by Ingell Street, an intersecting way, and up to a point which was too near to where the boys were playing football in the street. That rate of speed, which was prima facie greater than was reasonable and proper under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 90, \u00a7 17, could be found to constitute causal negligence. <em>DeFrancisco </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>306 Mass. 527, 529-530. <em>Desroches </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>285 Mass. 495. See <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>301 Mass. 372, 376; <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Nickerson, </em>304 Mass. 63, 66. The jury also could have concluded that the operator should not have approached the boys without slowing down or taking other precautions to obviate a wholly foreseeable sudden and violent stop with the attendant danger to passengers. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>217 Mass. 179, 181. <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Fowle, </em>255 Mass. 531, 532. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>312 Mass. 584, 587-588. \u201cProper conduct in an emergency is no defence to one whose negligence created the emergency. <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Middlesex &amp; Boston Street Railway, </em>276 Mass. 29, 33. <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>284 Mass. 205, 207.\u201d <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Strout, </em>303 Mass. 28, 33. This is not a case like <em>Bratton </em>v. <em>Rudnick, </em>283 Mass. 556, or <em>Bellows </em>v. <em>Worcester Storage Co. </em>297 Mass. 188, 196, where the causal connec-. tian between the original wrong and the ultimate harm had been broken by another occurrence which constituted \u201can intervening efficient, independent and dominant cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">A ruling on evidence relating to the issue of damages remains for consideration. The daughter-in-law of the plaintiff, called as his witness, testified that he was well before the accident. Later, subject to the defendants\u2019 exception, she was asked a question (not exactly quoted in the record) to the effect \u201cIf she had noticed any change in the apparent memory of her father-in-law from the time before the accident and since the accident.\u201d She answered \u201cthat after the accident he has been very forgetful.\u201d The ruling was right. It has been repeatedly held that a witness of ordinary intelligence who is familiar with a person may testify whether in a given time he has failed mentally or physically. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Hingham Steamboat Co. </em>109 Mass. 449, 451. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Comins, </em>110 Mass. 477, 480, 487. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brayman, </em>136 Mass. 438, 440. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>168 Mass. 523. <em>Gorham </em>v. <em>Moor, </em>197 Mass. 522, 523-524. <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>225 Mass. 521, 524. <em>Neill </em>v. <em>Brackett, </em>241 Mass. 534, 540. The defendants, while conceding this, contend that the question did not call <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>for any fact, act, or speech indicating a change. Such a construction would be a triumph of form over substance. Rightly interpreted, the question called for facts and not for the opinion of the witness. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Springfield Street Railway, </em>211 Mass. 483, 485-486.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
