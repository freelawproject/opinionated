The declaration is in three counts. Counts 1 and 2 are respectively in contract and tort, and allege an undertaking by the defendant to care for the plaintiff Mary Woronka (hereinafter called the plaintiff) \u201cbefore, during, and for some time after the birth of her child\u201d and negligent treatment causing burns on the buttocks which resulted in keloids. Count 3 is by the plaintiff\u2019s husband for consequential damages. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 6A, as inserted by St. 1939, c. 372, \u00a7 1. The judge directed verdicts for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The jury could have found the facts hereinafter set forth. On May 7, 1940, the plaintiff, then pregnant, and her husband consulted the defendant, an obstetrician, who undertook to treat the plaintiff before, during, and for as long after childbirth as she should need care, \u201cno matter what resulted.\u201d He saw her sixteen times in the pre-natal period. About 11 p.m. on December 20 the plaintiff, who was in mild labor and three weeks overdue, entered a lying-in hospital in Boston, where the defendant had arranged for her room. The baby, which was her first and a large one, was born about 2:10 a.m. on December 22. The plaintiff had \u00e1 difficult labor of thirty-five hours, and delivery was by the use of forceps after the defendant had performed an operation known as an episiotomy. She was in the delivery room on a hospital bed \u201cfor a good many hours,\u201d and was moved onto the delivery table when ready for delivery and then given ether anesthesia. About twelve minutes after anesthesia had started, in order to sterilize the field of operation, the defendant applied Scott\u2019s solution to the legs, to the perineum, and to an area extending half way from the pubic bone to the umbilicus; The ingredients of Scott\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>solution are mercurochrome, distilled water, ninety-five per cent alcohol, and a chemical known as acetone (a solvent, which has a tendency to dry up). During the delivery, which consumed \u201cperhaps an hour and ten minutes,\u201d the plaintiff, draped with sterile sheets and towels, lay on her back with her legs held by nurses, her buttocks resting on the \u201cbed\u201d where the defendant was operating. \u201cShe was lying on a rubber sheet at the time of delivery; the .rubber sheet was put just under her buttocks. She was lying on a hospital sheet, the rest of her body on a sterile towel between the rubber sheet and her buttocks.\u201d During the course of delivery he had another doctor as an assistant. The defendant \u201cwas theoretically in charge of the delivery room at the time of the delivery.\u201d The nurses were under his directions and orders. Compare <em>Guell </em>v. <em>Tenney, </em>262 Mass. 54, 55-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In the afternoon of December 22 the plaintiff, who was in her room which was downstairs from the delivery room, told the defendant that her back was sore and burned, and the defendant, said that it was natural and it would leave in a few days. There was a similar conversation the following day. On December 24 she told the defendant her back was worse and burning. The defendant made an examination, which disclosed on each buttock a second degree burn covering in each case an area of approximately two by three inches. He then said, \u201cMy God, what a mess; my God, what happened here .... It is a darn shame to have this happen.\u201d He also said that \u201cshe had a very hard delivery, and it was a burning shame to get that on top of it, and.it was because of negligence when they were upstairs.\u201d On Christmas day the defendant talked with the plaintiff\u2019s husband in her room and at that time said that it was unfortunate; that a thing like that should not have happened and the staff was going to take steps to correct it; that apparently it was from the solution being allowed to stay in the part of the \u201cmat\u201d which was recessed from the pressure; and that \u201cthe closest he could figure was that the- solution was on the rubber mat and exposed her skin for too long a period.\u201d On January 2 or 3, 1941, the plaintiff told the defendant that the burns were all unnecessary. He replied \u201cthat it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>was because of negligence while they were upstairs\u201d; that he could not understand how it happened; and that he washed and cleaned her off himself. From the burns there developed keloids, \u201ca tumor-like condition which generally originates in a scar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The defendant testified: \u201cShe got these burns while in the delivery room. ... He thought she got the bums at the time of the delivery.\u201d In answer to interrogatories the defendant stated that \u201cthe plaintiff did receive burns on both her buttocks while she was under his care and treatment\u201d; and that there were \u201cno negligent acts or omissions on the part of the plaintiff or by others than the defendant which caused the injuries suffered by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">There was error in the direction of the verdicts. The plaintiff was not required to show the exact cause of her injuries or to exclude all possibility that they resulted without fault on the part of the defendant. It was enough if she showed that the harm which befell her was more likely due to negligence of the defendant than to some other cause for which he was not liable. <em>Rocha </em>v. <em>Alber, </em>302 Mass. 155, 157-158. <em>Ruffin </em>v. <em>Coca Cola Bottling Co. </em>311 Mass. 514, 516. <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Boston Consolidated Gas Co. </em>314 Mass. 493, 496. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Kilbourn, </em>317 Mass. 358, 363. See <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Weene, </em>258 Mass. 178, 180. This is not a case where an inference of lack of proper care by the defendant rests upon the mere fact that the plaintiff suffered bums. See <em>King </em>v. <em>Belmore, </em>248 Mass. 108, 114; <em>Semerjian </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>284 Mass. 510, 514. Nor is it a case lacking in proof of causal connection between the lack of such care and the ensuing injuries, as in <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Clement, </em>287 Mass. 175. The jury could have found, in accordance with the defendant\u2019s admissions, that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were due to negligence; that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff or of anyone other than the defendant; that, by the process of elimination, this negligence was that of the defendant; and that, in particular, this negligence of the defendant related to the exposure of the plaintiff in the delivery room, while under his direction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>care, to a solution on the delivery table which he himself had administered. <em>Barnett </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>243 Mass. 233. <em>Tully </em>v. <em>Mandell, </em>269 Mass. 307. <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Harley Private Hospital, Inc. </em>279 Mass. 96. <em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Litvich, </em>297 Mass. 91. See <em>Leary </em>v. <em>Keith, </em>256 Mass. 157. It is no answer to say that the statements that the negligence occurred \u201cupstairs\u201d did not show that it took place in the delivery room. Some of the admissions were specifically related to the delivery room and to the time of delivery. The jury could find that when or while \u201cthey were upstairs\u201d meant when or while the plaintiff and the defendant were upstairs. ' Furthermore, we think that it sufficiently appears that the references to \u201cupstairs\u201d could be found to concern what occurred in the delivery room. The plaintiff testified that she was \u201ctaken up to the delivery room in the elevator.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s husband testified that the delivery room was upstairs, and that after the delivery \u201cshe was taken downstairs below where the delivery took place.\u201d It does not appear that the defendant saw the plaintiff upstairs anywhere but in the delivery room. It is likewise no answer to say that the admissions were merely statements of regret, sympathy, and benevolence evoked by human suffering. This is, of course, true of the statements that it was a \u201cshame\u201d and \u201cunfortunate.\u201d <em>Conti </em>v. <em>Brockton Ice &amp; Coal Co. </em>295 Mass. 15, 17. <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Ferrera Bros. Inc. </em>306 Mass. 90, 93. <em>Rasimas </em>v. <em>Swan, ante, </em>60, 62. But it is in no way true of the references to \u201cnegligence\u201d and to the definite declaration that the burns were attributable to the solution being on the \u201cmat\u201d and to the plaintiff\u2019s skin being exposed to the solution \u201cfor too long a period.\u201d The defendant contends that \u201cthe mere use of the word \u2018negligence\u2019 does not supply the essential elements to justify a necessary finding of liability on his part.\u201d Without intimating in the least that this contention is sound (see <em>McGenness </em>v. <em>Adriatic Mills, </em>116 Mass. 177, 178, 180-181; <em>Linnehan </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>126 Mass. 506, 510; <em>Zandan </em>v. <em>Radner, </em>242 Mass. 503, 504, 505; <em>Salminen </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>185 Fed. 997, affirmed sub nomine <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Salminen, </em>191 Fed. 504 [C. C. <em>A. </em>1J), it is enough to say that in the case at bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>much more is contained in the admissions than the mere use of that word. We appreciate that there was testimony from the defendant or from.an expert called by him to the effect that the burns were due to friction and pressure or to a combination of shock and pressure, to the fact of labor debilitating; the burned area perhaps more than some other areas on the body, and to the possible but rather unlikely augmenting of the foregoing by the touching of the burned area with Scott\u2019s solution; that in December, 1940, the use of Scott\u2019s solution was the accepted obstetrical practice in Boston; and that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were unavoidable. Such testimony, with the weight and credibility of which we are not concerned, went no farther than to present an issue for the tribunal of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
