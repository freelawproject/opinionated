Writ dated May 26, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-9\">In the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Richardson, </em>J., without a jury. The plaintiffs put in an auditor\u2019s report and rested. The defendant introduced no evidence. The judge found for the plaintiffs in the sum of $188.69, being the sum of $174.77, the amount found by the auditor, and interest thereon from January 12, 1899, to the date of the hearing, and reported the case for determination by this court. If the finding of the judge was not authorized, judgment was to be entered for the defendant or judgment was to be entered for the plaintiffs for such sum as law and justice might require ; otherwise, judgment was to be entered in accordance with the finding.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b27-10\"><em>H.

It is contended by the defendant that since these repairs so far as respects their nature were such as a mortgagee in possession may properly make and for the expense of which he may be allowed, the general rule applies; and that it is immaterial whether the mortgagee intended to foreclose by holding possession for three years or by the more summary process of a sale under the power, \u00f3r whether the repairs were needed to preserve the property so that it would be in the same condition at the sale as at the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">A mortgagee who has entered for foreclosure is not yet the owner of the land. He holds it as trustee for the owner. As a rule he has no authority to make the estate better at the expense of the owner. The mortgagor as the owner is the only person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>who has the right to exercise his judgment as to whether the estate shall be made more valuable by an outlay of money. Tet the mortgagee while in possession is bound to use reasonable means to preserve the estate from loss or injury, and those means he may use even although, as in a case where at the entry the property is in a dilapidated condition, the result is that the condition of the estate is made better than at the time of entry. <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>14 Gray, 132. We should be slow to say that where a mortgagee in good faith for the purpose of preserving the estate from loss or injury while in his possession had made repairs like those in this case, he should not be allowed therefor although the result was that its condition was better at the time of foreclosure than at the time of entry, and although he subsequently foreclosed by a sale rather than by possession for three years.'</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">But the mortgagee is to be held to good faith. If, not intending to keep possession, but entering upon the estate simply and solely for the purpose of more \"effectually foreclosing by an immediate sale to himself or to some third person under the power contained in the mortgage, he makes repairs which are not needed to preserve the estate from loss or injury while he is in possession and are not made for that purpose but solely that a higher price may be obtained at the sale, then it may be fairly said that he has gone beyond his duty and his right as mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">We cannot say that the finding of the court was not warranted by the evidence. According to the terms of the report there must be</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs for $174-77, with interest from January 18,1899.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
