Writ dated December 31, 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-13\">At the trial in the Superior Court before <em>Hopkins, </em>J., the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on December 5,1901. The defendant saved exceptions to rulings and refusals to rule by the judge. On Saturday, December 21, the defendant\u2019s counsel examined the files in the clerk\u2019s office to get the requests for rulings and instructions to the jury which bad been filed, but failed to find them, and on Monday, December 23, another search was made, and the defendant\u2019s counsel was informed by the clerk that <em>Hopkins, </em>J., on Friday, December 20, took the papers in the case with him to Millbury, and that probably the requests were with the papers taken by him. The defendant\u2019s counsel thereupon requested the counsel for the plaintiffs to- agree to an extension of time until the papers could be obtained from <em>Hog-kins, </em>J. This was refused, and thereupon notice was given by the defendant to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel of a motion to be offered the next day, December 24,1901, before <em>Fessenden, </em>J., asking for an extension of time. The motion was opposed, and was denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-14\">Later the missing papers were returned to the files, and the defendant prepared a substitute bill of exceptions by way of amendment, on which the judge declined to take action. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>defendant then presented his original bill of exceptions to <em>Fessenden, </em>J., who on October 15,1902, disallowed it, stating his grounds as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-5\">\u201cMr. Justice Hopkins, before whom the foregoing action was tried, failed by reason of death to sign or return the foregoing exceptions. The exceptions were brought before me October, 14th inst., for action. The plaintiffs, without admitting that the exceptions alleged were conformable to the truth, objected to an allowance thereof, alleging that notice of the filing of the same had not been given to them seasonably.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-6\">\u201c After hearing the parties upon the question whether notice was given seasonably or whether notice was waived, I find and rule that no notice of the filing of the exceptions was given the plaintiffs before December 26, 1901, when a notice of such filing was sent by mail to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel which reached them in due course of mail December 27, 1901, and I further find and rule that the plaintiffs did not waive due notice of the filing of the exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-7\">\u201c I disallow the exceptions for the reason that due notice of the filing of the same was not given seasonably to the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-8\"><em>S.

We are of opinion that the evidence before him, as reported in the record before us, justified the finding, and that the exceptions were for that reason properly disallowed. Pub.
