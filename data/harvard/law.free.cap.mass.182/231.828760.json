The answer sets up an oral agreement made by the parties before the execution of the lease, that if, during the term, the lessee should take a lease of another store of the lessor, and should vacate the store first leased, the lessor would thereupon surrender , all right under the original lease, and the lessee would be under no further liability thereon; that the lessee, relying upon the oral agreement and induced thereby, took a lease of another store of the plaintiff, and vacated the 'store first leased, before the beginning of the period of five months.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">To this answer the plaintiff demurred on the ground that the oral agreement contradicted and altered the terms of the written lease, and would be inadmissible in evidence; and that it was no legal defence to the action upon the lease. The Superior Court sustained the demurrer, and ordered judgment for the plaintiff; and the case is before us on the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AfY\">We are of opinion that the oral agreement set up in the answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>contradicted and altered one of the express terms of the written contract, namely; that relating to the payment of rent; and that therefore the answer set up no defence. <em>Merrigan </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>175 Mass. 508, and cases cited. The case is not one of a collateral oral agreement as to a matter not mentioned in the written agreement, and not contradictory of itand therefore does not fall within <em>Durkin </em>t. Cobleigh, 156 Mass. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
