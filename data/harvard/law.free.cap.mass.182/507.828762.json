To Mr. Leatherbee &amp; Co. Dear Sir, \u2014 I am ready to ship you bricks for that half million brick if you promise to buy as much Light hard as hards. Yours truly, H. Bernier.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-7\">Exhibit B. \u201c Boston, Nov. 14, 1899. H. Bernier, Esq., E. Bridgewater, Mass. Dear Sir, \u2014 We accept your offer for 250 M. Hard Up and D. Brick &amp; 300 M. Lt. Hard Brick at $4.90 &amp; $4.15 respectively f. o. b. cars Bridgewater.

Dear Sir, \u2014 I am lading up the cars you have order and will send you the number as soon as they are shipe for prices on bricks. I can not do no better for bodys at $6.50 also for Up and Down $6.00 Lt. Hard $4.50 this price is for winter for what we got on hand when we will begin to make them I will do a little better if there are not any higher. But for the bricks we are lading now I will let them at the same price. For the larger order of 500th it will now be impossible for me to shipe because I have sold 80th to one of our customers <em>&amp; </em>also to another parter for the 75th. I cannot shipe them either because I have n\u2019t hardly enough on hand for my costumers in Brockton. Yours truly, H. Bernier.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-9\">It was admitted that H. Bernier was the duly authorized agent of the defendant, and that \u201c half million \u201d in Exhibit A, and \u201c500th\u201d in Exhibit C, had reference to the five hundred and fifty thousand bricks mentioned in Exhibit B. It also appeared that the price was the same as on previous orders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-10\">The judge ruled that upon the evidence there was no sufficient memorandum in writing of the alleged contract signed by the party to be charged or by a person authorized by her. He found for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-11\"><em>J3. S.

They are therefore not a sufficient memorandum to take the case out of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">Exhibit B, while purporting to accept an offer, is not responsive to Exhibit A, and apparently refers to some other offer than the conditional one contained in Exhibit A. Exhibit C refers neither to Exhibit B nor Exhibit \u00c1, and apparently refers to another oral communication. <em>Oakman </em>v.
