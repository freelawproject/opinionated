J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiP\">The will of James S. Savage, late of Southboro, deceased, contains a provision as follows: \u201c At the decease of myself and wife and after all the bequests and stipulations heretofore provided for and the requirements shall have been duly and faithfully carried out and performed I direct that the income of said property after paying the necessary and equitable charges to the trustees be divided equally between my son James and my daughter Lucinda now the wife of S. H. Howe for their sole and individual benefit and use and at their decease should they leave issue to descend in fee to such issue or in case one only of my children leaves issue then the whole in fee to such issue but should neither child leave issue then to the heirs at law in my line at which time said trust will cease.\u201d For many years the income of this property was paid by the trustees in equal shares to the son and daughter of the testator, until the death of the daughter Lucinda on April 7,1902, leaving children and grandchildren. The question before the court is, What shall be done with the share of the property whose income has heretofore been paid to Lucinda S. Howe?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">The first question is whether the words \u201c at their decease \u201d mean at the decease of the survivor of them, or whether the property is intended to go in equal shares to the testator\u2019s two children and their respective issue, and whether the words mean at their respective deaths. In some of its features, the case of <em>Boring </em>v. <em>Coolidge, </em>99 Mass. 191, is similar to this, but it differs from it in material facts. In that case the property, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>expiration of the life estates, was to go to nephews and nieces, and there was no purpose to divide the estate into two parts after the death of the life tenants. It was held that the words \u201c at their death \u201d meant the point of time when both shall have deceased; but Mr. Justice Wells in giving the opinion said, \u201c These words may be, and sometimes are, construed distributively, when the nature or order of the sequent dispositions is such as to require it; as when the subsequent interests are given, <em>per stirpes, </em>to the children or other representatives respectively of those (not husband and wife) who are to enjoy the income during their lives. <em>Willes </em>v. <em>Douglas, </em>10 Beav. 47. <em>Abrey </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>16 Beav. 431. <em>Arrow </em>v. <em>Mellish, </em>1 DeG. &amp; Sm. 355. But in such cases the interpretation of the ambiguous term is governed by the apparent intent that the subsequent interests shall pass separately to each class, as succeeding to the share of the parent or other <em>cestui que trust </em>for life whom they respectively represent. Slight indications of intent are sufficient for this purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">This statement shows exactly the difference between the two cases. In the case at bar the intent of the testator to divide the property into two equal shares, which, after the expiration of the life estates, shall pass separately to the two classes, is plain. So when the life estate as to one half terminates, there is a plain indication that the share shall pass at once to the representatives of the life tenant. The words \u201c descend in fee to such issue \u201d add emphasis to this view. <em>Dove </em>v. <em>Torr, </em>128 Mass. 38. The direction that the income be divided equally between the son and the daughter made them tenants in common, each for his own life. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Courtis, </em>167 Mass. 251. \u201c For their sole . . . use,\u201d naturally means <em>\u201c </em>for their respective use.\u201d The words \u201c should they leave issue \u201d mean if they respectively leave issue, for they were not husband and wife and could not jointly leave issue. At the decease of either leaving issue, the rights of such issue are fixed as to the part which is to \u201c descend in fe\u00e9 to such issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\"><em>Loring </em>v. <em>Coolidge, ubi supra, </em>was decided for a reason which does not exist in this case, and which shows why the two cases call for different decisions. In that case the court says, \u201c There is but a single class to take the whole remainder, and they <em>per </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number><em>capita, </em>not as representatives of the brother and sister. The gift to them has no reference to their relations to the brother and sister, but only to their relations to the testatrix.\u201d We are of opinion that on the death of Lucinda S. Hoxve the trust as to one half of the property terminated, and that half descended to the issue that she then left, <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>153 Mass. 374. This result is in accordance with English decisions in similar cases. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Whittaker, </em>23 Beav. 196. <em>Sarel </em>v. <em>Sarel, </em>23 Beav. 87. <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Legg, 31 </em>Beav. 187. <em>Wills </em>v. <em>Wills, L. </em>R. 20 Eq. 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The deceased son, Edward H. Howe, did not take a vested interest which descended to his mother after his death. His interest depended not only on the contingency that his mother should leave issue at her decease, but also on the contingency that he should survive her, for the estate was to descend to \u201c such issue \u201d as she might leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The other half of the property will still be held in trust, and no question pertaining to it is now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">One half of the fund, with its income since the death of Lucinda S. Howe, is to be paid over to her children in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
