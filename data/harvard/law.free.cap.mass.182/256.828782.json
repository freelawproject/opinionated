The residuary legatee contends that the legacies were specific, and that the residue should not be diminished by the executor buying the eleven shares necessary to make up the number of shares given by the testator. The thirty-six shares were made up of legacies to ten different persons. The first legacy was in the following terms : \u201cTo James Talbot of Dighton, five shares of the Laurel Lake Mills of Fall River; \u201d and the other nine legacies were given in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>similar words. The gift of the residue was \u201c all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">It was held in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>128 Mass. 433, and in <em>Harvard Unitarian Society </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>151 Mass. 76, that the legacies there in question were specific, although the testator did not use the word \u201c my \u201d or an equivalent phrase in connection with the personal property given to the legatees. But there is nothing in the several legacies in question to indicate that the gift is a specific one; it is a legacy of so many shares of stock; that <em>per se </em>is a general legacy; <em>Bothamley </em>v. <em>Sherson, </em>L. R. 20 Eq. 304, 308; <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>Cas. temp. Talbot, 226; <em>Purse </em>v. <em>Snaplin, </em>1 Atk. 414; <em>Hinton </em>v. <em>Pinke, </em>1 P. Wms. 539, certainly where the number of shares given does not coincide with the number owned; <em>White </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>6 Pick. 48; <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Framingham Parish, </em>128 Mass. 370, 373; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>128 Mass. 433, 436. The residuary clause in the case at bar is just what the clause was not which was in question in <em>Harvard Unitarian Society </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>151 Mass. 76, relied on by the residuary legatee; in that case the residuary clause was \u201c the balance of my stock as per my stock-book, my furniture, and all other property not otherwise disposed of by me, I would have sold and the proceeds\u201d distributed. Here the residue is \u201c the rest, residue and remainder of my estate \u201d ; that is to say, what is left of my estate after the foregoing provisions of my will have been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">A decree should be entered directing the executors to purchase eleven additional shares of the capital stock of the Laurel Lake Mills, and transfer to the several legatees the shares given them respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
