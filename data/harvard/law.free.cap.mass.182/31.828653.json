J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArX\">This is an action of tort for the conversion of six ranges. The ranges were put upon the premises of one O\u2019Brien under a written agreement by which the plaintiff agreed to \u201c furnish and lease \u201d to O\u2019Brien the ranges, with appurtenances, \u201cblacked and set up,\u201d and O\u2019Brien agreed to pay the price \u201c when the ranges are furnished and set up.\u201d It was further agreed that the title was to remain in the plaintiff until fully paid for, and that the plaintiff should have a right to enter and take possession upon any breach of the contract. The ranges were taken by the defendant, it is said upon an attachment, before they were set up or paid for. The case is here on the defendant\u2019s exceptions, which go to the refusal of the presiding judge to direct a verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The contract is not within St. 1884, e. 313, and its amendments. R. L. c. 198, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13. Those statutes deal with cases where property is delivered before it is paid for. Here, although the parties used a form adapted to such a case, delivery and payment were to be simultaneous and the word \u201c lease \u201d must yield to that paramount consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Leaving the statutes on one side the position was this. The agreement to furnish and lease applied in terms only to the ranges when they should be set up. The payment was to take place at the same moment. Until then the plaintiff was to remain the owner with a necessarily implied right to enter O\u2019Brien\u2019s premises and to handle the ranges in order to complete its work and to set them up. No doubt the ranges had been appropriated to the contract, and, apart from the terms of the contract and the plaintiff\u2019s continued relation to them, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>have been in O\u2019Brien\u2019s possession. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Tidsbury, </em>181 Mass. 292. <em>Odd Fellows Hall Association </em>v. <em>McAllister, </em>153 Mass. 292, 295. But in view of the plaintiff\u2019s title and continued control of the ranges, it appears to us to have retained the possession and right of possession more clearly than did the plaintiffs in <em>Woodbury </em>v. <em>Long, </em>8 Pick. 543. See <em>Parry </em>v. <em>Libbey, </em>166 Mass. 112, 113; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>97 Mass. 46, 48. The cases where there has been a delivery upon a conditional sale, so called, do not apply for the same reasons that the statutes on that subject do not. <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Kingsbury, </em>131 Mass. 445. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>158 Mass. 357, 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
