Allen Whitehead on December 12, 2006. Bar Counsel alleged that Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d) 1. 15, governing the safekeeping of property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MRPC 8.4(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>(b), (c) and (d), governing attorney misconduct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 16-609, prohibiting certain transactions,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>10-306 and 10-307 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, Maryland Code (1989, 2000 Repl.Vol.), limiting the use of trust money and subjecting those who inappropriately use trust money to disciplinary proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">In accordance with Maryland Rules 16-752(a) and 16-757(c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we referred the petition to Judge Diane O. Leasure of the Circuit Court for Howard County for an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judge Leasure held an evidentiary hearing on August 1, 2007; a September 26, 2007 Order of this Court granted an extension for submission of the court\u2019s findings and conclusions. On October 4, 2007, Judge Leasure issued the following Findings of Fact and Proposed Conclusions of Law, in which she found by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent had violated MRPC 1.15 and 8.4(a), (c) and (d), as well as Sections 10-306 and 10-307 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, Maryland Code (1989, 2000 RepLVol.):<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">\u201cThe relevant facts are, for the most part, not in dispute. Based upon the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing, the Court makes the following findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">1. The Respondent was admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on December 1,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">2. The Respondent was admitted to the Bar of the District of Columbia in 1991 and to the Bar of the State of New York in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">3. The Respondent was appointed as the Conservator[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of the Estate of Reginald V. Grayson, Jr., an adult disabled ward, on September 16, 1999 by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Although he had been appointed as a trustee in the past, this was his first appointment as a conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">4. By his own admission, the Respondent thought being appointed as a conservator entailed the same obligations that he had when he served as a trustee. He acknowledged that he had not familiarized himself with the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>District of Columbia rules[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] regarding this type of appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">5. During the time he served as the Conservator of the estate, the Respondent submitted petitions for the payment of legal fees; no orders authorizing the requested payments were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">6. During the period of time that he served as the Conservator for the estate, the Respondent took two actions without obtaining prior court approval: (i) he paid legal fees of $40,200 to himself; and (ii) he made a loan of $600,000 of estate assets to purchase property in New York City that was titled in his name and that of his business partner, Aric Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">7. The property, which was the subject of the real estate transaction, is an eight unit rent-stabilized residential building located in Greenwich Village; the address of the property is 30 Perry Street, New York City, New York 10014. The building was being purchased as an investment property for the Respondent and his business partner. A Note, Mortgage, and Assignment of Rents and Leases secured the loan from the estate. The $600,000 Note was to be paid on a 30-year amortization schedule, but due in 2005 at an interest rate of 7.5%.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">8. The subject real estate transaction was disclosed on the various accountings filed by the Respondent in his capacity as the Conservator of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>9. The Respondent requested that an outside auditor review the estate\u2019s accounts and he received permission to do so. When the outside auditor questioned the propriety of the Respondent paying himself legal fees from the estate without prior court approval, he repaid the fees to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">10. When the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia raised questions regarding the propriety of the real estate transaction, the Respondent refinanced the property in July 2003 and repaid the Note in full, thus returning the assets, along with interest, to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">11. In October 2003, the Hon. Kaye K. Christian, a judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia issued a Show Cause Order against the Respondent. The Show Cause Order was issued in response to allegations that (i) the Respondent paid legal fees to himself without prior court approval; and (ii) that the Respondent entered into a mortgage investment transaction, utilizing $600,000 of the conservatorship estate assets, for the purchase of property located in New York City owned by the Respondent and his business partner, Aric Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">12. The Respondent sent a letter to Judge Christian (dated November 26, 2003) in which he tendered his resignation as the Conservator of the estate. In this letter, the Respondent made the following statements regarding the real estate transaction: (i) he knew that his actions were a violation of Probate Rule 5 (which he admitted he had not familiarized himself with); and (ii) that he now saw how this could be considered a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">13. The Show Cause hearing was held after which Judge Christian entered an Order. In the Order, Judge Christian noted that the Respondent admitted that he paid legal fees in the amount of $40,200 to himself without prior authorization and that he entered into a self-dealing mortgage investment transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">14. Judge Christian denied the Respondent\u2019s request to resign as the Conservator and, as a result of his payment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>legal fees to himself, without prior court approval, removed him as the Conservator of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">15. The District of Columbia Bar Counsel thereafter initiated disciplinary proceedings against the Respondent. The Respondent represented himself during these proceedings and consented to disbarment from the Bar of the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">16. After the Respondent was disbarred in the District of Columbia, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland filed a petition for reciprocal disciplinary action. The Court of Appeals held that the Respondent\u2019s conduct in taking fees from funds held in trust without prior court approval warranted an indefinite suspension rather than disbarment under Maryland law, <em>Attorney Grievance v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 890 A.2d 751 (2006), and indefinitely suspended him from the practice of law with the right to reapply after 18 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">17. As a result of another reciprocal proceeding in the State of New York, on December 12, 2006, the Respondent was suspended from the practice of law in the State of New York for a period of 18 months. The Supreme Court of the State of New York determined that the sanction of disbarment would be excessive based upon the established facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Since the basis of the indefinite suspension in Maryland was the fact that Respondent paid legal fees to himself without prior authorization, the present action is based solely upon the allegations surrounding the real estate transaction. The Respondent does not dispute the fact that he utilized $600,000 in estate funds to purchase real estate he owned with his business partner. The Respondent argues that he did not intend to take money improperly and that his actions resulted in no loss to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">I. MRPC 1.15: Safekeeping Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Rule 1.15 obligates a lawyer to hold property of clients (or others) that is in lawyer\u2019s possession separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The Petitioner claims that the Respondent violated this Rule by using estate funds to purchase real estate in New York City titled in the names of Respondent and his business partner, Aric Johnson; in essence, that the Respondent engaged in self-dealing. The Respondent argues that there was no self-dealing because the District of Columbia authorities were aware of the mortgage, since it was referenced in various estate filings made with the court. The Respondent additionally argues that the estate financially benefitted from this transaction since the mortgage interest rate was not less than the market value for similar real estate transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Based upon the testimony and evidence received at the hearing, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent is in violation of the MRPC 1.15 by utilizing estate property for his own benefit. Although the court believes the Respondent was sincere in his desire to maximize the assets of the estate, the manner in which he chose to do so is a clear conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">II. MRPC 8.4: Misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(a), (c) and (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-13\">The Court finds that the Respondent clearly knew what he was doing when he utilized estate funds to purchase real property that he would personally own and that he exhibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>poor judgment in doing so. Although his actions may not have been a deliberate attempt to deceive, the net effect of his actions is that he engaged in self-dealing. As a result, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated MRPC 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">III. Md.Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. \u00a7 10-306.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">This section provides that a lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer. Although the Respondent was acting in the role of a conservator, as opposed to a trustee, the obligation to safeguard the assets of the estate are the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The Respondent readily admitted during the hearing that he had not bothered to read the District of Columbia Code or rules governing conservatorships. Had he taken the time to do so, he would have more than likely known that prior court approval was needed regarding investing estate assets in a real estate venture in which he was a principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">The court does not find that the Respondent harbored a nefarious intent to deprive the estate of its assets. The court does find, however, that the Respondent\u2019s actions resulted in monies entrusted to him being utilized for unauthorized investments. For that reason, the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated the provisions of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">IV. Md.Code Ann., Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. \u00a7 10-307.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">This section provides the statutory basis for a disciplinary proceeding to be initiated. The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent\u2019s actions established the requisite willfulness for the instant disciplinary action to be maintained. The court further notes that during the District of Columbia disciplinary proceedings, and in his letter to Judge Christian, the Respondent admitted that his actions violated the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In proceedings involving attorney discipline, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 155, 939 A.2d 732, 740 (2008); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. 612, 632, 934 A.2d 1, 12 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Mininsohn, </em>380 Md. 536, 564, 846 A.2d 353, 369-70 (2004). In our review of the record, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous. Maryland Rule 16-759(b)(2);<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Harris, </em>403 Md. at 155-56, 939 A.2d at 740; <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. at 632, 934 A.2d at 12; <em>Mininsohn, </em>380 Md. at 564, 846 A.2d at 370. As to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, such as whether provisions of the MRPC were violated, our consideration is essentially <em>de novo. </em>Maryland Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1);<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Harris, </em>403 Md. at 156, 939 A.2d at 740; <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. at 632, 934 A.2d at 13; <em>Mininsohn, </em>380 Md. at 564, 846 A.2d at 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Respondent took exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, both of which we shall discuss.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Petitioner took no exceptions to the findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\n<em>A Respondent\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Respondent excepts to finding of fact number 10 of the hearing judge, which states: \u201cWhen the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia raised questions regarding the propriety of the real estate transaction, the Respondent refinanced the property in July 2003 and repaid the Note in full, thus returning the assets, along with interest, to the estate.\u201d Respondent argues that there is no evidence to support that portion of the finding regarding his impetus to repay the money; he refers to finding of fact number 8, which states, \u201cThe subject real estate transaction was disclosed on the various accountings filed by the Respondent in his capacity as the Conservator of the estate,\u201d and finding of fact number 9, which states, \u201cThe Respondent requested that an outside auditor review the estate\u2019s accounts and he received permission to do so. When the outside auditor questioned the propriety of the Respondent paying himself legal fees from the estate without prior court approval, he repaid the fees to the estate.\u201d Respondent also relies on an April 25, 2006, memorandum from an investigator for Bar Counsel to Assistant Bar Counsel, an exhibit introduced at the hearing, in which the investigator reports that the Court Auditor of the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia was aware of the $600,000 loan and the fact that it had been repaid with interest when stating that there was nothing to cause him concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As previously discussed, the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact generally will be accepted unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g. Harris, </em>403 Md. at 155-56, 939 A.2d at 740. Although Respondent argues that there is nothing in the record demonstrating that Respondent\u2019s impetus for repaying the conserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>torship in July of 2003 was in response to questions raised by the Probate Division, we disagree; the hearing judge clearly relied upon representations made by Respondent\u2019s counsel during opening statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">In late '02, Your Honor, he got an inquiry from the probate department about the mortgage, they\u2019re asking questions about it. In other words, they knew about the mortgage, they knew everything, but they had a different question. And he answered the question and he thought about this\u2014 and you\u2019ll hear from him, obviously\u2014as '03\u2014year '03 came about and he said, you know, they asked the question how\u2014 maybe they know something about this stuff I shouldn\u2019t have done. So he reversed everything. Borrowed the money, all the money was given back.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Those representations are supported by a November 18, 2002 letter, admitted into evidence, about which the Respondent testified, from the Estate Auditor of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia to Respondent, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">A review of the file herein indicates that the following additional requirements are necessary for presentation of the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\"><em>First and Second Account(s) </em>to the Court for approval:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ath\">Please file a copy of the original mortgage note receivable as the curtailments of the note have been previously filed. The curtailment schedule reflects an ending mortgage note receivable balance for the Second account of $592,531.45. In addition, please file copies of all documentation related to the creation of the mortgage note receivable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">Please file the above requirement(s) <em>within (20) days </em>from the date hereof, otherwise, your failure to comply must be brought to the attention of the Court and the fiduciary shall be subject to removal pursuant to <em>Rule 309.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The First and Second Accounting, Summary of Transactions, also admitted into evidence, only referenced the mortgage as \u201cMortgage receivable on 30 Perry Street, New York, NY\u201d without referencing in whom the property was titled. We, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>therefore, conclude that finding number 10 is supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\n<em>B. Respondent\u2019s Exception to Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">No exception was taken to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15 as well as Sections 10-306 and 10-307 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, Maryland Code (1989, 2000 RepLVol.). Having reviewed the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>we conclude, nevertheless, that Respondent\u2019s conduct violated MRPC 1.15, governing the safekeeping of property, specifically the $600,000 withdraw of conservatorship assets, and Sections 10-306 and 10-307 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, Maryland Code (1989, 2000 Repl.Vol.), limiting the use of trust money and subjecting those who inappropriately use trust money to disciplinary proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We next address Respondent\u2019s violations of MRPC 8.4(a), (c) and (d). During the course of the hearing, the judge granted a motion to dismiss the alleged violation of 8.4(b) and determined that Respondent violated Rules 8.4(a), (c) and (d), which state, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">The hearing judge found \u201cthat the Respondent clearly knew what he was doing when he utilized estate funds to purchase real property that he would personally own and that he exhibited poor judgment in doing so. Although his actions may not have been a deliberate attempt to deceive, the net effect of his actions is that he engaged in self-dealing.\u201d De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>spite the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion and dismissal of only 8.4(b), Respondent has only excepted to the conclusion that 8.4(c) was violated. During oral argument Respondent\u2019s attorney acknowledged that he had not taken exception to the conclusions of law relative to 8.4(a) and (d), because 8.4(c) was the \u201ckey thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Respondent asserts that he did not misappropriate funds because he did not intend to take the money, but rather, wanted to benefit the conservatorship. He also argues that he lacked specific intent to defraud or act deceitfully under 8.4(c) because the hearing judge found that his acts were not \u201ca deliberate attempt to deceive\u201d and that he did not \u201charbor[ ] a nefarious intent to deprive.\u201d Finally he contends that his was an act of negligence, rather than intent, because he did not know the rules concerning conservatorships. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Respondent\u2019s removal of the $600,000 without court approval was clearly a misappropriation. We consistently have held that intentional misappropriation is a violation of Rule 8.4(c), <em>see Attorney Grievance v. Webster, </em>402 Md. 448, 466, 937 A.2d 161, 171 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance v. McCulloch, </em>397 Md. 674, 683, 919 A.2d 660, 665 (2007); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kapoor, </em>391 Md. 505, 527-29, 894 A.2d 502, 515-16 (2006); <em>Attorney Grievance v. James, </em>385 Md. 637, 664, 870 A.2d 229, 245 (2005); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Zdravkovich, </em>381 Md. 680, 704, 852 A.2d 82, 96 (2004); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Snyder, </em>368 Md. 242, 260, 793 A.2d 515, 525-26 (2002), and have held in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Vanderlinde </em>that a lawyer violated MRPC 8.4(c) when she took money from her employer even though she replaced the money before the cessation of her employment. 364 Md. 376, 385-86, 773 A.2d 463, 468-69 (2001). <em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Pattison, </em>292 Md. 599, 608, 441 A.2d 328, 332 (1982) (finding Rules violation because \u201c[i]t is fundamental that a fiduciary may not make a loan, secured or unsecured (as was this), unto himself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Respondent asserts that his was not an \u201cintentional\u201d misappropriation because he acted to benefit the estate. In this, he confuses intent with motive. We have previously discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the difference between intent and motive when evaluating Rule 8.4 violations in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Potter, </em>380 Md. 128, 153, 844 A.2d 367, 382 (2004):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">In finding no violation of Rule 8.4, the hearing judge focused on respondent\u2019s motive, rather than on his intent. For example, the hearing judge determined that, based on respondent\u2019s motive of protecting the clients\u2019 interests, respondent did not remove the files or delete the computer records \u201cto be dishonest or deceitful.\u201d The hearing judge erred in concluding that the removal of the files was not a violation of Rules 8.4(c) and (d). Regardless of respondent\u2019s motive, <em>i.e., </em>his purported desire to protect the interests of the clients, his conduct was dishonest and deceitful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">In the instant case, Respondent\u2019s motivation, described by the hearing judge as a \u201cdesire to maximize the assets of the estate,\u201d does not affect the violation of 8.4(c) because he intentionally took the money out of the conservatorship; its utilization, or lack thereof, does not alter the character of the misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Respondent argues that he did not engage in dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation because he believed a higher rate of interest was available through the mortgage. Respondent relies upon <em>Attorney Grievance v. Siskind, </em>401 Md. 41, 930 A.2d 328 (2007), to argue that specific intent is required to demonstrate that an act was fraudulent in fact. In <em>Siskind, </em>we stated that \u201cif the <em>conduct </em>involved <em>fraud, </em>intent would become a relevant consideration in whether there was a violation of MRPC 8.4(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 930 A.2d at 344 (emphasis in original). <em>See also Attorney Grievance v.

We have recognized that public confidence in the legal profession is a critical facet to the proper administration of justice and conduct that negatively impacts on the public\u2019s image or the perception of the courts or the legal profession violates Rule 8.4(d). <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Respondent\u2019s self-dealing was harmful to the legal profession because his behavior undermines public confidence that an attorney will maintain entrusted funds as a fiduciary and as required by law. As such and consistent with this Court\u2019s well-established precedent, we hold that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) by engaging in behavior that was prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Respondent\u2019s violation of Rule 1.15, to which he failed to file an exception, as well as Rule 8.4(c) and (d) also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>constitute a violation of Rule 8.4(a), which prohibits attorneys from violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance v.

Respondent also had substantial experience in the practice of law having been admitted to the Bar of the Court of Appeals of Maryland on December 1, 1973, the Bar of the District of Columbia in 1991, and the Bar of the State of New York in 1997.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">Respondent has been sanctioned by this Court previously for failure to obtain the requisite court approval before paying himself legal fees, which we determined warranted an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after eighteen months. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 683, 890 A.2d 751, 763 (2006). The prior disciplinary action also arose from Respondent\u2019s action as a conservator; the present violation was not addressed in that proceeding. When the violations and time period are substantially similar to those in a previous attorney grievance case, we generally mete out essentially the same discipline. <em>See Mba-Jonas, </em>402 Md. at 346, 936 A.2d at 846. The present case is distinguishable from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>Mba-Jonas, </em>because Whitehead\u2019s misappropriation of $600,000 to purchase an investment property in his name and that of his business partner occurred almost immediately after his appointment as conservator on September 16, 1999; on May 4, 2000 he took the funds without any court approval. The Respondent first took legal fees in the amount of $16,325 without court approval in July of 2001, according to the record. Clearly, the misappropriation of $600,000, the violation of greatest severity, occurred during the infancy of his conservatorship. Additionally, the misappropriation presently at issue involves violations of different norms and implicates a set of facts that had not been subjected previously to any investigation regarding rule violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">We balance all of the forgoing considerations against mitigating factors, to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-6\"><em>Attorney Grievance v.

Respondent contends that he did not intend to misappropriate funds and, therefore, should not be disbarred, citing <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Following the completion of reciprocal discipline proceedings, subsequently initiated by the petitioner, the Attorney Grievance Commission, this Court rejected the disbarment sanction\u2014expressly refusing to defer to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2014and imposed, instead, an indefinite suspension. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Specifically, the Superior Court\u2019s Order removing the respondent as conservator for the Reginald Grayson, Jr. estate, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">\u201cThe Court heard the representations and admissions from Michael Grady, made on behalf of the Conservator, H.

Nevertheless, the Court justified the lesser sanction by determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>that only the improper fee payment charge was at issue, refusing to consider the conduct at issue here, the self-dealing mortgage investment transaction and by concluding that the respondent had demonstrated extenuating circumstances under Rule 16-773(e)(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">I dissented, believing that in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the proper application of Rule 16-773, consistent with its purpose, \u201cto ensure consistency of sanction and to demonstrate comity towards our sister jurisdictions[,]\u201d <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 690, 890 A.2d at 767, required this Court to defer to the sanction imposed by the disciplining court, especially as was the case there Maryland was not the respondent\u2019s primary place of practice, id. at 689-691, 890 A.2d at 767-68, and disbar the respondent on the basis that, and for the reason, that court did. That was not the only basis on which I relied to justify the sanction imposed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, however. Pointing out the consequences of the respondent\u2019s consent to disbarment, I explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201cMoreover, in this Court the respondent\u2019s status is not simply that of one who has consented to disbarment; rather, on the basis of that consent\u2014from the admission it contained\u2014he has been found by the hearing court to have violated Rule 8.4(a), (b), (c) and (d) [of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct]. Either subsection (b) or (c) constitutes a finding of intentional misappropriation of estate funds. That finding, in turn, is supported by the respondent\u2019s admission that he took fees from the estate, as to which he was conservator, without court permission. <em>In re Reginald Grayson, Jr., </em>No. 195-94, Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In other cases, in which the hearing court has found a violation of Rule 8.4(b) or (c), where there has been an inappropriate handling of monies or in which a trust account has been out of balance, we have refused to allow a respondent to be heard to say, and certainly not to succeed in the argument, that there was no misappropriation found or that it was not intentional. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

That basis, moreover, is consistent with the majority\u2019s desire and apparent determination, to attain, and to maintain, internal consistency in attorney discipline cases. As we have so often stated, disbarment is the inexorable result of a finding of misappropriation, absent compelling extenuating circumstances. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The conclusions were based on pertinent factual findings, as follows: with regard to Rule 1.15, that the respondent violated MRPC 1.15 by utilizing estate property for his own benefit; however, somewhat consistently with the respondent\u2019s argument, the court indicated its belief in the respondent\u2019s sincerity in wanting to maximize the assets of the estate, but decried the manner in which he chose to do so; as to Rule 8.4, \u201cthat the Respondent clearly knew what he was doing when he utilized estate funds to purchase real property that he would personally own and that he exhibited poor judgment in doing so. Although his actions may not have been a deliberate attempt to deceive, the net effect of his actions is that he engaged in self-dealing[;]\u201d as to \u00a7 10-306,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201cthat [the respondent] had not bothered to read the District of Columbia Code or rules governing conservatorships. Had he taken the time to do so, he would have more than likely known that prior court approval was needed regarding investing estate assets in real estate venture in which he was a principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">\u201cThe court does not find that the Respondent harbored a nefarious intent to deprive the estate of its assets. The court does find, however, that the Respondent\u2019s actions resulted in monies entrusted to him being utilized for unauthorized investments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Although the misappropriation will have been established with the sustaining of any one of the charged Rule violations or of \u00a7 10-306, only Rule 8\u20144(c) involves proof of an intent that would require disbarment as the default position, that would require the respondent to establish compelling extenuating circumstances to avoid that disposition. Accordingly, the respondent excepted to the conclusion that the petitioner had proven that Rule violation and that Rule violation only. It is significant, I think, that the hearing court did not specifically address each paragraph of the Rule alleged to have been violated, stating simply what the petitioner alleged and concluding that the respondent \u201cviolated MPRC 8.4.\u201d Rather than state clearly and unequivocally that the respondent engaged in conduct that was dishonest, fraudulent or deceitful, it characterized his actions in using estate funds without permission as \u201cusing poor judgment\u201d and acknowledged that \u201chis actions may not have been a deliberate attempt to deceive,\u201d although their \u201cnet effect\u201d was \u201cself-dealing.\u201d I have a hard time finding support for an 8.4(c) violation from this finding; it is hardly a ringing indictment for \u201cintentional misappropriation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The findings underlying the other Rule and statutory charges do not help or strengthen the petitioner\u2019s case or the hearing court\u2019s conclusion. As we have seen, while finding a violation of Rule 1.15 and decrying the manner in which he chose to do so, the hearing court the court indicated that it believed in the respondent\u2019s sincerity in wanting to maximize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>the assets of the estate. With regard to \u00a7 10-306, not only-does the hearing court acknowledge the petitioner\u2019s negligence in failing to become conversant with the rules regarding District of Columbia Conservatorships, negating intentional conduct, but it expressly \u201cdoes not find that the Respondent harbored a nefarious intent to deprive the estate of its assets.\u201d The further finding that the respondent\u2019s actions resulted in monies entrusted to him being utilized for unauthorized investments simply does not conflict with, or override, the earlier ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">My problem is that, under the majority\u2019s analysis, intent is not an element to be considered when the charge is misappropriation and that the motive underlying the conduct, although relevant, need not seriously be considered, even on the question of the appropriate sanction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is not the first time I have addressed the latter point. In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Pennington, </em>387 Md. 565, 876 A.2d 642 (2005), in which the hearing court found that the respondent \u201cintend[ed] the natural consequences of her action and nonaction,\u201d but concluded that, by those actions and nonactions, the respondent had no intent to harm her client, I dissented, reasoning that, given the court\u2019s conclusions, a finding that Rule 8.4(c) had been violated did not, as a matter of law, mean that the respondent acted with a dishonest or selfish motive. Id. at 602, 876 A.2d at 664. On the contrary, I concluded that the opposite was true, that the respondent acted without a dishonest or selfish motive. That the hearing court could have reached the opposite conclusion and, more to the point, that the opposite conclusion is the one that a reviewing court may prefer and, as factfinder, would have reached, can, and should, not change that reality. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>As I have demonstrated, our cases require consideration of intent both in determining whether misappropriation has occurred and on the sanction and of motive on the issue of sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s analysis is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s analysis of this very issue in prior cases. Indeed, to make the point, we need go no further than the reciprocal discipline case involving this very respondent, <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 890 A.2d 751. In that case, in justifying a sanction different from, and more lenient than, that imposed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, we clearly relied on the lack of the proof of intent to misappropriate the premature fee payment, stating \u201c[f]rom the record it is not apparent that respondent\u2019s conduct was intentional.\u201d Id. at 676, 890 A.2d at 759.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\"><em>Calhoun </em>is also instructive and relevant on this point. As promised, <em>see </em>note 3, its significance lies in the way in which this Court distinguished it in <em>Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. 612, 934 A.2d 1. There, Judge Battaglia, writing for a unanimous Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201cIn the singular case in which a violation of 8.4(c) was found and disbarment was not ordered, <em>Calhoun, </em>391 Md. at 532, 894 A.2d at 518, the respondent was charged with violating multiple rules of professional conduct, including 8.4(c), in connection with her representation of a client in a sexual harassment suit. The hearing court found that Calhoun had commingled trust funds and personal funds by failing to deposit two $5,000.00 payments for fees and an $8,000.00 settlement check into a properly designated attorney trust account. The hearing judge found that Calhoun had misled her client concerning legal fees and costs owed by failing to keep him informed of the accrual of those fees and costs in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>timely fashion, as was required by her representation agreement. Specifically, the court found that she \u2018mis[led] by silence and lack of communication,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 548, 894 A.2d at 527, and that she violated 8.4(c) by her \u2018failure to communicate properly.\u2019 Id. at 552, 894 A.2d at 530. In determining Calhoun\u2019s sanction, this Court noted that \u2018while the hearing judge did find that respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c), he did not find specifically that respondent engaged in dishonest or fraudulent conduct,\u2019 id. at 571, 894 A.2d at 541, and focused on the respondent\u2019s treatment of the $8,000.00 in settlement funds. We noted that the hearing court did not find that Calhoun had intentionally misappropriated the settlement funds, but rather that the facts indicated that she may have believed, albeit erroneously, that the settlement funds were owed to her to cover fees and costs associated with representation. Id. at 574, 894 A.2d at 543.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Id. at 646-47, 934 A.2d at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">I dissent. As I said in <em>Pennington, </em>387 Md. at 602, 876 A.2d at 664:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u201cThere really is no good reason, and the public is not protected, when an attorney, acting, as found by the hearing court, without a selfish or dishonest motive is disbarred. Imposition of such a sanction under those circumstances, amounts to nothing more than punishment.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-9\">. D.C.Code \u00a7 21-2011 (2001) defines a \"conservator\u201d as \"a person who is appointed by a court to manage the estate of a protected individual. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b305-5\">. I characterized the misconduct in the reciprocal discipline case as \"misappropriation,\u201d whether referring to the improper fee payment or the self dealing mortgage transaction, as both involved misuse of client funds. Given the analysis employed by the majority in arriving at a sanction, I conclude that it treated the improper fee payment as a misappropriation as well. Explaining why a sanction other than disbarment was appropriate, it pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">\"In the case at bar, respondent did not take the fees before they were improperly accounted for or earned. Respondent practiced in Maryland for twenty-six years before moving to New York and petitioner did not provide any evidence that respondent was disciplined on any other occasion. From the record it is not apparent that respondent's conduct was intentional. Furthermore, he returned the unapproved fees upon learning that taking them without approval was inappropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-7\"><em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Whitehead, </em>390 Md. 663, 676, 890 A.2d 751, 759 (2006). The majority seemed, in other words, to have determined that extenuating circumstances existed that mitigated the sanction. That also is consistent with Rule 16-773(d)(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">\"(e) Exceptional circumstances. Reciprocal discipline shall not be ordered if Bar Counsel or the attorney demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that: ... (4) the conduct established does not constitute misconduct in this State or it warrants substantially different discipline in this State....\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">. How we distinguished <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Calhoun, </em>391 Md. 532, 894 A.2d 518 (2006), is instructive and relevant to this case, as we shall see <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">. Maryland Rule 1. 15 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-8\">\"(a) A lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons that is in a lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be kept in a separate account maintained pursuant to Title 16, Chapter 600 of the Maryland Rules. Other property shall be identified as such and appropriately safeguarded. Complete records of such account funds and of other property shall be kept by the lawyer and shall be preserved for a period of five years after termination of the representation.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b310-5\">. Rule 8.4, Misconduct, of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201c(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">sjt sfs % s};</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">\"(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-10\">\"(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b310-11\">. Section 10-306 proscribes a lawyer\u2019s \"use [of] trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b310-12\">. Section 10-307 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-13\">\u201cA lawyer who willfully violates any provision of this Part I of this subtitle, except for the requirement that a lawyer deposit trust moneys in an attorney trust account for charitable purposes under \u00a7 10-303 of this subtitle, is subject to disciplinary proceedings as the Maryland Rules provide.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b312-5\">. I must confess that I also have a hard time squaring the use of the reciprocal discipline case as a prior disciplinary proceeding. As the opinion in that case made clear, the mortgage investment matter was fully revealed, even admitted by the respondent in that case. Indeed, as I point out <em>supra </em>and at <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 688-89, 890 A.2d at 766, so well developed was the issue that it could have been used in the reciprocal discipline case as another basis for deferring to the sanction of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">. It may also be worth mentioning that, when the Court was trying to justify a different, more lenient sanction than the sanctioning court, it was willing even to consider that the respondent \u201creturned the unapproved fees upon learning that taking them without approval was inappropriate.\u201d <em>Whitehead, </em>390 Md. at 676, 890 A.2d at 759 (2006). Dare I say it?\u2014so much for internal consistency!</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
