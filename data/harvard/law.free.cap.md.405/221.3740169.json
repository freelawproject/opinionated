Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">At about 10:30 p.m. on August 24, 2006, in Baltimore City, fourteen year-old Marcus J. was approached by officers in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>patrol car who asked him to \u201ccome here\u201d; Marcus J. began to run and threw something away as he was running. The police discovered a gun in the yard nearby, which Marcus J. denied was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">He was subsequently charged as a juvenile with one count of carrying a handgun, one count of concealing a dangerous or deadly weapon,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of possession of a firearm while under the age of 21. On the day of the adjudicatory hearing before a master, the State requested a postponement in order to obtain an operability report on the handgun, as well as a fingerprint analysis,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> both of which were not yet available. The postponement was denied. As a result, the State called Officer Charles Thompson who testified, over a defense objection, regarding whether the handgun was operational:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Officer Thompson, I\u2019m going to ask you, if you would, to pick up the weapon and the weapon has a barrel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">[OFFICER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-8\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And it has been rendered safe by you and double-checked by the sheriff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">[OFFICER]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m going to ask you if you would please take a look at the barrel and describe the condition of the barrel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-11\">[MARCUS J.\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-12\">[MASTER]: What do you mean \u201cdescribe the condition\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Describe what you see when you look in the barrel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">[MASTER]: Okay.

I see my thumbnail and I also see [b]ands and grooves in the barrel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Do you see any obstructions in the barrel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">[OFFICER]: No, I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m going to ask you to put your finger on the trigger of the weapon and pull that back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adh\">[OFFICER]: (Witness complied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-10\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Does it go back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-11\">[OFFICER]: Yes, it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-12\">[STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Is there a way that you can render it to go forward?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-13\">[OFFICER]: Yes, by depressing the trigger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-14\">[MARCUS J.\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I\u2019m going to object, Your Honor, to these lines of questions. This officer is not certified to, again, do any type of operability test. I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s been classified as an expert to do any type [of] tests on the operability of handguns at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-15\">The master made a finding of facts sustained,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> finding specifically that \u201c[t]he testimony of witnesses supported the sustained counts,\u201d and that \u201c[conflicting testimony concerning the sustained counts was resolved in favor of the witness[ ] for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the State.\u201d A disposition hearing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was held in November of 2006, after which the master recommended that Marcus J. be found to be \u201ca delinquent child\u201d and further recommended that he be placed on probation for an indefinite period, subject to various conditions, including substance abuse outpatient counseling, mandatory school attendance, community service and participation in a mentor program.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Within five days, Marcus J. filed a Notice of Exception and Request for Hearing, in which he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">Pursuant to Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, section 3-815(c) and Rule 11-111(c) of the Maryland Rules of Procedure, please be advised that the Respondent excepts to the findings and proposed orders of [the master], on the 3rd day November, 2006, in the above-captioned petition(s) and requests that the matter be set for a hearing de novo, before the Judge of this Honorable Court and in support of the exception, notes these errors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4J\">Respondents [sic] counsel is excepting to [the master\u2019s] findings at the adjudicatory hearing held on 10/6/06 and the disposition hearing on 11/3/06. [The master] erred in her admission of an non experts [sic] testimony on the operability of a handgun over Respondents [sic] council [sic] objection. Moreover, [the master] erred in her facts and findings in the adjudicatory and disposition hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">During the exceptions hearing, Marcus J.\u2019s attorney stated, in response to the Judge\u2019s statement that she did not comply with the exceptions policy of the Baltimore City Circuit Court when exercising its juvenile jurisdiction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that she \u201cdid file the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>exception and the exception does specifically state what I\u2019m excepting to.\u201d Marcus J.\u2019s attorney continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">Your Honor, I filed my exceptions, the law i[s] very clear that my Client is allowed an exception de novo hearing based on filing [ ] the exceptions with the Clerk\u2019s office, which was properly done within the five days. That is the law. The law that my Client is entitled to an exception de novo, as long as I file the exception within five days. That is what the law states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The Judge, nonetheless, dismissed Marcus J.\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Marcus J. appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, in which he posed the single question of whether the Circuit Court erred in dismissing his exceptions. In a reported opinion, the intermediate appellate court vacated the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanded the case for a hearing \u201cas to all matters decided by the master.\u201d <em>In re Marcus J., </em>175 Md.App. 703, 716, 931 A.2d 1146, 1154 (2007). The court iterated that, \u201c[bjecause a juvenile is, in fact, entitled to elect a <em>de novo </em>hearing on exceptions, and is entitled to file exceptions to \u2018all of the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations,\u2019 we view the exceptions filed by Marcus as sufficiently specific to communicate his election to avail himself of that right,\u201d and that \u201cthe circuit court erred in basing its dismissal of the exceptions on the juvenile\u2019s alleged failure to comply with a local \u2018exception policy\u2019 <em>that\u2014as applied in this </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>case\u2014purportedly imposed requirements beyond those set forth in Rule 11-111 and CJP \u00a7 3-807(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712, 715-16, 931 A.2d at 1151-52, 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The State petitioned for certiorari, which we granted. <em>In re Marcus J., </em>402 Md. 355, 936 A.2d 852 (2007). We shall hold that, under Section 3-807(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 RepLVol.), and Maryland Rule 11-111, Marcus J. was entitled to a de novo hearing as to all matters decided by the master.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The State acknowledges to the extent Marcus J. specifically excepted to the police officer\u2019s non-expert testimony on the operability of the handgun, that an exceptions hearing as to that exception would be appropriate. The State, nonetheless, argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that Marcus J. had a right to a de novo hearing on all of the masters findings, conclusions and recommendations under Section 3-807(e)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), and Maryland Rule ll-lll(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In response to the State\u2019s argument, Marcus J. contends that the intermediate appellate court was correct in concluding that Marcus J. complied with the statute and Rule governing the filing of exceptions and the request for a de novo hearing. Marcus J. argues that he was entitled to have his case heard before a qualified circuit court judge and that Section 3-807(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), and Maryland Rule 11-111 provide him with the option of a de novo hearing on all matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We utilize masters in many jurisdictions in various types of proceedings, such as domestic relations cases, general civil matters and, most importantly for the present case, in juvenile causes, including shelter care and delinquency. In <em>State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 714 A.2d 841 (1998), we had occasion to explore the role of masters: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>A master is not a judicial officer, and the Maryland Constitution does not vest a master with any judicial powers. <em>In re Anderson, </em>272 Md. 85, 106, 321 A.2d 516 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1000, 95 S.Ct. 2399, 44 L.Ed.2d 667 (1975); <em>see also Swisher v. Brady, </em>438 U.S. 204, 209, 98 S.Ct. 2699, 2703, 57 L.Ed.2d 705 (1978) (\u201cmasters [in Maryland] are entrusted with none of the judicial power of the State\u201d); <em>Lemley v. Lemley, </em>102 Md.App. 266, 277, 649 A.2d 1119 (1994) (\u201c[T]he master is not a judge and is not vested with any part of the State\u2019s judicial power.\u201d); <em>Sensabaugh v. Gorday, </em>90 Md.App. 379, 390, 600 A.2d 1204 (1992) (\u201cOnce a master has recommended a contempt proceeding it is necessary for the court to issue the show cause order because the master does not have the power to issue such orders.\u201d). \u201cSimply put, the Master is a ministerial and not a judicial officer.\u201d <em>Levitt v. Levitt, </em>79 Md.App. 394, 399, 556 A.2d 1162, <em>cert. denied, </em>316 Md. 549, 560 A.2d 1118 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">In <em>Nnoli v. Nnoli, </em>101 Md.App. 243, 646 A.2d 1021 (1994), [the Court of Special Appeals] observed that a master has historically been an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cadviser of the court as to matters of jurisdiction, parties, pleading, proof and in other respects where he may be of assistance to the court.... The duties of the master are of an advisory character only. He decides nothing, but merely reports to the court the result of his examination of the proceedings, with a suggestion as to the propriety of the court passing a decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 261 n. 5, 646 A.2d 1021 (quoting Edgar G. Miller, Jr. <em>Equity Procedure </em>\u00a7 556, at 654-55 (1897)). Thus, a judge \u201cmay never delegate away a part of the decision making function to a master\u2014a non-judicial officer.\u201d <em>Wenger v. Wenger, </em>42 Md.App. 596, 602, 402 A.2d 94 (1979). Consequently, even when a judge defers to a master\u2019s fact-finding, the judge does not defer to the master\u2019s recommendation as to the appropriate course of action. <em>Id. </em>at 606, 402 A.2d 94; <em>see also Ellis v. Ellis, </em>19 Md.App. 361, 365, 311 A.2d 428 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>A master is, however, an officer of the court, appointed by the circuit court; that court has constitutional authority to make such appointments. Md. Const, art. 4, \u00a7 9 (\u201cThe Judge, or Judges of any Court, may appoint such officers for their respective Courts as may be found necessary.\u201d); Md. Rule 2-541(a)(3) (\u201cA master serves at the pleasure of the appointing court and is an officer of the court in which the referred matter is pending.\u201d). Nevertheless, a master\u2019s status as an \u201cofficer of the court\u201d does not confer judicial powers upon the master, such as the authority to hold someone in contempt, to sign a warrant, or to order a police officer to make an arrest. Indeed, \u201c[a] master is not the trial judge. A master does not replace her or him.\u201d <em>Wise-Jones, </em>117 Md.App. at 500, 700 A.2d 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 593-595, 714 A.2d at 845.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>In 1970, this Court adopted Rule 908(e),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Rule from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>which current Rule 11-111<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was derived, which, for the first time, enabled the filing of \u201cwritten exceptions to the master\u2019s findings or recommendations or any part thereof,\u201d required the circuit court judge to \u201chear the entire matter or such specific matters as set forth in the exceptions <em>de novo </em>\u201d and mandated that the judge promptly confirm, modify or remand the findings and recommendations of the master. Rule 11-111(c) provides for the filing of exceptions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to a master\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>findings, conclusions and recommendations; it requires, however, that exceptions \u201cspecify those items to which the party excepts, and whether the hearing is to be de novo or on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Legislature, in 1975, after having considered whether to prohibit the use of masters, enacted a provision permitting the filing of exceptions \u201cto any or all of the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations,\u201d provided the requesting party \u201cspecify those items to which [the party] objects.\u201d <em>See </em>1975 Maryland Laws, Chapter 554. The statute, which is now codified at Section 3-807 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>allows the filing party to elect a hearing de novo or a hearing on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">We now turn to whether Marcus J.\u2019s exceptions meet the specificity requirement of the statute and Rule. Both Section 3-807 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), and Maryland Rule 11-111 allow a juvenile to file exceptions to the master\u2019s proposed findings, conclusions and recommendations provided that he or she <em>specify </em>those items to which the party excepts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Specify is defined as \u201cto name or state explicitly or in detail,\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1198 (11th ed.2005), and \u201c[t]o state explicitly.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary 1060 (1999). Marcus J.\u2019s Notice of Exception and Request for Hearing explicitly stated that the master \u201cerred in her admission of an non experts [sic] testimony on the operability of a handgun over Respondents [sic] council [sic] objection.\u201d In the State\u2019s brief and at oral argument, the State conceded that the exception regarding non-expert testimony on the operability of the handgun met the specificity requirement of the statute and Rule. We agree, but cannot end our analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Marcus J. also filed additional exceptions, stating he was \u201cexcepting to [the master\u2019s] findings at the adjudicatory hearing held on 10/6/06 and the disposition hearing on 11/3/06,\u201d and that \u201c[m]oreover, [the master] erred in her facts and findings in the adjudicatory and disposition hearing.\u201d Although the State argues that these exceptions are not specific, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>they are <em>explicit, </em>reflecting the mandate of Section 3-807(c) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl.Vol.), which states that any party \u201cmay file written exceptions to any or all of the master\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations.\u201d To conclude otherwise would render the word \u201call\u201d in the statute meaningless and would otherwise limit the ability of a juvenile to have his or her concerns heard by a circuit court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">The issue, however, that could arise on remand and has consumed much of the resources of both the State and Marcus J. before us, involves whether Marcus J. is entitled to a de novo hearing, as he requested, or whether the Circuit Court hearing should be on the record. The statute and Rule provide for one or the other, although the scope of a hearing de novo is undefined. The common meaning of a de novo hearing is a \u201cnew hearing of a matter, conducted as if the original hearing had not taken place\u201d and requires a \u201creviewing court\u2019s decision of a matter anew, giving no deference to a lower court\u2019s findings.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 738 (8th ed.2004). In their treatise on appellate courts, Daniel J. Meador, Maurice Rosenberg and Paul D. Carrington, have noted that originally, \u201c[i]n the English Court of Chancery the decision of a vice-chancellor[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] could be appealed to the chancellor and the case heard de novo. That is, the reviewing judge could receive evidence and make determinations of fact as though no proceeding had taken place previously.\u201d Daniel J. Meador, Maurice Rosenberg and Paul D. Carrington, <em>Appellate Courts: Structures, Functions, Processes, and Personnel </em>11 (1994). As they also noted, this practice persists whereby \u201cdecisions of trial courts of limited jurisdiction can be appealed de novo to the trial courts of general jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">De novo in the present case, albeit different contextually, must enable the Circuit Court Judge to receive evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>make determinations of facts as though no prior proceeding had occurred, especially because a master is not recognized as a judge, but a ministerial actor making recommendations to an Article IV judge.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Harryman v. State, </em>359 Md. 492, 505-06, 754 A.2d 1018, 1025-26 (2000) (describing a master as a \u201c \u2018ministerial officer\u2019 who advises and assists a judge\u201d); <em>Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. at 593, 714 A.2d at 845 (\u201cA master is not a judicial officer, and the Maryland Constitution does not vest a master with any judicial powers.\u201d); <em>In re Dewayne H., </em>290 Md. 401, 402 n. 1, 430 A.2d 76, 77 n. 1 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Because of this, we have held that a master\u2019s hearing in a juvenile matter does not place the juvenile in jeopardy; in <em>Anderson, </em>272 Md. at 106, 321 A.2d at 527, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">We have cited cases and authorities to the effect that a master is a ministerial officer, and not a judicial officer. We have called attention to the fact that under the Maryland Constitution a master is entrusted with no part of the judicial power of this State, although the earlier magistrate for juvenile causes was entrusted with such power as a justice of the peace. We have pointed out that, under the Maryland Rules applicable to juvenile cases and under the procedure generally where masters are involved, a master hears evidence and then reports his findings of fact and his recommendations to the chancellor. We have also pointed out that a master\u2019s findings do not become binding until approved by a judge of the court to which he reports. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>Accordingly, we conclude that a hearing before a master is not such a hearing as places a juvenile in jeopardy. <em>Therefore, double jeopardy cannot arise if the matter is heard de novo before the chancellor.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">(emphasis added). <em>See also Swisher v. Brady, </em>438 U.S. 204, 215, 98 S.Ct. 2699, 2706, 57 L.Ed.2d 705, 715 (1978) (iterating that the Maryland Rule allowing the State to file exceptions to a master\u2019s proposals does not require a juvenile to stand trial twice because under the master system, the \u201caccused juvenile is subjected to a single proceeding which begins with a master\u2019s hearing and culminates with an adjudication by a judge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Both <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Swisher </em>involved State requests for hearings on exceptions. In <em>Anderson, </em>we considered whether the State could request a de novo hearing on exceptions under Rule 908, which enabled the State to request a de novo hearing; we concluded that the State could request that hearing without placing the juvenile in jeopardy. <em>Anderson, </em>272 Md. at 106, 321 A.2d at 527. This ruling precipitated nine juveniles filing for habeas corpus relief in <em>Swisher, </em>arguing that double jeopardy was implicated when the State took exceptions to masters\u2019 findings that were favorable to them. Under Rule 911, however, which became applicable at the time of <em>Swisher, </em>the State was no longer able to request a hearing de novo. In addressing the issue of whether the Rule enabling the State even to request a hearing on the record violated double jeopardy, the Supreme Court concluded that the juveniles were not placed in jeopardy, because the master\u2019s hearing is part of a single proceeding that is ultimately concluded by the adjudication of a circuit court judge. <em>Swisher, </em>438 U.S. at 215, 98 S.Ct. at 2706, 57 L.Ed.2d at 715. Concomitantly, because the adjudication before a circuit court judge is the gravamen of the process, a juvenile must be entitled to elect to have a judge hear evidence, make findings and apply the law to the facts of the case, as though no proceeding had occurred, should the juvenile request a de novo hearing, after submitting appropriate exceptions. Under the present case, therefore, wherein Marcus J. took exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>to all matters decided by the master and unequivocally stated that he \u201crequests that the matter be set for a hearing de novo,\u201d he was entitled to such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Although the State\u2019s petition alleges that Marcus J. violated Section 4-101 of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2002, 2006 Supp.), for wearing or carrying a dangerous weapon, we note that a handgun is not within the definition of a dangerous weapon under Section 4-101(a)(5)(ii), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-14\">(ii) \"Weapon\u201d does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-15\">1. a handgun; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-16\">2. a penknife without a switchblade.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-17\">.

The exceptions policy apparently referred to the policy adopted in the Baltimore City Circuit Court whereby a form order is required to be entered in every case in which a party excepted to the master\u2019s proposed findings, conclusions, recommendations or orders. The form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>order required that a party requesting an exceptions hearing on the record file a memorandum within 10 days \"specif[ying] any finding of fact and conclusion of law to which that party is taking exception\u201d as well as \"the reason(s) as to why the Master\u2019s recommended finding of fact(s) or conclusion(s) of law is in error\u201d; the form order did not require the filing of a memorandum if the party requested a hearing de novo. <em>Forster v.

The history of the development of the juvenile court system in Maryland, as well as the role of juvenile masters before 1970, was extensively discussed by Judge Marvin H. Smith, on behalf of this Court, in <em>In re Anderson, </em>272 Md. 85, 94-97, 321 A.2d 516, 521-23 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1000, 95 S.Ct. 2399, 44 L.Ed.2d 667 (1975).

Provision for a special judicial officer to handle juvenile matters came into Maryland law with passage of Chapter 611 of the Acts of 1902.

The revised Rule prohibited the State from requesting a de novo hearing before a judge; the State had only the ability to request a hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the record. Shortly thereafter, Rule 910 was renumbered with nonsubstantive changes as Rule 911.
