Taylor, alleging violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. The Commission charged respondent with violating (1) Md. Rule 16-607 Commingling of Funds,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>as the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct: (2) Rule 1.15 Safekeeping Property,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (3) Rule 8.1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (4) Rule 8.4 Misconduct,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (5) Rule 1.3 Diligence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (6) Rule 1.4 Communication,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (7) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Rule 1.5 Fees,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (8) Rule 3.2 Expediting Litigation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (9) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>Rule 3.4 Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>to Maryland Rule 16-752(a), we referred the matter to Judge Sheila R. Tillerson Adams of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to make findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law. Judge Adams held an evidentiary hearing and concluded that the Commission had not produced sufficient evidence for the court to find that the respondent had violated the statute or the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Judge Adams made the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\n<em>\u201cFINDINGS OF FACT</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">I. <em>Trust Account Over Draft</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">Michael F. Taylor (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) is a member of the Maryland Bar and was admitted to practice in June of 2001. The respondent is not licensed to practice law in any other jurisdiction. Respondent worked as legal counsel to the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (DLLR) from his admission to the Bar in 2001 until July 7, 2005. During that period respondent maintained a very limited private practice out of his home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">On January 4, 2006, Bar Counsel received a report of an overdraft on respondent\u2019s attorney trust account. After an investigation, Bar Counsel determined that the respondent had violated the following rules of The Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct:[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3x\">Rule 1.15 Safekeeping Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALp\">Rule 8.1 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgO\">Rule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">That during the period of August 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006 the respondent maintained an attorney trust ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>count at Bank of America. That said account was the only attorney trust account that the respondent had ever obtained for his practice. That he opened the account in anticipation of a settlement in one of the few cases that he handled in his private practice. The settlement was finalized and the funds were properly disbursed through the trust account. The disbursements of the funds from the settlement are not at issue. Subsequent to the disbursement of the funds, the trust account remained open. No other client funds were ever deposited in that account. However, the respondent deposited minimal funds in that account from time to time to pay the on going maintenance fees that were automatically debited from that account on a monthly basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">On or about December 27, 2005 the respondent paid his office phone bill from the trust account in question and at that time there were insufficient funds in the account to cover the transaction. The transaction was covered by a subsequent deposit from the respondent in to the trust account. The trust account was closed March 2006. Upon receiving the January 4, 2006 notification from Bank of America, Bar Counsel sent letters to the respondent on January 10, 2006, February 21, 2006, March 16, 2006 and April 4, 2006 requesting a written response to the overdrafts in the trust account. The respondent did not send a written response to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry until April 11, 2006. Bar Counsel responded promptly with letters on April 17, 2006 and May 3, 2006. The respondent finally sent a detailed explanation to Bar Counsel on May 20, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">It is clear from the information submitted by the respondent that there were no commingling of client funds or use or misuse of client funds. In fact, there were no client funds deposited in the trust account case when the account overdrafted. At issue here, is the proper management and utilization of an attorney trust account, the events that led the account to overdraft and the timeliness of the response by the respondent. The respondent set forth the following explanation found in letter and deposition testimony lifted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>its entirety from the report of Jeffery S. Janofsky, M.D., designated as an expert by Bar Counsel during the hearing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWr\">In a May 2006 letter to the Attorney Grievance Commission Mr. Taylor explained in late 2005: my motivation to discontinue the practice of law was due to my rapidly declining mental health. I had survived a stroke (in October, 2004) which had resulted in some initial loss of (i) short and long-term memory and cognitive functions (ii) physical mobility, and (iii) emotional stability. By late 2005, I had regained much of my pre-stroke physical and mental acuities through medical treatment, medicines and physical therapy. However by late 2005 I discovered that I could not represent clients to the best of my ability due to my impaired mental acumen and emotional state ... unbeknownst to me at the time, and for sometime thereafter and earlier events signaled my descent into depression and related psychosocial disorder which significantly altered my behavioral patterns and outlook. Earlier in June, 2005, I was summarily dismissed from employment as an attorney with the state due to my health conditions ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIX\">As a result of my depression, I became withdrawn, touchy, lacking in motivation, dispirited, and bereft of my usual strong sense of responsibility. My normal sense of responsiveness to obligations, duties and requirements waned as I became indifferent and disconnected from life\u2019s daily responsibilities. On some level, I believed that I deserved the bad things that happened to me (e.g. stroke, job termination, poor court performance, diabetes, hypertension, and other ailment, etc.) because I did some unknown thing to cause them to happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">I remained in the midst of this depressive state through early May, 2006 of this year coming to terms with my the (sic) discovery of my condition only after a dramatic change in my physical, mental and emotional health as a result of an adjustment in my daily regimen of medicines prescribed by my new physician. With my mind clear, I began to question my recent conduct, especially my tardi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>ness in responding to the Commission\u2019s request. What then became clear is that I was seeking to be punished for my perceived failures....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">In his October 31, 2007 deposition, Mr. Taylor described similar difficulties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">Mr. Taylor attributed his initial failures to respond to the Attorney Grievance Commission to fear that he could not remember the details of the incidents, \u201cI could not remember all the stuff. I could not remember the details.\u201d In retrospect, Mr. Taylor felt he was depressed and therefore did not respond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">During this two-day hearing, the Court heard from Jeffrey S. Janofsky, M.D. and Dr. Henry, the respondent\u2019s primary care physician. Although Dr. Janofsky clearly indicated that Mr. Taylor had never been clinically diagnosed with depression, on cross examination he conceded that one could be depressed from all of the mental and medical stresses that the respondent was facing at that time in his life. Dr. Henry advised the court that he clearly felt that the respondent was depressed and recommended that he see a psychologist as late as September of 2007. The respondent further testified that during that period in his life he just let everything pile up. In fact, the respondent testified that he did not even open his mail. The respondent further testified that due to his depressed state of mind at that period in his life he could not have effectively responded any sooner than he did to Bar Counsel\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">II. <em>Jerry J. Mathis Representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">On or about May 2, 2006, the respondent was notified by Bar Counsel of the complaint filed by Jerry J. Mathis (hereinafter referred to as Mr. Mathis). Bar Counsel contended that the respondent violated the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">1) Rule 1.3 Diligence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">2) Rule 1.4 Communication</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">3) Rule 1.5 Fees</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>4) Rule 3.2 Expediting Litigation</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">5) Rule 3.4 Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">6) Rule 8.1 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">7) Rule'8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Mr. Mathis and the respondent had been acquaintances for more than 10 years. They lived in the same community and attended the same church. Conversations in those circles is what precipitated this representation. In May of 2003, the respondent began to provide legal representation to Mr. Mathis concerning a dispute with a business associate (hereinafter referred to as Mr. Hargrove). No fees for service were paid by Mr. Mathis at this point. The respondent surmised that this matter could be negotiated short of litigation based on the facts as he knew at the time. Respondent met with Mr. Mathis and developed a strategy for the case, which was memorialized in a letter to opposing counsel. Among other things, the respondent and Mr. Mathis agreed that Mr. Mathis would put all of Mr. Hargrove\u2019s commissions in an interest bearing account and to provide a regular accounting of the funds. A copy of the letter and the retainer agreement were hand delivered to Mr. Mathis on May 24, 2003. Although Mr. Mathis agreed to handle the funds as instructed, Mr. Mathis never put the funds in an interest bearing account despite the fact that Mr. Hargrove\u2019s attorney routinely forwarded the commission checks to Mr. Mathis through the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">After ignoring repeated request to provide an accounting, in August of 2003, Mr. Hargrove filed suit against Mr. Mathis in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County Maryland <em>(Hargrove v. Mathis et al. </em>CAL 03-15930). Mr. Mathis did not tell the respondent about the case until September of 2003. By that time a Motion for Default was pending. The respondent filed the appropriate pleadings. The Default was denied and an answer and counterclaim were filed. In September of 2003, Mr. Mathis finally signed the retainer agreement and paid the respondent $2,000.00. Prior to the September payment no other fee had been tendered to the respondent for services.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Between the months of September 2003 to March of 2004 the respondent did little on the case. However, there was no testimony that any court dates were missed during this time period. The respondent testified that he made numerous attempts to get Mr. Mathis to sign the interrogatories and he just would not cooperate. Therefore, the respondent sent unsigned answers to opposing counsel in an effort to be in compliance with the discovery rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">There came a point in time when the respondent determined that the case was really too much for him to handle. The Respondent then recommended two other attorneys and a paralegal to Mr. Mathis. A meeting was arranged and Mr. Mathis agreed to hire Mr. Frison to handle the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Mr. Frison was not barred in Maryland so he had to be moved into practice in the Circuit Court pro hoc vice for the purpose of this litigation and the respondent was required to stay in as local counsel. At the next court hearing, the respondent appeared with Mr. Frison. Mr. Frison handled the discovery process. The respondent minimally participated in the lawsuit from May 2004 through August of 2004. There came a time when the respondent and Mr. Frison had a difference of opinion concerning the strategy of the case. Mr. Mathis, however, agreed with Mr. Frison\u2019s approach. Thereafter, the respondent sought to withdraw from the case and Mr. Frison sought new local counsel. The trial proceeded without the respondent\u2019s participation and Mr. Mathis was not successful. Additionally, the respondents\u2019 appearance was never stricken from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Mr. Frison then sued Mr. Mathis for attorney fees. The respondent was brought into the suit as a third party. The court found for Mr. Frison and dismissed the suit against the respondent. The complaint with Bar Counsel was subsequently filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">On May 19, 2006, a second letter was sent by Bar Counsel. The letter was returned to Bar Counsel\u2019s office unclaimed on or about July 20, 2006. On or about July 7, 10, 11, and 14, 2006, Attorney Grievance Commission (here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>inafter referred to as the Commission) investigator Michael Peregoy attempted to contact respondent by telephone to arrange an interview. The respondent did not respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters until July 24, 2006. The July 24, 2006 response included 31 pages meticulously addressing every issue raised in the Mathis complaint and attached thereto all of the supporting documentation surrounding his representation of Mr. Mathis.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">I. <em>Trust Account Over Draft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">After reviewing all the evidence, considering argument of counsel and making the above referenced factual findings, this Court finds that Bar Counsel/the Commission has not met its burden by clear and convincing evidence of proving that the respondent has violated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-7\">Rule 1.15 Safekeeping Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-8\">Rule 8.1 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">Rule 8.4 Misconduct</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Although, the respondent should be counseled on the management of a trust account, at no time were client funds ever involved in any transaction concerning this account. The Commission further alleges that a violation of Rule 8.1 occurred. The respondent did not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information. While the respondent may not have responded as promptly as requested, the rules do not proscribe a time limit in which to respond. Respondent, nonetheless, responded thoroughly and openly. There is simply no evidence to support a violation of Rule 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">II. <em>Jerry J. Mathis Representation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">The Commission has alleged a violation of Rule 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.2, 3.4, 8.1 and 8.4. After reviewing all the evidence, considering argument of counsel and making the above referenced factual findings, this Court finds that the Commission has not met its burden by clear and convincing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>evidence of proving that the alleged violations have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">The respondent actively engaged in the representation of Mr. Mathis even before a retainer agreement was signed and before any form of payment was rendered. Once the respondent was notified by Mr. Mathis that Mr. Hargrove had sued him and a motion for order of default was pending, the respondent immediately filed the appropriate pleadings. While Mr. Mathis may not have been satisfied with the representation provided by the respondent, that dissatisfaction does not equate to a violation of the rules of professional conduct. Bar Counsel\u2019s continued inquiry into this complaint may have been prompted by the perceived lack of response by the respondent, but again the rules do not proscribe a time limit in which to respond and the respondent provided a thorough response to Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry in his July 24, 2006 letter as referenced above. Furthermore, the Commission has failed to produce evidence supporting its allegations by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent violated the above stated rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Bar Counsel excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to find violations of Rule 1.15, Rule 8.1, and Rule 16-607. Respondent did not file exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law, nor did respondent file a response to Bar Counsel\u2019s exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">This Court has original and complete jurisdiction in attorney discipline proceedings. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kreamer, </em>404 Md. 282, 291, 946 A.2d 500, 505 (2008) <em>(\u201cKreamer II </em>\u201d). We generally accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous but review conclusions of law <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 292, 946 A.2d at 505. The burden is on Bar Counsel to establish the allegations by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>We give due regard to the trial judge\u2019s finding on credibility, as the trial judge is in the best position to assess the witnesses credibility. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 402-03, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The ultimate determination as to an attorney\u2019s alleged misconduct, however, is reserved for this Court. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Garfield, </em>369 Md. 85, 97, 797 A.2d 757, 764 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Bar Counsel excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to find that respondent violated Rule 1.15. The hearing judge reasoned that the Rule was not violated because \u201cat no time were client funds ever involved in any transaction concerning this account.\u201d Rule 1.15(b) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer may deposit the lawyer\u2019s own funds in a client trust account for the sole purpose of paying bank service charges on that account, but only in an amount necessary for the purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">At the hearing, Bar Counsel introduced a letter respondent sent to Bar Counsel. A portion of the letter reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ8\">\u201cI am a sole practitioner. After reviewing the rules governing the use of trust accounts, let me state that my use of the account violated the rules. Although I did not know the full extent of the requirements under the rule, I should have known. I mistakenly believed (1) that my fee for legal services could be retained in the account after disbursement of client proceeds; (2) that the account could be used for personal use as long as client funds were no longer in the account; and (3) that a debit card could be used to access and manage the account. After a more in-depth review of the rules and after conferring with other attorneys, I now realize that this was not correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">We need not spend much time on this issue because respondent recognizes that he violated the Rule by depositing personal funds into the trust account in excess of the amount needed to cover bank charges, and, therefore, he was at least technically in violation of the Rule. He conceded as much at oral argument before this Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>attorney trust account to pay an office phone bill and his subsequent deposit to cover the overdraft violated Rule 1.15, notwithstanding the hearing judge\u2019s finding that there was no commingling with or misuse of client funds. We grant Bar Counsel\u2019s exception and hold that respondent violated Rule 1.15.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Bar Counsel excepts also to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to find a violation of Maryland Rule 16-607, which provides that \u201c[a]n attorney or law firm may deposit in an attorney trust account only those funds required to be deposited in that account by Rule 16-604 or permitted to be so deposited by section b. of this Rule.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The hearing judge made no findings with respect to Rule 16-607. The exception to the Rule set out in section b. is inapplicable; there is no question that respondent deposited personal funds into the trust account in excess of permissible amounts necessary to maintain the ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>count and that the account was intended to be used to disburse personal and business related expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Respondent\u2019s counsel represented at oral argument that respondent had opened the trust account to deposit monies from the settlement of one wrongful death case and that he made a mistake of leaving his fee in the account, not knowing that he should have withdrawn it promptly. He no longer used the account as a client trust account and began to pay bills and personal expenses from the account, maintaining the account in the event that he would have another personal injury case.</p>\n<p id=\"Av5\">This Court has made clear that a trust account may not be used for personal purposes, even if client funds are not in the account. An attorney violates the Rule if a trust account, still denominated as a trust account, is used for personal matters, even if the attorney no longer intends to use it for trust purposes. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Webster, </em>348 Md. 662, 677, 705 A.2d 1135, 1142 (1998). We stated in <em>Webster </em>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiF\">\u201cWe agree with the Supreme Court of California that when an account is designated an attorney trust account, inquiry into the source of the funds within the account is irrelevant. Use of the trust account for personal purposes while still designated a trust account, even if it was no longer intended that the account be used for trust purposes, is prohibited. It makes no difference whether client funds are deposited in the account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-11\">The purpose of the anti-commingling rules is to protect client funds from the claims of creditors of the attorney. Using an account designated an attorney trust account, when it no longer actually serves as such, constitutes a holding out to the public that the monies contained therein are not subject to attachment and improperly suggests that the monies are beyond the reach of creditors of the attorney. In this case, when Respondent put his personal funds into an account entitled \u2018escrow account\u2019 he improperly represented to his creditors that those funds were being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>held for a third party. An attorney may not avoid responsibility for misuse of a trust account, even if such misuse was inadvertent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 677-78, 705 A.2d at 1142-43 (internal citations omitted). Respondent\u2019s use of the attorney trust account violated Rule 16-607, even if no client funds were in the account. The account, designated as an attorney trust account, constituted a holding out to the world that the monies contained in the account were not subject to attachment and were beyond the reach of any creditors. Accordingly, we grant Bar Counsel\u2019s exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Bar Counsel excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s failure to find a violation of Rule 8.1 for failing to respond to Bar Counsel. The relevant portion of Rule 8.1(b) states that a lawyer shall not, \u201cknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority.\u201d In finding that respondent did not knowingly violate Rule 8.1, the hearing judge concluded, \u201c[wjhile the respondent may not have responded as promptly as requested, the rules do not proscribe a time limit in which to respond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Bar Counsel argues that Rule 8.1 was violated. Respondent received letters from Bar Counsel sent on January 10, 2006, February 21, 2006, March 16, 2006, and April 4, 2006. Bar Counsel received a partial reply on or about April 11, 2006, after which Bar Counsel sent two more letters before receiving a full response. Bar Counsel also sent letters on May 2 and May 19, 2006, requesting information about a second matter. Respondent did not respond until July 24, 2006. Additionally, Bar Counsel made at least four attempts to reach respondent by telephone, each time leaving a message that went unreturned. Respondent argues that his \u201ctardiness\u201d in responding to Bar Counsel was precipitated by a \u201cdepressive [mental] state\u201d which affected his \u201cresponsiveness to obligations, duties and requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">Bar Counsel\u2019s letters to respondent were lawful demands for information. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 252, 760 A.2d 1108, 1118 (2000) (\u201cRespondent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>argument that the letters of Bar Counsel were merely requests to respond, as opposed to demands, is plainly frivolous.\u201d). The Commission\u2019s authority to make lawful demands for information carries with it the authority to demand that attorneys furnish Bar Counsel with the requested information timely and within a reasonable period of time. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance v. Sapero, </em>400 Md. 461, 486, 929 A.2d 483, 498 (2007) (holding that an attorney violates Rule 8.1(b) when he fails to make a timely and orderly reply even though the failure was because of disorganization in his record keeping practices).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Kreamer, </em>387 Md. 503, 530, 876 A.2d 79, 95 (2005) <em>(\u201cKreamer </em>/\u201d), we addressed an attorney\u2019s failure to respond to Bar Counsel. Bar Counsel\u2019s letter, sent on August 28, 2003, to Ms. Kreamer, citing Rule 16\u2014731(d) and Rule 8.1, noted concern about completing the investigation within the time established and requested a written response within ten days. Bar Counsel\u2019s September 8 letter referenced the first letter, gave Ms. Kreamer seven days to reply, and reminded Ms. Kreamer of Rule 8.1. Bar Counsel\u2019s October 15 letter granted Ms. Kreamer\u2019s oral request for an extension and noted that her response was expected by October 29, 2003. Kreamer made no written response to three letters from the Commission. We held that Ms. Kreamer violated Rule 8.1, stating that \u201cMs. Kreamer\u2019s eventual response to the Commission, while certainly much better than no response at all, does not excuse her repeated failures to respond in writing, as requested by the Commission several times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 876 A.2d at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Similarly, in <em>Fezell </em>we noted that, \u201c[t]his Court has a long history of holding that an attorney violates Rule 8.1(b) by failing to respond to letters from disciplinary authorities requesting information.\u201d <em>Fezell, </em>361 Md. at 249, 760 A.2d at 1116. We found that the respondent violated Rule 8.1 when he failed to respond to five letters from Bar Counsel, although he did ultimately respond by phone, holding that, \u201c[e]ven viewing the phone call in the light most favorable to respondent, his belated cooperation with Bar Counsel does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>excuse respondent\u2019s failure to respond to the previous five letters sent by Bar Counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253, 760 A.2d at 1118. We noted that, \u201c[t]he practice of law carries with it special responsibilities of self-regulation, and attorney cooperation with disciplinary authorities is of the utmost importance to the success of the process and the integrity of the profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 760 A.2d at 1119. In the instant case, that Bar Counsel\u2019s efforts led ultimately to a response cannot wholly excuse respondent\u2019s repeated failures to reply timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The hearing judge found that Bar Counsel had sent four letters to respondent before respondent replied in an incomplete fashion nearly three months after Bar Counsel\u2019s initial letter. While respondent may have ultimately \u201cresponded thoroughly and openly,\u201d an untimely response does not excuse the failure to timely respond. Bar Counsel\u2019s persistence will not absolve an attorney of the responsibility to make a reasonably prompt reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In addition to his argument that his ultimately thorough response satisfied Rule 8.1, respondent argues that he did not <em>knowingly </em>fail to respond to Bar Counsel. He argues that respondent\u2019s inaction was brought about by his depressed state, which in turn was brought about by his health issues and other circumstances. The hearing judge, in her memorandum opinion, recited the testimony of the two physicians, but failed to make any findings of fact with respect to the alleged depression from which respondent may have been suffering, and more importantly, did not make any findings as to whether respondent\u2019s depression was the cause of his failure to respond to Bar Counsel in a timely fashion. It is clear, however, that in finding that Bar Counsel failed to establish a violation of Rule 8.1, the hearing judge was at least <em>influenced </em>by respondent\u2019s mental state at the time of the investigation into his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Ordinarily, we would remand this matter to the hearing judge to make findings of fact as to respondent\u2019s claim that his failure to timely respond was not a knowing failure. We need not do so in this case because respondent has violated Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>1.15 and 16-607 and, given the circumstances, the sanction would be no different even if Rule 8.1 had been violated. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Lanocha, </em>392 Md. 234, 241, 896 A.2d 996, 1001 (2006). Given the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions, respondent\u2019s depressed mental state, while perhaps not rising to the level of a psychiatric disorder, is relevant to the proper sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Having found that respondent violated Rule 1.15 and 16-607, we turn now to the sanction. We are mindful that our aim is to protect the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession rather than to punish the attorney. <em>Kreamer II, </em>404 Md. at 348, 946 A.2d at 539. We aim also to deter other lawyers from violating the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>Id. </em>The public is best protected when sanctions are imposed commensurate with the nature and the gravity of the misconduct and the intent with which it was committed. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 223, 892 A.2d 533, 541 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The severity of the sanction depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case, taking account of any particular aggravating or mitigating factors. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm. v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 484, 671 A.2d 463, 480 (1996). In determining the appropriate sanction, we have often looked to the American Bar Association\u2019s <em>Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions, </em>reprinted in Lawyers\u2019 Manual on Professional Conduct (2003) <em>{ABA Standards). Id. </em>at 488, 671 A.2d at 483. These standards create an organizational framework that calls for a consideration of four questions: (1) What is the nature of the ethical duty violated?; (2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?; (3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?; and (4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating circumstances? <em>See ABA Standards, </em>Standard 3.0, at 17. Also relevant are the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>\u201cAbsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 488-89, 671 A.2d at 483 (quoting <em>ABA Standards, </em>Standard 9.32, at 41-42).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Bar Counsel recommends a suspension from the practice of law for at least 60 days. In light of the totality of the circumstances, we find that a reprimand is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">There are several mitigating factors in this case. Bar Counsel made clear that there was no allegation in this case of misappropriation or commingling of client funds. Respondent\u2019s misuse of the attorney trust account occurred at a time when he was intending to close his practice. Although respondent failed to make timely responses to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information, the hearing judge found that he ultimately \u201cresponded thoroughly and openly\u201d and that he was mentally depressed and was not functioning normally. Additionally, the absence of a selfish or dishonest motive is a mitigator. Respondent has no prior disciplinary record, and his conduct neither was dishonest nor in any way resulted in actual harm to any client. Accordingly, we impose a reprimand as the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED.
