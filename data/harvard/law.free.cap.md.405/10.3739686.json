ELDRIDGE, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AJ\">(Retired, Specially Assigned).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">In this criminal case, we granted the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to re-examine the Maryland common law principle that inconsistent jury verdicts are normally permissible in criminal jury trials. We also granted the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari which presented the issue of whether Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7 5-905 of the Criminal Law Article, authorizes the enhancement of sentences for multiple counts arising from the same criminal transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">The State\u2019s evidence at the trial can be summarized briefly as follows. On November 20, 2002, Officer Richard Pollock and Sergeant William Harris, of the Baltimore City Police Department, were conducting surveillance at an apartment complex in Baltimore City located on Winchester Street. Known to the police officers as an area where drugs are \u201ccommonly sold,\u201d Officer Pollock and Sergeant Harris initially observed the apartment complex from their unmarked police car with binoculars. During this time, they witnessed several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>people standing in a breezeway. Among the group in the breezeway were the defendant Price and Damien Tucker. The police officers saw about fifteen people, at different times, drive into the parking lot of the apartment complex and then approach the group in the breezeway. Upon meeting the group, the police officers witnessed Tucker receive cash and then each visitor, in turn, was handed a small object. Although Price was one of the individuals standing in the breezeway, the police officers did not see Price receive money, distribute anything, or engage in conduct that appeared to be drug dealing. Officer Pollock later testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">\u201c[i]n [the Winchester Apartment] area, there\u2019s a constant flow sometimes where there may be four or five people and then other people come up and they\u2019re communicating and talking with others even while sales are going on, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re involved in the actual sales. They\u2019re just in the area as it is going on, as was the case that I thought with [Price].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">After observing a series of transactions, Officer Pollock and Sergeant Harris called for back up. Once additional police officers arrived, the officers exited their vehicle and approached the group in the breezeway. Seeing the officers approaching, everyone started to run. Officer Pollock followed Price and Tucker upstairs, and Tucker dropped a bag containing suspected controlled dangerous substances. Price and Tucker ran up to a third floor apartment, entered, and locked the door. Officer Pollock followed them, and waited outside the apartment until a backup officer arrived with a key to the apartment from the rental office. When the officers entered the apartment, they saw three men. The three men ran to a back room, where one of them jumped out of a window and ran. One officer apprehended Tucker, and Officer Pollock apprehended Price who threw a bag containing a handgun and U.S. currency to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Price was charged in 18 counts with various drug offenses and three firearms offenses. Three of the substantive drug charges fell into the category of a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as defined in Maryland Code (2002), \u00a7 5-621 of the Criminal Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Article. Those offenses were possession of heroin with intent to distribute it, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute it. Nine of the counts charged that Price engaged in conspiracies with Tucker to distribute, or to possess with intent to distribute, or to possess heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. The three firearms offenses charged were (1) possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, under sufficient circumstances to constitute a nexus to the drug trafficking crime, in violation of \u00a7 5\u2014621(b)(1) of the Criminal Law Article,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) possessing a regulated firearm having been convicted of a prior disqualifying felony, and (3) unlawfully carrying or transporting a handgun. The three firearms charges were based on the same incident of Price throwing to the ground a bag containing a handgun. Finally, Price was charged in three counts with simple possession of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge told the jury that Price could only be convicted of possession of a firearm, during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, under circumstances constituting a nexus to drug trafficking, if Price was also convicted of one of the drug trafficking crimes. The judge stated, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the defendants are charged with the crime of possessing a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking crimes. Possession with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine and marijuana, and conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute heroin, cocaine and marijuana are drug trafficking crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">\u201cYou may not consider the crime of possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime unless you found the defendant guilty of possession with the intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>distribute heroin, cocaine and/or marijuana, conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine and/or marijuana, or conspiracy to possess with the intent of distributing heroin, cocaine and/or marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">\u201cIf your verdict on those charges is not guilty you must find the defendant not guilty of possession of a firearm in the commission of a drug trafficking crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The jury acquitted Price of all drug trafficking charges. Thus, Price was found not guilty of possession with intent to distribute heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. Moreover, Price was found not guilty on all nine conspiracy counts. In addition, the jury acquitted Price on the two firearms counts charging possession of a regulated firearm having been convicted of a prior felony, and unlawfully carrying or transporting a handgun. Despite the trial judge\u2019s instructions and the acquittals, the jury found Price guilty of possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, under circumstances constituting a nexus to the drug trafficking crime. In addition, the jury convicted Price of simple possession of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Price\u2019s attorney moved to strike the guilty verdict on the count charging possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, under \u00a7 5\u2014621(b)(1) of the Criminal Law Article, on the ground that it was inconsistent with the acquittals. More specifically, defense counsel argued that commission of a drug trafficking crime is an \u201cessential element\u201d of the firearms offense under \u00a7 5\u2014621(b)(1) of the Criminal Law Article, and that the jury had determined that Price did not commit a drug trafficking crime. The prosecuting attorney agreed that the guilty verdict on the \u00a7 5-621(b)(1) firearms count was inconsistent with the acquittals on the drug trafficking counts, but he argued that such inconsistent verdicts were permissible. After receiving legal memoranda from the parties, the trial judge denied the motion to strike on the ground that the cases in this Court, as well as some federal cases, have held that inconsistent verdicts are allowable. The trial judge, at the sentencing hearing, sentenced Price to twelve years imprisonment for the firearms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>conviction under \u00a7 5-621 (b)(1), consecutive to any other sentence, with the first five years to run without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 5-601 of the Criminal Law Article, Price\u2019s convictions for possession of heroin and cocaine each carried a maximum of four years imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $25,000 or both.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His possession of marijuana conviction subjected Price to a maximum sentence of one year in prison or a fine not exceeding $1000, or both. The trial court judge sentenced Price to the maximum imprisonment penalty for each of his possession convictions, and then doubled each sentence under the apparent authority of \u00a7 5-905 of the Criminal Law Article. Section 5-905(a) states that \u201c[a] person convicted of a subsequent crime under this title is subject to ... a term of imprisonment twice that otherwise authorized. ...\u201d Price had a previous conviction in November 2002 for possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. As a result, Price was sentenced in this case to eight years imprisonment for possession of heroin, a consecutive eight years for possession of cocaine, and two years concurrent for the possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Price appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Circuit Court erred when it refused to strike the conviction for possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime because the conviction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>inconsistent with the acquittals on all counts charging drug trafficking crimes. In addition, Price argued that the trial court erred by doubling his prison sentences for all three of his drug possession convictions. Price contended that the trial judge misconstrued \u00a7 5-905 of the Criminal Law Article, and that doubling of sentences under that section is limited to \u201cone count only.\u201d Section 5-905 provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">\u201c \u00a7 5-905. Repeat offenders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A person convicted of a subsequent crime under this title is subject to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">(1) a term of imprisonment twice that otherwise authorized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">(2) twice the fine otherwise authorized; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">(3) both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">(b) <em>Rule of </em>interpretation.\u2014For purposes of this section, a crime is considered a subsequent crime, if, before the conviction for the crime, the offender has ever been convicted of a crime under this title or under any law of the United States or of this or another state relating to other controlled dangerous substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">(d) <em>Sentencing in conjunction with other sentences.\u2014A </em>sentence on a single count under this section may be imposed in conjunction with other sentences under this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">In a reported opinion, <em>Price v. State, </em>172 Md.App. 363, 388, 915 A.2d 432, 447 (2007), the Court of Special Appeals held that \u201cinconsistent verdicts in a jury trial are generally tolerated under Maryland law.\u201d Accordingly, the intermediate appellate court upheld the guilty verdict on the firearms count. The Court of Special Appeals agreed however, with Price\u2019s contention that his sentences for the drug possession convictions were improperly doubled. The appellate court reasoned that the language in \u00a7 5-905 \u201cis ambiguous in that it does not make clear whether an enhanced penalty can be imposed on each and every count arising out of a single course of conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>... or whether an enhanced penalty can only be imposed on one count of a multi-count charging document based on a single course of conduct.\u201d <em>Price v. State, supra, </em>172 Md.App. at 387-388, 915 A.2d at 446. Based on this ambiguity, the appellate court applied the rule of lenity, holding that the enhanced penalty can be imposed on just one count. The Court of Special Appeals upheld the four guilty verdicts but vacated all of the sentences and remanded the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">As earlier indicated, Price filed a petition for a writ of certiorari regarding the inconsistent verdict question, and the State simultaneously filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with respect to the interpretation and application of \u00a7 5-905\u2019s sentence enhancement provisions. This Court granted both petitions, <em>Price v. State, </em>399 Md. 33, 922 A.2d 573 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">We shall first address the inconsistent verdict issue. In Maryland, the principles concerning inconsistent verdicts have judicially developed over time as part of this State\u2019s common law. Unlike several other jurisdictions, there are no Maryland statutes or promulgated procedural rules which relate to inconsistent verdicts generally or relate to specific types of inconsistent verdicts. Moreover, the Maryland common law principles governing inconsistent verdicts are themselves confusing and somewhat inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u201cIt has been the position of this Court that inconsistent verdicts injury trials are permissible in criminal cases.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>397 Md. 172, 189, 916 A.2d 294, 305 (2007). <em>See, e.g., Wright v. State, </em>307 Md. 552, 576, 515 A.2d 1157, 1169 (1986) (\u201c[inconsistent verdicts by a jury are normally tolerated\u201d); <em>Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 54, 512 A.2d 358, 362 (1986) (\u201c[Cjonvictions based on inconsistent jury verdicts are tolerated\u201d); <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 601, 479 A.2d 1344, 1352-1353 (1984) (Trial court\u2019s denial of relief \u201cwas consonant with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>this Court\u2019s ... holdings that inconsistent verdicts can stand\u201d); <em>Ford v. State, </em>274 Md. 546, 337 A.2d 81 (1975) (A divided Court (4-2) upheld inconsistent verdicts in a criminal case where the defendant was convicted of using a handgun in the commission of a felony but was acquitted of committing the very same felony). The reasons usually given for the toleration of inconsistent verdicts are that the jury has an historic or a singular role in our justice system and \u201c \u2018that inconsistencies may be the product of lenity, mistake, or a compromise to reach unanimity,\u2019 \u201d <em>Galloway v. State, </em>371 Md. 379, 408, 809 A.2d 653, 671 (2002). <em>See also Shell v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 54, 512 A.2d at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">While toleration of inconsistent verdicts has sometimes been called the \u201cnormal\u201d rule, this Court from time to time has recognized various limitations or exceptions to the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Thus, as Judge Greene for the Court recently pointed out in <em>State v. Williams, supra, </em>397 Md. at 189-190, 916 A.2d at 305, quoting in part from <em>State v. Anderson, 320 </em>Md. 17, 29, 575 A.2d 1227, 1233 (1990), \u201cit is ... well settled in Maryland \u2018that inconsistent verdicts of guilty and not guilty, by a trial judge at a nonjury trial, are not ordinarily permitted.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also, e.g., Wright v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 576, 515 A.2d at 1169 (\u201cLljnconsistent verdicts by the court are not ordinarily permitted as a matter of Maryland common law\u201d); <em>Shell v. State, supra, 307 </em>Md. at 55, 512 A.2d at 363 (\u201cThe <em>Ford </em>holding [tolerating inconsistent jury verdicts] does not justify inconsistent verdicts from the trial judge\u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>238 Md. 528, 541-543, 209 A.2d 765, 771-772 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Moreover, in a criminal trial where, by agreement of the parties, some counts are submitted to the jury and some counts are submitted to the trial judge, and where the evidence underlying the counts is identical, the trial judge is precluded from rendering guilty verdicts on the counts submitted to the judge if such verdicts would be inconsistent with not guilty verdicts rendered by the jury. <em>See Galloway v. State, supra, </em>371 Md. at 401, 809 A.2d at 667, where Judge Cathell for the Court emphasized that \u201cthe reasons why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>inconsistent jury verdicts are tolerated simply do not apply when a judge is involved in rendering one of the inconsistent verdicts.\u201d <em>See also Wright v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 576, 515 A.2d at 1169, involving a different type of inconsistency between a court\u2019s verdict and the jury\u2019s verdict, and the court\u2019s verdict prevailed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Even with regard to inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal cases, Maryland cases have from time to time narrowed the area of toleration. Thus, inconsistent jury verdicts of guilty have long been held to be invalid. <em>See, e.g., Shell v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 55, 512 A.2d at 362 (\u201c[N]ot all inconsistent verdicts are permitted to stand ... [, such as] \u2018inconsistent verdicts of guilty under different counts of the same indictment,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Johnson v. State, supra, </em>238 Md. at 541, 209 A.2d at 771); <em>Mack v. State, supra, </em>300 Md. at 601, 479 A.2d at 1353 (Inconsistent jury \u201cfinding[s] of guilt on two inconsistent counts [are] invalid\u201d); <em>Fletcher v. State, </em>231 Md. 190, 189 A.2d 641 (1963); <em>Leet v. State, </em>203 Md. 285, 293, 100 A.2d 789, 793 (1953) (\u201c[I]t is true that a [jury] finding of <em>guilt </em>on two inconsistent counts will be declared invalid in Maryland\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">In addition, the Court of Special Appeals has held that inconsistent jury verdicts in a criminal case will not be allowed where the trial judge failed to give an instruction on the requirement of consistent verdicts, even though there had been no request for such instruction and the defendant had not objected to the failure. <em>Stuckey v. State, </em>141 Md.App. 143, 157 n. 3, 784 A.2d 652, 660 n. 3 (2001), and cases there cited. Another exception to the principle allowing inconsistent jury verdicts was recognized in <em>Hoffert v. State, </em>319 Md. 377, 572 A.2d 536 (1990).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>A significant limitation upon the toleration of inconsistent jury verdicts is that the trial court, in its discretion, need not accept inconsistent verdicts and may grant relief. In <em>Mack v. State, supra, </em>300 Md. at 599-600, 479 A.2d at 1352, this Court made it clear \u201cthat it is the duty of a jury to decide a criminal case according to established rules of law,\u201d that \u201cthe trial court has the power to set aside the verdict\u201d when the jury misapplies the law, that inconsistent jury verdicts are contrary to the law and \u201ccontrary to the trial court\u2019s instructions,\u201d and that the granting of relief \u201cis within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d No criteria, however, have been set forth in this Court\u2019s opinions to guide trial courts in deciding whether or not inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal cases should be accepted by trial judges. Typically, as in the present case, the reason given by trial judges for accepting inconsistent jury verdicts is that they are permitted under the law. This reason furnishes no standard for a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion as to whether inconsistent jury verdicts should or should not stand. Under this reasoning, all inconsistent jury verdicts would stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The most important and most recent Maryland exception to the toleration of inconsistent jury verdicts is jury inconsistency in civil actions. In <em>Southern Management v. Taha, </em>378 Md. 461, 467, 836 A.2d 627, 630 (2003), a civil case in which the jury rendered inconsistent verdicts, this Court for the first time held \u201cthat such irreconcilably inconsistent jury verdicts cannot stand____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Some of the background underlying the <em>Taha </em>holding is noteworthy. About one year prior to the <em>Taha </em>decision, in <em>Galloway v. State, supra, </em>371 Md. 379, 809 A.2d 653, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>criminal case involving inconsistent verdicts by both the jury and the trial judge, this Court pointed out that verdicts by the trial judge, which were inconsistent with verdicts by the jury, are not allowed in civil cases. Judge Cathell for the Court then stated (371 Md. at 400, 809 A.2d at 666):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">\u201cWe see no reason why the consistency requirements in criminal cases should be less stringent than the standards we have applied in civil cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The <em>Galloway </em>opinion concluded as follows (371 Md. at 417, 809 A.2d at 676):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u00ed \u201cMoreover, to accept what occurred here would be to create different, harsher, standards in criminal cases than in civil cases. We are unwilling to afford less protection to the jury trial rights of a criminal defendant, whose very liberty, or even his or her life, is at stake, than to a civil litigant, where, generally, it is money that is at stake.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">It was against this background that the Court in <em>Taha </em>held invalid the inconsistent jury verdicts in a civil action. Moreover, <em>Taha </em>recognized the similarity between inconsistent verdicts in criminal jury trials and inconsistent verdicts in civil jury trials. Judge Battaglia for the Court in <em>Taha </em>quoted the reasons' given in an earlier criminal case for tolerating inconsistent jury verdicts <em>(Shell v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 54, 512 A.2d at 362), and then stated <em>(Taha, </em>378 Md. at 487, 836 A.2d at 642):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">\u201c[t]he jury interplay involved in rendering a civil verdict involves the same potential for jury compromises in order to reach unanimity and mistakes as the process in criminal jury verdicts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Consequently, as to the difference between the <em>Taha </em>holding in civil cases and the earlier holdings in criminal cases, the <em>Taha </em>opinion expressly left the question open, saying (378 Md. at 488 n. 8, 836 A.2d at 642 n. 8):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">\u201cWe leave for another day the issue of whether this Court should reconsider its decision in criminal matters in which inconsistent verdicts have been rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Today is the \u201c[]other day\u201d for this Court to reconsider the matter of inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">As earlier mentioned, the Maryland principles governing inconsistent verdicts are neither reflected in statutes nor in the Rules promulgated by this Court. Instead, those principles have, by case law, developed from time to time as part of Maryland common law. Nevertheless, \u201c[bjecause of the inherent dynamism of the common law, we have consistently held that it is subject to judicial modification in light of [new] circumstances,\u201d <em>Ireland v. State, </em>310 Md. 328, 331, 529 A.2d 365, 366 (1987). \u201c[A]s often pointed out, this Court has authority under the Maryland Constitution to change the common law.\u201d <em>Bowden v. Caldor, </em>350 Md. 4, 27, 710 A.2d 267, 278 (1998). <em>See also, e.g., Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Clark, </em>404 Md. 13, 944 A.2d 1122 (2008) (This \u201cCourt certainly has the authority to change the common law\u201d); <em>Owens v. State, </em>399 Md. 388, 413, 924 A.2d 1072, 1086 (2007) (\u201c \u2018The common law rule may, within constitutional constraints, be changed or modified by ... judicial decision where it is found to be a vestige of the past, no longer suitable to [present] circumstances,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Jones v. State, </em>303 Md. 323, 337 n. 10, 493 A.2d 1062, 1069 n. 10 (1985)); <em>Fox v. Wills, </em>390 Md. 620, 635, 890 A.2d 726, 735 (2006); <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 614, 861 A.2d 78, 86-87 (2004); <em>Baltimore Sun v. Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 653, 662, 755 A.2d 1130, 1135 (2000); <em>Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 469-470, 601 A.2d 633, 657-658 (1992), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The numerous exceptions to the principle tolerating inconsistent verdicts, and, more importantly, the recent opinions in <em>Southern Management v. Taha, supra, </em>378 Md. 461, 836 A.2d 627, and <em>Galloway v. State, supra, </em>371 Md. 379, 809 A.2d 653, are circumstances which fully warrant a prospective change in the common law applicable to inconsistent verdicts. There is no longer any justification for the one remaining situation where inconsistent verdicts are tolerated, namely certain types of inconsistent verdicts by a jury in a criminal trial. Contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>ued acceptance of inconsistent verdicts, in that one situation, is simply not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">This Court has consistently stated that inconsistent jury verdicts are \u201ccontrary to law,\u201d and that the trial court should instruct the jury that it cannot return inconsistent verdicts. <em>Galloway v. State, supra, </em>371 Md. at 407-408, 809 A.2d at 671; <em>Shell v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 54, 512 A.2d at 362; <em>Mack v. State, supra, </em>300 Md. at 594-600, 479 A.2d at 1349-1352. We have taken the position that \u201cthe possibility of inconsistent verdicts\u201d should be \u201cminimize[d]\u201d in \u201corder to avoid, this deleterious result,\u201d and that inconsistent verdicts violate \u201cthe duty of the jury to decide a criminal case according to established rules of law,\u201d <em>Mack, </em>300 Md. at 595, 597, 599, 479 A.2d at 1350-1351. Nonetheless, some inconsistent jury verdicts were tolerated because of the historic role of the jury in our justice system and because \u201cinconsistencies may be the product of lenity, mistake or a compromise to reach unanimity.\u201d <em>Shell v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. at 54, 512 A.2d at 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The reasons given in the past for tolerating inconsistent jury verdicts, if valid, would be equally applicable to civil cases and criminal cases. The jury has an historic and unique role in civil actions at law just as it has in criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Trial by jury, both in civil and criminal trials, originated in ancient Greece. <em>See </em>Bloomstein, <em>Verdict, The Jury System, </em>pp. 3-4 (1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In England, trial by jury began soon after the Norman conquest, and was used primarily in civil actions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>during the reign of Henry II. Bloomstein, <em>supra, </em>at 16-17.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Vidmar <em>&amp; </em>Hans, <em>American Juries, </em>p. 24 (2007) (The authors, referring to the report of an English jury trial in 1221, state: \u201cWhen the Church forbade trial by ordeal, the jury seemed a logical successor for both criminal <em>and civil disputes. </em>The idea developed slowly and unevenly throughout England\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">One of the earliest cases in the Maryland Reports involved the right to a jury trial in a civil action of ejectment. <em>Abington v. Lowry, </em>1 H. &amp; McH. 8 (1662). The right to a jury trial in civil cases is dealt with in six separate provisions of the Maryland Constitution. <em>See </em>Articles 5 and 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and Article III, \u00a7\u00a7 40, 40A, 40B, and 40C, of the Constitution. <em>See also Bryan v. State Roads, </em>356 Md. 4, 10-15, 736 A.2d 1057, 1060-1063 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In sum, a jury in a civil action at law has an historic and singular role in our system of justice which is similar to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>historic and singular role of a jury in a criminal case. Furthermore, as pointed out by the Court in <em>Southern Management v. Taha, </em>supra, 378 Md. at 487, 836 A.2d at 642, an inconsistent jury verdict in a civil case may be the product of lenity, mistake or a compromise to reach unanimity, to the same extent as an inconsistent jury verdict in a criminal case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In fact, a jury\u2019s reliance on lenity in a criminal case relates only to the defendant; in a civil case, any party may be the beneficiary of lenity. Despite the acknowledgment that the reasons for tolerating inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal cases are also applicable to inconsistent jury verdicts in civil cases, the Court in <em>Taha </em>held that inconsistent jury verdicts in civil cases would not be allowed. If the traditional reasons for tolerating inconsistent jury verdicts are not sufficient in civil cases, those reasons are clearly not sufficient in criminal cases.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Moreover, in criminal jury trials, our system accords greater procedural protections for the defendant than we give to either side in civil jury trials. Consequently, if there is to be a difference, there should be less toleration of inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal cases than in civil cases. As previously pointed out, this Court in <em>Galloway v. State, supra, </em>371 Md. at 400, 417, 809 A.2d at 666, 676, emphasized that \u201cthe consistency requirements in criminal cases\u201d should not \u201cbe less stringent than the standards we have applied in civil cases,\u201d and that we are \u201cunwilling to afford less protection to the jury trial rights of a criminal defendant, whose very liberty, or even his or her life, is at stake, than to a civil litigant, where, generally, it is money that is at stake.\u201d To uphold, in the present case, the inconsistent jury verdict of guilty on the count charging possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime, would be to repudiate the principles recently set forth in our <em>Galloway </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">This Court has sometimes observed that the majority of jurisdictions allow inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal cases. <em>See, e.g., Shell v. State, </em>307 Md. 46, 54, 512 A.2d 358, 362 (1986); <em>Ford v. State, </em>274 Md. 546, 553, 337 A.2d 81, 85-86 (1975). It is, however, very doubtful that a majority of jurisdictions, by case law, recognize all of the exceptions and limitations to the allowance of inconsistent verdicts which are reflected in Maryland appellate opinions. For example, many jurisdictions allowing inconsistent verdicts in criminal jury trials also, contrary to Maryland cases, allow inconsistent verdicts in criminal nonjury trials.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A distinction between civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>and criminal cases, with regard to inconsistent verdicts, may in some jurisdictions be based upon statutes or rules.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the holding in <em>Mack v. State, supra, </em>300 Md. at 599-600, 479 A.2d at 1352, apparently leaving the acceptance or rejection of inconsistent jury verdicts in the unbridled discretion of the trial judge, seems to be unique.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Some State Supreme Courts have refused to allow inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal cases. The reasoning of the Supreme Court of Alaska in <em>DeSacia v. State, </em>469 P.2d 369 (Alaska 1970), is persuasive. The court explained that there is (469 P.2d at 377)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">\u201cno basis to assume ... that inconsistent verdicts are the product of a jury\u2019s disposition toward treating the accused leniently; nor can we see a basis for assuming that, in allowing inconsistent jury verdicts in criminal trials to stand, we run only \u2018the risk that an occasional conviction may have been the result of compromise.\u2019 The truth is simply that we do not know, nor do we have any way of telling how many inconsistent verdicts are attributable to feelings of leniency, to compromise, or, for that matter, to outright confusion on the part of the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">The Supreme Court of Florida has held that \u201cthe possibility of a wrongful conviction ... outweighs the rationale for allowing [inconsistent] verdicts to stand.\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>959 So.2d 218, 222 (Fla.2007). In addition, the Court of Appeals of New York held that a conviction \u201cwill be reversed ... in those instances where acquittal on one crime as charged to the jury is conclusive as to a necessary element of the other crime, as charged, for which the guilty verdict was rendered.\u201d <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>v. Tucker, </em>55 N.Y.2d 1, 7, 447 N.Y.S.2d 132, 431 N.E.2d 617, 619 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In <em>Southern Management v. Taha, supra, </em>378 Md. at 489, 836 A.2d at 643, we held that striking a jury\u2019s inconsistent verdict of civil liability was \u201cthe only logical and legally sound conclusion.... \u201d This Court has also characterized a jury\u2019s verdict of guilty, which is flatly inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdict of not guilty on another count, as \u201cillogical\u201d and \u201ccontrary to law.\u201d There is no reasonable basis for reversing the inconsistent verdict of \u201cliability\u201d but not reversing the inconsistent verdict of <em>\u201cguilty.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Accordingly, with regard to the instant case, similarly situated cases on direct appeal where the issue was preserved, and verdicts in criminal jury trials rendered after the date of our opinion in this case, inconsistent verdicts shall no longer be allowed. For a discussion and review of the effective date for changes in the common law, <em>see Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, supra, </em>325 Md. at 469-470, 601 A.2d at 657-658.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that, under \u00a7 5-905 of the Criminal Law Article, Price\u2019s enhanced sentences must be vacated. With regard to Price\u2019s drug possession sentences which are subject to enhancement under \u00a7 5-905, only one of them may be doubled under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Section 5-905(a) provides that a \u201cperson convicted of a subsequent crime\u201d is subject to \u201ctwice\u201d the term of imprisonment which is \u201cotherwise authorized,\u201d and \u00a7 5-905(d) states that \u201c[a] sentence on a <em>single count under this section </em>may be imposed in conjunction with other sentences under this title.\u201d (Emphasis added). The State argues that \u201cthe plain language of the statute\u201d permitted the trial court\u2019s doubling of the sentences on all three possession counts. (State\u2019s opening brief at 16). The defendant Price contends that the General Assembly, in subsection (d) of \u00a7 5-905, \u201cchose ... to mandate that only a sentence on a single count could be imposed under \u00a7 5-905(d) in conjunction with other sentences.\u201d (Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>reply brief at 10). Alternatively, the defendant argues that the \u201cCourt of Special Appeals correctly ruled that application of the rule of lenity compelled the conclusion that Mr. Price was subject to a single sentence enhancement under \u00a7 5-905.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The State\u2019s \u201cplain language of the statute\u201d argument focuses on subsection (a) of \u00a7 5-905, as Price was convicted of subsequent drug crimes under three separate counts, with three separate sentences authorized, and with each term of imprisonment arguably subject to being doubled. Nevertheless, the language of subsection (a) does not address multiple crimes charged together and based on the same incident. In addition, the State\u2019s \u201cplain language\u201d argument does not take into account subsection (d) of \u00a7 5-905.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Very often, a statute may be unambiguous in certain contexts but ambiguous in other contexts. <em>See, e.g., BAA v. Acacia, </em>400 Md. 136, 151, 929 A.2d 1, 9-10 (2007); <em>Bank of America v. Stine, </em>379 Md. 76, 85, 839 A.2d 727, 733 (2003) (\u201cAs we have recognized, however, \u2018[a]n ambiguity may ... exist even when the words of the statute are ... clear. That occurs when its application in a given situation is not clear,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Blind Industries v. D.G.S., </em>371 Md. 221, 231, 808 A.2d 782, 788 (2002)). Thus, if Price had been convicted of just one of the possession counts, \u00a7 5-905 would have, unambiguously, authorized the doubling of his sentence under that count. What is not clear is how the enhancement applies under the circumstances of this case. In fact the State, elsewhere in its briefs, seems to recognize this degree of ambiguity, acknowledging that \u201cthe Legislature did not anticipate and explicitly address [the] particular fact pattern\u201d here (State\u2019s opening brief at 33) and that the General Assembly \u201cdid not anticipate, and explicitly address, the argument that Price ... makes\u201d <em>(id. </em>at 40-41; <em>see also id. </em>at 17; State\u2019s reply brief at 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The State principally relies on <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995), and on the enactment in the year 2000 of subsection (d) which was a response to the decisions in <em>Scott v. State, </em>351 Md. 667, 720 A.2d 291 (1998), and <em>Gardner v. State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>344 Md. 642, 689 A.2d 610 (1997). The State\u2019s reliance, however, is misplaced. All three of those cases involved the question of whether the sentences in the cases before the Court could be enhanced by <em>two separate enhancement </em>statutes. In the present case, however, the issue is whether sentences on multiple counts, all based on the same transaction, can each be enhanced by the <em>same enhancement </em>statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">In <em>Whack, </em>the Court interpreted a predecessor to \u00a7 5-905, Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl.Vol.), Article 27 \u00a7 293.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The issue in <em>Whack </em>was whether former \u00a7 293 could be applied along with another enhancement statute, former Article 27, \u00a7 286(c), to increase the sentences on different counts in the same case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court upheld the enhancements under each statute, reasoning that \u201cthe provisions of \u00a7 286(c) and \u00a7 293 each enhance a repeat drug offender\u2019s sentence indifferent ways.\u201d <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. at 682, 659 A.2d at 1355. Permitting the application of two distinct enhancement mechanisms, operating in different ways, is not the same as applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>a single enhancement mechanism to multiple counts. The Court allowed the multiple enhancements in <em>Whack </em>because the different enhancement statutes applied in \u201cdifferent ways.\u201d That is not the situation in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">In <em>Scott v. State, supra, </em>351 Md. 667, 720 A.2d 291, this Court considered whether former \u00a7 293 and a second enhancement statute, former Article 27, \u00a7 286(f)(3), could each apply to a conviction on a single count. <em>Gardner v. State </em>considered the parallel issue of whether former \u00a7 293 and former \u00a7 286(c) could each enhance a sentence on a single count. Both <em>Scott </em>and <em>Gardner </em>held that it was ambiguous whether the Legislature had intended the application of two separate highly penal enhancement statutes to a single count. This Court, therefore, applied the rule of lenity. <em>Scott v. State, </em>351 Md. at 677, 720 A.2d at 295; <em>Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. at 651-652, 689 A.2d at 614-615.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In response to <em>Scott </em>and <em>Gardner, </em>the General Assembly in the year 2000 enacted Senate Bill 345, which is now codified as \u00a7 5-905(d) of the Criminal Law Article. The Department of Legislative Services\u2019 \u201cFiscal Note\u201d and \u201cAnalysis\u201d with respect to Senate Bill 345, at p. 1, explained that the Bill was intended to rectify the problem found by the Court in <em>Gardner v. State, </em>namely that \u201cthe application of these statutes in enhancing a single count of a violation is ambiguous.\u201d The Department of Legislative Services continued <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1-2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">\u201cThis bill clarifies that intent by clearly applying the enhanced penalty under the Article 27, Section 293(b)(3) to any controlled dangerous substance offense.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">\u201cIn <em>Gardner, </em>and in reversing a related Court of Special Appeals opinion, the Court of Appeals held that a single count may not be enhanced under both sections of Article 27.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">A Report of the House Judiciary Committee concerning Senate Bill 345 similarly stated that the purpose of the Bill was to \u201capply[ ] the enhanced penalty under Article 27, \u00a7 293 to any controlled dangerous substance offense\u201d and that \u201c[t]his bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>provides that a sentence under Article 27, \u00a7 293 may be imposed in conjunction with other sentences.... \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Like the statutory language, the legislative history of \u00a7 5-905(d) reads in terms of one \u201coffense\u201d or a single \u201ccount\u201d being enhanced \u201cunder\u201d \u00a7 5-905 of the Criminal Law Article. Nothing in \u00a7 5-905(d)\u2019s legislative history discloses the General Assembly\u2019s intent that \u00a7 5-905 should apply to each one of multiple counts based on the same incident. In the present case, \u00a7 5-905 is not being applied to a single offense in conjunction with another enhancement statute. Neither the statutory language nor the legislative history of subsection (d) addresses the application of \u00a7 5-905 to the situation now before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u00a7 5-905 of the Criminal Law Article, as applied to the circumstances of this case, is ambiguous. \u201cIf there is doubt as to the penalty, then the law directs that [the] punishment must be construed to favor a milder penalty over a harsher one.\u201d <em>Gardner v.

The key to the Greek system was the use of <em>dikasteries. </em>Well before the time of the birth of Christ, the Greeks selected by lot six thousand citizens (thereafter called dikasts) above thirty years of age and divided into smaller groups, called <em>decuries. </em>When a <em>civil or criminal trial </em>was ready to be held, lots were drawn to determine in which <em>decury </em>and court the case was to be heard, so that no one could know in advance before whom the case would appear and attempt to influence the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">\" \u2018Juries\u2019 were large at this time.

Bloomstein explains, at 16-17:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">\"In cases where trial by combat was inapplicable, impracticable, not customary, or interdicted by the clergy, and in cases that were, at first, of generally inferior importance, men of the neighborhood where the offense was surmised to have been committed were gathered in an inquest. Those who were selected were supposed to have knowledge of the facts of the matter.

Of course, the phrase \"irreconcilably inconsistent\u201d is redundant. In this context, \"irreconcilable\u201d adds nothing to the word \"inconsistent\" and is superfluous. If verdicts can be reconciled, they are not inconsistent in either civil or criminal cases and are allowable. Even in a nonjuiy trial, if a trial judge's verdicts can be reconciled, they are not inconsistent and are allowable. This principle has been discussed in several Maryland cases. <em>See, e.g., State v. Anderson, </em>320 Md. 17, 29-30, 575 A.2d 1227, 1232 (1990); <em>Shell v.

The accreted hodgepodge of exceptions<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to Maryland\u2019s traditional toleration of inconsistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>verdicts has undermined the intellectual justification for continuing to permit such verdicts. I write separately, however, to encourage clarification of the scope of today\u2019s holding and the proper procedure to be followed by a defendant in the trial court and a trial judge in order to fashion relief from an inconsistent verdict, thereby giving guidance and possibly sparing our appellate courts unnecessary appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Distinguish Factual From Legal Inconsistency</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The Majority opinion, while undoubtedly joining the minority of states that prohibit inconsistent verdicts, does not penetrate further into the jurisprudential wilderness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I think it important to note explicitly that the Majority\u2019s holding applies only to \u201clegally inconsistent\u201d verdicts, not \u201cfactually inconsistent\u201d verdicts. The Court should continue to recognize factually or \u201clogically\u201d inconsistent verdicts rendered by juries in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">A factually inconsistent verdict is one where a jury renders \u201cdifferent verdicts on crimes with distinct elements when there was only one set of proof at a given trial, which makes the verdict illogical.\u201d Ashlee Smith, Comment, <em>Vice-AVerdict: Legally Inconsistent Jury Verdicts Should Not Stand in Maryland, </em>35 U.Balt. L.Rev. 395, 397 n. 16 (2006). The feature distinguishing a factually inconsistent verdict from a legally inconsistent verdict is that a factually inconsistent verdict is merely illogical. By contrast, a legally inconsistent verdict occurs where a jury acts contrary to a trial judge\u2019s proper instructions regarding the law. The difference be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tween the two is perhaps best illustrated by examples from other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Assume a legally intoxicated or otherwise reckless driver causes a head-on collision, killing on impact the driver and passenger of the other car. The intoxicated driver is charged with two counts of vehicular homicide. The jury convicts the defendant of vehicular homicide as to the death of the driver of the other car, but finds the defendant not guilty of the same crime with regard to the death of the passenger. Such a result would constitute factually inconsistent verdicts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The verdicts in the present case also contain a factual inconsistency. Price was acquitted of being a felon in possession of a handgun,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but convicted of possessing a handgun in the course of drug trafficking.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was no dispute at trial as to Price\u2019s prior felony convictions. Therefore, it is illogical for the jury to find that Price is guilty of possessing a firearm in the course of drug trafficking without possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Despite the illogical verdict, this does not rise to the level of a legally inconsistent verdict. Thus, if this were the only grounds for challenging Price\u2019s conviction for possession of a handgun in the course of drug trafficking, his conviction should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">A legal inconsistency, by contrast, occurs when \u201can acquittal on one charge is conclusive as to an element which is necessary to and inherent in a charge on which a conviction has occurred.... \u201d Stephen T. Wax, <em>Inconsistent and Repugnant Verdicts in Criminal Trials, </em>24 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 713, 740 (1979). Similarly, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island stated that \u201cif the essential elements of the count[s] of which the defendant is acquitted are identical and necessary to prove the count of which the defendant is convicted, then the verdicts are inconsistent.\u201d <em>State v. Arroyo, </em>844 A.2d 163, 171 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cVerdicts of guilty of crime A but not guilty of crime B, where both crimes arise out of the same set of facts, are legally inconsistent when they necessarily involve the conclusion that the same essential element or elements of each crime were found both to exist and not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>exist.\u201d <em>People v. Frias, </em>99 Ill.2d 193, 75 Ill.Dec. 674, 457 N.E.2d 1233, 1235 (1983).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">As Price\u2019s acquittal established conclusively that he was not engaged in drug trafficking, the Majority opinion correctly concludes that the conviction for possession of a handgun while engaged in drug trafficking may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Relationship to the \u201cRule of Consistency\u201d in Conspiracy Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The Majority\u2019s opinion holding represents a return to ideological consistency regarding legally inconsistent verdicts. It is important to note parallels between the application of this newly announced rule and the \u201crule of consistency\u201d applicable in conspiracy cases. \u201cAs one person alone cannot be guilty of conspiracy, when all but one conspirator are acquitted, conviction of the remaining conspirator cannot stand.\u201d <em>Hurwitz v. State, </em>200 Md. 578, 92 A.2d 575, 581 (1952). This \u201crule of consistency does not apply to separate trials____\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>286 Md. 520, 528, 408 A.2d 1317, 1322 (1979); <em>accord State v. Johnson, </em>367 Md. 418, 430, 788 A.2d 628, 635 (2002) (\u201c[T]hus, despite the acquittal of all of the respondent\u2019s co-conspirators in a prior trial, the respondent\u2019s conviction for conspiracy must stand.\u201d). There is no requirement that the State even try more than one conspirator. <em>Gardner, </em>286 Md. at 524-25, 408 A.2d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">As a parallel, the Majority\u2019s opinion should not be read to require that the State even charge an underlying offense in order to maintain \u201cconsistency.\u201d Thus, Price could be convicted of possessing a handgun with a nexus to drug trafficking without being charged and tried for drug trafficking. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>addition, the Majority opinion\u2019s requirement of legally consistent verdicts should apply only to single trials.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The rule announced by the Majority opinion today applies only to outright acquittals rendered by a jury. If a jury deadlocks on one count of an indictment, but convicts on a compound offense of which the aforementioned count is a necessary element, the jury renders only one verdict. Thus, the conviction on the compound crime is not an inconsistent verdict. \u201cIn Maryland, a mistrial is equivalent to no trial at all.\u201d <em>Powers v. State, </em>285 Md. 269, 285, 401 A.2d 1031, 1040 (1979) (citing <em>Cook v. State, </em>281 Md. 665, 671, 381 A.2d 671, 674 (1978)). \u201cAccordingly, a jury\u2019s failure to agree, which results in a mistrial, does not establish any facts\u201d and this may not be said to establish an inconsistency. <em>Powers, </em>285 Md. at 285, 401 A.2d at 1040 (citing <em>United States v. Smith, </em>337 A.2d at 503-04 (Kern, J., concurring)). \u201cOnce a mistrial has been declared, all questions of fact remain to be decided----\u201d <em>Cook, </em>281 Md. at 671, 381 A.2d at 674. \u201cA nonverdict, to be sure, does not affirmatively establish one of the opposing poles for a set of inconsistent verdicts.\u201d <em>Butler v. State, </em>91 Md.App. 515, 548, 605 A.2d 186, 202 (1992), <em>aff'd, </em>335 Md. 238, 643 A.2d 389 (1994). \u201cMoreover, it is logical to focus upon the counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>where the jury reached verdicts rather than upon counts representing no decision and establishing nothing.\u201d <em>Ferrell v.

Because of the \u201csea change\u201d announced by the Majority\u2019s opinion, some prospective direction is necessary and desirable to highlight the procedure required in order for a defendant to preserve for appellate review a challenge to a legally inconsistent verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The jury may render a legally inconsistent verdict to show lenity to the defendant. Muller, <em>supra </em>at 784; Comment, <em>supra </em>at 28. The defendant should not be foreclosed from accepting the jury\u2019s lenity as a result of the holding of the Majority opinion. Nevertheless, we should not permit the defendant to accept the jury\u2019s lenity in the trial court, only to seek a windfall reversal on appeal by arguing that the jury\u2019s verdicts are inconsistent. Accordingly, a defendant must note his or her objection to allegedly inconsistent verdicts prior to the verdicts becoming final and the discharge of the jury. Otherwise, the claim is waived.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cIf a defendant claims that a verdict is inconsistent to the point of being self-destructive, he must present that claim to the circuit court before the jury is discharged; if he does not, he waives the claim.\u201d <em>State v. Flemons, </em>144 S.W.3d 877, 881 (Mo.Ct.App.2004); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>State v.

But, despite a hearkening, if a demand for a poll is duly made thereafter, it is the acceptance of the verdict upon the poll that removes the verdict from the province of the jury. In other words, the jury has control of the verdict until it is final. Absent a demand for a poll, the verdict becomes final upon its acceptance when hearkened. When a poll is demanded, the verdict becomes final only upon its acceptance after the poll.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-7\"><em>Smith v.

The jurors then should be permitted to resume deliberation. The jury is free to resolve the inconsistency either by returning verdict in the defendant\u2019s favor, convicting on the implicated counts, or deadlocking on a charge so that no inconsistent finding results. \u201cUntil the announcement that the verdict has been recorded, the jury has the right to amend or change any verdict; and when it is so amended it is the real verdict of the jury and it may be properly accepted by the court.\u201d <em>Heinze v.

For example, two inconsistent convictions cannot stand. <em>Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 613, 42 A.2d 128 (1945).

It would be imprudent for appellate judges to attempt to discern from the evidence presented at trial whether a jury\u2019s verdict is factually illogical. Accordingly, I caution against reading too much into the Majority opinion\u2019s use of a quotation from <em>DeSacia. </em>Majority op. at 28, 949 A.2d at 630. Although the Supreme Court of Alaska eloquently notes the conceptual difficulties associated with accepting inconsistent verdicts, the analysis from that particular case should not be adopted in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">Instead, Maryland should remain safely in the \"majority of the minority\u201d of states that prohibit legally inconsistent verdicts while nonetheless permitting logically or factually inconsistent verdicts.

When a single jury reaches logically inconsistent verdicts in a single case, we can be certain from the verdict itself that the jury has somehow erred (in the sense, at least, of not following its instructions), and the argument of my Harvard article [Muller, <em>supra </em>note 1] is that the legal system ought to do something about inconsistent convictions in this setting (rather than just letting them stand, as the law now does). But when two juries reach logically inconsistent verdicts in separate trials, those verdicts supply no evidence that either jury has erred\u2014let alone that the erring jury was [the] \"harsher\u201d one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">Is That Legal, http://www.isthatlegal.org/archives/2006/08/post_6.html (4 August 2006, 10:15 AM).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b78-9\">. In fact, quite often a defendant's optimal choice will be to remain silent, thus waiving his challenge to the inconsistent verdicts and accepting the conviction that may be inconsistent. A defendant, aware of his or her guilt, or the overwhelming evidence of guilt, of all of the crimes of which he or she stands charged, may choose to accept the jury\u2019s lenity. A defendant may be wise to accept the inconsistent conviction and accompanying sentence, rather than look a gift horse in the mouth. If the defendant objects to the inconsistent verdicts, the jury, given a second chance, may choose to remedy the error in a manner not in the defendant's favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\">. Because the rule against legally inconsistent verdicts is intended to protect the criminal defendant, the State may not object to the inconsistent verdicts. The option belongs only to the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b80-7\">. There is no double jeopardy consequence in permitting the trial court, upon the defendant\u2019s request, to re-instruct the jury and permit it to return to deliberations. The defendant knowingly and affirmatively waives any challenge to the jury\u2019s reconsideration of the inconsistent verdicts by objecting to the inconsistent verdicts before they become final. Even if the issue is not waived when the defendant objects, the double jeopardy prohibition only \"prevents further deliberation on an acquittal only after that verdict is final.\u201d Muller, supra at 829; <em>see State v. Peters, </em>855 S.W.2d 345, 347-48 (Mo.1993) (en banc) (\"We hold that the first two verdicts the jury attempted to return were inconsistent because if the defendant was not guilty of assault, he cannot be guilty of armed criminal action based on assault. The court acted properly in sending the matter back to the jury for further consideration. In addition, we hold that the action of the court did not subject Peters to double jeopardy.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
