Clancy, Jr, perhaps best known as the author of many popular \u201ctechno-thriller\u201d novels, and Wanda King,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his wife at the time, entered into an agreement (the \u201cJRLP Partnership Agreement\u201d), under Maryland law, forming the Jack Ryan Limited Partnership (JRLP). The purpose, as later amended, of JRLP is to \u201cengage in activities relating to the writing, publishing and sale of books or in any other lawful activity____\u201d Clancy and King each own a 1% general partnership interest and 49% limited partnership interest in JRLP. Section 5.5 of the 33 page JRLP Partnership Agreement states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>A The General Partners or their Affiliated Persons may act as general or managing partners for other partnerships engaged in businesses similar to that conducted by the Partnership. Nothing herein shall limit the General Partners or their Affiliated Persons from engaging in any such business activities, or any other activities which may be competitive with the Partnership or the [JRLP-owned] Property, and the General Partners or their Affiliated Persons shall not incur any obligation, fiduciary or otherwise, to disclose or offer any interest in such activities to any party hereto and shall not be deemed to have a conflict of interest because of such activities.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">E. The General Partners shall be under a fiduciary duty to conduct the affairs of the Partnership in the best interests of the Partnership, including the safekeeping and use of all Partnership funds and assets and the use thereof for the benefit of the Partnership. The General Partners shall at all times act in good faith and exercise due diligence in all activities relating to the conduct of the business of the Partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Section 5.7 of the JRLP Partnership Agreement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-1\">Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall have any rights or obligations, by virtue of this Agreement, in or to any independent ventures of any nature or description, or the income or profits derived therefrom, in which a Partner may engage, including, without limitation, the ownership, operation, management, syndication and development of other businesses, even if in competition with the Partnership\u2019s trade or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">JRLP, in furtherance of its purpose, contracted with S <em>&amp; </em>R Literary, Inc., in a 23 March 1993 letter agreement, forming a joint venture known as \u201cTom Clancy\u2019s Op-Center\u201d (Op-Center).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> S &amp; R Literary is controlled by its President, Dr. Steve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>R. Pieczenik. The original purpose of the Joint Venture Agreement was to develop a proposal for a television series.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Proceeds from the efforts undertaken pursuant to the Op-Center joint venture were to be split evenly between JRLP and S &amp; R Literary. The Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement pertinently states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">2. All decisions with respect to the development, use and exploitation of the proposal shall be made by mutual agreement between Steve R. Pieczenik and Tom Clancy; provided, however, that if, after discussion, no agreement is reached, the decision of Tom Clancy should prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The signature page of the Joint Venture Agreement appears as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please indicate your agreement by signing and returning copies hereof to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">JACK RYAN LIMITED PARTNERSHIP By [Mr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">Clancy]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-11\">AGREED TO AND ACCEPTED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-12\">S. &amp; R. LITERARY, INC. By [Dr. Pieczenik]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-13\">AGREED TO (insofar as I am concerned):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-14\">[Mr. Clancy]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-15\">[Dr. Pieczenik]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">To develop the paperback book series, Pieczenik assembled a team including Martin Greenberg, a book \u201cpackager,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Jeff Rovin, an author-for-hire. Rovin was selected as the actual author of the series because, it was thought, he would be able to affect a \u201cClancyesque\u201d style of writing. According to the testimony, Clancy had very little to do with the development of the series. Although he \u201cglanced at a few\u201d of the books, Clancy did not read, cover-to-cover or in any meaningful part, any of the books in the series. Apparently his chief contribution to the effort was the aura lent to the enterprise by the association of his name and reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The Op-Center paperback books proved to be successful. Every book appeared on the New York Times Paperback Bestseller list. As of July 2003, the Op-Center book series generated over $28 million in domestic and foreign profits, after deducting writers\u2019 fees, commissions, and other expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In 1996, in the midst of the Op-Center series of books, Clancy and King, as husband and wife, separated. Their divorce was finalized by the Circuit Court for Calvert County on 6 January 1999. Leading up to the divorce, Clancy and King entered into a Marital Property Agreement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the Marital Property Agreement did not alter the respective ownership interests of Clancy and King in JRLP, it designated Clancy as Managing Partner of JRLP.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Marital Prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>erty Agreement also contained a provision by which a party breaching the agreement would have to pay the non-breaching party\u2019s resultant costs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">After a total of 10 books were published in the Op-Center series, and Books 11 and 12 slated for publication, Clancy set the stage for the possible removal of his name from the Op-Center series. JRLP and S &amp; R Literary agreed, in a jointly signed letter dated 28 October 2001, that Clancy\u2019s name would be used in connection with Books 13 and 14 in the series. Clancy signed on behalf of JRLP; Pieczenik on behalf of S &amp; R Literary. The letter agreement provided further that, after the publication of Book 14, JRLP could withdraw permission to use Clancy\u2019s name in connection with future books in the series.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">King filed a Complaint in the Circuit Court for Calvert County on 3 July 2003 alleging that Clancy breached his fiduciary duty to her and JRLP by, <em>inter alia, </em>stating<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that he intended to prevent the use of his name in connection with later books in the Op-Center series. She sought injunctive relief to prohibit Clancy, as Managing Partner of JRLP, from taking action detrimental to the Op-Center series, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>placing her in the role of Managing Partner of JRLP, and recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">It was not until 19 January 2004 that Clancy \u201cpulled the trigger\u201d on his announced intent to withdraw his name prospectively from the Op-Center series. Through counsel in a 19 January 2004 letter, he expressed his refusal to permit the Op-Center joint venture to use his name in connection with the series beyond Book 14. Specifically, the letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApB\">Although [Clancy], individually, permitted the joint venture to use the name \u201cTom Clancy\u201d in the series title in connection with op-Center paperback books 1 through 14, he has withdrawn permission to the joint venture for further and future use of his name in the titles to the Op-Center paperback book series beyond book 14. Please accept this letter as confirmation of the fact that [Clancy] will not permit the joint venture to use his name in the title to the Op-Center paperback book series beyond book 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">On 20 January 2004, Clancy filed in the case initiated by King a Counterclaim for Declaratory Relief. Clancy sought a declaration holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">(1) That beyond rights granted by [him] to the Joint Venture to use the \u201cTom Clancy\u201d name in the publication of Books 1 through 14 of the Op-Center paperback book series, the Joint Venture does not possess the right to use the name \u201cTom Clancy\u201d in the Op-Center series title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">(2) That the Joint Venture does not have the right to use the name \u201cTom Clancy\u201d in the series title for hardback book publications;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-9\">(3) That all decisions with respect to the development, use and exploitation of the Op Center concept are at the unfettered discretion of [Clancy], individually;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-10\">(4) That [Clancy] may withhold or withdraw any license to use his name in Joint Venture business endeavors for any reason, including for purely personal competitive reasons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-11\">(5) That JRLP does not possess the right to use the name \u201cTom Clancy\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>(6) That Wanda King does not possess the right to use the name \u201cTom Clancy\u201d; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">(7) That [Clancy] does not owe a duty, as managing partner or otherwise, to JRLP such as would require him to permit the use of his name in JRLP\u2019s business ventures, including through its participation in the Joint Venture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Clancy later filed a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> King responded with a motion for partial summary judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In denying Clancy\u2019s motion and granting King\u2019s, the trial court held that Clancy does not \u201cindividually own or control the mark \u2018Tom Clancy\u2019s Op-Center\u2019 \u201d and that Clancy\u2019s \u201cpartnership and/or contractual obligations to Ms. King preclude him from stopping the future use of the mark \u2018Tom Clancy\u2019s Op-Center.\u2019\u201d The trial court ordered that the case proceed to trial on the issues of \u201cthe extent of equitable relief\u2019 to be granted to King and King\u2019s \u201crequest to recover her legal fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In consideration of arguments made on the first day of trial, the trial court vacated its summary judgment ruling in King\u2019s favor to the extent that it held that Clancy breached his fiduciary duty to JRLP and King.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That issue also proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The Circuit Court bifurcated the trial. The object of the first portion of the trial was to determine whether Clancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>breached his fiduciary duty to JRLP and King. The second part of the trial was to determine, if necessary, equitable relief and damages due to King. On 5 August 2005, the Circuit Court concluded that Clancy breached his duty to JRLP and the Op-Center joint venture. The court ordered that King be appointed as managing partner of JRLP as it related to the Op-Center series, which included \u201ccollaborating and negotiating with Dr. Pieczenik, on behalf of the joint venture, publishing, royalty and other contracts for the management of the Op-Center brand.\u201d A later order awarded King attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in the amount of $518,431.71.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Clancy noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court affirmed, in an unreported opinion, the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment. The Court of Special Appeals, however, expressed its view that the scope of the trial court\u2019s order as to King\u2019s authority as managing partner of JRLP with regard to the Op-Center project was not sufficiently clear. The court remanded the case to the Circuit Court for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We granted Clancy\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari, 402 Md. 355, 936 A.2d 852 (2007), to consider three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-7\">1. Whether the lower courts erred in failing to recognize that principles of contract preempt fiduciary duties where the contract is unambiguous and the parties have made their intentions clear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">2. Whether the intermediate appellate court erred by failing to order that under [King\u2019s] control the Op-Center Joint venture cannot expand its activities beyond its current scope, which is television productions and mass market paperback books?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">3. Whether the lower courts erred in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to the respondent?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Where, as in the present case, an action has been tried without a jury, we \u201creview the case on both the law and the evidence.\u201d Maryland Rule 8-131(c). \u2018We will not disturb the judgment on the facts, however, unless the trial court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Goff v. State, </em>387 Md. 327, 338, 875 A.2d 132, 139 (2005). \u201cThe deference shown to the trial court\u2019s factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard does not, of course, apply to legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Nesbit v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 72, 854 A.2d 879, 883 (2004). Where a case involves \u201cthe application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the lower court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a de novo standard of review.\u201d <em>Walter v. Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609, 612 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Clancy concedes that, contract law aside,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> his pertinent actions, which animated King\u2019s suit, would violate the fiduciary duty he owed to JRLP. Thus, for proper analysis of the controversy presented for our review involving the interpretation of the JRLP Partnership Agreement and the Op-Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Joint Venture Agreement, we need not dwell unduly on common law or statutory fiduciary duties.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Section 9A-103(a) of the Maryland Code, Corporations and Associations Article notes that \u201crelations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership are governed by the partnership agreement.\u201d Section 9A-103(b)(3)(i) permits partnerships to \u201cidentify specific types or categories of activities that do not violate the duty of loyalty.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201cThe general rule is that the partnership agreement governs the relations among the partners and between the partners and the partnership.\u201d <em>Della Ratta v. Larkin, </em>382 Md. 553, 564, 856 A.2d 643, 649 (2004) (citing <em>Creel v. Lilly, </em>354 Md. 77, 87, 729 A.2d 385, 391 (1999)). \u201cA partnership is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>of course, a contractual relation to which the principles of contract law are fully applicable.\u201d <em>Klein v. Weiss, </em>284 Md. 36, 63, 395 A.2d 126, 141 (1978) (citing <em>Collier v. Collier, </em>182 Md. 82, 32 A.2d 469 (1943) and <em>Abbott v. Hibbitts, </em>142 Md. 7, 119 A. 650 (1922)); <em>see also Della Ratta, </em>382 Md. at 569, 856 A.2d at 652-53 (holding that the limited partnership agreement modified the default rules governing the limited partnership); J. William Callison, <em>Why a Fiduciary Duty Shift to Creditors of Insolvent Business Entities Is Incorrect as a Matter of Theory and Practice, </em>1 J. Bus. &amp; Tech. L. 431, 451-52 (2007) (\u201c[T]he business organization universe is full of other forms, specifically closely held corporations, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies, in which the emerging consensus is that fiduciary duties are capable of modification by agreement.\u201d); Alan R. Bromberg <em>&amp; </em>Larry E. Ribstein, Bromberg &amp; Ribstein on Partnership \u00a7 12:05(e) (1988, Rel. 2002-2) (\u2018Within very broad limits the [limited partnership] agreement may be anything the partners want it to be.\u201d). Bang concedes that \u201c[a] partner\u2019s fiduciary duties may be modified by partnership agreement.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Thus, the first step in the proper analysis of the questions presented by the instant case is to examine the contracts governing the operation of JRLP and the Op-Center Joint Venture. <em>See Sonet v. Timber Co., </em>722 A.2d 319, 324 (Del.Ch. 1998) (noting that under limited partnership law \u201ca claim of breach of fiduciary duty must first be analyzed in terms of the operative governing instrument\u2014the partnership agreement\u2014and only where that document is silent or ambiguous, or where principles of equity are implicated, will a Court begin to look for guidance from the statutory default rules, or other extrinsic evidence\u201d); Stephen M. Bainbridge, <em>Much Ado About Little? Directors\u2019 Fiduciary Duties in the Vicinity of Insolvency, </em>1 J. Bus. &amp; Tech. L. 335, 337 (2007) (\u201c[Fiduciary duties ... can be understood as gap-fillers that complete the contract....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The rules of contract interpretation are well-settled. \u201cThe interpretation of a contract, including the determination of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>subject to de novo review.\u201d <em>Sy-Lene of Wash., Inc. v. Starwood Urban Retail II, LLC, </em>376 Md. 157, 163, 829 A.2d 540, 544 (2003). \u201cMaryland adheres to the principle of the objective interpretation of contracts.\u201d <em>Cochran v. Norkunas, </em>398 Md. 1, 16, 919 A.2d 700, 710 (2007). The court will \u201c \u2018giv[e] effect to the clear terms of the contract regardless of what the parties to the contract may have believed those terms to mean.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Riley, </em>393 Md. 55, 79, 899 A.2d 819, 833 (2006) (quoting <em>Towson Univ. v. Conte, </em>384 Md. 68, 78, 862 A.2d 941, 946-47 (2004)). \u201cThus, our search to determine the meaning of a contract is focused on the four corners of the agreement.\u201d <em>Cochran, </em>398 Md. at 17, 919 A.2d at 710 (citing <em>Walton v. Mariner Health, </em>391 Md. 643, 660, 894 A.2d 584, 594 (2006)). \u201c[Ejffect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can be sensibly and reasonably followed.\u201d <em>Sagner v. Glenangus Farms, Inc., </em>234 Md. 156, 167, 198 A.2d 277, 283 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">There are essentially two contracts of concern in the present case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The first, the JRLP Partnership Agreement, clearly and unambiguously limits the duty of loyalty ordinarily owed by Clancy to JRLP and King. Section 5.5A of the JRLP Partnership Agreement pertinently states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">The General Partners or their Affiliated Persons may act as general or managing partners for other partnerships engaged in businesses similar to that conducted by the Partnership. Nothing herein shall limit the General Partners or their Affiliated Persons from engaging in any such business activities, or any other activities which may be competitive with the Partnership or the [JRLP-owned] Property, and the General Partners or their Affiliated Persons shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>incur any obligation, fiduciary or otherwise, to disclose or offer any interest in such activities to any party hereto and shall not be deemed to have a conflict of interest because of such activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Similarly, \u00a7 5.7 of the JRLP Partnership Agreement provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall have any rights or obligations, by virtue of this Agreement, in or to any independent ventures of any nature or description, or the income or profits derived therefrom, in which a Partner may engage, including, without limitation, the ownership, operation, management, syndication and development of other businesses, even if in competition with the Partnership\u2019s trade or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">In short, these provisions trumped the usual duty not to compete with the limited partnership and, to a large extent, the duty not to usurp partnership opportunities. <em>See Kahn v. Icahn, </em>No. Civ. A. 15916, 1998 WL 832629, *3, 24 Del. J. Corp. L. 738 (Del.Ch.1998), <em>aff'd, </em>746 A.2d 276 (Del.2000) (table)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (holding that contract language almost identical to the language in the JRLP Partnership Agreement permitted the general partner to compete with the firm and usurp the firm\u2019s business opportunities); Andrew S. Gold, <em>On the Elimination of Fiduciary Duties: A Theory of Good Faith for Unincorporated Firms, </em>41 Wake Forest L.Rev. 123, 127-28 (2006) (\u201cTypically, when fiduciary duties are eliminated, the scope of managerial discretion will be limited by the parties (or, in cases of contractual silence, provided by default terms). But barring egregious cases, such as unconscionability, fraud, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>misappropriation of assets, contract doctrine mandates few restrictions____\u201d); J. William Callison <em>&amp; </em>Maureen A. Sullivan, Partnership Law &amp; Practice: General &amp; Limited Partnerships \u00a7 22:8 (2007) (recommending sample language similar to that in the JRLP Partnership Agreement to permit the general partner to engage in self-dealing and competition with the limited partnership).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Thus, Clancy was under no obligation to allow JRLP to participate in the Op-Center Joint Venture. Clancy was free to retain all profits and management of the Op-Center Joint Venture for himself as an individual.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">As to the second contract of special relevance in the present case, the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">2. All decisions with respect to the development, use and exploitation of the proposal shall be made by mutual agreement between Steve R. Pieczenik and Tom Clancy; provided, however, that if, after discussion, no agreement is reached, the decision of Tom Clancy should prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>In other words, \u201cTom Clancy\u201d has final authority over \u201c[a]ll decisions\u201d regarding the \u201cdevelopment, use, and exploitation\u201d of the Op-Center project.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Joint Venture Agreement is between two parties, JRLP and S &amp; R Literary, but also was signed by Clancy and Pieczenik individually. The face of the contract makes clear the dual capacities of the various signatories.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The contract is in the form of a letter from JRLP to S &amp; R Literary. Thus, where the contract refers to \u201cyou,\u201d it refers to S &amp; R Literary.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> By contrast, when the contract uses the third person plural \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cours,\u201d the contract refers to JRLP.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The use of the name \u201cTom Clancy\u201d in paragraph two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>means \u201cTom Clancy individually.\u201d To read \u201cTom Clancy\u201d in paragraph two to mean \u201cTom Clancy, as General Partner of JRLP\u201d defies plain meaning and would cause the terms in paragraph two to conflict with the terms in paragraph four. Paragraph four states that \u201cequal credit [shall] be given to Tom Clancy and Steve Pieczenik (in that order) as originators of the series.\u201d In this respect, paragraph four also used \u201cTom Clancy\u201d to mean Clancy individually, not in his role as general partner of JRLP. Finally, the signature page clearly contemplates that Clancy signed the contract both as General Partner of JRLP and as an individual. The signature page appears as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please indicate your agreement by signing and returning copies hereof to us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">Very truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">JACK RYAN LIMITED PARTNERSHIP By [Mr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">Clancy]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">AGREED TO AND ACCEPTED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">S. &amp; R.

JRLP and S &amp; R Literary already and objectively had indicated their intent to be bound by the contract as evidenced by the signatures earlier on the page. The phrase \u201cAGREED TO (insofar as I am concerned)\u201d also indicates that Clancy signed individually. Throughout the contract, JRLP is referred to in the first person plural as \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus.\u201d The use of the word \u201cI\u201d shows that those signatures were of individuals.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals correctly recognized that Clancy reserved for himself, individually, in the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement, management and control of the Op-Center venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">If traditional common law and statutory fiduciary duty principles were paramount to the analysis and outcome of the present case in the posture in which it reaches us, portions of this contract clearly would be improper self-dealing and a usurpation of a partnership opportunity. Clancy reserved control of the project to himself, not the entity to which he owed fiduciary duties. Instead, the JRLP Partnership Agreement clearly contemplates that Clancy may compete with JRLP. In fact, Clancy, under the JRLP Partnership Agreement, may contract to control individually the entire management and profits of the Op-Center Joint Venture. There is no reason, therefore, that he could not contract for less of an interest in the Op-Center activities for himself individually. In essence, Clancy agreed to retain full and final management authority for himself individually, while assigning the profits and ownership of the venture to JRLP. Thus, the terms of the Op-Center Joint Venture contract were permitted by the terms of the JRLP Partnership Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">A fiduciary, under appropriate circumstances, may acquire and enforce legal rights against the firm for which he or she serves as a fiduciary. In <em>Waterfall Farm Systems, Inc. v. Craig, </em>914 F.Supp. 1213, 1215 (D.Md.1995), the Craigs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>minority shareholders and directors of a corporation, owned real property upon which a greenhouse was built. The property was leased to the corporation but the lease agreement was never finalized in writing. <em>Waterfall Farm Sys., </em>914 F.Supp. at 1223. After the corporation failed to pay rent, the Craigs attempted to terminate the lease. <em>Waterfall Farm Sys., </em>914 F.Supp. at 1219. The corporation filed suit, arguing that the Craigs breached their fiduciary duty to the corporation. <em>Waterfall Farm Sys., </em>914 F.Supp. at 1220-21. The court held that where the Craigs\u2019 interests were adverse to that of the corporation as lessors, \u201cthey had every right to take proper and lawful steps to protect the substantial investment which they had in the real property owned by them,\u201d even if those steps would have an adverse financial consequence on the corporation. <em>Waterfall Farm Sys., </em>914 F.Supp. at 1228.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">In <em>Storetrax.com, Inc. v. Gurland, </em>397 Md. 37, 45, 915 A.2d 991, 996 (2007), a director brought a breach of contract action against the corporation seeking payment of a severance package. He obtained a default judgment against the corporation and enforced the judgment by attaching the corporation\u2019s bank account. <em>Storetrax.com, </em>397 Md. at 46, 915 A.2d at 996. The director refused to voluntarily relinquish the default judgment upon the corporation\u2019s request. <em>Storetrax.com, </em>397 Md. at 47, 915 A.2d at 996. The corporation sued, arguing that the director breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation. <em>Storetrax.com, </em>397 Md. at 47-48, 915 A.2d at 997. We held that the director did not breach his fiduciary duty by obtaining a judgment against the corporation and enforcing a writ of garnishment against the corporate bank account. <em>Storetrax.com, </em>397 Md. at 67, 915 A.2d at 1009. <em>Waterfall Farm Systems </em>and <em>Storetrax.com </em>stand for the proposition that a fiduciary properly may enforce a validly obtained legal right against the firm to which he or she stands in a fiduciary relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Similarly, in <em>Manufacturers Trust Co. v. Becker, </em>338 U.S. 304, 308, 70 S.Ct. 127, 130, 94 L.Ed. 107 (1949), fiduciaries and their family members purchased, at arm\u2019s length from third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>parties but at a tremendous discount from their face value, notes of the corporation in which they served as directors. Another creditor sued to stop the payment of the notes. <em>Mfrs. Trust, </em>338 U.S. at 305-06, 70 S.Ct. at 128-29, 94 L.Ed. 107. The creditor argued that notes held by the fiduciaries should be paid, if at all, only up to the amount that the fiduciaries paid for them on the open market. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court held that fiduciaries could recover more than the amount they paid to acquire the notes. <em>Mfrs. Trust, </em>338 U.S. at 314-15, 70 S.Ct. at 133, 94 L.Ed. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><em>Manufacturers Trust </em>stands for the proposition that where there is \u201cno component of unfair dealing or bad faith,\u201d fiduciaries may recover beyond their personal financial exposure on fairly purchased corporate notes. <em>Id. </em>Thus, a fiduciary does not need to show a potential personal financial loss in order to enforce a valid and fairly obtained contractual right that is adverse to the firm. <em>See In re Philadelphia &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>64 F.Supp. 738, 739 (E.D.Pa.1946) (\u201c[T]he relationship has never been held to deny a director the right to purchase outstanding corporate obligations at a discount and enforce them against the company for their full amount....\u201d); <em>In re McCrory Stores Corp., </em>12 F.Supp. 267, 269 (D.C.N.Y.1935) (\u201cUnder ordinary conditions a director may purchase claims against his corporation at a discount and enforce them for their full amount.\u201d (citing <em>Seymour v. Spring Forest Cemetery Assoc., </em>144 N.Y. 333, 39 N.E. 365 (1895) and <em>Glenwood Mfg. Co. v. Syme, </em>109 Wis. 355, 85 N.W. 432 (1901))); <em>William M. Moore Const. Co. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guarantee Co., </em>293 N.Y. 119, 56 N.E.2d 74 (N.Y.1944) (holding that the \u201cpurchase of the judgment against the subcontractor by an officer thereof for less than face [value] and its enforcement for its full amount is permissible\u201d); Fletcher Cyclopedia Corporations \u00a7 869 (2006) (\u201c[T]he general rule is that directors or other corporate officers may purchase, and enforce, claims against their corporation, at their face value, notwithstanding they were bought at a discount____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Thus, a fiduciary may enforce validly obtained legal rights against his or her firm, even if that transaction results in a profit for the fiduciary at the firm\u2019s expense. In the present case, Clancy contracted in both the JRLP Partnership Agreement and the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement regarding an intellectual property right, namely, control over the use and exploitation of \u201cTom Clancy\u2019s Op-Center.\u201d He now seeks to enforce that contracted-for-right, just as the director in <em>Storetrax.com </em>sought to enforce his contract for a severance package. The rationale for reserving such a right is obvious. Clancy is a commercially successful and highly-franchised artist. It is perfectly legitimate and rational for such an artist to seek to retain creative control over a project which bears his or her name, regardless of the degree of artistic contribution he or she actually contributes to the endeavor.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The fact that Clancy validly reserved the right to control the use and exploitation of the Op-Center project does not end the inquiry. According to the terms of the JRLP Partnership Agreement and contract law generally, Clancy must exercise his discretion in good faith. Section 5.5E of the JRLP Partnership Agreement states that \u201c[Clancy and King] shall at all times act <em>in good faith </em>and exercise due diligence in all activities relating to the conduct of the business of the Partnership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Even if the contract did not contain this general good faith term, Maryland contract law implies such an obligation. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl. Vol.), Corporations &amp; Associations Article, \u00a7 9A-103(b)(5) (noting that the partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>agreement may not \u201c[e]]iminate the obligation of good faith and fair dealing\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 9A-404(d) (\u201cA partner shall discharge the duties to the partnership and other partners under this title or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.\u201d); <em>Julian v.

Several of the limited partners opposed the capital call because the general partner had not made any distributions of profits, and the capital call represented a financial hardship. <em>Della Ratta, </em>382 Md. at 561, 856 A.2d at 647. They exercised their statutory right to withdraw from the limited partnership. The general partner responded by accelerating the due date of the capital call to antedate the withdrawal. <em>Della Ratta, </em>382 Md. at 560, 856 A.2d at 647. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>We summarized the findings of fact of the trial court in the subsequent litigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">The Circuit Court found that \u201ca significant motivation for Della Ratta issuing the capital call was to squeeze out some of the limited partners.\u201d The trial judge did not believe Della Ratta\u2019s testimony regarding his motivation for issuing the capital call and found Della Ratta\u2019s actions to be \u201ccompletely self-serving.\u201d In addition, the Circuit Court found that Della Ratta advanced the date of the capital call in order to \u201cout-maneuver\u201d the Withdrawing Partners and block them from exercising their statutory right to withdraw.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\"><em>Della Ratta, </em>382 Md. at 577, 856 A.2d at 657. We held that the general partner acted in bad faith. <em>Della Ratta, </em>382 Md. at 579-80, 856 A.2d at 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In <em>Desert Equities, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund, II, L.P., </em>624 A.2d 1199 (Del.1993), the Supreme Court of Delaware held that a limited partner/plaintiff may maintain a claim for breach of fiduciary duty where it alleged that the general partner exercised its contractual discretion, granted in the limited partnership agreement, in bad faith. The limited partnership agreement permitted the general partner to bar the limited partners from participating in new business opportunities (leveraged buyout investments) \u201cif the General Partner delivers a written notice to such Limited Partner that the making of such Capital Contribution or portion thereof might have a Material Adverse Effect. Any Capital Contribution by a Limited Partner might have a \u2018Material Adverse Effect\u2019 if: ... the General Partner, in its discretion, determines .... participation by such Limited Partner is such LBO Investment would ... have a material adverse effect on the Person that is, directly or indirectly, the subject of the proposed LBO Investment, the Partnership or Morgan Stanley.\u201d <em>Desert Equities, </em>624 A.2d at 1202 n. 4. The general partner, exercising its rights under the partnership agreement, did not permit a limited partner to participate in three new business opportunities. <em>Desert Equities, </em>624 A.2d at 1202. The limited partner barred from participating sued, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>arguing that the exclusion by the general partner was in bad faith<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>The trial court granted the general partner\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. <em>Desert Equities, </em>624 A.2d at 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The Supreme Court of Delaware reversed. The court held that the limited partner may recover if it could prove that the general partner acted in retaliation against the limited partner.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Desert Equities, </em>624 A.2d at 1206. Thus, <em>Della Ratta </em>and <em>Desert Equities </em>stand for the proposition that where a general partner is granted discretion in the partnership agreement to act to the disadvantage of limited partners, such discretion must not be exercised in bad faith. The cases also provide a working definition of \u201cbad faith\u201d in the limited partnership context. A general or managing partner acts in bad faith where a primary motivation of his or her conduct is to injure either the firm/venture or his or her business partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The requirements of good faith in contract law are similar to the good faith doctrine in partnership law. In <em>First Nat. Realty Corp. v. Warren-Ehert Co., </em>247 Md. 652, 657, 233 A.2d 811, 813-14 (1967), we surveyed \u201ca number of Maryland cases which have dealt with the question of the performance of a contract to the satisfaction of one of the parties.\u201d The Court concluded that, in \u201cmatters essentially affecting personal taste,\u201d \u201cthe purchaser\u2019s opinion as to satisfaction controlled in the absence of fraud <em>or bad faith. \u201d First Nat. Realty, </em>247 Md. at 657, 233 A.2d at 814-15 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Samuel Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 38:23, 38:24 (4th ed. 2000) (noting the distinction between the subjective test applied to matters of personal taste, such as art, and the objective test applied to \u201cmatters of mechanical fitness, utility or marketability\u201d). The rule articulated in <em>First Nat. Realty Corp. </em>seems apt for application to the present case. In matters of personal discretion in contract, the party with the discretion is limited to exercising that discretion in good faith. <em>See also Volos, Ltd. v. Sotera, </em>264 Md. 155, 171, 286 A.2d 101, 109 (1972) (holding that, in employment contracts for definite term subject to the satisfaction of the employer, the employer may discharge an employee only for an honest, good faith dissatisfaction with the employee\u2019s performance); <em>Wilmington Leasing, Inc. v.

L. 666 (Del.Ch.1997) (holding that although a partnership agreement provision granted rights to the general partner to be exercised in its \u201csole and absolute discretion,\u201d such discretion must be used in good faith); Fitzgerald <em>v. Cantor, </em>No. Civ. A. 16297-NC, 1999 WL 182571, *1 (Del.Ch. 1999) (\u201cAs a matter of equity, however, a managing general partner cannot use, adversely to the interests of a partner or shareholder of a corporate partner seeking consent to transfer shares, provisions identical or similar to Section 11.01 for the sole purpose of protecting or advancing the interests of certain limited or general partners in matters unrelated to their partnership interests. Despite the fact that Section 11.01 states that the managing general partner may deny consent for any reason whatsoever, equity through an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing demands generally that consent not be unreasonably withheld.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">If a significant motive for Clancy exercising his contractual right to withdraw his name from the Op-Center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>series was to decrease the profitability of the series, thereby denying his JRLP partner and ex-wife revenue, because he desired to spite or punish King for or as a consequence of their divorce, it reasonably could be maintained that he acted in bad faith towards both the Op-Center Joint Venture and JRLP. One certainly breaches the promise of good faith owed in contract and as fiduciary in a partnership by working actively to decrease directly the profits of the business venture.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cStated otherwise, under the covenant of good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>and fair dealing, a party impliedly promises to refrain from doing anything that will have the effect of injuring or frustrating the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract between them.\u201d <em>E. Shore Mkts., Inc. v. J.D. Assocs., Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>213 F.3d 175, 184 (4th Cir.2000) (interpreting Maryland law). Thus, Clancy may not act to impair the value of the Op-Center franchise out of personal spite toward his business partner, King. Such motivation would constitute bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\u201cGood faith ordinarily is a question of fact....\u201d <em>David A. Bramble, Inc. v.

In the present case, the trial court made only a finding that Clancy did not act in the best interests of JRLP.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> As noted above, Clancy only needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>to act in good faith toward his business partners, even if such actions actually were adverse to the interests of JRLP.

The Circuit Court previously awarded attorneys fees to King, despite the fact that the court did not determine that or how Clancy violated the parties\u2019 Marital Property Agreement. The only apparent basis for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in these circumstances would (or could) have been a breach of the Marital Property Agreement. <em>See Friolo v. Frankel, </em>403 Md. 443, 456, 942 A.2d 1242, 1250 (2008) (\u201cMaryland generally adheres to the common law, or American rule, that each party to a case is responsible for the fees of its own attorneys, regardless of the outcome.\u201d (citing <em>Montgomery v.

If the Circuit Court were to find on remand that Clancy acted in bad faith, the court must resolve expressly whether the Marital Property Agreement may serve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>as a basis, in this litigation, to award attorneys\u2019 fees to King and, if so, how Clancy breached that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR CALVERT COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AND THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">BATTAGLIA, J., dissents and files opinion joined by GREENE, J.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-15\">.

Penguin Group USA cannot be too concerned with the expansion of the \u201cClancy\u201d brand because they just agreed to add two (2) books to a new branded series: Splinter Cell, a computer game. Therefore, this Court is not persuaded that the Op-Center series is damaging Mr. Clancy in any way because there is evidence to show that the sales of the other series of books not authored by Mr. Clancy are declining as well. Further, the evidence that Mr. Clancy does not want Mrs. King to benefit in any way from the Op-Center series further supports the contention that he was not acting in the best interests of JRLP in requesting his name be withdrawn from the series and that there should not be any further publications with his name. It is this Court\u2019s opinion that Mr. Clancy breaches his fiduciary duty not only to JRLP and his partner, Mrs. King, but also to the joint venture formed for the development of the Op-Center series.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Although the trial court discussed some of the evidence indicating as much, it made no discernable, reyiewable finding that Clancy made the decision to withdraw his name in bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\">.

King, Respondent, his ex-wife and partner in JRLP, when he attempted to withdraw his name from the \u201cTom Clancy\u2019s Op-Center\u201d book series; the Op-Center series was created by Mr. Clancy and Dr. Steve Pieczenik under the auspices of the Op-Center Joint Venture between JRLP and S <em>&amp; </em>R Literary, Inc.

As a result of Mr. Clancy\u2019s breach, the judge appointed Ms. King as Managing Partner of JRLP with respect to the Op-Center Joint Venture; subsequently, in a second order, the judge awarded Ms. King attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. The Court of Special Appeals agreed that Mr. Clancy breached his fiduciary duty to Ms. King and JRLP, but remanded the case for clarification of the scope of Ms. King\u2019s role as Managing Partner of JRLP. The majority herein disagrees with both the trial court and the intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>appellate court and concludes that Mr. Clancy did not owe a fiduciary duty to Ms. King and JRLP; I dissent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Mr. Clancy and Ms. King\u2019s relationship with respect to the Partnership is governed by the JRLP Partnership Agreement, dated, February 26, 1992, Section 5.5, \u201cRights, Powers and Duties of Partners,\u201d of which prescribes the duties owed by the partners:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-6\">A. ... The General Partners or their Affiliated Persons may act as general or managing partners for other partnerships engaged in businesses similar to that conducted by the Partnership.

The General Partners shall be under a fiduciary duty to conduct the affairs of the Partnership in the best interests of the Partnership, including the safekeeping and use of all Partnership funds and assets and the use thereof for the benefit of the Partnership. The General Partners shall at all times act in good faith and exercise due diligence in all activities relating to the conduct of the business of the Partnership.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Section 5.7 of the Partnership Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-9\">Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall have any rights or obligations, by virtue of this Agreement, in or to any independent ventures of any nature or description, or the income or profits derived therefrom, in which a Partner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>may engage, including, without limitation, the ownership, operation, management, syndication and development of other businesses, even if in competition with the Partnership\u2019s trade or business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Op-Center Joint Venture is governed by the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement, a letter agreement signed by Mr. Clancy, on behalf of JRLP, and Dr. Pieczenik, on behalf of S <em>&amp; </em>R; the letter agreement contains a provision specific to Mr. Clancy and Dr. Pieczenik, which explains the process of decision-making for the Op-Center Joint Venture:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoe\">All decisions with respect to the development, use and exploitation of the proposal shall be made by mutual agreement between Steve R. Pieczenik and Tom Clancy; provided, however, that if, after discussion, no agreement is reached, the decision of Tom Clancy shall prevail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The bottom of the letter contained the notation, \u201cAGREED TO (insofar as I am concerned),\u201d and was signed by Mr. Clancy and Dr. Pieczenik individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The gravamen of the instant case is what fiduciary duty is owed by Mr. Clancy to Ms. King in light of the JRLP Agreement and the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement. The majority concludes that because Mr. Clancy reserved for himself, individually, in the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement, management and control of the Op-Center series, Mr. Clancy owed no fiduciary duty to Ms. King and JRLP, and that the pertinent inquiry is whether Mr. Clancy\u2019s actions in attempting to withdraw his name from the Op-Center series were in good faith. The issue is not whether good faith existed, however, even though Mr. Clancy did not prove his bona fides, but whether he could, for his own purposes, violate an agreement under which he had fiduciary obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Professor Reed Rowley, in his treatise <em>Rowley on Partnership, </em>states that \u201c[o]ne of the essentials or results of the partnership relation\u201d is that a general partner \u201cis the agent for the other partners and the partnership in partnership business,\u201d with the right to incur obligations and execute instruments on behalf of the partnership. 1 Reed Rowley, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Rowley on Partnership </em>287-38 (2d ed. 1960). <em>See also </em>4 Alan R.

Sullivan, <em>Partnership Law and Practice </em>Section 12:1 (1996, 2004 Supp.) (\u201cThe status of partners as fiduciaries with respect to the partnership and each other is an established principle of partnership law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">In the present case, Section 5.5E of the JRLP Partnership Agreement establishes the general fiduciary relationship owed by Mr. Clancy to Ms. King, providing that, \u201cThe General Partners shall be under a fiduciary duty to conduct the affairs of the Partnership in the best interests of the Partnership.\u201d (emphasis added). The fiduciary duty referred to in the JRLP Partnership Agreement has been explored by commentators, including Professor Rowley:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">The law imposes upon each partner the duty of exercising toward his copartner the utmost integrity and good faith in all partnership affairs. In transactions concerning the interests of the firm he must consider their mutual welfare, rather than his own private benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">The relationship between partners being fiduciary, the highest degree of good faith between the partners is required. \u201cThere can be no question but that the law holds each member of a partnership to the highest degree of good faith in his dealings with reference to any matter which concerns the business of the common engagement, and that each partner, being the agent of the firm, must be held, during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>the existence of the relation, to the same accountability as other trustees, in all matters which affect the common interest.\u201d \u201cThere is no stronger fiduciary relation known to the law than that of a copartnership, where one man\u2019s property and property rights are subject to a large extent to the control and administration of another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">1 Rowley, <em>Rowley on Partnerships </em>at 516-17 (footnotes omitted). <em>See also </em>2 Bromberg &amp; Ribstein, <em>Bromberg and Ribstein on Partnership </em>at Section 6.07 (stating that generally, \u201cpartners owe fiduciary duties to each other and to the partnership\u201d); Callison &amp; Sullivan <em>Partnership Law and Practice </em>at Section 12:1 (\u201cThe status of partners as fiduciaries with respect to the partnership and each other is an established principle of partnership law.\u201d). In <em>Della Ratta, </em>382 Md. at 578, 856 A.2d at 658, we had occasion to explore the fiduciary duty of general partners:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">The partnership relationship is a fiduciary one, a relation of trust. <em>Allen v. Steinberg, </em>244 Md. 119, 128, 223 A.2d 240, 246 (1966). Managing or general partners particularly owe a fiduciary duty to inactive partners. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the partnership relationship carries with it the requirement of utmost good faith and loyalty. <em>Herring v. Offutt, </em>266 Md. 593, 597, 295 A.2d 876, 879 (1972). As Justice Cardozo, then Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\u201cMany forms of conduct permissible in a workaday world for those acting at arm\u2019s length are forbidden to those bound by fiduciary ties. A trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior. As to this there has developed a tradition that is unbending and inveterate. Uncompromising rigidity has been the attitude of courts of equity when petitioned to undermine the rule of undivided loyalty by the \u2018disintegrating erosion\u2019 of particular exceptions.... Only thus has the level of conduct for fiduciaries been kept at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>Meinhard v. Salmon, </em>249 N.Y. 458, 164 N.E. 545 (1928) (quoted in <em>Herring, </em>266 Md. at 597, 295 A.2d at 879).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Clearly, under the JRLP Partnership Agreement, General Partners of JRLP, Mr. Clancy and Ms. King, owed each other a fiduciary duty to conduct the affairs of the Partnership, including the Op-Center Joint Venture, in the best interests of the Partnership. The fact that under the Partnership Agreement Mr. Clancy and Ms. King could each pursue independent business ventures similar to, or even in competition with, the business conducted by the Partnership, does not change this basic tenet of partnership law, which Mr. Clancy and Ms. King adopted in the JRLP Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The majority circumvents the fiduciary duty owed by Mr. Clancy to Ms. King by referencing the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement, which includes a provision specific to Mr. Clancy and Dr. Pieczenik explaining that, essentially, Mr. Clancy reserved for himself, individually, management and control of the Op-Center series. That clause, which pertains only to that agreement, however, does not eviscerate the fiduciary duty owed to Ms. Kang and JRLP under a different agreement. As both the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals recognized, even though Mr. Clancy reserved to himself, individually, in the Joint Venture Agreement, the management and control of the development, use and exploitation of the book series, that agreement was signed by Mr. Clancy as general partner of JRLP. The trial court concluded that \u201cas an agent of the partnership, [and] also as managing partner, Mr. Clancy has the duty to act in the best interests of JRLP by informing Ms. King of any matters that are to the benefit or detriment of JRLP and any related projects\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8J\">It is clear that Mr. Clancy no longer wanted to be associated with the Op-Center series, but there is evidence that indicates that he had no problem continuing with the other products in the Clancy line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">Mr. Clancy was aware that not only was the Op-Center series declining in sales, but also the sales in the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>products in the Clancy brand. There is nothing to indicate that he wished to prevent the use of his name on the other Clancy brand products, even those books he does not personally author.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">Tom Clancy is a name synonymous with the techno-thriller genre and because Mr. Clancy\u2019s name is significant in the publishing world and carries such a name brand recognition, it would have been damaging to the partnership and the joint venture to have had his name removed from the Op-Center series. The purpose of the partnership and the joint venture would become frustrated for the reasons that the parties would not be able to contract, obtain the dollar values for the books and enjoy the fan base it enjoys now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">In the case at bar, even though Dr. Pieczenik and Mr. Clancy reserved to themselves, each individually, the management and control over the Op-Center series, Mr. Clancy signed the agreement on behalf of JRLP to carry out the business of JRLP which is to pursue activities relating to writing and the sale of books. Not only was the agreement made in the usual course of the partnership business, it was prepared by the attorney for JRLP and signed by the managing partner of JRLP, with the partnership name on the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">While there is evidence that Mr. Clancy wants to end the Op-Center series because sales are going down and it is hurting his literary reputation, there is proof to the contrary that the books in the \u201cClancy\u201d brand are going down in sales no more than the general decline in book sales. Penguin Group USA cannot be too concerned with the expansion of the \u201cClancy\u201d brand because they just agreed to add two (2) books to a new branded series: Splinter Cell, a computer game. Therefore, this Court is not persuaded that the Op-Center series is damaging Mr. Clancy in any way because there is evidence to show that the sales of the other series of books not authored by Mr. Clancy are declining as well. Further, the evidence that Mr. Clancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>does not want Mrs. King to benefit in any way from the Op-Center series further supports the contention that he was not acting in the best interest of JRLP in requesting his name be withdrawn from the series and that there should not be any further publications with his name. It is this Court\u2019s opinion that Mr. Clancy breached his fiduciary duty not only to JRLP and his partner, Mrs. King, but also to the joint venture formed for the development of the Op-Center series.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The Court of Special Appeals agreed and noted that although it \u201cis possible that [Mr. Clancy] could have withdrawn permission to use his name without breaching a duty to the Op-Center Joint Venture,\u201d Ms. King\u2019s \u201ccomplaint, however, raised the issue of whether appellant had breached his fiduciary duty to Ms. King and JRLP, not to the Op-Center Joint Venture\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACi\">Tom Clancy\u2019s Op-Center is an asset of JRLP. The evidence before the circuit court leads to the reasonable conclusion that any acts that diminish the sales of Op-Center products, and thus income, will adversely effect the income of its co-owners\u2014JRLP and S <em>&amp; </em>R. Thus, our inquiry is whether appellant upheld his ... contractually imposed (JRLP limited partnership agreement) fiduciary duties to JRLP and appellee to protect and exploit the Op-Center asset.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">We find no error in the court\u2019s legal rulings that appellant was subject to a fiduciary duty, and that duty was not superceded by the partnership agreements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">We, therefore, affirm the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that appellant breached his fiduciary duty to appellee and JRLP.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there are two extant partnership agreements which the majority, apparently, conflates, although Ms. King was not a signatory to the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement but only the JRLP Agreement. The JRLP Agreement predated that Joint Venture Agreement, which was executed by Mr. Clancy, Managing Partner of JRLP, on the Partnership\u2019s behalf, to carry out its business, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>i.e., to pursue activities relating to the writing, publishing, and sale of books. Thus, Ms. King could not have adopted the Op-Center Joint Venture Agreement\u2019s individual terms as part of the Partnership Agreement, but Mr. Clancy, acting on behalf of JRLP with the Op-Center Joint Venture, was bound by the fiduciary duty specified in the JRLP Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Moreover, the majority errs in stating that because Clancy could control the management of the Op-Center Joint Venture, \u201c[tjhere is no reason ... that he could not contract for less of an interest in the Op-Center activities for himself individually,\u201d and \u201c[tjhus, the terms of the Op-Center Joint Venture contract were permitted by the terms of the JRLP Partnership Agreement.\u201d Majority op. at 562, 954 A.2d at 1104. By attempting to remove his name from the Op-Center series, consequently, Mr. Clancy also was adversely affecting Ms. King\u2019s interest in the book series, to whom he owed a fiduciary duty, although Ms. King did not authorize such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Nevertheless, the majority cites to our decision in <em>Storetrax. com, Inc. v. Gurland, </em>397 Md. 37, 915 A.2d 991 (2007), as well as to <em>Waterfall Farm Systems, Inc. v. Craig, </em>914 F.Supp. 1213 (D.Md.1995), for the proposition that an individual occupying a fiduciary relationship with a corporation or partnership may properly obtain and enforce legal rights against the corporation or partnership without breaching the fiduciary duty. That reading, however, extends the reach of those two cases beyond the realm of what was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In <em>Waterfall Farm Systems, </em>914 F.Supp. at 1213, two corporate directors sought to terminate a lease with the corporation; the corporation objected and filed suit. Judge Alexander Harvey, II of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland noted that the director\u2019s \u201cinterest were adverse to those of the Corporation, and that they had every right to take proper and lawful steps to protect the substantial investment which they had in the real property owned by them,\u201d and \u201cthe mere fact that the Craigs were officers and directors of Waterfall did not impose on them a legal obligation to accede to demands of the Corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>which were adverse to- their personal financial interest.\u201d </em>914 F.Supp. at 1228 (emphasis added). Thus, proof would be required of adverse effect on personal financial interests, which was not provided by Mr. Clancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We found Judge Harvey\u2019s reasoning persuasive in <em>Storetrax.com, </em>397 Md. at 37, 915 A.2d at 991, where a member of the board of directors of a corporation, and a former employee, brought a lawsuit against the corporation to recover severance pay due him and to enforce a garnishment order against the corporation. We concluded that the director did not breach his fiduciary duty because the director could maintain a cause of action against the corporation and \u201chad no legal obligation to accede to the demands of [the corporation] to relinquish a judgment to which he then had a colarable right merely because the corporation asked him to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 69, 915 A.2d at 1010.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Again, adverse effect was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In the present case, the Circuit Court, however, found as a matter of fact, uncontested before us, that Mr. Clancy had not proven that the use of his name in the Op-Center book series was adverse to his personal interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-7\">Tom Clancy is a name synonymous with the techno-thriller genre and because Mr. Clancy\u2019s name is significant in the publishing world and carries such a name brand recognition, it would have been damaging to the partnership and the joint venture to have had his name removed from the Op-Center series. The purpose of the partnership and the joint venture would become frustrated for the reasons that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>parties would not be able to contract, obtain the dollar values for the books and enjoy the fan base it enjoys now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">While there is evidence that Mr. Clancy wants to end the Op-Center series because sales are going down and it is hurting his literary reputation, there is proof to the contrary that the books in the \u201cClancy\u201d brand are going down in sales no more than the general decline in book sales. Penguin Group USA cannot be too concerned with the expansion of the \u201cClancy\u201d brand because they just agreed to add two (2) books to a new branded series: Splinter Cell, a computer game. Therefore, this Court is not persuaded that the Op-Center series is damaging Mr. Clancy in any way because there is evidence to show that the sales of the other series of books not authored by Mr. Clancy are declining as well. Further, the evidence that Mr. Clancy does not want Mrs. King to benefit in any way from the Op-Center series further supports the contention that he was not acting in the best interest of JRLP in requesting his name be withdrawn from the series and that there should not be any further publications with the name.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">JRLP\u2019s interests, the court found, were not adverse to those of Mr. Clancy, and therefore, Mr. Clancy was not relieved of his fiduciary duty to Ms. King and JRLP. The Court of Special Appeals agreed when it noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">Most significant on the question of whether a glut of Op-Center books was damaging to the sales and income, of Tom Clancy\u2019s books, was testimony of David Shanks, the Chief Executive Officer of Penguin Books, the publisher of Tom Clancy\u2019s books. From Shanks\u2019s wide-ranging testimony the court was able to conclude that the Op-Center brand was not a significant cause of decreasing Tom Clancy sales.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">Pieczenik testified as to his disagreements with Clancy about the future of Op-Center and concluded that the proposal to withdraw the Clancy name from the Op-Center brand was not put forward until Clancy and King began their divorce proceedings. He opined that Clancy, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>with his literary agent, undertook to subvert the Op-Center products. There existed throughout the trial the undercurrent that Clancy\u2019s motive in withdrawing his name from the Op-Center venture, and effectively crippling it, was to harm the financial interests of King.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Moreover, what Mr. Clancy, and the majority, fail to recognize is that Mr. Clancy\u2019s interests in the Op-Center book series, in fact, are consistent with those of Ms. King and JRLP. As JRLP partners, Mr. Clancy and Ms. King owned rights to several of Mr. Clancy\u2019s literary works, in addition to the Op-Center series, including \u201cWithout Remorse,\u201d \u201cDebt of Honor,\u201d \u201cExecutive Orders,\u201d and \u201cRainbow Six.\u201d Had Mr. Clancy proven that the decline in sales in the Op-Center series had had a negative affect on the \u201cTom Clancy\u201d brand, including the other works under the purview of JRLP, he could have acted within his fiduciary obligation, in his, Ms. King\u2019s <em>and </em>JRLP\u2019s interests, should he have attempted to withdraw his name from the book series. I agree with the Circuit Court and-the Court of Special Appeals, however, that Mr. Clancy did not prove adverse effect. To say absent adverse effect, that a general partner can withdraw an asset vital to the Partnership without breach, not only offends the terms of the JRLP Partnership Agreement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but, offends the notion of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">I dissent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Judge GREENE authorizes me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-10\">. Because of the majority\u2019s holding, the issue regarding Ms. King\u2019s role as managing partner of JRLP is not reached, although I do agree with the Court of Special Appeals that a remand for clarification of Ms. King's role as managing partner of JRLP would be necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-8\">. The majority also cites <em>Manufacturers Trust Co. v. Becker, </em>338 U.S. 304, 70 S.Ct. 127, 94 L.Ed. 107 (1949), for the proposition that an individual occupying a fiduciary relationship with a corporation may ordinarily purchase debt of the corporation at a discount and recover face value. <em>Manufacturers Trust, </em>however, did not involve a breach of fiduciaiy duly claim, as the Supreme Court noted that \"Petitioner does not here contend that respondent\u2019s claims should be limited because of conduct by the Becker directors or by respondents amounting to bad faith or abuse of fiduciary advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 70 S.Ct. at 130, 94 L.Ed. at 113. Even so, in that case the fiduciary proved that acceding \u2022to the demands of the corporation would have constituted an adverse effect on his personal financial interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-7\">. Section 5.3 of the JRLP Agreement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\n<em>Restrictions on Authority</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">A. With respect to the Partnership and the Property, the General Partners shall not have any authority to perform any act in violation of any applicable laws or regulations thereunder, nor shall any General Partner as such, without the Consent of the Limited Partners, have any authority:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-10\">(i) to do any act in contravention of this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">(ii) to do any act which would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">(iii) to possess Partnership property, or assign its rights in specific Partnership property, for other than a Partnership purpose.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b622-13\">. Mr. Clancy\u2019s and Ms. King\u2019s divorce was finalized on January 6, 1999. \u201cIncorporated but not merged\u201d into the divorce decree was a Marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Property Agreement, which did not alter the ownership of the interests of Mr. Clancy and Ms. King in JRLP, but appointed Mr. Clancy as the Partnership's Managing Partner. The Marital Property Agreement also contained a provision which stated that \"[e]ach party shall indemnify and hold the other harmless from all damages, liabilities, losses, costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys and accountants fees and expenses) resulting from such party's breach of this Agreement.\u201d I agree with the majority in that the only basis for the trial court\u2019s award of attorney's fees to Ms. King was a finding that Mr. Clancy breached the Marital Property Agreement, and that the Circuit Court, if confronted with the same motion on remand, should resolve expressly whether the Marital Property Agreement was breached.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
