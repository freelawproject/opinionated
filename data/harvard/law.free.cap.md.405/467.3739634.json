He testified that the back injury prohibited him from returning to work since the accident, but that after his injury he also obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in theology in 2002, was able to drive a car, walk between 30 to 40 minutes without taking a break and do \u201clight work\u201d around the house. He indicated, nevertheless, that, because he could only sit for a certain period of time before needing to lay down, \u201cno job is going to hire me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">American Airlines also presented the videotaped depositions of two medical experts, Dr. Stephen W. Siebert, a psychiatrist, and Dr. Edward R. Cohen, an orthopedic surgeon, who both testified as to their evaluation of Maldonado\u2019 s permanent impairment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Section 9-721. Dr. Siebert testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cbased on impairments in [Maldonado\u2019s] daily activities, in [Maldonado\u2019s] social functioning, in [Maldonado\u2019s] task completion and in what I feel would be [Maldonado\u2019s] likelihood to deteriorate or decompensate in a work situation, I assessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>[Maldonado] to have a mild overall impairment of about 10 percent,\u201d and attributed 5% of the impairment to be directly related to the accident and 5% to other factors. Dr. Cohen testified that Maldonado had a 10% impairment to his lower back because he believed half of the degenerative changes were preexisting and half were attributable to the accident; he further stated that his examination and Maldonado\u2019s complaints revealed \u201cthat [Maldonado] did not have any findings consistent with what we call a radiculopathy\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and that \u201cthere was no evidence of instability in [Maldonado\u2019s] spine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">After the denial of his motion for a directed verdict,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maldonado offered the videotaped depositions of two experts, a psychologist, Dr. Morris Lasson, Ph.D, who testified that Maldonado suffered a 60% impairment, due to psychological problems arising from the injury, including depression, and Dr. Jeffrey D. Gaber, M.D., an internist who testified that he estimated Maldonado to have a 45% impairment due to a disk injury to his back as well as an additional 15% impairment from other problems associated with the accident. Maldonado again moved for a directed verdict at the close of all testimony, and the Judge reserved ruling. After being instructed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>having deliberated, the jury reduced Maldonado\u2019s Commission award by 15%.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> His Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-582,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> based upon the absence of a vocational expert testifying on behalf of American Airlines, was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and similarly before us, Maldonado requests a holding that any party who disputes a Commission decision under \u201cOther cases\u201d industrial loss must present the testimony of a vocational expert during a judicial review proceeding in order to rebut the presumption of correctness of a Commission award. After the Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, declined to so hold, we granted Maldonado\u2019s petition for certiorari, <em>Maldonado v. American Airlines, </em>403 Md. 612, 943 A.2d 1244 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">In his argument, Maldonado relies on <em>Jewel Tea Co. v. Blamble, </em>227 Md. 1, 174 A.2d 764 (1961), and <em>Bullis School v. Justus, </em>37 Md.App. 423, 377 A.2d 876 (1977), for the proposition that expert testimony is required to overturn a decision of the Commission when a complex issue, such as industrial loss, is involved. American Airlines counters Maldonado\u2019s assertion that vocational testimony is required by distinguishing <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 1, 174 A.2d at 764, and offering the reasoning in <em>Terumo Medical Corp. v. Greenway, </em>171 Md. App. 617, 911 A.2d 888 (2006), to undermine Maldonado\u2019s interpretation of the earlier <em>Bullis School </em>Case from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>intermediate appellate court. American Airlines also contends that the evidence in the present case was sufficient for the jury to determine the degree of disability, relying on <em>Getson v. WM Bancorp, </em>346 Md. 48, 694 A.2d 961 (1997), and that additional evidence need not be introduced, citing <em>General Motors Corp. v. Bark, </em>79 Md.App. 68, 555 A.2d 542 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission is empowered to grant awards of compensation for various levels of disability, including permanent partial disability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Permanent partial disability awards are divided into two categories, scheduled injuries<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and unscheduled \u201cOther cases,\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>which compensation for industrial loss<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is determined by the tenets of Section 9-627(k):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">(k) <em>Other </em>cases.\u2014(1) In all cases of permanent partial disability not listed in subsections (a) through (j) of this section, the Commission shall determine the percentage by which the industrial use of the covered employee\u2019s body was impaired as a result of the accidental personal injury or occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">(2) In making a determination under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Commission shall consider factors including: (i) the nature of the physical disability; and the age, experience, occupation, and training of the disabled covered employee when the accidental personal injury or occupational disease occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">(3) The Commission shall award compensation to the covered employee in the proportion that the determined loss bears to 500 weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">(4) Compensation shall be paid to the covered employee at the rates listed for the period in \u00a7\u00a7 9-628 through 9-630 of this Part IV of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Both Maldonado and American Airlines agree that the essence of the issue before us is whether expert vocational testimony on industrial loss is necessary to rebut the presumption of correctness of a workers\u2019 compensation award under Section 9-745(b), which states that in judicial review proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">(l) the decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">(2) the party challenging the decision has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>See Baltimore County v. Kelly, </em>391 Md. 64, 75-76, 891 A.2d 1103, 1109-10 (2006); <em>Ackerhalt v. Hanline Bros., Inc., </em>253 Md. 13, 20, 252 A.2d 1, 5 (1969); <em>Krell v. Md. Drydock Co., </em>184 Md. 428, 435, 41 A.2d 502, 505 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Section 9-745 does not require nor suggest any quantum or type of evidence to overcome the presumption of correctness of a workers\u2019 compensation award. This Court in addressing the burden of proof in a judicial review proceeding of such awards often has iterated that a party challenging the decision need not provide evidence additional to that provided before the Commission to satisfy the burden of proof. <em>Ackerhalt, </em>253 Md. at 21, 252 A.2d at 5; <em>Abell v. Albert F. Goetze, Inc., </em>245 Md. 433, 437, 226 A.2d 253, 256 (1967); <em>Greenwalt v. Brauns Bldg. Specialties Corp., </em>203 Md. 313, 317-18, 100 A.2d 804, 806-07 (1953). Rather, as Judge Thomas B. Finan, writing for this Court in <em>Abell, </em>245 Md. at 437, 226 A.2d at 256, explained, a party challenging the decision can overcome the presumption of correctness of a Commission decision \u201cby submitting new evidence, by relying on all or a part of the record before the Commission, by argument as to the probative value of the evidence and by argument as to the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>See also Ackerhalt, </em>253 Md. at 21, 252 A.2d at 5, and <em>Williams Constr. Co. v. Bohlen, </em>189 Md. 576, 580, 56 A.2d 694, 696 (1948), in which we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">[W]here the Commission has considered conflicting evidence of essential facts, and has drawn one of two different permissible inferences, there may be imposed upon the party attacking the decision of the Commission merely a burden of persuasion, and not necessarily a burden of additional proof____ The provision of the Act placing the burden of proof upon the appellant means only that he must prove in the trial Court what he asserts. His burden is to convince the Court or the jury that the Commission decided incorrectly in interpreting the facts, or deducing the inference from the facts, or construing the law applicable to the facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The gravamen of Maldonado\u2019s argument is that there is a <em>per </em>se requirement for expert vocational testimony in a judicial review proceeding in order to rebut the presumption of correctness of a Commission decision on industrial loss, because industrial loss is such an inherently complicated issue, citing <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>227 Md. at 1, 174 A.2d at 764. In <em>Jewel Tea Co., </em>both parties sought judicial review of a Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission decision that determined the employee was permanently totally disabled, with 60% of the disability being attributed to a work injury and 40% being the result of a pre-existing condition. The lay testimony provided by the employee supported the conclusion that she was permanently totally disabled; all medical testimony presented, including the testimony of the employee\u2019s own medical expert, conflicted with a finding of permanent total disability. We held, with respect to the lay testimony, that \u201clay testimony alone is not justified when the medical question involved is a <em>complicated </em>one, involving fact finding which properly falls within the province of medical experts,\u201d but clearly posited that such a statement \u201cshould not be taken as indicating that we conclude that all awards in cases of injuries of a subjective nature can stand only if accompanied by definitive medical testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7, 174 A.2d at 767 (emphasis added). We, therefore, explicitly stated that we were <em>not </em>establishing a <em>per se </em>requirement for expert testimony when a medical question was involved. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">So, we note, has the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Terumo Medical Corp. v. Greenway, </em>171 Md.App. at 617, 911 A.2d at 888, when addressing whether in <em>Bullis School, </em>37 Md.App. at 423, 377 A.2d at 876, that court had embraced a <em>per se </em>requirement for vocational expert testimony. Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr., writing for the intermediate appellate court in <em>Terumo Medical Corp., </em>specifically repudiated any notion that vocational expert testimony was required under <em>Bull\u00eds School:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXF\">In <em>Bull\u00eds School, </em>of course, we said no such thing. We held that testimony from a vocational expert was admissible. That was it. We did not have before us and we did not discuss any minimal requirements for taking a case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>permanent total disability to the jury. We did not elevate vocational analysis to a <em>sine qua non </em>for a finding of permanent total disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><em>Terumo Med. Corp., </em>171 Md.App. at 639, 911 A.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The notion, delineated in <em>Jewel Tea Co. </em>and <em>Terumo Medical Corp., </em>that expert testimony may be admitted to assist the fact-finder, is reflected in Maryland Rule 5-702, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeL\">Expert testimony <em>may </em>be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">(emphasis added). Obviously, the fact that expert testimony may be admissible, however, is not dispositive of the issue regarding whether it is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Whether, as Maldonado asserts, expert vocational testimony is <em>per se </em>required in every case depends upon whether the factors identified in Section 9-627(k)(2) are so complicated that no jury in any case, regardless of the other evidence presented, would have sufficient evidence upon which to alter a Commission decision without the expert testimony. The factors in Section 9-627(k)(2) include: \u201c(i) the nature of the physical disability; and (ii) the age, experience, occupation, and training of the disabled covered employee when the accidental personal injury or occupational disease occurred.\u201d We have acknowledged that the first factor, \u201cthe nature of the physical disability,\u201d with respect to impairment only, in some cases may necessitate medical testimony of impairment to assist the finder of fact, <em>see Getson, </em>346 Md. at 62, 694 A.2d at 968 (noting that often evaluating physicians provide \u201can assessment of medical impairment\u201d to assist the finder of fact in determining the degree of disability), while never mandating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number><em>sine qua non </em>requirement. The other factors to be considered under Section 9-627(k)(2), \u201cthe age, experience, occupation, and training\u201d of the employee when the accident occurred, moreover, are not so complicated as to require in every case expert vocational testimony to assist the jury in its fact-finding, for as Judge Sally D. Adkins, 'writing for the Court of Special Appeals in this case, aptly noted, \u201cjurors are generally acquainted with matters involving work, vocation, age, experience, training, abilities, salary, and job prospects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Our conclusion that expert vocational testimony is not <em>per se </em>required to determine industrial loss is consistent with cases in our sister jurisdictions in which their courts have had occasion to review workers\u2019 compensation awards. In those cases, no court has determined that expert vocational testimony was a <em>sine qua non </em>for determining industrial loss. <em>See Ex parte Northam, </em>689 So.2d 854, 857 (Ala.1996) (holding that \u201cwhile medical testimony as to an employee\u2019s degree of impairment is probative, as is the testimony of a vocational expert, it is well settled that neither is required\u201d to make a finding of 60% permanent partial disability); <em>Bennett v. Clark Hereford Ranch, </em>106 Idaho 438, 680 P.2d 539, 543 (1984) (iterating that while \u201c \u2018an expert in the area of employment\u2019 \u201d often testifies to prove that the percentage of disability exceeds the percentage of medical impairment, such expert testimony is not required); <em>Copeland v. Johnson Group, Inc., </em>24 Kan.App.2d 306, 944 P.2d 179, 187 (1997) (rejecting the contention that the \u201cextent of permanent partial general disability should be made by a vocational rehabilitation expert\u201d); <em>Haney v. Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons, Co., </em>3 Neb.App. 14, 521 N.W.2d 77, 83 (1994) (declaring that the trial court \u201cdid not need the expert testimony of a vocational rehabilitation counselor to determine earning capacity loss\u201d of 25%); <em>Bituminous Cas. Co. v. Dep\u2019t of Indus., Labor and Human Relations, </em>97 Wis.2d 730, 295 N.W.2d 183, 187 (1980) (holding that the prediction of loss of earning capacity \u201cneed not be presented by an employment expert; a qualified physician and even the department itself can determine the percentage of such disability\u201d). Significantly, even states that purport to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>expert vocational testimony do not have a <em>per se </em>rule that requires such testimony in every case. <em>See Brown v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Knight Ridder, Inc./Phila. Newspapers, Inc.), 856 </em>A.2d 302, 305-06 (Pa.Cmwlth.2004) (stating that although the statute dictates that earning power \u201cshall be based upon expert opinion evidence,\u201d \u201c[ejxpert reports are not necessary in situations ... to prove earning power in an amount shown by credible evidence to have been received\u201d); <em>Caldwell v. John Morrell &amp; Co., </em>489 N.W.2d 353, 362 (S.D. 1992) (acknowledging that while there is a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that testimony of a vocational expert is required, \u201cthere may be cases where an expert\u2019s testimony on loss of use, over and above a medical impairment, may be only advisable rather than essential\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We, therefore, conclude that the testimony of a vocational expert is not a <em>sine qua non </em>requirement to rebut the presumption of correctness of a Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission award of permanent partial disability under \u201cOther cases\u201d industrial loss, nor is expert vocational testimony required in this case, where the jury was presented with sufficient evidence from which to determine industrial loss. Specifically, in terms of the statutory factors listed in Section 9-627(k)(ii), the age, experience, occupation and training of the employee when the accident occurred, Maldonado testified that he was forty-three years old, that at the time of the accident he had been working for American Airlines as a fleet service clerk for fourteen and a half years, that the position required loading, offloading and deicing the plane as well as \u201cpushing the aircraft back when it was ready for departure, [and] giv[ing] hand signals to the aircraft when it was approaching the gate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">There was also adequate evidence upon which the jury could gauge the nature of the physical disability pursuant to Section 9-627(k)(i). The jury heard conflicting testimony from the doctors for each party as to the extent of the Maldonado\u2019s back injury as well as psychological functioning related to the accident. Maldonado himself also provided the jury with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>evidence relevant to this factor; he testified that after sustaining his injuries, he obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002 and that he was able to drive a car, walk between 30 to 40 minutes without taking a break and engage in \u201clight work\u201d around the house, but that because he could only sit for a certain period of time before needing to lay down \u201cno job is going to hire me.\u201d Based on the testimony of the witnesses, including Maldonado, there was sufficient evidence provided on each statutory factor to allow the jury to \u201cassess the extent of the loss of use by considering how the injury has affected the employee\u2019s ability to do his or her job.\u201d <em>Getson, </em>346 Md. at 62, 694 A.2d at 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
