Vol.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When the insurance lapsed, Jordan failed to renew or otherwise surrender evidence of the registration to the Motor Vehicle Administration (\u201cMVA\u201d) as required under Section 17-106 and, pursuant to the same Section, the State of Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>land Central Collection Unit<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (\u201cthe State\u201d), the Petitioner, obtained a judgment against Jordan in the District Court of Maryland for Anne Arundel County. Having noted an appeal to the Circuit Court, Jordan testified that he sold the truck for cash before cancelling the insurance and argued that \u201cthe vehicle was not being driven with those tags without insurance.\u201d The Circuit Court Judge reversed the judgment of the District Court, stating that he found Jordan \u201cto be extremely credible and his testimony compelling,\u201d and that he \u201cunderstood] [that] [Jordan] has these obligations under state law but it seems to me he didn\u2019t knowingly fail to do anything, in fact, [he] thought he had done everything he was supposed to do.\u201d The State petitioned for certiorari, which we granted, to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">Did the circuit court err as a matter of law in finding that because, as it believed, respondent did not intentionally fail to maintain insurance on his motor vehicle registered in the State of Maryland, the MVA could not impose statutory penalties for his failure to maintain insurance on his motor vehicle?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\"><em>Central Collection v. Jordan, </em>402 Md. 623, 938 A.2d 825 (2008).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and hold that Section 17-106 is a strict liability statute that does not require a showing of knowledge or intent to establish a violation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The facts recited in the State\u2019s brief were as follows:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A55\">It is undisputed that during the period of November 30, 2003 through and including September 30, 2005, MVA official records indicated that Jordan was the registered owner of a 1986 GMC truck that was not covered by the required security, i.e., insurance. Although all registered owners are instructed to surrender license tags to MVA upon cancellation of insurance, MVA records also indicate that evidence of the truck\u2019s registration was never surrendered, a fact Jordan and his witness admitted. Nor did Jordan, after being requested to do so, ever respond to MVA\u2019s requests for information concerning the insurance cancellation. Instead, he ignored MVA\u2019s entreaties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The State filed suit against Jordan on September 18, 2006, alleging that he \u201cincurred a debt in the amount of $4,630.00 with the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) for compulsory insurance violation penalties assessed during the period of November 30, 2003 through September 30, 2005.\u201d The complaint further alleged that Jordan owed the State $4,655.00 as well as a 17% collection fee of $791.35, pursuant to Section 3-304 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, Maryland Code (1985, 2006 ReplVol.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and COMAR 17.01.01.07<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for a total amount due of $5,446.35, for which the State allegedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>repeatedly made demand. After trial, the District Court judge entered judgment for the total amount, which the Circuit Court reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Before us, the State argues that the Circuit Court erred in considering intent as an element of Section 17-106 with respect to failure to maintain insurance, because 17-106 is a strict liability statute. Jordan, not having filed a brief, relies on the ruling of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The issue presented in this case is simply whether Section 17-106 is a strict liability statute or one requiring proof of knowledge or intent for a violation thereof. Generally, a violation of a penal statute requires proof of intent, which has, \u201ctraditionally not been limited to the narrow, dictionary definition of purpose, aim, or design, but instead has often been viewed as encompassing much of what would ordinarily be described as knowledge,\u201d while \u201cthe modern approach is to define separately the mental states of knowledge and intent,\u201d so that intent is now defined as \u201cpurpose.\u201d Wayne R. La-Fave, <em>Criminal Law, </em>Section 5.2(b) (4th ed.2003). A strict liability statute, conversely, \u201cdoes not require the State to prove <em>mens rea.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 585, 632 A.2d 797, 804 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always \u201cto discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules.\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 172, 935 A.2d 699, 708 (2007); <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Seay, </em>388 Md. 341, 352, 879 A.2d 1049, 1055 (2005). <em>See also Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Kelly, </em>397 Md. 399, 419-20, 918 A.2d 470, 482 (2007). We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that \u201c \u2018no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 172, 935 A.2d at 708; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 420, 918 A.2d at 482. <em>See also Kane v. Bd. of Appeals of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>390 Md. 145, 167, 887 A.2d 1060, 1073 (2005). If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 708-09; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>City of Frederick v. Pickett, </em>392 Md. 411, 427, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>897 A.2d 228, 237 (2006); <em>Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604-05, 861 A.2d 78, 81 (2004). If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the terms are ambiguous when it is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. <em>Barbre, </em>402 Md. at 173, 935 A.2d at 709; <em>Kelly, </em>397 Md. at 419-20, 918 A.2d at 482; <em>Smack v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>378 Md. 298, 305, 835 A.2d 1175, 1179 (2003). When the statute is part of a larger, statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the \u201cpurpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body,\u201d <em>Serio v. Baltimore County, </em>384 Md. 373, 390, 863 A.2d at 952, 962 (2004); <em>Drew v. First Guar. Mortgage Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003), and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect. <em>Bowen v. City of Annapolis, </em>402 Md. 587, 613-14, 937 A.2d 242, 258 (2007); <em>Magnetti v. Univ. of Md., </em>402 Md. 548, 565, 937 A.2d 219, 229 (2007); <em>Clipper Windpower, Inc. v. Sprenger, </em>399 Md. 539, 554, 924 A.2d 1160, 1168 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Title 17 of the Transportation Article, the lynchpin of the present case, provides the statutory framework for the compulsory insurance law. Section 17-104(b) compels drivers to maintain security: \u201c[t]he owner of a motor vehicle that is required to be registered in this State shall maintain the required security for the vehicle during the registration period,\u201d the form of which is governed by Section 17-103, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">(a) <em>Required form; annual </em>assessment.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the form of security required under this subtitle is a vehicle liability insurance policy written by an insurer authorized to write these policies in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">(2) The Administration may accept another form of security in place of a vehicle liability insurance policy if it finds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the other form of security adequately provides the benefits required by subsection (b) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">(3) The Administration shall, by regulation, assess each self-insurer an annual sum which may not exceed $750, and which shall be used for actuarial studies and audits to determine financial solvency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">(b) <em>Required minimum </em>benefits.\u2014The security required under this subtitle shall provide for at least:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">(1) The payment of claims for bodily injury or death arising from an accident of up to $20,000 for any one person and up to $40,000 for any two or more persons, in addition to interest and costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">(2) The payment of claims for property of others damaged or destroyed in an accident of up to $15,000, in addition to interest and costs;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">(3) Unless waived, the benefits described under \u00a7 19-505 of the Insurance Article as to basic required primary coverage; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">(4) The benefits required under \u00a7 19-509 of the Insurance Article as to required additional coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Section 17-106<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides penalties for failing to maintain the required form of insurance on a motor vehicle and states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>(d) <em>Owner to surrender evidences of </em>registration.\u2014(1) Within 48 hours after an owner is notified by the Administration of the suspension of registration, the owner shall surrender all evidences of that registration to the Administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">(2) If the owner fails to surrender the evidences of registration within the 48-hour period, the Administration:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">(i) Shall attempt to recover from the owner the evidences of registration; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">(ii) May suspend his license to drive until he returns to the Motor Vehicle Administration the evidences of registration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">(3) The Administration may enter into contracts with private parties to procure the services of independent agents to assist in the recovery of the evidences of registration as authorized in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>(e) Penalties.\u2014(l)(i) In addition to any other penalty provided for in the Maryland Vehicle Law, if the required security for a vehicle terminates or otherwise lapses during its registration year, the Administration may assess the owner of the vehicle with a penalty of $150 for each vehicle without the required security for a period of 1 to 30 days. If a tine is assessed, beginning on the 31st day the fine shall increase by a rate of $7 for each day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">(ii) Each period during which the required security for a vehicle terminates or otherwise lapses shall constitute a separate violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">(iii) The penalty imposed under this subsection may not exceed $2,500 for each violation in a 12-month period.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Section 17-107 follows the statute at issue and prohibits driving or allowing others to drive an uninsured vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">(a) <em>Vehicles not covered by required </em>security.\u2014A person who knows or has reason to know that a motor vehicle is not covered by the required security may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">(1) Drive the vehicle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">(2) If he is an owner of the vehicle, knowingly permit another person to drive it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">(b) <em>Evidence of violation of subsection </em>(a).\u2014(1) In any prosecution under subsection (a) of this section the introduction of the official records of the Motor Vehicle Administration showing the absence of a record that the vehicle is covered by the security required under \u00a7 17-104 of this subtitle shall be prima facie evidence that a person knows or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>has reason to know that a motor vehicle is not covered by the required security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">(2) The introduction of evidence of the records of the Administration may not limit the introduction of other evidence bearing upon whether the vehicle was covered by the required security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">(c) <em>Defense of sovereign </em>immunity.\u2014An owner or lessee of any motor vehicle registered under Title 13 of this article may not raise the defense of sovereign or governmental immunity as described under \u00a7 5-524 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">In the present case, Section 17-106 is silent as to whether knowledge or intent is a required element for a violation thereof. The absence of such language in a statute, however, does not necessarily make it a strict liability offense. <em>See Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 619, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 1804, 128 L.Ed.2d 608, 624 (1994) (\u201cSilence does not suggest that Congress dispensed with <em>mens rea </em>for the element of \u00a7 5861(d) at issue here.\u201d); <em>Outmezguine v. State, </em>335 Md. 20, 42, 641 A.2d 870, 881 (1994) (noting that in certain cases, \u201cthe Legislature, despite an omission, intended to provide a <em>mens rea </em>requirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In <em>Outmezguine, </em>335 Md. at 20, 42, 641 A.2d at 870, we were called upon to determine whether Section 419A (c) of Article 27, Maryland Code (1957,1992 RepLVol.), which penalized photographing or filming a minor engaging in an obscene act or sexual conduct, was a strict liability statute or not. We determined that the statute did not require proof of knowledge or intent for its violation, after we reviewed its plain language, bulwarked by a review of its legislative history. Chief Judge Robert Murphy, writing for the Court, contrasted the Section under scrutiny, Section 419A (c), with Sections 419A (b) and (d) of Article 27, penalizing, respectively, soliciting, causing to induce, or permitting a minor to engage, as the subject, in the production of. any obscene matter, and promoting, distributing, or possessing with the intent to distribute any matter depicting a minor engaged, as a subject, in sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>conduct, which each contained knowingly requirements and concluded that the absence of such a scienter requirement reflected a \u201cpurposeful design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 44, 641 A.2d at 882. In support, he reflected upon the statutory Section\u2019s legislative history, as explicated by the Court of Special Appeals, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">It is therefore clear, both from the plain language of \u00a7 419A and from the statute\u2019s legislative history, that knowledge as to the minor\u2019s age is not an element of the offense under \u00a7 419A (c). Not so clear is whether the Legislature intended to make this offense a strict liability crime or whether it intended to provide a reasonable mistake of age defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD7l\"><em>Id. </em>at 45, 641 A.2d at 882-88. <em>See also Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 651, 547 A.2d 1041, 1047 (1988) (concluding, based partly on the relevant statutory scheme, that knowledge is an element of possession of a controlled dangerous substance and possession of controlled paraphernalia, although not explicitly set forth in the statute); <em>Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 585-88, 632 A.2d at 804-05 (holding that silence as to <em>mens rea </em>for statutory rape stood in stark contrast to another crime codified in the same Section, that of having vaginal intercourse with an incapacitated or helpless person, which included a <em>mens rea </em>element, and concluding that such an absence, coupled with the drafting history of the statute, reflected an intent on the part of the Legislature to omit a <em>mens rea </em>requirement for statutory rape).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Significantly, Section 17-107 relates to the required security on a motor vehicle and explicitly prohibits a person who <em>knows </em>or has reason to <em>know </em>a motor vehicle is uninsured to drive the vehicle or <em>\u201cknowingly </em>permit another person to drive it.\u201d (emphasis added). The Legislature chose to include a <em>mens rea </em>requirement in Section 17-107, while not providing such a requirement in Section 17-106, even though Section 17-106 was renumbered and revised by the same Bill that enacted Section 17-107. <em>See </em>1977 Maryland Laws, Chapter 14. The Legislature\u2019s omission of a <em>mens rea </em>requirement in 17-106, therefore, leads us to conclude that the Legislature deliberately chose not to make knowledge an element of the offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>maintaining the required security on an automobile. <em>See Outmezguine, </em>335 Md. at 45, 641 A.2d at 882-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">This conclusion is bulwarked by our analyses of other regulatory strict liability offenses in various previous cases. Regulatory strict liability mandates, which are premised on the police power of the State, emerged in both the United States and England in the 19th Century in order to \u201cprotect the public health and welfare.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 644, 547 A.2d at 1043. In <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 255-56, 72 S.Ct. 240, 246, 96 L.Ed. 288, 296 (1952), the United States Supreme Court explicated that \u201c[tjhese cases do not fit neatly into any of such accepted classifications of common-law offenses, such as those against the state, the person, property, or public morals\u201d and that many of these regulatory strict liability offenses \u201care not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions, with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty.\u201d In fact, violations of these regulations may \u201cresult in no direct or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it which the law seeks to minimize.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 256, 72 S.Ct. at 246, 96 L.Ed. at 296. Notably, the Court concluded with respect to regulatory strict liability statutes that, \u201cwhatever the intent of the violator, the injury is the same, and the consequences are injurious or not according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to fortuity. <em>Hence, legislation applicable to such offenses, as a matter of policy, does not specify intent as a necessary element.\u201d Id. </em>at 256, 72 S.Ct. at 246, 96 L.Ed. at 296-97. (emphasis added). Clearly, 17-106 is a regulatory statute, as defined by its purpose, that being that \u201cenforcement of this State\u2019s compulsory insurance laws is important to the well-being and safety of the citizens of this State\u201d and \u201cthe growing number of uninsured motorists in this State is a serious concern.\u201d 1983 Maryland Laws, Chapter 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">We also have considered, when determining whether a statute is a strict liability one, in addition to the characteristic of being regulatory in nature, what type of penalty provision is included and whether the defendant is \u201cgenerally in a position to prevent the violation from occurring,\u201d regardless of his or her state of mind. <em>State v. McCallum, </em>321 Md. 451, 457, 583 A.2d 250, 253 (1991). <em>See also Owens v. State, </em>352 Md. 663, 678, 724 A.2d 43, 50 (1999) (\u201c[C]ourts have considered the substantiality of the penalty imposed by a statute in determining whether a statute includes a mens rea element....\u201d). In evaluating the penalty provision set forth for violation of the compulsory insurance law, we note that only a monetary fine is a sanction, not incarceration. <em>See McCallum, </em>321 Md. at 457, 583 A.2d at 253 (stating that the possibility of incarceration for violating a statute suggests that the legislature intended it to have a <em>mens rea </em>requirement); <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 651, 547 A.2d at 1047 (evaluating the penalty, which includes up to four years in prison, a $25,000 fine or both and concluding, based partly on the nature of the penalty, that the offense was not a strict liability crime). <em>See also Staples, </em>511 U.S. at 618-19, 114 S.Ct. at 1804, 128 L.Ed.2d at 624 (noting that \u201ca severe penalty is a ... factor tending to suggest that Congress did not intend to eliminate a <em>mens rea </em>requirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The statutory penalty in the present case consists of a $150.00 fee for a vehicle registered without the required security for a period of 1 to 30 days and $7.00 per day thereafter. Section 17-106(e)(l)(i). Significantly, the statute provides that the sanction \u201cmay not exceed $2,500 for each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>violation in a 12-month period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (e)(l)(iii). Providing for such a cap and a daily fee to encourage compliance is consistent with the goal of regulatory strict liability statutes, which is to \u201cregulate rather than to punish behavior.\u201d <em>See Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 645, 547 A.2d at 1044, citing <em>People v. Vogel, </em>46 Cal.2d 798, 299 P.2d 850, 853 n. 2 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Whether \u201c \u2018the defendant is generally in a position to prevent the violation from occurring\u2019 \u201d is a third consideration in the determination of whether a statute engenders strict liability characteristics. <em>McCallum, </em>321 Md. at 457, 583 A.2d at 253, quoting <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 645, 547 A.2d at 1044. In <em>McCallum, </em>the defendant contended, as a defense to the charge of driving on a suspended license, that he had no notice of the suspension of his license. We iterated, in concluding that the statute was not a strict liability offense, that the defendant \u201cwould have no reason to avoid driving and no reason to suspect that he was endangering the public by driving if he had no knowledge that his driving privileges were suspended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Conversely, in the present case, Jordan had the ability both to prevent the violation from occurring as well as recurring on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Upon a consideration of the larger statutory context in which Section 17-106 appears, as well as the Section\u2019s regulatory purpose, the extent of the penalty involved and whether its violator is generally in a position to prevent the offense, it is evident that Section 17-106 is a strict liability statute that does not require a showing of knowledge or intent for a violation thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED; STAY REMOVED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE DISTRICT COURT; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-13\">.
