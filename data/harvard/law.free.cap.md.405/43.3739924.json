Heeding that principle, we shall decide only the questions of law integral to the necessary holdings in the instant case, based on the questions properly presented in the successful petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">On 24 September 2002, Washington Management and Development Company, Inc.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied to the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) for approval of a preliminary plan of subdivision (the \u201cPreliminary Plan\u201d) for 47 residential lots<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Prince George\u2019s County.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The proposed subdivision (the \u201cProperty\u201d) consisted of 236.45 acres along Bald Eagle Road and is located in the so-called planned Rural Tier of Prince George\u2019s County, as defined by the 2002 Prince George\u2019s County Approved General Plan (the \u201cGeneral Plan\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Planning Board approved the Prelimi-</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>nary Plan at a hearing on 20 February 2003, subject to certain conditions not relevant here. The Planning Board expressed its approval and the bases therefore in a Resolution adopted on 27 March 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">A group of area residents, individually and collectively referred to as the Greater Baden Aquasco Citizens Association (collectively, \u201cPetitioners\u201d), filed, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s action. The Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the Planning Board. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion (hereinafter referred to as <em>Archers Glen I, </em>for convenience), a panel of the intermediate appellate court held that the Planning Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>failed to articulate sufficiently the findings in support of its conclusion that the Preliminary Plan conformed to the recommendations of the Master Plan. The Court of Special Appeals vacated the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment and directed that the case be remanded to the Planning Board for further proceedings. Although \u201c[rjesolving [the] issue [was] unnecessary\u201d to the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding, the court chose to comment on the parties\u2019 dispute regarding \u201cwhether the Planning Board was required to consider the subdivisiones] compliance with both the General Plan and the Master Plan, or only the Master Plan.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">In an attempt to avoid the expense and delay of additional appeals, we offer the following guidance for the parties to the action on remand. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We first address whether the subdivision plan must comply with both the General Plan and Master Plan, or only the Master Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">In Prince George\u2019s County, development is guided by a county-wide General Plan, which operates in concert with several subregion-specific Master Plans. In land use cases generally, neither type of plan imposes mandatory criteria with which plans such as the Developer\u2019s must comply, but in Prince George\u2019s County, \u00a7 24-121(a)(5) of the County Code\u2019s Subdivision Regulations requires subdivision plans to \u201cconform to the area master plan.\u201d <em>See Coffey v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>293 Md. 24[, 441 A.2d 1041] (1982). That section of the code, however, does not expressly state that subdivision plans must conform to the General Plan, as opposed to the Master Plan. On the basis of that omission, appellees argue that subdivision plans need not conform to the General Plan. Appellants present no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>counter-argument, but they argue that appellees\u2019 theory amounts to an after-the-fact rationalization that did not form the basis of the Planning Board\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">Section 24-103(a) of the Subdivision Regulations declares, \u201cIt is ... the policy of Prince George\u2019s County to consider the subdivision of land ... as subject to the control of the County, pursuant to the General Plan, for the orderly, planned, efficient, and economical development of the County.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 24-104(a)(2) then states that one of the purposes of the Subdivision Regulations is \u201c[t]o guide development according to the General Plan, area master plans, and their amendments.\u201d Clearly, the General Plan was intended, in some way, to guide the subdivision of land in Prince George\u2019s County, notwithstanding the absence of the phrase \u201cGeneral Plan\u201d from \u00a7 24-121(a)(5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">The Master Plan, which all parties agree does apply to this subdivision, provides, \u201cThe Subregion YI Study Area Master Plan is in accordance with the General Plan, with the exception of the following which constitute amendments thereto.\u201d Thus, the Master Plan accepts the planning policies of the General Plan as being appropriate guides to development in the particular subregion, and to the extent that the General Plan\u2019s guidance is inappropriate for a locality, the Master Plan rejects and amends the General Plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">Given the policies and purposes of the Subdivision Regulations, as stated in \u00a7\u00a7 24-103(a) and 24-104(a)(2), that subdivision developments in Prince George\u2019s County be guided by the General Plan, it would make little sense if, under \u00a7 24-121(a)(5), compliance with the General Plan were not a prerequisite to subdividing land.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">Under appellees\u2019 theory, those portions of the General Plan with which the Master Plans did not disagree (i.e., those portions that were appropriate for the subregion), and therefore did not amend, would not be applied to subdivision plans. This nonsensical result is eliminated by the explanatory language in the Master Plan: \u201cThe ... Master Plan is in accordance with the General Plan, with the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of the following which constitute amendments thereto.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By that statement, the Master Plan expressly incorporates into itself the substance of the General Plan (except as amended by the Master Plan), thereby retaining, for application to subdivisions under \u00a7 24-121(a)(5), those portions of the General Plan deemed appropriate to the subregion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-4\"><em>The parties apparently did not litigate this issue before the Planning Board, and the Board did not expressly decide the issue in its decision. Because we are vacating the judgment and remanding the case, ultimately, to the Planning Board, and given the fact that the issue was not litigated within the Planning Board, we find it unnecessary, and inappropriate under the circumstances, to definitively resolve how the General Plan should apply under the Subdivision Regulations. Pursuant to our remand, the parties will ham an opportunity to revisit this issue in light of the above comments. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On remand, the Planning Board held another public hearing, on 23 June 2005, regarding the Preliminary Plan. Following the hearing, the Planning Board approved the Preliminary Plan anew, again with certain conditions not relevant here. On 29 September 2005, the Planning Board adopted an Amended Resolution evidencing the reasons for its approval of the Preliminary Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Petitioners filed a second petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court. The Developer and the Commission responded to the petition, indicating their intent to participate in the litigation. On 2 June 2006, the Circuit Court remanded the case to the Planning Board for \u201cfurther specific and factually supported consideration^] and findings\u201d regarding the Preliminary Plan\u2019s conformance to the recommendations of the General Plan as \u201cincorporated in the Master Plan when not thereby contradicted or amended.\u201d Specifically, the Circuit Court held that the Planning Board needed to make specific findings regarding the \u201cnumber of new dwelling units constructed and projected to be constructed between 2000 and 2025 in the whole of Prince George\u2019s County; the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>dwelling units already approved for construction in the Rural tier of Prince George\u2019s County; and whether the addition of 46 new dwelling units in the Rural Tier will cause growth in the Rural Tier since 2000 to exceed 0.75-1.00% of overall projected dwelling unit growth.\u201d The Developer and the Commission jointly filed a timely Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">A panel of the Court of Special Appeals different than the one that decided <em>Archers Glen I </em>reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court, in a reported opinion. <em>Archers Glen Partners, Inc. v. Garner, </em>176 Md.App. 292, 933 A.2d 405 (2007) <em>(Archers Glen II). </em>In the Court of Special Appeals on this occasion, Petitioners argued for the first time that the Commission lacked standing to participate in the judicial review of its own decision. The intermediate appellate court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Petitioners also contended that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s unreported opinion in <em>Archers Glen I </em>discussing the potential legal effect to be accorded the General Plan in the subdivision process <em>(supra </em>at 50-51, 494 A.2d at 643-44) served as the \u201claw of the case,\u201d and thus, the recommendations of the General Plan were binding on the Planning Board in considering and acting on the Preliminary Plan. The intermediate appellate court, however, held, in <em>Archers Glen II, </em>that <em>Archers Glen I </em>did not decide the issue of whether the General Plan was binding, and thus, the law of the case doctrine did not apply. The Court of Special Appeals went on to hold that the Planning Board had \u201cdiscretion to determine whether the preliminary subdivision plan conformed ... to the goals, objectives, policies, and strategies in the General Plan.\u201d Finally, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the Planning Board\u2019s approval of the Preliminary Plan was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">We granted Petitioners\u2019 petition for a Writ of Certiorari to consider only two questions, which we rephrase slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">1. May the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board participate as a party in a judicial review of its decision approving a Preliminary Plan for a residential development?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>2. Does the law of the case doctrine apply to a Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in the same proceeding which addresses a legal question pursuant to Md. Rule 8-131(a) in order to provide \u201cguidance\u201d and \u201cto avoid the expense and delay of additional appeals\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><em>Garner v. Archers Glen, </em>403 Md. 304, 941 A.2d 1104 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Standing of the Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The issue of the Commission\u2019s standing has not been preserved. Petitioners did not raise the issue of standing in the Circuit Court, either in <em>Archers Glen I </em>or <em>Archers Glen II.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Maryland Rule 8-131(a) provides that \u201c[o]rdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d <em>See Dorsey v. Bethel A.M.E. Church, </em>375 Md. 59, 71, 825 A.2d 388, 395 (2003) (\u201c[A]ny dispute concerning [the plaintiffs\u2019] standing should have been raised and litigated in the Circuit Court, not the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d); <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Ass\u2019n v.

Howard Res. &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>278 Md. 417, 424-25, 365 A.2d 34, 38 (1976)); <em>Bowman Group v.

After examination of the record, we choose not to exercise our discretion and decline to review the issue of Moser\u2019s standing to contest the rezoning.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Petitioners conceded at oral argument before us that a challenge to the standing of the Commission was not raised in the Circuit Court, but argued that the Developer and the Commission had not asserted Petitioners\u2019 waiver of the standing challenge in the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Archers Glen II. </em>In essence, according to Petitioners, the Commission and the Developer waived their right to assert Petitioners\u2019 waiver as a defense to the Commission\u2019s lack of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">It \u201cis a settled principle of Maryland law that, \u2018where there exists a party having standing to bring an action ... we shall not ordinarily inquire as to whether another party on the same side also has standing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sugarloaf Citizens\u2019 Ass\u2019n v.

City of Balt., </em>274 Md. 597, 602, 337 A.2d 92, 96 (1975). Our traditional reluctance to address issues of standing not necessary to the outcome of a case is highlighted in <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, </em>323 Md. 641, 650 n. 6, 594 A.2d 1115, 1119 n. 6 (1991). There we declined to address a possible standing issue because it was unnecessary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>noting \u201c[i]n light of our decision on the merits, we need not and do not reach any issue of standing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In the present case, Petitioners concede that \u201cthe Developer has standing to appeal.\u201d We ordinarily do not decide issues of standing not raised in the trial court. Similarly, we ordinarily do not decide issues of standing where it is undisputed that one party on each side of the litigation has standing. Thus, we decline Petitioner\u2019s invitation to address the issue of standing where unnecessary to do so in order to decide the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The Law of The Case</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Petitioners contend that the noted portion from the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s unreported opinion in <em>Archers Glen I, supra </em>at 4-6, directed to the legal effect of the General Plan in the subdivision review process, established the \u201claw of the case\u201d and bound the Commission on remand. The \u201c \u2018law of the case doctrine is one of appellate procedure.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott v.

Although it is somewhat unclear from the record before us, it appears that Archers Glen Partners, Inc., owned the land for which a subdivision application was filed that triggered this litigation.

The current General Plan parses the land mass of Prince George's County into three tiers: the Developed Tier; the Developing Tier; and the Rural Tier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">. Although we shall not decide here any issue regarding the legal effect of the recommendations of the General Plan in the subdivision review process, the parties\u2019 apparent dispute over that point looms in the background. In an effort to address its \"Smart Growth\u201d policies, the Prince George's County Council, sitting as the District Council for that part of the regional district in the County, in 1998, created \"Commission 2000,\u201d a 53-member panel, to study and recommend a new comprehensive growth management plan. The final product of the work of Commission 2000, the Biennial Growth Policy Plan, served as an interim planning document until the former General Plan could be amended companionably. \"The approved General Plan builds on recommendations of the Biennial Growth Policy Plan adopted by the Prince George\u2019s County Council in November 2000 and prepared with the assistance of Commission 2000.... The preliminary General Plan was released in February 2002, adopted by the Planning Board in May 2002, and approved by the Prince George\u2019s County Council, sitting as the District Council, in October 2002.\u201d Foreword, 2002 Prince George\u2019s County Approved General Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">An \"area master plan\u201d differs from the General Plan. Master plans govern a specific, smaller portion of the County and are often more detailed in their recommendations than the countywide General Plan as to that same area. In the present case, the Property lies in Planning Area 87A, addressed by the Subregion VI Study Area Approved Master Plan (1993) (the \u201cMaster Plan\u201d). Prince George's County Code \u00a7 27-684.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The relationship between the various levels of planning and regulation-the subdivision regulations, the Master Plan, the General Plan, and the Biennial Growth Policy Plan-is disputed by the parties. Petitioners contend that the General Plan imposed binding requirements which must be complied with if the Preliminary Plan is to be approved. The Developer and the Commission see it otherwise. Prince George\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>County Code \u00a7 24-121(a)(5) states that a proposed subdivision \"plat shall conform to the area master plan, including maps and text, unless the Planning Board finds that events have occurred to render the relevant plan recommendations no longer appropriate or the District Council has not imposed the recommended zoning.\" Thus, it is clear that the Preliminary Plan must conform to the recommendations in the Master Plan. That section, however, does not expressly require conformance to the General Plan. Prince George\u2019s County Code \u00a7 24-104(a)(2) notes, perhaps in contrast to \u00a7 24-121(a)(5), that the purposes of the subdivision regulations are to \"guide development <em>according to ike General Plan, </em>area master plans, and their amendments.\" (emphasis added). Furthermore, the Master Plan states that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, the \u201cSubregion VI Study Area Master Plan is in accordance with the General Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The relationship between the various planning and regulatory documents is not without practical significance. Most relevant to the present case, the various plans potentially conflict on the amount of growth that should be permitted in the Rural Tier designated areas of Prince George\u2019s County. The Biennial Growth Policy Plan states as a \"Growth Objective\u201d that Prince George\u2019s County should \"[sjlow dwelling unit growth within the Rural Tier to <em>0.75 percent </em>of total Countywide dwelling unit growth over the next 20 years.\u201d (emphasis added). By contrast the \"growth objective of the [General Plan] is that 33 percent of the county\u2019s residential growth over the next 25 years is to be located in the Developed Tier, 66 percent in the Developing Tier, and <em>one percent in the Rural Tier.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) Executive Summary, 2002 Prince George\u2019s County Approved General Plan. The Subregion VI Study Area Approved Master Plan contains no objective or requirement regarding the percentage of countywide growth that should take place in the Rural Tier within its portion of the County. Nonetheless, the Master Plan notes that it \"is in accordance with the General Plan.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">. Maryland Rule 8-131(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">The issues of jurisdiction of the trial court over the subject matter and, unless waived under Rule 2-322, over a person may be raised in and decided by the appellate court whether or not raised in and decided by the trial court. Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">.
