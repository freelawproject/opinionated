We are asked to determine whether Lilly owed a duty to Mr. Gourdine, the third-party who did not ingest the drugs. Petitioner, Mary Gourdine, the wife of Mr. Gourdine, argues that it was foreseeable for Lilly that Ms. Crews, allegedly suffering an adverse reaction to the medications, would cause injury and death to third persons while she was operating a motor vehicle, when she had not been adequately warned about the dangers that allegedly were associated with the specified medications, and that such foreseeability, thus, created a duty owed to Mr. Gourdine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The certiorari questions presented are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>1.

Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">On the morning of February 25, 2002, Ms. Crews took a combination of Humalog, a quick-acting form of insulin taken with meals, and Humulin N (or \u201cHumulin NPH\u201d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a medication designed to supply a constant source of insulin to the body, both of which were manufactured by Lilly, and prescribed by Ms. Crews\u2019 doctor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> While driving from Baltimore to College Park, Ms. Crews hit an automobile driven by Isaac J. Gourdine; the force of the collision caused Mr. Gourdine\u2019s car to leave the highway and crash into a tractor-trailer, leaving him with a mortal head wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">On January 7, 2005, Ms. Gourdine, individually, and as Personal Representative of the Estate of Mr. Gourdine, and as Next Friend of Monica J. Gourdine and Lamar T. Gourdine, their two children, filed a Complaint for Wrongful Death and Survival Action and for Compensatory and Punitive Damages for Sale of a Defective Product, Fraud, Conscious Misrepresentation, Negligence and Breach of Warranty, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Lilly, as well as a number of other individuals and companies who are not implicated in the present appeal. In the Complaint, Ms. Gourdine contended that, at the time of the accident, Ms. Crews suffered a hypoglycemic<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reaction and experienced a \u201cblackout\u201d causing her to lose control of her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Against Lilly, several theories of liability were posited, based upon Ms. Gourdine\u2019s contention that the combination of Humalog and Humulin N caused increased rates of hypoglycemia, neuroglycopenia and drowsiness between 6 a.m. and noon and that Lilly knowingly failed to include a warning of such possibilities in its labeling and advertising. In Count 1, \u201cstrict liability in tort for sale of a misbranded drug with false and misleading advertising and labeling,\u201d Ms. Gourdine alleged that the Humalog label at the time it was sold was \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d because \u201cit boast[ed] on one hand that patients such as Defendant Crews, who had Type I diabetes, had fewer hypoglycemic episodes between midnight and 6 a.m. while on the other hand ignoring the fact that most episodes with both of the constituent insulins contained in the Humalog mixtures tested occurred during mid-day and that a substantial number of the hypoglycemic reactions experienced by type I diabetics occurred without warning at mid-day.\u201d Ms. Gourdine alleged that Lilly owed a duty to her husband, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">77. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant Lilly had a duty imposed by statute and the common law to warn users of the drug Humalog of the risks to which the drug as compounded and its constituent drugs exposed persons who consumed them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">78. Decedent Isaac J. Gourdine, as a user of the highway, was in the class of persons the statute and regulations of the FDA that Lilly violated intended to protect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">79. Defendant Lilly, therefore, owed a duty to protect users of the highway from drivers suffering from hypoglycemia induced by Defendant Lilly\u2019s misbranded drug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-7\">80. It was foreseeable that a Type I diabetic suffering from neuroglycopenia caused by hypoglycemia would cause injury and death to third persons while operating a motor vehicle on a highway if the diabetic was not warned of the period of greatest vulnerability for drowsy driving. Such information would enable Type I diabetics to take proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>precautions before operating an automobile during this period of maximum vulnerability for drowsiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">In Count 2, \u201cnegligent failure to warn of dangers associated with the use of the drug Humalog as directed,\u201d Ms. Gourdine alleged, similarly, that \u201cLilly breached its duty by failing to warn consumers that a high percentage of Type I diabetics were at greatly increased risk of drug-induced hypoglycemia, neuroglycopenia and drowsiness at mid-day\u201d; with respect to the duty violated by Lilly, Ms. Gourdine repeated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">86. At all times relevant hereto, Defendant Lilly had a duty imposed by statute and the common law to warn users of the drug Humalog of the risks to which they were exposed by the drug as compounded and its constituent drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">87. Decedent Isaac J. Gourdine, as a user of the highway, was in the class of persons the statute and regulations of the FDA that defendant Lilly violated intended to protect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">In Count 3, \u201cconscious misrepresentation and fraud,\u201d Ms. Gourdine alleged that \u201cLilly published, or caused to be published, ... statements that failed to disclose that Humalog and the Humalog mixtures containing Humulin NPH tested were most likely to be associated with hypoglycemia and drowsiness at mid-day while boasting that Humalog was associated with lower nighttime hypoglycemia,\u201d that Lilly knew the statements to be untrue or that Lilly did not have proof that they were true, and that Ms. Crews and her physician \u201crelied on Defendant Lilly\u2019s misrepresentations and Defendant Crew\u2019s drove her automobile at mid-day without taking the proper precautions against undetected hypoglycemia and drowsiness, resulting in the accident which killed Isaac J. Gourdine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ACe\">Lilly subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because \u201cLilly did not owe a duty to warn Mr. Gourdine, who did not use or consume Lilly\u2019s insulin products,\u201d \u201cLilly made no representations to Mr. Gourdine, a non-user, and therefore essential elements of fraud are lacking,\u201d and that \u201cwithout a basis to claim fraud, plaintiffs punitive damages claim fails.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Lilly also contended that because the United States Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) approved the warnings for Lilly\u2019s insulin products, the \u201cfailure to warn claim is preempted as a matter of federal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Ms. Gourdine responded and asserted that Lilly owed a duty to Mr. Gourdine to adequately warn Ms. Crews about the risks of the combination of Humalog and Humulin N because it was foreseeable for Lilly that Ms. Crews, allegedly suffering an adverse reaction to the medications, would cause injury and death to third persons while she was operating a motor vehicle, when she had not been adequately warned about the dangers that allegedly were associated with the specified medications, citing <em>Valk Manufacturing Co. v. Rangaswamy, </em>74 Md.App. 304, 537 A.2d 622 (1988), for the proposition that a cause of action in negligence and strict liability may be sustained by a bystander injured as a result of a defective product.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">The Honorable Steven I. Platt of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, after a hearing on the matter, granted Lilly\u2019s motion for summary judgment and subsequently filed a memorandum opinion in which he determined that, \u201cPlaintiffs have not raised any disputes as to material facts, and Defendant Eli Lilly is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, because Eli Lilly did not owe a duty to Mr. Gourdine, and because Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to warn claim is pre-empted by federal law.\u201d Judge Platt stated that \u201cthe issue is what duty is owed the public by a drug manufacturer in a failure to warn case,\u201d and concluded that under the \u201clearned intermediary\u201d doctrine,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> no duty is owed to a non-patient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>The existence of a legal duty is a question of law, to be decided by the court. <em>Doe v. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., Inc., </em>388 Md. 407, 414, 879 A.2d 1088, 1092 (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">In this case, the issue is what duty is owed the public by a drug manufacturer in a failure to warn case. With respect to prescription drugs, Maryland courts have adopted the \u201cLearned Intermediary Rule,\u201d which states that a prescription drug manufacturer has a duty to warn physicians of potential risks associated with taking a drug, but does not have a duty to warn patients. <em>Hunt v. Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., </em>785 F.Supp. 547, 550 (D.Md.1992). It follows that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer does not have a duty to give patients using their products warnings, they do not have a duty to warn the people with whom those patients interact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-7\">Plaintiffs concede in their Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment that Eli Lilly had no duty to warn Mr. Gourdine directly. Instead they argue that it was foreseeable that not warning patients of an increased risk of hypoglycemia between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m. could cause people to suffer from hypoglycemia or neuroglycopenia, and if that occurred while the patient was driving a vehicle, that they could seriously injure other users of the road. Plaintiffs argue that this foreseeability extends a duty to users of the road and so to Mr. Gourdine. This Court declines to extend that duty to Eli Lilly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">Instead this trial court echoes what the Maryland Court of Appeals said in <em>Doe v. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., Inc., </em>388 Md. 407, 879 A.2d 1088 (2005), \u201cthe imposition of a duty of care in this case would create an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 879 A.2d at 1096. In <em>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, </em>the plaintiff was the wife of a laboratory technician who had contracted HIV from his employment in a laboratory. The Court held that the employer did not owe a duty to the wife, because that would create an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs, including spouses, sexual partners, and then anyone the employee could possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>bly pass the disease onto. Certainly, if this were an indeterminate class of people, then expanding duty to users of the highway, as Plaintiffs strenuously urge this Court to do in the instant case, would create an equally large and amorphous indeterminate class of Plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-5\">Plaintiffs would have us interpret <em>Valk Mfg. Co. v. Rangaswamy </em>as authority to impose a liability on Eli Lilly on this case. <em>Id., </em>74 Md.App. 304, 537 A.2d 622 (1988). In <em>Rangaswamy, </em>the Court held that \u201cbystanders ... are protected under the doctrine of strict liability in tort.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 537 A.2d at 632. However, in the sentence immediately preceding, the <em>Rangaswamy </em>Court cited W. Keeton, <em>Prosser and Keeton on Torts </em>704 (5th ed. 1984), to explain that the effect of an expanded duty to bystanders was to put \u201cstrict liability on the same footing as negligence, as to all foreseeable injuries.\u201d <em>Rangaswamy, </em>74 Md.App. at 323, 537 A.2d at 632. It is this Court\u2019s opinion in this case, that Eli Lilly did not owe a duty to Plaintiffs even in the negligence claim, and so <em>Rangaswamy </em>does not aid Plaintiffs in their strict liability claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">(Footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Ms. Gourdine noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in a reported opinion. <em>Gourdine v. Crews, </em>177 Md.App. 471, 935 A.2d 1146 (2007). The intermediate appellate court concluded that the trial court did not err in granting Lilly\u2019s motion for summary judgment because \u201c[Lilly] has no duty to warn a nonuser such as Gourdine\u201d under the \u201clearned intermediary\u201d doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">With respect to prescription drugs, \u201cMaryland law recognizes the \u2018learned intermediary\u2019 doctrine, which provides that manufacturers need only warn the prescribing physician and not the patient directly.\u201d <em>Ames v. Apothecon, Inc., </em>431 F.Supp.2d 566, 572 (D.Md.2006); <em>see also Nolan v. Dillon, </em>261 Md. 516, 523, 276 A.2d 36 (1971). Stated alternatively, under the learned intermediary doctrine, the manufacturer of a prescription drug has no duty to directly warn patients. Diane S. Kane, Annotation, Construction and Application op Learned-Intermediary Doctrine, 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>A.L.R. 5th 1 (1998). It follows, therefore, that since there is no duty on the part of prescription drug manufacturers to directly warn users of the drug of possible adverse effects, the manufacturer has no duty to warn a nonuser such as Gourdine. <em>See Kirk v. Michael Reese Hosp. &amp; Med. Ctr., </em>117 Ill.2d 507, 111 Ill.Dec. 944, 513 N.E.2d 387, 393 (1987) (applying the learned intermediary doctrine and holding that drug manufacturers owed no duty to warn a third party who was injured by a patient using their products).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 478-79, 935 A.2d at 1150 (footnote omitted). The court also opined that even if Lilly\u2019s warnings were inadequate, the injuries to Mr. Gourdine were not foreseeable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">Appellants nonetheless maintain that it was foreseeable that failing to warn patients of an increased risk of hypoglycemia between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m. could cause them to suffer from hypoglycemia, and if that occurred while a patient was driving a vehicle, that the patient could seriously injure other users of the road. According to appellants, the foreseeability of the injuries here at issue extended a duty to warn all users of the road and, thus, Gourdine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">Appellants correctly state that \u201cliability for injuries which are foreseeable resulting from a defective product extends to bystanders who are put in peril by the defect.\u201d <em>See e.g. Valk Mfg. Co. v. Rangaswamy, </em>74 Md.App. 304, 322-23, 537 A.2d 622 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. Montgomery County v. Valk Mfg. Co., </em>317 Md. 185, 562 A.2d 1246 (1989). Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the warnings rendered about the drugs were defective, the injuries sustained by Gourdine were not reasonably foreseeable. It cannot be said that Lilly should have reasonably foreseen-that Crews, with her history of hypoglycemia, would ignore her doctor\u2019s orders to discontinue her morning insulin, drive a car, suffer a hypoglycemic episode, lose control of her car, strike Gourdine\u2019s car, push it into the back of an illegally parked tractor-trailer, and fatally injure Gourdine. Indeed, to impose a duty on Lilly in these circumstances \u201cwould create an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs.\u201d <em>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Co., supra, </em>388 Md. at 421, 879 A.2d 1088.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 479, 935 A.2d at 1150-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Ms. Gourdine filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted. <em>Gourdine v.

On appeal from an order entering summary judgment, we review \u201conly the grounds upon which the trial court relied in granting summary judgment.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>400 Md. at 70, 926 A.2d at 754, quoting <em>Standard Fire, </em>395 Md. at 450, 910 A.2d at 1079; <em>Eid v. Duke, </em>373 Md. 2, 10, 816 A.2d 844, 849 (2003), quoting <em>Lovelace, </em>366 Md. at 695, 785 A.2d at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Undergirding the grant of summary judgment in this case is the Circuit Court\u2019s decision that Lilly did not owe a duty of care to Mr. Gourdine based upon foreseeability that an accident could occur after the ingestion of the specific medications while Ms. Crews was operating a motor vehicle; Ms. Gourdine, of course, disagrees and asserts that the \u201clearned intermediary\u201d doctrine, upon which the trial court and the Court of Special Appeals relied, is inapplicable and that Lilly, in fact, owed a duty to Mr. Gourdine to warn Ms. Crews about the risks of the combination of Humalog and Humulin N because it was foreseeable that inadequate warnings could result in injuries or death to members of the motoring public when Ms. Crews was driving. Ms. Gourdine argues that this duty arises from the common law because the failure to warn Ms. Crews put Mr. Gourdine, a foreseeable victim, in peril. Ms. Gourdine compares this case to those in which liability is imposed on a car manufacturer for injuries caused to third-party bystanders resulting from product defects, relying upon <em>Volk Manufacturing Co. v. Rangaswamy, </em>74 Md.App. 304, 537 A.2d 622 (1988). She also relies on out-of-state cases in which liability was imposed on doctors for injuries sustained by a bystander when the doctor failed to adequately warn the patient about the risks of driving while taking certain medications, citing <em>Taylor v. Smith, </em>892 So.2d 887 (Ala.2004); <em>McKenzie v. Hawai\u2018i Permanente Medical Group, Inc., </em>98 Hawai\u2019i 296, 47 P.3d 1209 (2002); and <em>Kaiser v. Suburban Transportation </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number><em>System, </em>65 Wash.2d 461, 398 P.2d 14, <em>modified, </em>65 Wash.2d 461, 401 P.2d 350 (1965). Ms. Gourdine also argues that the duty is imposed upon Lilly by statute, specifically the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), which prohibits drug manufacturers from placing a misbranded product into interstate commerce. With respect to her fraud claim, Ms. Gourdine contends that Lilly knowingly published untrue statements about the dangers and risks associated with Humalog and Humulin N, that Ms. Crews and her physician relied on these misrepresentations, and that liability for these statements extends to Mr. Gourdine because his death was foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Lilly, conversely, asserts that the Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals correctly applied the \u201clearned intermediary\u201d doctrine and further argues that no duty was owed to Mr. Gourdine because foreseeability, by itself, is insufficient to create a legally cognizable duty, and because there was no connection between Lilly\u2019s allegedly tortious act and Mr. Gourdine\u2019s death. Additionally, Lilly contends that this case is different from those involving car manufacturers\u2019 liability for injuries directly caused to bystanders because those cases involved manufacturing and design defect claims, rather than failure to warn claims as in the instant case. Likewise, Lilly distinguishes the out-of-state cases that imposed liability on doctors for injuries caused to bystanders because those courts have adopted an interpretation of duty contrary to Maryland law. Lilly also argues that the FDCA does not establish a duty owed by Lilly to Mr. Gourdine because the Act\u2019s purpose is to protect the public health generally rather than any specific class of individuals.

Whether any such unreasonable risk exists in a given situation depends on balancing the probability and seriousness of harm, if care is not exercised, against the costs of taking appropriate precautions. However, we observe that in cases such as this the cost of giving an adequate warning is usually so minimal, amounting only to the expense of adding some more printing to a label, that this balancing process \u25a0will almost always weigh in favor of an obligation to warn of latent dangers, if the manufacturer is otherwise required to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We also adopted Section 388 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), \u201cChattel Known to be Dangerous for Intended Use,\u201d as \u201ca general principle in the duty to warn area\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>One who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for another to use is subject to liability to those whom the supplier should expect to use the chattel with the consent of the other or to be endangered by its probable use, for physical harm caused by the use of the chattel in the manner for which and by a person for whose use it is supplied, if the supplier</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">(a) knows or has reason to know that the chattel is or is likely to be dangerous for the use for which it is supplied, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">(b) has no reason to believe that those for whose use the chattel is supplied will realize its dangerous condition, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">(c) fails to exercise reasonable care to inform them of its dangerous condition or of the facts which make it likely to be dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\"><em>Moran, </em>273 Md. at 543-44, 332 A.2d at 15. In <em>Moran, </em>a products liability action against a cologne manufacturer alleging negligent failure to warn of concealed dangers, we recognized a framework for analysis in negligent failure to warn cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">Based on this negligence law we think that in the products liability domain a duty to warn is imposed on a manufacturer if the item it produces has an inherent and hidden danger about which the producer knows, or should know, could be a substantial factor in bringing injury to an individual or his property when the manufacturer\u2019s product comes near to or in contact with the elements which are present normally in the environment where the product can reasonably be expected to be brought or used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 552, 332 A.2d at 20.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-11\">This framework substantially mirrors that of a strict liability action, which was defined by Judge John C. Eldridge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>writing for this Court, in <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., 278 </em>Md. 337, 341, 363 A.2d 955, 957 (1976). In <em>Phipps, </em>Judge Eldridge adopted Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical Harm to User or Consumer</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\">(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-9\">(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\">(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-11\">(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-12\">and summarized the elements of an action in strict liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amp\">The essential elements of an action in strict liability are set forth in \u00a7 402A. For recovery, it must be established that (1) the product was in defective condition at the. time that it left the possession or control of the seller, (2) that it was unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer, (3) that the defect, was a cause of the injuries, and (4) that the product was expected to and did reach the consumer without substantial change in its condition. However, in an action founded on strict liability in tort, as opposed to a traditional negligence action, the plaintiff need not prove any specific act of negligence on the part of the seller. The relevant inquiry in a strict liability action focuses not on the conduct of the manufacturer but rather on the product itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 344, 363 A.2d at 958. Judge Eldridge went on to explain that \u201cthe theory of strict liability is not a radical departure from traditional tort concepts\u201d and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">Despite the use of the term \u201cstrict liability,\u201d the seller is not an insurer, as absolute liability is not imposed on the seller for any injury resulting from the use of his product. Proof of a defect in the product at the time it leaves the control of the seller implies fault on the part of the seller sufficient to justify imposing liability for injuries caused by the product.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 363 A.2d at 963. <em>See also Harig v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>284 Md. 70, 84, 394 A.2d 299, 306-07 (1978) (\u201c[T]he major distinction between an action in strict liability in tort and one founded on traditional negligence theory relates to the proof which must be presented by the plaintiff.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992), we addressed the issue of whether the seller\u2019s knowledge of a defect, or lack thereof, would affect liability. Judge Eldridge, again writing for this Court, noted that most courts addressing the issue require knowledge of defect, as elucidated in Comment j of the Restatement Section 402A:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">Comment j explains that \u201cthe seller is required to give warning against [the danger], if he has knowledge, or by the application of reasonable, developed human skill and foresight should have knowledge, of the ... danger.\u201d The comment goes on to distinguish a product containing an adequate warning from a defective product, stating: \u201ca product bearing such a warning, which is safe for use if it is followed, is not in defective condition, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">\u2756 \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">[T]he majority of courts which have considered a failure to warn case in the context of strict liability have either expressly or implicitly held that a manufacturer of a product, which is defective only because of the lack of an adequate warning, is not liable when the failure to warn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>resulted from an absence of knowledge of the dangerous quality of that product.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">Moreover, the courts reason, the presence of the required knowledge can be established by evidence that the dangerous quality of the product should have been known by a manufacturer because it was known in the scientific or expert community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">Consequently, in a failure to warn case governed by the Restatement \u00a7 402A and Comment j, negligence concepts to some extent have been grafted onto strict liability. In such cases, a majority of courts hold that an element of knowledge or \u201cstate of the art\u201d evidence is directly pertinent to a cause of action under \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, and liability is no longer entirely \u201cstrict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 433-35, 601 A.2d at 640-41. Judge Eldridge also reflected that our adoption of Section 402A in the <em>Phipps </em>case included the knowledge element of its Comment j. <em>Id. </em>at 438 n. 8, 601 A.2d at 641 n. 8.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>We have recognized, therefore, that negligence concepts and those of strict liability have \u201cmorphed together,\u201d as a result, in failure to warn cases. <em>See ACandS, Inc. v.

Dillon, </em>261 Md. 516, 523, 276 A.2d 36, 40 (1971), to determine that Lilly did not owe a duty to Mr. Gourdine. In <em>Nolan, </em>a negligence and breach of warranty action, this Court was faced with the question of \u201cwhether the warnings which American Home gave regarding the use of Sparine were adequate\u201d to warn of possible venous thrombosis or arteriolar spasm; the package insert contained a warning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>that use of the drug \u201chas resulted in localized thrombophlebitis or vascular spasm of digital vessels.\u201d In answering the question, we analyzed the reasonableness of the written warnings, without adopting the \u201clearned intermediary\u201d doctrine, <em>id. </em>at 523, 276 A.2d at 40; that case clearly lacks the express adoption of the \u201clearned intermediary\u201d doctrine undertaken by other courts. <em>See e.g. Stone v.

At its core, the determination of whether a duty exists represents a policy question of whether the specific plaintiff is entitled to protection from the acts of the defendant. <em>See Pendleton, </em>398 Md. at 461, 921 A.2d at 205; <em>Rosenblatt v.

Some boundary must be set to liability for the consequences of any act, upon the basis of some social idea of justice or policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">This limitation is to some extent associated with the nature and degree of the connection in fact between the defendant\u2019s acts and the events of which the plaintiff complains. Often to greater extent, however, the legal limitation on the scope of liability is associated with policy-with our more or less inadequately expressed ideas of what justice demands.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">In that case, we considered whether a physician owed a duty to a patient\u2019s wife, who became pregnant following the patient\u2019s failed vasectomy, when the wife was not the doctor\u2019s patient and did not have any contact with the doctor. The wife asserted that a duty was owed by the physician to the wife because it was foreseeable that negligence in the execution and postsurgical follow-up of her husband\u2019s vasectomy would result in her pregnancy. We stated that foreseeability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>alone was not sufficient to establish a duty, as well as the fact that the wife could not have relied on the doctor\u2019s advice and instructions to her husband because the doctor had not performed the vasectomy or provided post-operative care and the doctor had never met the wife prior to trial. We concluded that under the circumstances of the case, the doctor did not owe a duty of care to the wife:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-5\">A duty of care does not accrue purely by virtue of the marital status of the patient alone; some greater relational nexus between doctor and patient\u2019s spouse must be established, if it can be established at all, and here it was not. A duty of care to a non-patient is not one which Maryland law is prepared to recognize under these circumstances. The imposition of a common law duty upon Dr. Edgecombe to the wife under these circumstances could expand traditional tort concepts beyond manageable bounds. The rationale for extending the duty would apply to all potential sexual partners and expand the universe of potential plaintiffs____ Based on these rationales alone, a family practitioner who ostensibly provides after-care following a sterilization procedure performed by another physician would owe a duty of care not just to the patient who underwent the operation but every sexual partner the patient encounters after the operation\u2014a possibility the law does not countenance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 626-27, 865 A.2d at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">In <em>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, </em>388 Md. at 407, 879 A.2d at 1088, we further confirmed the importance of a close and direct connection between the tortious act and effect. In <em>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, </em>a husband, who became infected with HIV-2 while handling the virus in the course of his employment in a research laboratory, infected his wife after the two engaged in unprotected marital relations. The husband\u2019s employer had conducted tests to detect the existence of HIV -1, but did not inform the husband that a positive initial test result, followed by a subsequent negative, could indicate the existence of HIV-2. The wife argued that because it was foreseeable that she would contract the disease from her husband, the employer owed her a duty to inform her husband of the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>laboratory test results for his health and the implications for his future conduct. We concluded that the employer had no duty to the wife because \u201cMs. Doe had no relationship with Pharmacia. There is no assertion in the complaint that she was ever an employee of Pharmacia, that she had ever been tested for HIV or any other disease by Pharmacia, or that she had ever had any contact with Pharmacia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 420, 879 A.2d at 1095. We also explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-4\">Doe\u2019s proposed duty of care to her would create an expansive new duty to an indeterminate class of people. This Court has resisted the establishment of duties of care to indeterminate classes of people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">The concern with recognizing a duty that would encompass an indeterminate class of people is that a person ordinarily cannot foresee liability to a boundless category of people. Additionally, we have noted that the imposition of a duty to an indeterminate class would make tort law unmanageable. The imposition of a duty of care in this case would create an indeterminate class of potential plaintiffs. Doe portrays her proposed duty as limited to spouses. She claims that it was foreseeable that she would contract HIV while engaging in unprotected sex with her husband because it is foreseeable that a husband and wife will engage in sexual relations. Doe does not offer any legitimate reason to support a distinction between married plaintiffs and other plaintiffs. The rationale for imposing a duty of care to Ms. Doe could apply to all sexual partners of employees. The potential class to whom Pharmacia would owe a duty under Doe\u2019s theory is even greater than all sexual partners of its employees. It includes any person who could have contracted HIV-2 from the employee by any means.

In <em>Valle Manufacturing, </em>Dr. Rangaswamy died as a result of an automobile accident in which he was struck by a dump truck on which a snow plow hitch arm protruded unsafely. The doctor\u2019s widow and minor child filed suit against the manufacturer of the snowplow hitch alleging negligence and strict liability for \u201cdefective design.\u201d A jury awarded the plaintiffs $2,500,000 on the strict liability count, and our intermediate appellate court affirmed the award. Addressing whether the plaintiffs could recover under the theory of strict liability in tort as a \u201cbystander,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals noted that \u201c[m]ost jurisdictions, when called upon to do so, have extended the strict liability doctrine to provide relief for bystanders ... \u2018to put the strict liability on the same footing as negligence, as to all foreseeable injuries.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 537 A.2d at 631, quoting Keeton et al., <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>at Section 100. As a result, the intermediate appellate court was persuaded that \u201cthe all-important concept of legal duty\u201d should allow recovery for strict liability to a third-party bystander. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 537 A.2d at 631. In <em>Valle Manufacturing, </em>however, the defective product was directly involved in the accident and caused the decedent\u2019s injury. <em>See also Kelley v. R.G.

Here, however, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>no direct connection between the drugs and accompanying warnings and the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Ms. Gourdine, however, also attempts to draw support from cases from other jurisdictions in which she asserts the courts have held that a doctor\u2019s duty to warn his or her patient of the risks associated with medication prescribed extends to non-patients who are foreseeably at risk. E.g., <em>Taylor v. Smith, </em>892 So.2d 887 (Ala.2004) (director of outpatient methadone-treatment center owed duty of due care to a non-patient motorist who was injured in an automobile accident with the director\u2019s patient); <em>McKenzie v.

Palmer &amp; Baker Engineers, Inc., </em>293 Ala. 301, 302 So.2d 228, 232 (1974) (concluding that engineering firm under a contract with the City of Mobile to inspect a tunnel owed a duty to third party \u201cmember[s] of the public using\u201d the tunnel to reasonably apprise the City of Mobile of the \u201ccondition of the fire-fighting equipment located in the [tjunnel\u201d; \u201cThe ultimate test of the existence of a duty to use due care is found in the foreseeability that harm may result if care is not exercised.\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds, Ex parte Insurance Co. of North America, </em>523 So.2d 1064 (Ala.1988); <em>Taylor-Rice v.

Dockery, </em>273 Ga.App. 418, 615 S.E.2d 237, 239 (2005) (patient who was involved in a car accident in which sons were injured filed suit on their behalf based on physician\u2019s alleged failure to warn patient not to drive after taking certain medications; the Court of Appeals of Georgia rejected the claims on behalf of the sons because \u201c[t]o expand a doctor\u2019s duty to his patient to generally include members of the public at large in a case such as this one would be contrary to Georgia public policy\u201d); <em>Lester ex rel.

Michael Reese Hospital &amp; Medical Center, </em>117 Ill.2d 507, 111 Ill.Dec. 944, 513 N.E.2d 387 (1987). In <em>Kirk, </em>a driver, apparently because of undisclosed side effects of certain prescription drugs, lost control of his vehicle and collided with a tree, injuring a passenger. The passenger brought an action against the drug manufacturers, and others, alleging failure to warn based in negligence and strict liability. Before the Supreme Court of Illinois, the passenger asserted that his injuries were foreseeable and that \u201cwhile the class of persons to whom the warning is required to be given may be very limited, the class of persons to whom the duty is owed includes the public generally.\u201d <em>Kirk, </em>513 N.E.2d at 392. The court rejected this argument, determining that \u201cforeseeability ... is not intended to bring within the scope of the defendant\u2019s liability every injury that might possibly occur\u201d and that the manufacturer of the prescription drug owed no duty to a \u201cnonuser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392-93. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Therefore, although there may be circumstances where foreseeability alone may give rise to liability to a third party because of policy reasons, this is not the case. We conclude that Lilly did not owe a duty to Mr. Gourdine.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Duty Under Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Ms. Gourdine, alternatively, argues that the duty between Lilly and Mr. Gourdine is prescribed by statute and refers us to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), 21 U.S.C. Section 321, <em>et seq., </em>which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>prohibits drug manufacturers from placing a misbranded product into interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">A duty may be established by statute \u2018\u201cwhen the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was designed to protect and the injury was of the type the statute was designed to prevent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pendleton, </em>398 Md. at 466, 921 A.2d at 207, quoting <em>Remsburg, </em>376 Md. at 584, 831 A.2d at 27; <em>Erie Ins. Co. v. Chops, </em>322 Md. 79, 84, 585 A.2d 232, 234 (1991). Furthermore, the statute must \u201cset forth mandatory acts clearly for the protection of a <em>particular class </em>of persons rather than the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Remsburg, </em>376 Md. at 584, 831 A.2d at 27; <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 635, 510 A.2d at 1087. <em>See also Polakoff v. Turner, </em>385 Md. 467, 483, 869 A.2d 837, 847 (2005) (\u201cTo make out a prima facie case in a negligence action based on the breach of a statutory duty, a plaintiff must show \u2018(a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 78, 835 A.2d 616, 620-21 (2003) (\u201cMoreover, where there is an applicable statutory scheme designed to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff, another well-settled Maryland common law rule has long been applied by this Court in negligence actions. That rule states that the defendant\u2019s duty ordinarily \u2018is prescribed by the statute\u2019 or ordinance and that the violation of the statute or ordinance is itself evidence of negligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 170, 854 A.2d at 1232, we considered whether the Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) statute created a duty to a child who had been the subject of many reported child abuse incidents; the statute at issue, Section 5-706 of the Family Law Article, Maryland Code (2003), required DSS, promptly after receiving a report of child abuse, to make a \u201cthorough investigation\u201d in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the child. DSS contended that the governing statute imposed upon it a duty to the public at large, and not to a particular class of individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>als. We rejected this argument, recognizing that the statutory duties imposed \u201care far more specific and focused,\u201d and that \u201cthe statute makes clear in several places that the sole and specific objective of the requirement is the protection of a specific class of children\u2014those identified in or identifiable from specific reports made to DSS and those also found in the home or in the care or custody of the alleged abuser. This is not an obligation that runs to everyone in general and no one in particular. It runs to an identified or identifiable child or discrete group of children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189-90, 854 A.2d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">In contrast, in <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery County, </em>370 Md. 447, 499-500, 805 A.2d 372, 403 (2002), we determined that the statutory duty imposed on 911 operators and supervisors to protect \u201cthe safety and well-being of the citizens of Maryland\u201d was owed to the public at large rather than to an individual citizen, and in <em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085, we noted that a police officer\u2019s statutory duty to follow certain procedures when stopping or detaining a driver under suspicion of intoxication did not create a duty to a pedestrian injured by the drunk driver where the officer detected the driver\u2019s condition before the accident but failed to stop and detain him because the underlying concern of the statute was the safety of the public and not a particular class of persons. Also, in <em>Remsburg, </em>376 Md. at 585, 831 A.2d at 28, we held that statutes regulating hunting licenses, hunting seasons, endangered species and the number and type of wildlife and game that may be hunted did not create a duty on the part of the leader of a hunting party to protect third parties from being shot by members of his hunting party because \u201c[ajbsent from these statutes ... is any mention of a duty placed upon a leader of a hunting party, by virtue of his or her position as such, to protect all other hunters or landowners from the negligent acts of members of his or her hunting party.\u201d Moreover, in <em>Lamb v. Hopkins, </em>303 Md. 236, 253, 492 A.2d 1297, 1306 (1985), we concluded that probation officers who failed to seek the revocation of probation of an individual, although aware that the individual had committed a number of drunk driving offenses during the probationary period, owed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>no duty to the parents of a child severely injured by the probationer, because the officers\u2019 statutory duty to report violations to the court only was owed to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Ms. Gourdine, nevertheless, alludes to the Act\u2019s prohibition of the placement of misbranded products into interstate commerce by drug manufacturers. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. Section 331(a)-(b) (\u201cThe following acts and the causing thereof are prohibited: (a) The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded, (b) The adulteration or misbranding of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic in interstate commerce.\u201d); 21 U.S.C. Section 352(a) (stating that a \u201cdrug or device shall be deemed to be misbranded ... [i]f its labeling is false or misleading in any particular\u201d). She also refers to several federal regulations prohibiting misleading advertising and requiring certain information to be disclosed. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. Section 201.56(b) (\u201cThe labeling shall be informative and accurate and neither promotional in tone nor false or misleading in any particular.\u201d); <em>Id. </em>at Section 201.57(f)(2) (\u201c[T]he labeling shall contain the following subsections as appropriate for the drug: ... (2) Information for patients. This subsection of the label shall contain information to be given to patients for safe and effective use of the drug, e.g., precautions concerning driving or the concomitant use of other substances that may have harmful additive effects.\u201d); <em>Id. </em>at Section 202.l(e)(5)(ii)-(iii) (\u201cAn advertisement does not satisfy the requirement that it present a \u2018true statement\u2019 of information in brief summary relating to side effects, contradictions, and effectiveness if: (i) It is false or misleading with respect to side effects, contradictions, or effectiveness; or (ii) It fails to present a fair balance between information relating to side effects and contradictions and information relating to effectiveness of the drug.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">These statutes and regulations, however, are framed to protect the public in general, <em>see United States v. An Article of Drug ... Bacto-Unidisk, </em>394 U.S. 784, 798, 89 S.Ct. 1410, 1418, 22 L.Ed.2d 726 (1969) (noting that \u201cthe Act\u2019s overriding purpose [is] to protect the public health\u201d), and, as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>heretofore stated, a statutory obligation which \u201cruns to everyone in general and no one in particular\u201d cannot impose a duty between two parties. <em>Horridge, </em>382 Md. at 190, 854 A.2d at 1243. Therefore, we decline to find that a statutory basis supports the imposition on duty on Lilly to Mr. Gourdine.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">B. Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Ms. Gourdine, in Count 3, asserts a claim based in fraud, alleging that Lilly knowingly published untrue statements, about the dangers and risks associated with Humalog and Humulin N, that Ms. Crews and her physician relied on these misrepresentations, resulting in the accident that killed Mr. Gourdine. This claim was also resolved on the grant of summary judgment in favor of Lilly. Ms. Gourdine argues that because Lilly owed a duty to Mr. Gourdine, her fraud claim is viable, while Lilly, conversely, contends that the Circuit Court\u2019s decision was correct because there was no duty owed by Lilly to Mr. Gourdine, and regardless, there were no misrepresentations made to Mr. Gourdine.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-7\">To prevail on a claim for fraud, a plaintiff must show: (1) that the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff, (2) that its falsity was either known to the defendant or that the representation was made with reckless indifference as to its truth, (3) that the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff, (4) that the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it, and (5) that the plaintiff suffered compensable injury resulting from the misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-8\"><em>Maryland Env\u2019tal Trust v.

In a strict liability failure to warn case, the alleged defect is the failure of the seller to give an adequate warning.

Thus, where a product lacks a warning because of insufficient knowledge on the part of the manufacturer or in the scientific field involved, the product is not defective.

The United States Court of Appeals for Fifth Circuit explained the reasoning behind the learned intermediary doctrine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-7\">\u201cWe cannot quarrel with the general proposition that where <em>prescription </em>drugs are concerned, the manufacturer\u2019s duty to warn is limited to an obligation to advise the prescribing physician of any potential dangers that may result from the drug\u2019s use. This special standard for prescription drugs is an understandable exception to the Restatement\u2019s general rule that one who markets goods must warn foreseeable ultimate users of dangers inherent in his products. <em>See Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>Section 388 (1965). Prescription drugs are likely to be complex medicines, esoteric in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>formula and varied in effect. As a medical expert, the prescribing physician can take into account the propensities of the drug as well as the susceptibilities of his patient. His is the task of weighing the benefits of any medication against its potential dangers. The choice he makes is an informed one, an individualized medical judgment bottomed on a knowledge of both patient and palliative. Pharmaceutical companies then, who must warn ultimate purchasers of dangers inherent in patent drugs sold over the counter, in selling prescription drugs are required to warn only the prescribing physician, who acts as a \u2018learned intermediary\u2019 between manufacturer and consumer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"><em>Reyes v.
