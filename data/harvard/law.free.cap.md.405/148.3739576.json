We shall hold that the combination of all of these comments exceeded the permissible scope of closing argument and that the trial judge did err in permitting the prosecutor to make those comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Petitioner, the defendant below, Kevin Ricardo Lee, was indicted for various offenses that allegedly occurred on September 13th, 2003, arising from a shooting involving Richard Cotton in Baltimore City. The offenses included attempted first-degree murder in violation of Section 2-205 of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2002),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> attempted second-degree murder in violation of Section 2-206, first-degree assault in violation of Section 3-202, second-degree assault in violation of Section 3-203, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence in violation of Section 4-204, wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun upon or about his person in violation of Section 4-203, reckless endangerment in violation of Section 3-204(a)(l), discharging a firearm within Baltimore City limits in violation of Article 19, Section 59-2 of the Baltimore City Code, and common law conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">At trial, the State presented one eyewitness, who testified that on September 12th, 2003, Lee and Cotton were involved in a fight on her porch and that Lee had a gun at that time. The eyewitness further testified that the following day she heard gunshots and from an upstairs window in her home, she witnessed Lee running up the street after Cotton with an \u201cobject that looked like a gun\u201d from which smoke appeared to be emanating. Subsequently, after being shown photographs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>by the police, she identified Lee as the individual involved in the altercation with Cotton on her porch, as well as the one chasing Cotton down the street on the day of the shooting. On cross-examination, she admitted that, about a year after the shooting, she told her brother that she had not seen anything, but stated on redirect that she did so because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want [her brother] in the middle of it.\u201d Two detectives and a police officer also testified regarding their investigation of the case, including the eyewitness\u2019s identification of Lee. Forensic evidence was not offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Lee called Cotton, the victim, to the stand; Cotton testified that Lee did not shoot him. Cotton also stated that he did not recall any altercation with Lee on the day before the shooting, as well as any guns or any discussion of guns. He also responded that although he was \u201cpretty intoxicated\u201d when he was shot, he was \u201csober enough\u201d to know that Lee was not the culprit. Lee also presented the testimony of the brother of the eyewitness, who remarked that the view of the eyewitness from the upstairs window to the street would have been obstructed and that she had told him that she had not seen anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">After the conclusion of evidence, the trial judge gave instructions to the jury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> iterating that they were the sole judges of the evidence, that they were the judges of whether or not a witness should be believed, that they should not be swayed by sympathy, prejudice or public opinion, and that both opening statements and closing arguments were not evidence, but \u201cintended only to help you understand the evidence and apply the law to that evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>After the State presented closing argument, Lee\u2019s counsel, in his closing, posited that the State\u2019s evidence was based entirely on the testimony of the eyewitness, whose account of the events had changed over time. Lee\u2019s counsel suggested, therefore, that the jury should believe Cotton, the victim, who testified that Lee did not shoot him; he remarked that the reason that the State did not call Cotton to testify, requiring Lee to call him, was that, \u201cHe didn\u2019t prove their case. They don\u2019t like what he had to say. They made no effort to bring him in.\u201d He further suggested to the jury that it would \u201cgo[ ] against nature\u201d for the victim to lie on the stand and not identify his assailant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">[COUNSEL FOR LEE]: Mr. Cotton is entitled to the presumption that he\u2019s telling the truth. He\u2019s the victim. There wasn\u2019t one iota of evidence presented by the State to suggest to you that he\u2019s lying or trying to deceive you other than that he\u2019s a friend. So I guess what that means is, if your friend is charged with a crime, the State doesn\u2019t want you to come in and say, no, he didn\u2019t do it. You\u2019re lying. You\u2019re just trying to protect him. You took three shots and you\u2019re just trying to protect him. That\u2019s what the State is asking you to assume. I suggest to you that it goes against nature. Maybe it\u2019s true. It is possible it is true. I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s impossible that Cotton got on that witness stand after having three gunshot wounds and lied to you just to protect his friend. That is not impossible. Is it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>likely? Is it likely? Do you disbelieve Cotton beyond a reasonable doubt? I suggest to you that you can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">On rebuttal, the State argued that the jurors should not believe Cotton, because he was untruthful, because Cotton was following \u201cthe law of the streets\u201d; Lee\u2019s counsel interposed several objections, which were overruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\">[STATE]: ... I\u2019m talking about Baltimore, the city that reads. Let\u2019s establish that I\u2019m talking about the city that bleeds. Now, Richard Cotton came to court and testified that this defendant did not shoot him, and this defense counsel doesn\u2019t know why, but in order to sit on this jury\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8e\">[COUNSEL FOR LEE]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">[STATE]:\u2014you have to be residents of Baltimore City and I\u2019m hoping you do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">Richard Cotton would have you believe first of all, that there was not a fight the day before on the 12th. He would have you believe that [the eyewitness] called the police for nothing at all and we know [the eyewitness] called the police because Officer Henry testified on the stand that he responded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-10\">Now, if you believe Richard Cotton, then you would have to believe that when Officer Henry said that he saw the defendant and the defendant just broke out running, you would have to believe that he was running for the sport of it. When Officer Henry testified that he observed the defendant hiding in the bushes, you would have to believe that he was laying on the ground for convenience. Do not let your intelligence be insulted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-11\">Richard Cotton came here to help his boy, his friend, his buddy because this Court read you the law of the State of Maryland, but that has nothing to do with the law of the streets of Baltimore. Let\u2019s make the distinction. Defense can\u2019t understand somebody taking three shots.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-12\">[COUNSEL FOR LEE]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>[STATE]: He can\u2019t understand somebody taking three shots, but perhaps you can understand somebody who doesn\u2019t even remember how many times he got shot. Defense would have you to believe that Richard Cotton came here to tell you the honest-to-God truth, but I beg to differ. I beg to differ. Under no circumstances, if you live by the law of the streets of Baltimore, do you help police\u2014 [COUNSEL FOR LEE]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-4\">THE COURT: It\u2019s argument. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-5\">[STATE]:\u2014you need to be residents of Baltimore City to live on this jury. We\u2019re not in Missouri.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">Richard Cotton, from the beginning, was not interested in assisting the police in solving this crime. He knew who shot him then, he knows who shot him now, but this building we are in, this is not his law, not the law that he follows, not the justice that he seeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The prosecutor continued, asserting that she represented the citizens of Baltimore City, who had a right to be safe in their neighborhoods; she asked, \u201cand those residents ask that you teach this defendant ... that disputes aren\u2019t settled by the blast of a gun.\u201d Lee\u2019s counsel objected, to no avail. When the judge overruled his objections, he also requested a curative instruction, after which the judge informed the jury that the prosecution was making \u201can argument,\u201d and, repeating the instructions given earlier, that appeals to passion and prejudice were not evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">[STATE]: Now, after firing a gun in a residential neighborhood where [the eyewitness] told you herself that at the time this incident happened she had a nephew outside playing, that is a reckless act. I represent the State of Maryland, the city residents. All of the residents of the 4700 block of Belvedere who has homes close to where this happened, who may have been on the street going from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>car to the house, on the way home, whatever, all of the residents want justice, even if Richard Cotton doesn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">Now, the defendant has a lot of rights, as well he should, as well he should, and pay attention to them all, but who else has rights? Do the residents in that area have a right to be able\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">[COUNSEL FOR LEE]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">THE COURT: Overruled. It\u2019s argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">[COUNSEL FOR LEE]: It\u2019s improper argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">THE COURT: No, it isn\u2019t. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">[STATE]: Do the residents of that area have the right to be able to be safe in their environment? I ask and those residents ask that you teach this defendant\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">[COUNSEL FOR LEE]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">[COUNSEL FOR LEE]: It is improper for the State\u2019s Attorney to suggest to the jury that they\u2019re here to clean up the streets, or they\u2019re here to protect the residents of any neighborhood. That is improper, Your Honor, and I would ask for a curing instruction and admonishing of the State\u2019s Attorney. The jury is here to decide under the facts of this case whether this defendant is guilty of crimes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-14\">THE COURT: Appeals to passion, prejudice, so forth and so on, are not proper appeals. It\u2019s an argument, but your duty in this case is to decide the case based on the evidence, not on passion or prejudice. Is that clear? Continue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aru\">Immediately thereafter, the State\u2019s Attorney completed her closing argument by repeating the \u201claws of the streets\u201d and asking the jury to teach the defendant a lesson not to settle disputes with violence. Lee\u2019s counsel objected and was overruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-15\">[STATE]:\u2014teach the defendant that disputes aren\u2019t settled by the blast of a gun, teach the defendant that pulling a trigger doesn\u2019t make you a man, it makes you a criminal\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW8\">[COUNSEL FOR LEE]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-16\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>[STATE]:\u2014teach the defendant not to follow the laws of the streets of Baltimore, but to follow the laws of the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The jury deliberated and found Lee guilty of first-degree assault, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun upon and about his person, reckless endangerment and discharging a firearm within Baltimore City limits, but acquitted him of attempted first and second degree murder. Lee filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. The judge sentenced Lee to twenty years imprisonment, the first five without parole, for using a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and ten years for first-degree assault to run consecutively to the use of a handgun sentence; the sentences for the other convictions were merged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Lee noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. Addressing the question of whether the trial court erred in permitting the \u201claw(s) of the streets\u201d and \u201cclean up the streets\u201d comments by the prosecutor during its rebuttal argument,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the intermediate appellate court opined that the State\u2019s \u201ccomments came close to overstepping the bounds of legitimate argument,\u201d but that the jury was not mislead by the comments so as to render Lee\u2019s trial unfair because the judge \u201ctook prompt curative action.\u201d Moreover, the panel explicated that the State was entitled to respond, in rebuttal, to arguments raised in the defense\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Lee filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted, <em>Lee v. State, </em>403 Md. 304, 941 A.2d 1104 (2008), raising the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Did the trial court err in permitting the State, over objection, to argue to the jury that the \u201claw of the streets\u201d prevented the victim from identifying Lee as his assailant, and to argue that they should protect their community by teaching Lee a lesson?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We shall hold that the trial judge did err in permitting the State to argue to the jury during rebuttal argument that a victim\u2019s testimony was not credible because he was following \u201cthe law of the streets,\u201d that the jury should protect their community and clean up the streets, and that the jury should teach the defendant not to abide by the \u201claws of the streets\u201d in settling disputes, and shall conclude that the cumulative effect of the prosecutor\u2019s comments was sufficiently prejudicial to deny Lee a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The remarks in this case that Lee asserts were improper fall into three groups: use of the phrase \u201cthe law of the streets,\u201d by which the prosecutor argued to the jurors that Cotton was not credible because he was abiding by \u201cthe law of the streets\u201d; the assertion that the jury should protect their community and clean up the streets; and, finally, the use of the phrase \u201claws of the streets,\u201d by which the prosecutor asked the jury to teach Lee a lesson not to settle disputes with violence. Lee argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the \u201claw(s) of the streets,\u201d in both instances, were improper because they alluded to facts not in evidence and that the comments exhorting the jurors to clean up the streets were an improper invocation of the prohibited \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The cumulative effect of the comments, Lee contends, was sufficiently prejudicial to deny Lee a fair trial and to warrant reversal because the State\u2019s case against Lee was dependent entirely upon the credibility of the eyewitness. Lee also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were repeated and involved issues central to the case and that the trial judge took no contemporaneous or direct curative action. Finally, Lee contends that the State\u2019s argument that Cotton was being untruthful because he was following \u201cthe law of the streets\u201d cannot be justified under the \u201cinvited response doctrine.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The State, conversely, argues that the trial court acted within its discretion in allowing the State\u2019s rebuttal argument. The State contends that \u201cthe law of the streets\u201d comments directed to Cotton\u2019s credibility were not improper and that they were a fair and direct response to the issues raised by Lee in his summation, specifically that the State did not call Cotton because he was not helpful to the State\u2019s case and that \u201cit goes against nature\u201d for Cotton, the victim of the shooting, to lie on the witness stand. The State asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s plea to the jury to clean up the streets was not improper because it did not call for the jury to divert its focus away from the function of judging the defendant based upon the evidence presented. The State argues also that the \u201claws of the streets\u201d comment relating to teaching Lee a lesson was not improper and that, even so, it was an isolated event. The State also contends that any prejudice that could have resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s comments was ameliorated by the curative instruction delivered by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">The United States Supreme Court has discussed, and we have acknowledged, the purpose and importance of closing arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">It can hardly be questioned that closing argument serves to sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by the trier of fact in a criminal case. For it is only after all the evidence is in that counsel for the parties are in a position to present their respective versions of the case as a whole. Only then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>can they argue the inferences to be drawn from all the testimony, and point out the weaknesses of their adversaries\u2019 positions. And for the defense, closing argument is the last clear chance to persuade the trier of fact that there may be reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">The very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Herring v. New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 862, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 2555, 45 L.Ed.2d 593, 600 (1975) (citation omitted); <em>Henry v. State, </em>324 Md. 204, 229-30, 596 A.2d 1024, 1037 (1991). <em>See also Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412, 326 A.2d 707, 714 (1974). As a result, we have given attorneys wide latitude in the presentation of closing arguments, because \u201c[summation provides counsel with an opportunity to creatively mesh the diverse facets of trial, meld the evidence presented with plausible theories, and expose the deficiencies in his or her opponent\u2019s argument.\u201d <em>Henry, </em>324 Md. at 230, 596 A.2d at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Generally, \u201cthe party holding the \u2018affirmative of the issue ... has the right to begin and reply, both in the introduction of evidence and in the argument to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v.

In <em>Harris, </em>we continued that \u201c[i]n more contemporary terms we might say that one factor bearing on which side should have the advantage of opening and closing argument is which party has the burden of persuasion.... [I]t is clear that in a criminal case the prosecution ordinarily bears the burden of persuasion and the burden of production and thus usually has \u2018the right to the first and last word in the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255-56, 539 A.2d at 652. <em>See also </em>Jacob A. Stein, <em>Closing Arguments </em>Section 1:6 (2d ed. 2005) (\u201cAt the close of the evidence in a criminal trial, the prosecution ordinarily opens the argument.

There are no hard-and-fast limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined\u2014no well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar.

The \u201cinvited response doctrine\u201d has evolved as an extension of the general rule that comments made by a prosecutor must be examined in context, which \u201csuggests that \u2018where a prosecutorial argument has been made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel, the unfair prejudice flowing from the two arguments may balance each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>other out, thus obviating the need for a new trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 157 n. 7, 872 A.2d at 32 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Notwithstanding the wide latitude afforded prosecutors in closing arguments, a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial must be protected. <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 430, 722 A.2d at 902; <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 413-15, 326 A.2d at 714-15.

The Prosecutor\u2019s Comments</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Our first determination is whether any statements made by the prosecutor during her rebuttal argument were improper. <em>See Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 593, 886 A.2d at 889; <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 156, 872 A.2d at 31. Although the Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal comments came close to overstepping the bounds of legitimate argument,\u201d but did not do so, we disagree. The comments clearly were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u201cThe Law of the Streets\u201d\u2014Cotton\u2019s Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">During its rebuttal argument, the State argued to the jury that they should not believe Cotton; Cotton was being untruthful about Lee not being the shooter, because Cotton was following \u201cthe law of the streets,\u201d to which Lee\u2019s counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>interposed several objections, which were summarily overruled. Lee contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about \u201cthe law of the streets,\u201d directed at the credibility of Cotton, were improper because they alluded to facts not in evidence. The State, however, asserts that these comments were not improper, but rather, that they were a fair and direct response to the issues raised by Lee in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Generally, we have deemed comments made during closing argument that invite the jury to draw inferences from information that was not admitted at trial, improper. <em>See Spain, </em>386 Md. at 156, 872 A.2d at 31; <em>Hill, </em>355 Md. at 222, 734 A.2d at 208; <em>Degren, </em>352 Md. at 433, 722 A.2d at 903. In <em>Spain, </em>the defendant was charged with and convicted of various controlled dangerous substance offenses. The prosecution\u2019s case was supported by the testimony of the officer who arrested Spain, the drugs confiscated from a third party at the time of the arrest and documentary exhibits. During closing, the prosecutor stated that the police officer who testified did not have a motive to lie and that he would not testify falsely, because he \u201cwould have to engage in a lot of lying, in a lot of deception and a conspiracy of his own to come in here and tell you that what happened was not true. He would have to risk everything he has worked for. He would have to perjure himself on the stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151, 872 A.2d at 28. Defense counsel\u2019s objection was overruled, because the trial court determined that, \u201cthe jury understand^] that this of course is closing argument, and that they will [consider the statements to be] lawyer\u2019s arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28, 872 A.2d at 29. We concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the absence of a motive to lie was within the permissible bounds of closing argument, but ruled improper the reference to the possible adverse consequences that the police officer would suffer if he were to lie; we opined that although the concept of \u201cadverse personnel implications flowing from perjured testimony by a police officer resonates at a common sense level, at no time during the trial scrutinized in the present case did the State introduce evidence from which it could be inferred ineluctably that Officer Williams risked his career or any of its benefits if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>he were to testify falsely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156, 872 A.2d at 31-32. <em>But see Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 404, 326 A.2d at 707, a consolidation of two <em>cases\u2014Wilhelm v. State </em>and <em>Cook v. </em>State\u2014in which we espoused an exception to the rule against alluding to facts not in evidence. The complaint in <em>Cook, </em>a murder case, was over the prosecutor\u2019s informing the jury, in closing argument, that over 300 people had been murdered in Baltimore City in the last year, that an unknown number of persons had been robbed with weapons, and that the victims were most often people unable to fight back. We determined that this argument was not improper because it made reasonable inferences from the facts in evidence, and those \u201cof such general notoriety as to be matter of common knowledge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445, 326 A.2d at 731.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">We also have iterated that prosecutors should not appeal to the passions and prejudices of a jury. <em>See Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 597, 886 A.2d at 892; <em>Hill, </em>355 Md. at 211, 734 A.2d at 208; <em>Contee v.

In <em>Lawson, </em>the prosecutor, during rebuttal argument, implied that the defendant in a sexual offense case was a \u201cmonster\u201d and a \u201cchild molester.\u201d We held that these comments were improper, agreeing that they were \u201cdesigned to inflame the jurors\u2019 prejudices against a hated class of individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 886 A.2d at 891-92. In reaching our conclusion, we cited <em>Walker v. State, </em>121 Md. App. 364, 709 A.2d 177 (1998), in which our intermediate appellate court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument calling the defendant an \u201canimal\u201d and a \u201cpervert\u201d was improper; we also noted that the \u201c \u2018right to a fair trial and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>search for the truth, however, should not be hampered or obfuscated by extreme appeals to passion calculated to inflame the jury.... It is incumbent upon the People\u2019s representative to maintain an air of dignity and stay above the frey.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 598, 886 A.2d at 892, quoting <em>Walker, </em>121 Md.App. at 380-81, 709 A.2d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In the instant case, the State essentially argued to the jury that Cotton was not credible because Cotton was following \u201cthe law of the streets.\u201d There was nothing in the record, nor was there any testimony or evidence, however, as to what constituted the \u201cthe law of the streets\u201d in this cont\u00e9xt. The prosecutor\u2019s comments left the jurors to speculate what was contemplated by the phrase, which is not \u201cof such general notoriety as to be matter of common knowledge.\u201d Rather, the prosecutor\u2019s argument had the effect of leading to juror speculation and decision, perhaps, on information outside of the evidence, and as such, constituted an improper appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The State argues, nevertheless, that reversal is not required because the prosecutor\u2019s \u201claw of the streets\u201d comments were a fair and direct response to the issues raised by Lee\u2019s counsel in his closing argument, specifically that \u201cit goes against nature\u201d for Cotton, the victim of the shooting, to testify falsely about the identity of the shooter. The \u201c \u2018invited response doctrine\u2019 suggests that \u2018where a prosecutorial argument has been made in reasonable response to improper attacks by defense counsel, the unfair prejudice flowing from the two arguments may balance each other out, thus obviating the need for a new trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 157 n. 7, 872 A.2d at 32 n. 7. The doctrine does not grant a prosecutor unbridled discretion to respond to an inappropriate defense argument with improper conduct, but rather, permits the prosecution to respond to improper conduct in order to equalize the positions of both sides and remedy any unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>1, 12, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 1044-45, 84 L.Ed.2d 1, 10-11 (1985), iterated that \u201cthe idea of \u2018invited response\u2019 \u201d \u201cshould not be read as suggesting judicial approval or\u2014encouragement\u2014of response-in-kind that inevitably exacerbates the tensions inherent in the adversary process\u201d but \u201cwhether the prosecutor\u2019s \u2018invited response,\u2019 taken in context, unfairly prejudiced the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">As a result, because the \u201cinvited response doctrine\u201d calls for the prosecutor\u2019s invited response to be considered in context with the defense counsel\u2019s own impropriety, it is not applicable when defense counsel has made no improper argument. <em>See Spain, </em>386 Md. at 157 n. 7, 872 A.2d at 32 n. 7 (stating that the \u201cinvited response doctrine\u201d is only applicable when the response is made after an improper, direct and specific attack is made on a witness\u2019s veracity); <em>Johnson v.

Although the prosecutor was entitled to respond to the argument posed by the defense, <em>see Degren, </em>352 Md. at 432 n. 14, 433, 722 A.2d at 902 n. 14, 903 (concluding that comments by prosecutor during rebuttal, although \u201cunprofessional and injudicious,\u201d but not improper, were made in response to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument); <em>Henry, </em>324 Md. at 232, 596 A.2d at 1038 (determining that rebuttal argument was not improper, and that, when viewed in context, was merely a direct response to the argument of defense counsel); <em>Blackwell v.

Therefore, because defense counsel\u2019s argument regarding whether Cotton was being truthful was not improper, there is no \u201cinvited response\u201d and the prosecutor\u2019s \u201claw of the streets\u201d comments exceeded the permissible scope of closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u201cClean Up The Streets\u201d Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The State also asserted during its rebuttal argument that residents of Baltimore City have a right to be safe and requested the jurors to protect their community and clean up the streets. The court repeatedly overruled Lee\u2019s counsel\u2019s objections, and thereafter, issued a curative instruction, by rereading the instructions provided before closing arguments and informing the jurors that this was \u201cargument\u201d and that they were not to consider appeals to passion and prejudice. Lee argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments appealing to the jurors to protect their community and clean up the streets constituted an invocation of the prohibited \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument. The State asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s argument did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>not call for the jury to divert its focus away from its function of judging the defendant on the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">A \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument is one in which a litigant asks the jury to place themselves in the shoes of the victim, <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 593 n. 11, 886 A.2d at 889 n. 11, or in which an attorney appeals to the jury\u2019s own interests, <em>Hill, </em>355 Md. at 214-15, 734 A.2d at 204.

Courts throughout the country have condemned arguments of that kind, which are unfairly prejudicial and risk diverting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>focus of the jury away from its sole proper function of judging the defendant on the evidence presented. <em>See Arrieta-Agressot v.

Essentially, the State was calling for the jury to indulge itself in a form of <em>vigilante justice </em>rather than engaging in a deliberative process of evaluating the evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments were directed such that the jurors were asked to teach Lee a lesson, and not to send a message to the entire community, these comments were improper because they asked the jury to view the evidence in this case, not objectively, but consonant with the juror\u2019s personal interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The \u201cLaws of the Streets\u201d\u2014To Teach Lee a Lesson</p>\n<p id=\"A3c\">Near the conclusion of its rebuttal argument, the State asserted that the jurors should teach Cotton a lesson not to follow the \u201claws of the streets\u201d by settling disputes -with violence. Lee contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the \u201claws of the streets,\u201d directed to the jury to teach Lee a lesson not to settle disputes with violence, were improper because they alluded again to facts not in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Here, the \u201claws of the streets\u201d comment was set in a different context than what the prosecutor had argued before, but again, there was nothing on the record from which the jury could derive what was meant. The prosecutor\u2019s comments left the jurors to surmise, on their own, what was contemplated by the phrase. In fact, the prosecutor had used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>the term, \u201cthe law(s) of the streets,\u201d in two entirely different connotations, once in reference to the credibility of Cotton and the other to teach Lee a lesson, so that our conclusion is buttressed that the invocation of the phrase could do nothing other than lead to juror speculation and decision, perhaps, on information outside of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">B. Prejudice Suffered by Lee\u2014Harmless Error Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Although we conclude that the prosecution\u2019s comments in this case were improper allusions to facts not in evidence, appeals to the passions and prejudices of the jury and an invocation of the prohibited \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument, our inquiry does not end. We must address whether the error was harmless. While not every impermissible comment by the prosecutor constitutes reversible error, the State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless and must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the contested error did not contribute to the verdict. <em>See Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. When determining whether overruling defense objections to improper statements during closing argument constitutes reversible, or harmless, error, we consider several factors, including the severity of the remarks, cumulatively, the weight of the evidence against the accused and the measures taken to cure any potential prejudice. <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 592, 886 A.2d at 889; <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159, 872 A.2d at 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The State contends that any error in overruling the defense objections was harmless because any prejudice resulting from the cumulative effect of the comments was cured by the instruction delivered by the judge. Considering the statements cumulatively, Lee argues, conversely, that they were sufficiently prejudicial to deny him a fair trial and to warrant reversal, because the State\u2019s case against Lee was dependent entirely upon the credibility of the eyewitness, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were repeated and involved issues central to the case and the trial judge took no contemporaneous or direct curative action. The Court of Special Appeals determined that, even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper, the judge\u2019s failure to sustain the objections was harmless and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>not render the trial unfair because \u201cthe court took prompt curative action.\u201d Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">First we must consider the statements in the context of the prejudice that each of the statements, and all of them together, created in the minds of the jurors. <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 600, 886 A.2d at 893. <em>See also Spain, </em>386 Md. at 161, 872 A.2d at 34. In this case, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201claw(s) of the streets\u201d and her appeals to the jurors to clean up the streets and protect the neighborhoods, cumulatively, were not isolated comments but were part of persistent appeals to the jurors\u2019 biases, passions and prejudices. The prosecutor referred to the \u201claw(s) of the streets\u201d several times, in two different contexts, arguing that Cotton was not credible because he was following \u201cthe law of the streets,\u201d as well as that Lee should be taught a lesson not to follow the \u201claws of the streets.\u201d Additionally, even after the trial court issued a curative instruction to the jury, the prosecutor continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The strength of the evidence against the accused is an important consideration. <em>See Spain, </em>386 Md. at 161, 872 A.2d at 34; <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 427, 326 A.2d at 722 (\u201cAnother important and significant factor where prejudicial remarks might have been made is whether or not the judgment of conviction was \u2018substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 or where the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was \u2018overwhelming.\u2019 \u201d). In this case, it is apparent that the evidence against Lee was not overwhelming; instead, like in <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 600, 886 A.2d at 894, the \u201c \u2018she said, he said\u2019 case\u201d was close. The State\u2019s case was supported by the testimony of an eyewitness, who stated that, on September 12th, the day before the shooting, Lee and Cotton had been involved in a fight and that Lee had had a gun at that time, and that the following day, from an upstairs window in her house, she heard gunshots and saw Lee running after Cotton \"with an \u201cobject that looked like a gun\u201d from which smoke appeared to be emanating. Subsequently, the eyewitness went to the police station and identified Lee as the individual involved in the altercation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Cotton on September 12th, and the one chasing Cotton down the street the next day. Two detectives and a police officer also testified for the prosecution regarding their investigation of the case, including the eyewitness\u2019s identification of Lee. The defense presented testimony from the victim, Cotton, who stated that Lee did not shoot him. Lee also presented the testimony of the brother of the eyewitness, who stated that the view of the eyewitness from the upstairs windows would have been obstructed and that the eyewitness had told him that she had not seen anything. The State\u2019s case was less than substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">A prime factor relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals, however, was the instruction given by the trial judge as curative. <em>See Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 601, 886 A.2d at 894; <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159-60, 872 A.2d at 33-34; <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 423-24, 326 A.2d at 720 (noting that \u201ca significant factor in determining whether the jury were actually misled or were likely to have been misled or influenced to the prejudice of the accused is whether or not the trial court took any appropriate action ... such as informing the jury that the remark was improper, striking the remark and admonishing the jury to disregard it\u201d). <em>Lawson </em>and <em>Spain </em>are again instructive. In <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 151, 872 A.2d at 29, the trial judge, in response to objection by defense counsel, which was overruled, informed the jury \u201cthat this of course is closing argument, and that they will [consider the statements to be] lawyers\u2019 arguments.\u201d We concluded that the response was a contemporaneous and specific jury instruction sufficient to diminish prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Z\">We note also the likely diminution of prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s comments as a result of the trial judge\u2019s contemporaneous reminder that they were only an attorney\u2019s argument, not evidence, as well as the pertinent instructions that the trial judge gave to the jury before sending it to deliberate. In response to the objection by defense counsel, the trial judge stated, \u201cOkay, well the jury understand^] that this of course is closing argument, and that they will [consider the statements to be] lawyers\u2019 arguments. Over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ruled.\u201d Although the trial judge did not acknowledge the comments as improper, nor did he explicitly instruct the jury to disregard the comments, he reminded the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s statements only should be considered as argument, not evidence. By emphasizing the argumentative nature of closing arguments contemporaneously with the improper comments, the judge took some effort to eliminate the jury\u2019s potential confusion about what it just heard and therefore ameliorated any prejudice to the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 159-60, 872 A.2d at 33-34. In <em>Lawson, </em>389 Md. at 570, 886 A.2d at 876, we addressed an entirely different situation in which the judge did not make any effort, aside from providing jury instructions before closing argument and sustaining one objection, of many, to ameliorate any prejudice resulting from an improper argument. Comparing the judge\u2019s efforts with those in Spain, we concluded that \u201cthere was no immediacy or specificity as to any efforts to cure\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>there were no contemporaneous efforts by the trial judge to ameliorate the prejudice or any specific effort to cure the effects. Instead, he relied only on the general instructions he had previously given and the fact that written general instructions would go in the jury deliberation room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">We look at the trial judge\u2019s actions as a whole in reference to the statements. In <em>Spain, </em>for example, upon objection by the defense attorney to the prosecutor\u2019s comments, the trial court contemporaneously and specifically addressed the issue that the jury understood the remarks to be only lawyers\u2019 arguments and not evidence. In petitioner\u2019s case the only time the judge addressed the weight or appropriateness of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was in the general jury instructions, which at no point directly addressed the improper remarks. Thus there was no immediacy or specificity as to any efforts to cure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 602-03, 886 A.2d at 895 (citations omitted). Therefore, to be sufficiently curative, the judge must instruct contemporaneously and specifically to address the issue such that the jury understands that the remarks are improper and are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>evidence to be considered in reaching a verdict. <em>See Miller v. State, </em>380 Md. 1, 35-37, 843 A.2d 803, 823-24 (2004) (concluding that the trial court properly denied a motion for a mistrial based upon the prosecutor\u2019s comments because the court properly sustained the defense\u2019s objections, granted the defense\u2019s motions to strike and immediately instructed the jury to disregard the specific comments).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In this case, the trial judge provided the jury with the model criminal pattern jury instructions before closing arguments. During the State\u2019s rebuttal argument the only curative instruction given by the trial judge was a repeat of the prior instructions given to the jury: \u201cAppeals to passion, prejudice, so forth and so on, are not proper appeals. It\u2019s an argument, but your duty in this case is to decide the case based on the evidence, not on passion or prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">This instruction, however, was neither contemporaneous nor specific. The curative instruction was only issued after the \u201cclean up the streets\u201d argument, not contemporaneous with the \u201claw(s) of the streets\u201d comments, nor did it specifically address the \u201claw(s) of the streets\u201d arguments or inform the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper. Moreover, the resulting prejudice of the comments, cumulatively, was exacerbated because the judge, rather than sustaining the valid objections interposed by Lee\u2019s counsel and admonishing the prosecutor to limit her rebuttal to appropriate arguments, allowed repeated improper comments even after the curative instruction was provided to the jury; immediately after the curative instruction, the prosecutor, obviously not having gotten the message, asked the jury to teach Lee a lesson not to settle disputes with violence, to which an objection was made and again overruled, and referred to the \u201claws of the streets.\u201d By summarily overruling multiple defense counsel objections before issuing his curative instruction, followed by yet another overruled objection, the trial judge conveyed to the jurors that there was nothing wrong with considering the prosecutor\u2019s \u201claw(s) of the streets\u201d and \u201cclean up the streets\u201d arguments, when the sole proper function of the jury was to determine Lee\u2019s guilt or innocence based on the evidence presented at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>his trial. <em>See Hill, </em>355 Md. at 226, 734 A.2d at 210 (warning of \u201cthe persistency of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct\u2014continuing to make these [improper] remarks time and again despite the court\u2019s rulings that the remarks were improper\u201d because there is a \u201crisk\u201d that \u201cwhen the prosecutor persistently ignores those rulings and continues in an improper course of conduct, that the jury may come to regard the court\u2019s rulings as rote window dressing and thus pay less attention to them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">As a result, after our own independent review of the record, we are not able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the judge\u2019s error in overruling defense counsel\u2019s objections, to the prosecution\u2019s improper comments alluding to facts not in evidence, appealing to the passions and prejudices of the jury and invoking the prohibited \u201cgolden rule\u201d argument, in no way influenced the verdict.

The prosecutor\u2019s essential point was simple: Cotton lied about the identity of his attacker because of his friendship with Lee. The prosecutor\u2019s first reference to the \u201claw of the streets\u201d makes that clear. The prosecutor stated, \u201cRichard Cotton came here to help his boy, his friend, his buddy because this Court read you the law of the State of Maryland, but that has nothing to do with the law of the streets of Baltimore.\u201d The first half of the sentence is clearly a permissible statement. A prosecutor is permitted to challenge the credibility of a witness because of his friendship with the defendant, where that friendship was a matter of evidence. The second half of the sentence, where the prosecutor mentions the \u201claw of the streets,\u201d should be viewed as a rhetorical device designed to make the credibility argument effective and memorable for the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>In introducing the phrase the \u201claw of the streets,\u201d the prosecutor supplied, in context, a relative definition of a corollary of the phrase: refusing to cooperate with authorities in order to protect one\u2019s friends and associates. Thus, in the context of the closing argument, the jury likely was not misled or confused as to what the prosecutor was arguing.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 439, 326 A.2d 707, 728-29 (1974), we held that it was not improper for the prosecutor, in a murder prosecution in Baltimore City, to make reference to the number of murders that had been committed in Baltimore during the previous year. We stated that the \u201creference the prosecutor made to the number of murders committed in Baltimore in 1972\u2014based upon the widespread publicity given such data\u2014was but a direction by him to the jury of a fact that was within their common knowledge.\u201d <em>Wilhelm, </em>272 Md. at 440, 326 A.2d at 729. It is an understatement to say that recent difficulties encountered by police and prosecutors in obtaining full witness cooperation in Baltimore (and elsewhere) have been well-publicized.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In fact, it is much more likely that a juror would be aware of the challenges surround<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ing witness cooperation than that same juror being aware of the number of murders in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The prosecutor\u2019s later references to the \u201claw of the streets\u201d are extensions of her first use of the phrase. For example, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[u]nder no circumstances, if you live by the law of the streets of Baltimore, do you help police.\u201d The jury could not be confused by a term which the prosecutor already had introduced and defined in context.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">As noted above, the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine does not apply to the present case because defense counsel\u2019s remarks were not improper (Majority op. at-), and the \u201claw of the streets\u201d remarks were not improper. Nonetheless, I would deem the \u201claw of the streets\u201d comments from the prosecutor, even assumed <em>arguendo </em>to be improper, a fair response to defense counsel\u2019s closing argument. Appealing to the jury\u2019s common sense, defense counsel argued that it would be contrary to human nature for a victim who had been shot three times to lie to protect his assailant. Thus, defense counsel argued, Cotton\u2019s testimony that Lee was not the shooter should be considered credible. The prosecution countered, providing an alternate theory of Cotton\u2019s motivation for his testimony. The prosecutor, also appealing to the jury\u2019s common sense, argued in rebuttal that Cotton\u2019s testimony could be explained by his reluctance to incriminate his friend and cooperate with authorities. Both arguments address the same underlying issue, Cotton\u2019s credibility. Both arguments appeal to the jury\u2019s understanding of human nature and motivation. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were a fair alternative explanation of the same evidence, <em>ie., </em>Cotton\u2019s testimony that Lee did not attack him.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Accordingly, although I concur with the judgment of the Majority opinion and its analysis of the \u201cgolden rule\u201d invocation, I would hold that the prosecutor\u2019s \u201claw of the streets\u201d comments were mere oratorical conceits permissible under the liberal freedom of speech allowed in closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Judge RAKER has authorized me to state that she joins in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">. I also disagree with the Majority opinion\u2019s analysis of the \u201cinvited response\u201d doctrine. The Majority opinion correctly notes that the invited response doctrine only applies where opposing counsel has made some improper remark or argument. Majority op. at -. There was nothing improper in either counsel\u2019s closing remarks to the jury-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. This rhetorical device is not novel. The rhetorical value of the phrase is apparent upon a careful analysis of the sentence. The phrase \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>law of the streets of Baltimore\u201d is preceded by a similar phrase, \"the law of the State of Maryland.\u201d Parallelism is a rhetorical device designed to make arguments more persuasive. Wikipedia, Parallelism (rhetoric), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelism_(rhetoric) (last visited 3 June 2008). In crafting sentences combining different thoughts and phrases, writers are encouraged to use similar words and structure to create parallelism in their arguments. William Strunk Jr. &amp; E.B. White, The Elements of Style 26-28 (4th ed. 2000). It is apparent to me that the prosecutor was using a basic rhetorical device (parallel structure) to craft a more persuasive argument regarding a permissible topic (witness credibility). The Court should be more leery of intruding into the discretion best left to the trial court where counsel is using rather standard rhetorical devices to argue about permissible topics.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\">. The \"widespread publicity\u201d regarding the number of murders in Baltimore in 1972, according to the Court, consisted of two news articles (in two different newspapers) published 19 days before the trial. <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 439 n. 10, 326 A.2d 707, 728 n. 10 (1974). A current search of the Baltimore Sun for \"stop snitching\u201d turns up 97 articles over the past three years. In addition, witness cooperation was a continuing theme of a fictional, but highly influential, HBO crime drama based in Baltimore that recently signed off the air.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-8\">. The prosecutor's last reference to \"the law of the streets\u201d aims at a somewhat different sense. The use of the phrase, however, likely was not confusing or misleading to the jury. The prosecutor asked the jury to \"teach the defendant not to follow the laws of the streets of Baltimore, but to follow the laws of the State of Maryland.\u201d This is a straightforward exhortation to the jury to uphold the rule of law (a frequent theme of sanctioned Law Day ceremonies in Maryland and elsewhere).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
