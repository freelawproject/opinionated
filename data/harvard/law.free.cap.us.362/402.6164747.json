Upon consideration of the entire record we agree with the Solicitor General that \u201cthe record in this case does not sufficiently support the findings of competency to stand trial/' for to support those findings under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 4244 the district judge \u201cwould need more information than this record presents.\u201d We also agree with the suggestion of the Solicitor General that it is not enough for the district judge to find that \u201cthe defendant [is] oriented to time and place and [has] some recollection of events,\u201d but that the \u201ctest must be whether he has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>In view of the doubts and ambiguities regarding the legal significance of the psychiatric testimony in this case and the resulting difficulties of retrospectively determining the petitioner\u2019s competency as of more than a year ago, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of conviction, and remand the case to the District Court for a new hearing to ascertain petitioner\u2019s present competency to stand trial, and for a new trial if petitioner is found competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
