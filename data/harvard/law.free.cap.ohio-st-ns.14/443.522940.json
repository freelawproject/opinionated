Keyes et al.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b459-9\">1. The 17th section of the act regulating the mode of administeriDg assignments, etc., passed April 6, 1859 (4 Curwen's Stat. 3352), applies to fraudulent conveyances made <em>before </em>as well as after the passage of the act.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b459-10\">2. Hence, where an insolvent debtor made a fraudulent conveyance of his land on the 23d February, 1858, tnd a creditor obtained judgment in the next following October, and filed his petition to set aside the fraudulent conveyance, and to subject this land to the payment of his judgment, on the 18th day of May, 1859, such creditor obtained no priority over the other creditors of the insolvent debtor.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-11\">Error to the district court of Ashtabula county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-12\">The plaintiffs in error, were plaintiffs below. In their original petition, filed on the 18th of May, 1859, they alleged that prior to January, 1858, the defendants, Henry Keyes and Ira <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>White, together with one Martin Keyes, were indebted to the plaintiffs in about $4000, and became insolvent. That Henry Keyes, for the purpose of defrauding his creditors, on the 23d of February, 1858, conveyed certain lands described in the petition, situate in Ashtabula county, and of which he was the owner, to the defendant, Henry P. Keyes. That at the October term of the court of common pleas of Ashtabula county, the plaintiffs, on their said indebtedness, recovered a judgment against the said Henry Keyes and Ira White, for $3,950 68, and costs. That a large balance remained due on said judgment, which the plaintiffs were unable to collect, and they prayed that said lands might be sold to satisfy their judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\">Answers were filed by Henry Keyes and Henry P. Keyes, denying that the conveyance from the former to the latter was fraudulent. The answers also alleged, that on the 18th of June, 1859, the lands were reconveyed by Henry P. Keyes to Henry Keyes, and that on the same day Henry Keyes conveyed the same, together with his property generally, to J. Q. Farmer, as his assignee, in trust for the benefit of all his creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\">On the trial, in the district court, the court found \u201c all the facts stated in the petition to be true, and that the sale of the lands by the said Henry Keyes to the said Henry P. Keyes was fraudulent and void. The court further found, that said lands were afterward, as set forth in the answers of the said Henry and Henry P. Keyes, conveyed to one J. Q. Farmer, in trust for the creditors of said Henry Keyes, and that said plaintiffs have no priority over the general creditors of Henry Keyes.\u201d The court thereupon decreed that \u201c said sale from said Henry Keyes to the said Henry P. Keyes, be set aside as utterly null and void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-7\">The plaintiffs excepted to the opinion and judgment of the court, and filed their petition in error to reverse the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-8\">The errors assigned are, in substance, that the court did not find the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment a lien upon the land described in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition; and that it held that the plaintiffs had no priority over the general creditors of Henry Keyes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>0. Booth and O. H. </em>Bitch, for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-5\">1. The plaintiffs\u2019 judgment against Henry Keyes and Ira White, was a lien on the lands of Keyes, previously conveyed by him for the purpose of defrauding his creditors. <em>Myerly et al. </em>v. <em>Hewett et al., </em>16 Ohio Rep. 451; <em>Barr </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>3 Ohio Rep. 527; <em>Walpole\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Ink, </em>9 Ohio Rep. 142; Wright\u2019s Rep. 700.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-6\">2. The 17th section of the statute, in relation to assignments, does not apply to fraudulent conveyances made before the passage of the act. <em>Conrad &amp; Bro. et al. </em>v. <em>Pancost &amp; Co., </em>11 Ohio St. Rep. 685.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b461-7\">. <em>Sherman $ Barmer, </em>for defendants in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-8\">1. A judgment is a lien only upon the legal title of the judgment debtor\u2019s lands. <em>Baird et al. </em>v. <em>Kertland et al., 8 </em>Ohio Rep. 23; 11 Ohio Rep. 351, 357.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-9\">2. The legal title in lands fraudulently conveyed, passes to the fraudulent grantee, as against creditors, notwithstanding the statute of frauds. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>18 Johns. 524; 3 Ohio St. Rep. 261; 10 Ohio Rep. 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-10\">3. The 17th section of the act of April 6, 1859, regulating assignments, etc., applies to fraudulent conveyances existing at the time of the passage of the act.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b461-11\">Wilder, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aci\">Two questions are made by the plaintiffs in error \u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">1. Was the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment against Henry Keyes and Ira White, a lien upon the lands of Keyes, of which he had made a previous fraudulent conveyance ?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">2. Does the 17th section of the statute, in relation to assignments (4 Curwen\u2019s Stat. 3352), apply to fraudulent conveyances made prior to its passage ?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">The plaintiffs\u2019 debt was contracted prior to January, 1858. The fraudulent conveyance of Henry Keyes was made February 23, 1858. The plaintiffs\u2019 judgment was recovered in October, 1858. The \u201cact regulating the mode of administering assignments in trust for the benefit of creditors,\u201d was passed and took effect April 6,1859. The plaintiffs\u2019 petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>was filed in the common pleas, May 18, 1859. The lands fraudulently conveyed by Henry to Henry P. Keyes, were re-conveyed by Henry P. to Henry Keyes, June 18,1858, and on the same day were conveyed by Henry Keyes to J. Q. Farmer, in trust for the benefit of all the creditors of Henry Keyes.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">As, in our opinion, it is not necessary, in this case, to decide the question, whether a judgment is a lien upon land fraudulently conveyed before its recovery \u2014 a question of some difficulty in its solution, and in respect to which there might not be entire unanimity among the members of the court \u2014 we do not propose to consider or decide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Judgment liens are purely of statutory creation, and pertain solely to the remedy. They create no vested right of property, and are subject to modification or extinction, as the legislature, in its wisdom, may see fit to provide by the modification or repeal of the statutes creating them.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In legislating, therefore, upon the subject of assignments and fraudulent conveyances, so far as related to any supposed judgment liens, there was no difficulty in the way of the legislature, in giving the same effect to fraudulent conveyances theretofore made as to those thereafter to be made. The only-question, then, necessarily arising in this case, is: Does the 17th section of the said statute, regulating assignments (4 Curwen\u2019s Stat. 3352) apply to fraudulent conveyances made prior to the passage of that act ?</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Said section, or so much of it as is material to the present question, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u201c Sec. 17. All transfers, conveyances or assignments, made with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors, shall inure to the equal benefit of all creditors in proportion to the amounts of their respective claims, and the probate judge, after any such transfer, conveyance or assignment, shall have been declared, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to have been made with the intent aforesaid, on the application of any creditor, shall appoint an assignee,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">From 1835 to 1859, the legislature had provided, by various statutes, that all assignments of property made by debtors i&lt;? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>trustees, in contemplation of insolvency, and with the design to secure one or more creditors to the exclusion of others, should be held to inure to the benefit of all the creditors of the assignor, in proportion to their respective demands. 1 Cur-wen\u2019s .Stat. 161 and 424, and 3 Curwen, 2239. The main purpose of this legislation was to secure, to the extent of all such assignments, an equal distribution of the effects of insolvent debtors among their creditors. It was a just and wise purpose, and the legislature sought greatly to extend the principle by the much broader and more general provisions contained in the 17th section of the act of April 6, 1859, above quoted. The language used in this section is general. Not \u201c all transfers,\u201d etc., \u201c <em>hereafter </em>made,\u201d but \u201c all transfers, conveyances or assignments, made with the intent,\u201d etc., \u201cshall <em>inure </em>to the equal benefit of all creditors,\u201d etc. The object sought was equality of distribution, among the creditors, of all property so conveyed or \u2019assigned. The language is sufficient and appropriate to embrace lands conveyed before, as well as after, the passage of the act. Save, where vested rights had intervened, there was the same reason for the application of the principle of equality of distribution in the one case as in the other, and we think the act should be so construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The statute against frauds and perjuries made such conveyances void as against creditors, but they were valid between the parties. The act of April 6, 1859, gives effect to the conveyance, but constitutes the fraudulent grantee a trustee, and charges the land with a trust for the benefit of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">It is not material when the conveyance is declared fraudulent by the .court, except so far as relates to the jurisdiction of the probate court, which jurisdiction then attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">It is claimed by the counsel for the plaintiffs, that the trust charged upon the property, is only for the benefit of such as were creditors at the time of the conveyance, and that those whose debts were contracted after the conveyance, have no claim on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">If this were so, it would not avail the plaintiffs in this case. The insolvency of Keyes existed at the time of the convey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>anee, and it does not appear that any of his creditors became such after the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-6\">Brinkerhoee, C.J., and Scott, Ranney and White, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
