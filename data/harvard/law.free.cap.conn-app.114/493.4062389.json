We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On April 20,2003, Easter Sunday, the victim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who was ten years old at the time, and several members of her family, as part of their living arrangements, were staying with the defendant\u2019s sister, Ella Saunders, in her apartment. Also present, among others, were Walter Saunders, the defendant\u2019s brother, who was dating the victim\u2019s mother, the defendant\u2019s mother, Maggie Saunders, the defendant, and Ella Saunders\u2019 children, Asia, Nisa, Delvin and Devante. The sleeping arrangements were such that the victim shared a room with her five year old brother, C, and Asia. On that night, the victim shared a twin bed with her brother; he slept at the head and she at the foot of the bed, while Asia slept on the floor. The victim slept on her stomach, still dressed in her Easter dress with her undergarments and shoes on. At some point, the defendant entered the room and shook the victim\u2019s arm, telling her that her mother wanted her. The victim feigned sleep and ignored the defendant, who then went into the hall outside the room. Once there, the defendant had a brief conversation with someone who then went downstairs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The defendant reentered the room and approached the victim, who was still feigning sleep, face down on the bed. He pulled down her undergarments and left the room again. He soon returned and removed C from the twin bed he was sharing with the victim and placed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>him on the floor. C did not awaken. The defendant then inserted his penis into the victim\u2019s vagina. The defendant had lubricated his penis with shampoo that burned the victim\u2019s vagina. The defendant then tried to insert his penis fully into the victim\u2019s vagina for five minutes to no avail. During the assault, the victim continued to feign sleep in fear that had she not, the defendant would have physically assaulted her. After ending his efforts, the defendant pulled the victim\u2019s undergarments back up, placed C back on the bed and left the room. Neither of the children sharing the room with the victim awoke during the incident. The next morning, the victim awoke before anyone in the house and went into the bathroom that was located next to the bedroom she slept in. The victim saw a bottle of shampoo placed on the toilet and started to cry. The victim did not immediately report the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">On October 29, 2003, the victim was at home with C and her older brother, D, while their mother was at work.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She and D were watching the movie \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d on television. In the movie, there is a scene in which a character is raped by her father and becomes pregnant. After viewing the movie, the victim had a violent outburst in which she destroyed several glass figurines and other items she kept in her bedroom. D intervened, asking the victim what was wrong with her. The victim told D that the defendant had raped her. D then called their mother and reported to her what the victim had told him. The victim\u2019s mother came home and called the police. Joann Sodan, a police officer, arrived at the scene and interviewed the victim. The victim reported to Sodan that the defendant had raped her on Easter Sunday, 2003. She also told Sodan that during the assault, she lay face down on her stomach. Subsequently, the victim picked the defendant\u2019s photograph out of a photographic array at the police department. The defendant was charged by substitute long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>form information with sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. After a trial to the jury, the defendant was found guilty of both crimes. The court imposed a total effective sentence of ten years imprisonment followed by fifteen years of special parole. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The defendant claims first that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of both charges because the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator of the assault. In other words, the defendant claims that by itself, the victim\u2019s identification of him as the perpetrator, under the circumstances, fails to establish beyond a reasonable doubt his identity as the perpetrator. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [jury] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\u201cIt is within the province of the jury to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the facts proven. . . . The jury may draw reasonable inferences based on other inferences drawn from the evidence presented. . . . Our review is a fact based inquiry limited to determining whether the inferences drawn by the jury are so unreasonable as to be unjustifiable. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">\u201c[T]he inquiry into whether the record evidence would support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt does not require a court to ask itself whether it believes that the evidence . . . established guilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . We do not sit as a [seventh] juror who may cast a vote against the verdict based upon our feeling that some doubt of guilt is shown by the cold printed record. . . . Furthermore, [i]n our review of the evidence to determine its sufficiency, we do not look at the evidence to see whether it supports the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . Instead, our focus is whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [trier\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Fleming, </em>111 Conn. App. 337, 342-43, 958 A.2d 1271 (2008), cert. denied, 290 Conn. 903, 962 A.2d 794 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The defendant claims essentially that the victim\u2019s identification of him as the perpetrator of the assault against her is insufficient as a matter of law to support his conviction of these crimes. He argues that because there was no physical evidence or any corroborating witness and the assault took place in a dark room, just after the victim woke up and while the victim remained face down feigning sleep, the victim lacked the opportunity to observe him and, thus, accurately to identify him as the person who assaulted her. The defendant bolsters this claim by arguing that the assault took place in a room with two sleeping children, in a house full of people just after the victim heard the defendant converse with another party in the hallway and that it is just as likely that this other person committed the assault rather than the defendant. Moreover, the defendant contends, the victim\u2019s identification is based on her conclusion that it was the defendant who assaulted her as opposed to what she actually saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Although the defendant couches his argument in terms of insufficiency of the evidence, he confuses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>however, the issues of sufficiency and credibility. As just noted, \u201c[o]ur task is to view the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict before determining if the jury reasonably could have concluded that such evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . We assume that the jury credited the evidence that supports the conviction if it could reasonably have done so. Questions of whether to believe or to disbelieve a competent witness are beyond our review. As a reviewing court, we may not retry the case or pass on the credibility of witnesses. . . . We must defer to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses that is made on the basis of its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Osoria, </em>86 Conn. App. 507, 514-15, 861 A.2d 1207 (2004), cert. denied, 273 Conn. 910, 870 A.2d 1082 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We note, that although \u201c[i]t is black letter law that in any criminal prosecution, the state bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s identity as one of the perpetrators of the crime charged\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra, 111 Conn. App. 343; \u201cit is for the trier of fact to determine the weight to be given [an] identification.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>274 Conn. 790, 802, 877 A.2d 739 (2005). Although the victim did not report the assault immediately, the testimony reveals that she consistently reported\u2014to family, law enforcement and an examining physician\u2014that it was the defendant who assaulted her. Moreover, she chose the defendant from a police photographic array and identified him in court as the person who assaulted her. See id. (\u201cin-court identifications . . . [are] sufficient evidence by themselves to allow the tiler of fact to conclude that it was the defendant who committed the crimes charged\u201d). On the record before us, the jury was free to credit the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>testimony. Because we cannot decide issues of credibility, the defendant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Next, the defendant claims that the court improperly allowed the state to comment on missing witnesses during final argument. Specifically, the defendant contends that (1) there was no factual basis for the state to comment on one missing witness in particular, (2) the testimony of the missing witnesses would have been cumulative and allowing the state to comment on them was an abuse of discretion and (3) the state\u2019s comments exceeded the scope of permissible comments allowed under <em>State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>250 Conn. 722, 737 A.2d 442 (1999) (en banc), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1170, 120 S. Ct. 1195, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1099 (2000).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We conclude that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>issues were not preserved at trial and, accordingly, do not reach the merits of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">During the trial, Elizabeth Rhodes testified that the defendant was at her home in North Carolina on April 20, 2003. She testified that the defendant showed up at her house with his infant son sometime in the morning and stayed all day. She testified that her son-in-law, Bruce Bulla, and stepdaughter, Anitra Bulla, were present when the defendant arrived and that they all spent the holiday together having a cookout. She also testified that the defendant stayed until just before dark. There was also testimony from Rhodes that indicated that her husband was present in the home while the defendant and his infant son were there.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant did not call any of these individuals to testify as witnesses. The state asked the court\u2019s \u201cpermission during [its] rebuttal closing argument to comment on certain\u2014the absence of certain witnesses and [assured the court that its] argument will go no further than that.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The defendant objected to the state\u2019s request as follows: \u201c[T]here\u2019s probably two different issues. Regarding the comments with regard to [Rhodes\u2019 testimony], I think she said her stepdaughter or others who were down in North Carolina, it\u2019s probably fair game to say that from all the people that were there, only [Rhodes] testified. That\u2019s simply a fact. To say that [the defendant] could have produced, it\u2019s just as difficult for us to produce [a potential witness from North Carolina] on short notice . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>as it is for the state to get [another potential witness from North Carolina] here. Now, as for the other witnesses that were relatives of [the defendant] here [in Connecticut] . . . they were on the state\u2019s witness list and they didn\u2019t produce them.\u201d It seems that the defendant\u2019s arguments were twofold: (1) that the missing North Carolina witnesses would have been difficult to produce; and (2) that the missing local witnesses, members of the defendant\u2019s family, were on the state\u2019s witness list, the state failed to call them as witnesses, and therefore the state should be precluded from commenting on the defendant\u2019s failure to call any of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The court, after reviewing <em>Malave, </em>allowed the state only to \u201ccomment [in closing argument] insofar as the\u2014 those witnesses reflect on the weakness of the opposing party\u2019s alibi. So, [the state will] have to confine [itself] to drawing attention to the absence of those people. . . . Those named people. And under <em>Malave, </em>I think this is allowed. I think [the state] followed the proper procedure for notifying the bench and [the defendant that it] intendfs] to argue this. . . . And I\u2019ve noted [the defendant\u2019s] objection.\u201d In its rebuttal closing argument, the state made the following comments: \u201c[L]et\u2019s talk about Rhodes\u2019 testimony. Was that testimony corroborated? We did not hear from her husband. Her husband was seated in the back room of the courthouse\u2014of the courtroom\u2014the backseat of the courtroom.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She testified he saw [the defendant] that day. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Did we hear from him? We didn\u2019t hear from him. She talked about her; I think she said [that her] stepdaughter and son-in-law were present as well. We didn\u2019t hear from them, either, and I believe her testimony was, \u2018I would have brought them.\u2019 She didn\u2019t bring them. We didn\u2019t hear from them. And this is a woman who has six children, ten grandchildren, big in the community, and those were the only people who were at her house that day and we did not hear from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">\u201cCorroboration could have also come from members of the defendant\u2019s family themselves. You heard [the state\u2019s] witnesses say that Easter [Sunday] 2003 or that during week, Ella Saunders, Theresa Saunders, Maggie Saunders [and] Walter Saunders were all present that day. That\u2019s the testimony you heard from the state\u2019s witnesses [who] were present on [April 20, 2003] and resided in that house. We didn\u2019t hear from any of those people, and, as we know, Maggie Saunders has been in the courtroom every day since we started this trial. Did we hear from her? We did not.\u201d The defendant did not make any further objection at any time subsequent to these statements or request a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">On appeal, the defendant makes three arguments concerning these comments made by the state during final argument. First, the defendant contends that there was no factual basis for the state\u2019s commenting on Rhodes\u2019 husband\u2019s not testifying because the evidence established that he had not returned from work prior to the defendant\u2019s leaving the Rhodes\u2019 residence. Second, the defendant argues that the testimony of the potential North Carolina witnesses would have been cumulative, and, therefore, allowing the state to comment on the missing witnesses was an abuse of discretion. Last, the defendant argues that the state\u2019s comments exceeded the scope of permissible comments allowed under <em>Malave </em>by implicitly and improperly inviting the jury to draw an adverse inference that the testimony of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Rhodes\u2019 husband would not have supported the defendant\u2019s alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u201cAppellate review of evidentiary rulings is ordinarily limited to the specific legal [ground] raised by the objection of trial counsel. ... To permit a party to raise a different ground on appeal than [that] raised during trial would amount to trial by ambuscade, unfair both to the trial court and to the opposing party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stenner, </em>281 Conn. 742, 755, 917 A.2d 28, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 883, 128 S. Ct. 290, 169 L. Ed. 2d 139 (2007); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At trial, the defendant\u2019s objections were based on the difficulty in getting the North Carolina witnesses to Connecticut and the fact that the state did not call as witnesses the members of the defendant\u2019s family that it wanted to comment on. On appeal, the defendant is abandoning those arguments in favor of the three arguments detailed previously.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cInasmuch as the defendant raises a claim on appeal different from the one that he raised at trial, he is not entitled to review of his claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>263 Conn. 524, 556, 821 A.2d 247 (2003). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim fails.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The defendant next claims that the state engaged in prosecutorial impropriety during final argument and, therefore, deprived him of his due process right to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The defendant concedes that he did not object to the alleged instance of prosecutorial impropriety at trial. \u201cOnce prosecutorial impropriety has been alleged, however, it is unnecessary for a defendant to seek to prevail under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and it is unnecessary for an appellate court to review the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Golding. . . . </em>The reason for this is that the touchstone for appellate review of claims of prosecutorial [impropriety] is a determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial, and this determination must involve the application of the factors set out by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pascal, </em>109 Conn. App. 55, 66, 950 A.2d 566, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 917, 957 A.2d 880 (2008). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial impropriety, we engage in a two step analytical process. . . . The two steps are separate and distinct. . . . We first examine whether prosecutorial impropriety occurred. . . . Second, if an impropriety exists, we then examine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>whether it deprived the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. ... If we conclude that prosecutorial impropriety has occurred, we then must determine, by applying the- six factors enumerated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, [540], whether the entire trial was so infected with unfairness so as to deprive the defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. . . . These factors include the extent to which the impropriety was invited by defense conduct, the severity of the impropriety, the frequency of the impropriety, the centrality of the impropriety to the critical issues in the case, the effectiveness of the curative measures adopted and the strength of the state\u2019s case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pascal, </em>supra, 67. We now turn to the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">As noted previously, in its rebuttal final argument, the state made the following comments: \u201c[L]et\u2019s talk about Rhodes\u2019 testimony. Was that testimony corroborated? We did not hear from her husband. Her husband was seated in the back room of the courthouse\u2014of the courtroom\u2014the backseat of the courtroom. She testified [that] he saw [the defendant] that day. Did we hear from him? We didn\u2019t hear from him.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the statement\u2014\u201c[s]he testified [that] he saw [the defendant] that day\u201d\u2014alluded to facts that were not in evidence and, thus, constituted prosecutorial impropriety. The state counters that it confined its rebuttal argument properly to evidence adduced at trial and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. It is the following exchange that is at the crux of the defendant\u2019s claim, which took place during the state\u2019s cross-examination of Rhodes:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u201cQ. So, then what did you do after [the defendant] left?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>\u201cA. I was waiting for my husband to come home</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">\u201cQ. And what time does your husband get home?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u201cA. He got home\u2014well, he got most time\u2014a twelve to fourteen hour shift sometimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\u201cQ. So, you\u2014do you recall what time your husband came home on Easter of 2003?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">\u201cA. Right before dark. That\u2019s all.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">\u201cQ. Right before dark? Was [the defendant] still there when your husband came home?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">\u201cA. Yeah.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">\u201cQ. Was the baby still there?</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">\u201cA. He left with the baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">The defendant argues that this exchange supports the conclusion that Rhodes\u2019 husband did not see the defendant at his home on April 20, 2003, and, therefore, the defendant was deprived of a fair trial because the prosecutor improperly referred to facts that were not in evidence during final argument. The defendant contends that Rhodes\u2019 affirmative response to the questions \u201cRight before dark? Was [the defendant] still there when your husband came home?\u201d was merely an answer to the first question, leaving the second question unanswered. Therefore, the defendant asserts, the evidence supported a finding that Rhodes\u2019 husband did not arrive home until after the defendant left and was not a witness who could have supported his alibi. On this basis, the defendant argues that the state\u2019s contention otherwise\u2014that he saw the defendant that day\u2014amounted to prosecutorial impropriety. The state, however, counters that this very exchange supports the opposite conclusion. The state contends that Rhodes\u2019 testimony is merely inconsistent on the subject and supports the conclusion that her husband did arrive home from work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>that day while the defendant was present, and, as a result, it is reasonable to infer that he would have seen the defendant at his home in North Carolina on April 20, 2003, and could have testified in support of the defendant\u2019s alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">As noted, the first step in our analysis is to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s statements properly can be characterized as an impropriety. In so doing, we must bear in mind that \u201ca prosecutor properly may ask the jury to draw reasonable inferences based on the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Batista, </em>101 Conn. App. 623, 635, 922 A.2d 1116, cert. denied, 284 Conn. 918, 933 A.2d 721 (2007). We conclude that the statements claimed by the defendant to amount to prosecutorial impropriety were arguments presented by the state during its final argument that were based on reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in the case. To be sure, Rhodes\u2019 testimony about the timing of her husband\u2019s return from work on that day is not the picture of clarity.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We cannot conclude, however, as the defendant urges us, that this testimony <em>categorically </em>establishes that Rhodes\u2019 husband did not arrive home until after the defendant left and therefore did not see the defendant that day. This inconsistent testimony simply does not warrant such a categorical, one-sided conclusion. Although the inference that Rhodes\u2019 husband did <em>not </em>arrive home while the defendant was still present is supported by Rhodes\u2019 testimony, this circumstance alone does not foreclose the contradictory inference from being drawn reasonably from this inconsistent testimony. A conclusion supported plausibly by the testimony of Rhodes, on the record before us, is that her husband did arrive home before the defendant left, and, on that basis, it is a reasonable inference that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>see the defendant that day. Accordingly, we conclude that the statements made by the state during its rebuttal final argument cannot be characterized properly as prosecutorial impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person ...

Although our Supreme Court abandoned the <em>Secondino </em>rule, it did not intend to \u2018prohibit counsel from making appropriate comment, in closing arguments, about the absence of a particular witness, insofar as that witness\u2019 absence may reflect on the weakness of the opposing party\u2019s case.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v. <em>Malave, </em>supra], 739. Comments in closing argument that do \u2018not directly exhort the jury to draw an adverse inference by virtue of the witness\u2019 absence\u2019 do not necessarily fall under the ambit of <em>Secondino-, </em>id.; and accordingly are not forbidden by <em>Malave. </em>Our Supreme Court further provided that \u2018[o]f course, the trial court retains wide latitude to permit or preclude such a comment, and may, in its discretion, allow a party to adduce additional evidence relative to the missing witness issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>67 Conn.

Similarly, a party cannot merely comment on the failure of the opposing party to present a witness without first providing a factual or evidentiary foundation from which to infer a weakness in the opposing party\u2019s case.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)

During the defendant\u2019s direct examination of Rhodes, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">\u201cQ. First things first. Who\u2014who\u2019s this gentleman in the back who\u2019s smiling at you?</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">\u201cA. That\u2019s my husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">\u201cQ. Okay.

[T]he scope of final argument lies within the sound discretion of the court . . . subject to appropriate constitutional limitations. ... It is within the discretion of the trial court to limit the scope of final argument to prevent comment on facts that are not properly in evidence, to prevent the jury from considering matters in the realm of speculation and to prevent the jury from being influenced by improper matter that might prejudice its deliberations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>67 Conn.

Our review of the record and briefs indicate that the defendant has failed to establish an abuse of discretion by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b528-8\"> See footnote 9. Also, the defendant has not claimed on appeal that this factual assertion by the state amounted to prosecutorial impropriety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\"> We note that at no time did the defendant attempt to clarify the testimony of Rhodes by further questioning her during redirect examination or otherwise attempt to resolve the inconsistency in her testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
