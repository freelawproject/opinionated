We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On September 19, 2005, the victim, who was fourteen years old, was living with her mother on the second floor of a two-family house in New Britain. That morning, after her mother left for work, the victim missed her bus to school and subsequently decided to stay home. She proceeded to call a man named Lee, whom she had met through a telephone chat line, and invited him to her house. The victim was under the impression that Lee was eighteen years old and lived in Hartford. She had never seen him but had spoken to him approximately ten times over the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Shortly thereafter, Lee arrived at her house with two other males\u2014the defendant, who identified himself as Duane, and another male, who identified himself as Ryan. The four watched a movie together, during which the victim and Lee went into her bedroom. Lee kissed the victim on her neck, biting her in the process, and touched her buttocks. He tried to convince her to have further sexual contact with him, but the victim refused, telling him to let her go, which he did. The two rejoined the defendant and Ryan, who were still watching the movie in the living room. The defendant then told the victim that he wanted to talk to her, and they both went into her bedroom. Once inside her bedroom, the defendant pushed the victim onto her bed and took off her pants and underwear. He then put a condom on and proceeded to have sexual intercourse with the victim, despite her asking him to stop. Approximately three minutes later, the defendant put his clothes back on, and he and the victim returned to the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Lee then took the victim back into her bedroom and attempted to have sexual contact with her for a second time by opening her legs with his hands. The victim rebuffed Lee\u2019s advances, which prompted the three men to leave the victim\u2019s house. Within five minutes of their departure, the victim left her home and went across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>the street to her neighbor\u2019s house. The victim told her neighbor that she had been raped. The neighbor called the victim\u2019s mother, who immediately left work and took the victim to New Britain General Hospital. At the hospital, Ann Alexander, an emergency room staff nurse, examined the victim, using a sexual assault kit in the course of the examination. She observed bite marks on the left and right side of the victim\u2019s neck. She was unable to determine from the examination whether the victim had been sexually assaulted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Upon returning home from the hospital, the victim spoke with Marcin Ratajczak, an officer with the New Britain police department. She told Ratajczak how she came to know Lee and related the sexual assault by the defendant. She described the defendant as a black male with a Jamaican accent, six feet tall and weighing 170 pounds. She described Lee as wearing a blue MECCA<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> shirt and provided Ratajczak with Lee\u2019s telephone number. Ratajczak performed a reverse listing inquiry for the telephone number, which produced the address of 203 Sargeant Street, Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Ratajczak went to the residence, where he located a man who identified himself as Lloyd Aldridge, Sr. Aldridge told Ratajczak that Lee was his son and that Lee\u2019s real name was Lloyd Aldridge, Jr. Lee subsequently came out of the house. Ratajczak immediately noticed that Lee\u2019s clothing matched the description given by the victim, as he was wearing a blue MECCA shirt. Ratajczak then arrested Lee but was unable at that time to locate the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Two to three days after the alleged sexual assault of the victim and the arrest of Lee, Michael Steele, a detective with the New Britain police department, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>assigned the task of finding the defendant. On October 11, 2005, he discovered that the defendant\u2019s real name was Nicketa Wright. A department of motor vehicles record check revealed that the defendant lived at 205 Sargeant Street in Hartford, which was located in the same multifamily house in which Lee lived. Steele then compiled a photographic array that included the defendant\u2019s photograph and asked the victim to come to the police station to view it. The victim immediately, and with certainty, identified the defendant as the man who had sexually assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Subsequently, on December 16, 2005, Matthew Kelly, an officer with the New Britain police department, arrested the defendant in connection with the sexual assault of the victim. During the booking process, Kelly learned that the defendant was twenty-four years of age,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> six feet, one inch tall, weighed 170 pounds and spoke with a Jamaican accent.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">On the first day of the evidentiary portion of the defendant\u2019s trial, the court, <em>D\u2019Addabbo, J., </em>informed defense counsel that the state had issued a subpoena for the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file so that the court could review it in camera to determine whether it contained any exculpatory information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Judge D\u2019Addabbo further stated to defense counsel that the Juvenile Court, <em>Quinn, J., </em>had held a hearing earlier that morning on the victim\u2019s motion to quash the state\u2019s subpoena<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and, at the conclusion of the hearing, had issued an order for the release of the file to the trial court for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>in camera review, absent all mental health screening and assessment information.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The state then represented to Judge D\u2019Addabbo that the victim and her mother, after consultation with an attorney, had no objection to the court performing an in camera review of the victim\u2019s confidential Juvenile Court file.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">After a short recess, Judge D\u2019Addabbo announced that he had reviewed the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file, as redacted, and found that it contained no exculpatory information. Judge D\u2019Addabbo explained that he had reviewed similar files in the past and that he looked at the file with an eye toward \u201canything that could affect the cross-examination needs of the defense attorney, including the ability [of a witness] to perceive, to recollect, to testify, tell the truth, veracity.\u201d Judge D\u2019Addabbo, therefore, did not disclose the contents of the file to the parties and had the file sealed and marked for appellate review, to the extent that there was such appellate review. Judge D\u2019Addabbo next asked the parties if they wanted to say anything. Defense counsel replied: \u201cNothing to add, Your Honor.\u201d Judge D\u2019Addabbo further asked defense counsel: \u201cAll right. Any requests that you have at this point?\u201d Defense counsel replied: \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d The court then swore in the jury and commenced the evidentiary portion of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">After the victim and two other witnesses had testified, the court and the parties met in chambers to discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>the victim\u2019s status as a juvenile in a juvenile probation matter. The state represented to the court that it had advised defense counsel during jury selection that the victim was on probation and had informed defense counsel of the general nature of the probation. Defense counsel agreed that the substance of the information was given to him. The court then stated: \u201cAnd so you\u2019re aware of it, then. You made some tactical decisions during the cross-examination concerning that information.\u201d Defense counsel replied: \u201cThat\u2019s correct, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The defendant claims that the court denied him his sixth amendment right to confrontation and fourteenth amendment right to exculpatory evidence when it refused to disclose the information contained in the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file after the court\u2019s in camera inspection. A close review of the defendant\u2019s brief and oral argument to this court, however, reveals that he also claims that the Juvenile Court improperly redacted the victim\u2019s mental health screening and assessment information from the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file, thereby excluding it from the trial court\u2019s in camera review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We will first dispose of this second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The state argues that this claim is \u201cwholly unreviewable\u201d because the defendant did not object to Judge Quinn\u2019s order removing the mental health information and did not request that Judge D\u2019Addabbo review that information or that it be made part of the record for appellate review. We agree. Although the record reveals that defense counsel was not present at the hearing in front of Judge Quinn, Judge D\u2019Addabbo made counsel aware, on the record, that the hearing had taken place and that at the hearing, Judge Quinn had issued an order that included the redaction of any information regarding the victim\u2019s mental health. The defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>therefore, was put on notice of the Juvenile Court\u2019s order at that point in time but failed to object to it and appeal from it. The defendant now attempts to raise a claim relating to the Juvenile Court\u2019s order in his appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment. The Juvenile Court\u2019s order to exclude the victim\u2019s mental health records from her juvenile file, however, is wholly unrelated to any action of the trial court. Thus, we will not consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim that the victim\u2019s mental health record was improperly excluded from the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s primary claim, namely, that the court violated his constitutional rights when it refused to disclose the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file as redacted, the state, in its brief, argues that this claim is unreviewable because it was not preserved at trial and the defendant did not request this court to review his unpreserved claim pursuant to <em>State </em>v. Golding, 213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The state further argues that even if this court finds the defendant\u2019s claim to be reviewable, the trial court properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>concluded that the file contained no exculpatory information.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We agree with the state that the defendant\u2019s claim is unpreserved due to his failure to object to the trial court\u2019s ruling. We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable pursuant to <em>Golding, </em>despite his failure to specifically invoke <em>Golding </em>in his request for review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">As a general rule, appellate courts do not review claims not raised at the trial level. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), however, our Supreme Court established review for unpreserved claims that constituted \u201c \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 . . . .\u201d The court recognized \u201ctwo situations that may constitute \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 such that newly raised claims can and will be considered by this court. The first is . . . where a new constitutional right not readily foreseeable has arisen between the time of trial and appeal. . . . The second \u2018exceptional circumstance\u2019 may arise where the record adequately supports a claim that a litigant has clearly been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The cases decided after <em>Evans, </em>interpreting and reinterpreting its precepts, were not always consistent with each other and caused our Supreme Court, in <em>Golding, </em>to \u201carticulate guidelines designed to facilitate a less burdensome, more uniform application of the present <em>Evans </em>standard in future cases involving alleged constitutional violations that are raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239. Relying on the methodology of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), the court held that \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Golding </em>is often misconstrued to require the satisfaction of each of these four conditions to obtain review by this court. Instead, the language in <em>Golding </em>provides that all four conditions must be met for a defendant to <em>prevail </em>on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial. This court\u2019s ability to <em>review </em>a claim, and the defendant\u2019s ability to <em>prevail </em>on his claim, are two entirely different concepts. Case law is clear that \u201c[t]he first two [prongs of <em>Golding] </em>involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two . . . involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 621, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Golding, </em>the defendant \u201cbears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim\u201d and \u201cdemonstrating that his claim is indeed a violation of a fundamental constitutional right,\u201d thereby satisfying the first and second prongs.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240. Should the defendant do so, \u201c[an appellate court] will [then] review [the claim] and arrive at a conclusion as to whether the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and . . . clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial,\u201d and decide whether the state was able to demonstrate harmlessness, thereby satisfying the third and fourth prongs.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Id., 241. Thus, the court in <em>Golding </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ultimately held that this court \u201cerred by refusing to review the defendant\u2019s claim since she proffered a constitutional claim and the record was clearly adequate to review that claim.\u201d Id., 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">We recognize that in a number of cases, both this court and the Supreme Court have denied review of an unpreserved alleged constitutional claim on the ground that the defendant failed to request review by citing <em>Golding. </em>In recent years, cases have refined this concept as the defendant\u2019s failure to <em>affirmatively </em>request appellate review by citing <em>Golding. </em>These cases can be traced to <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>261 Conn. 156, 171, 801 A.2d 788 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In <em>Ramos, </em>the defendant brought a number of claims in his direct appeal to the Supreme Court. Id., 159. The court determined that two of those claims were unpreserved. Id., 165, 171. As to the first of those claims, the court held that the defendant, having sought review under <em>Golding </em>and having satisfied the first two prongs, failed to satisfy the third prong \u201cbecause he [had] not demonstrated that the alleged constitutional violation exists.\u201d Id., 165. As to the second claim, the court determined that it could not review that claim because the defendant had failed to request <em>Golding </em>review. Id., 171. The court was not explicit as to the manner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>which the defendant had failed to request <em>Golding </em>review properly. Id. Instead, it stated: \u201cA party is obligated . . . affirmatively to request review under [the <em>Golding </em>doctrine].\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><em>Ramos </em>cited the following statement in <em>State </em>v. <em>Waz, </em>240 Conn. 365, 371 n.11, 692 A.2d 1217 (1997), in support of the claimed necessity for an affirmative request: \u201c[Defendants who seek consideration of unpreserved constitutional claims [on appeal] . . . bear the burden of establishing their entitlement to such review under the guidelines enumerated in Golding.\u201d As previously noted, under the precise guidelines of <em>Golding, </em>a defendant who seeks consideration of his claim, i.e., review, need only provide an adequate record and proffer a claim \u201cof constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. We do not interpret <em>Ramos </em>and its progeny<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> as requiring a specific mention of <em>Golding </em>by name, which would effectively add a fifth prong to its test.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cThe only justification for the requirement that a defendant specifically cite <em>Golding </em>in its brief is that an appellate court should be clear on the level of review a defendant seeks because \u201c[i]t is not appropriate to engage in a level of review that is not requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ghant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>255 Conn. 1, 17, 761 A.2d 740 (2000). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Given the prominence of <em>Golding, </em>and its predecessor, <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 61, in our jurisprudence, however, it is difficult to conclude that even without a specific mention of <em>Golding, </em>an appellate court would fail to realize that a request for <em>Golding </em>review is being made in a defendant\u2019s brief, when a defendant explores the <em>Golding </em>methodology by establishing that there is an adequate record for review and proffering and discussing a claim that is of constitutional magnitude.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The rationale of <em>Evans </em>and <em>Golding </em>is that fundamental constitutional rights are of such importance that appellate courts should review claims of alleged constitutional violations even when a defendant fails to take an exception to the alleged violation at the trial court level. <em>Evans </em>and <em>Golding </em>are intended to deal with \u201csubstance, not labels.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gooch, </em>186 Conn. 17, 18, 438 A.2d 867 (1982). In <em>Gooch, Evans </em>was characterized by Justice Parskey as a \u201ctrial court bypass,\u201d although a narrow one, as opposed to an \u201cappellate Champs-Elysees.\u201d Id. A narrow bypass, however, is not necessarily a street with a neon sign on it, emblazoning the words <em>\"Golding </em>Review.\u201d Moreover, after elimination by our Supreme Court in <em>Golding </em>of the hurdle of \u201cfailure to preserve\u201d constitutional claims at the trial court level, so that appellate review could be obtained for some unpreserved constitutional claims, it is not logical for us to establish another hurdle, namely, the necessity of the mention of the very case that gives the defendant the right to obtain review of the claim he or she failed to preserve at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>To require a ritualistic incantation in a defendant\u2019s brief of the four prongs of <em>Golding, </em>followed by a citation to the case by name and volume, would do an injustice to the principles of the case. It is our belief that public confidence in judicial proceedings is more likely to be gained, rather than undermined, if we review a claim authorized by Supreme Court and Appellate Court decisions, instead of turning a \u201cdeaf pen\u201d to the claim because the name of the case entitling the defendant to such review was omitted in his or her brief. In addition, our holding promotes judicial economy, as it provides a lessened need for future habeas corpus petitions that allege ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to obtain appellate review of an unpreserved constitutional claim because counsel failed to cite <em>Golding </em>specifically in a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">This court\u2019s position is reinforced by the fact that in a number of instances, both this court and our Supreme Court have reviewed an unpreserved alleged constitutional claim despite the defendant\u2019s failure to request a <em>Golding </em>review. In both <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. 301, 315-16, 579 A.2d 515 (1990), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>214 Conn. 89, 97-98, 570 A.2d 209 (1990), our Supreme Court <em>presumed </em>that the defendant was seeking an <em>Evans-Golding </em>review because he asserted a claim of constitutional magnitude that he did not raise at trial, allowing the court to then proceed to analyze the claim under the prongs of <em>Golding. </em>This court also, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>37 Conn. App. 589, 617-18, 658 A.2d 98, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 916, 661 A.2d 97 (1995), stated: \u201cPresumably, the defendant seeks review under . . . <em>Golding . . . </em>although he has not cited that case, which allows review of an unpreserved claim of constitutional error under certain conditions. The claim is reviewable under the first two prongs of <em>Golding, </em>but the actual review shows the defendant\u2019s claim to be meritless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Furthermore, our Supreme Court in <em>Waz, </em>the case on which <em>Ramos </em>relies, addressed the defendant\u2019s unpreserved constitutional claim, despite the defendant\u2019s failure to make an express reference to the guidelines specified in <em>Golding. State </em>v. <em>Waz, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 371 n.11. In <em>Ramos </em>itself, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIn certain instances, dictated by the interests of justice, we may, sua sponte, exercise our inherent supervisory power to review an unpreserved claim that has not been raised appropriately under the <em>Golding </em>or plain error doctrines.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>supra, 261 Conn. 172 n.16; see Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (plain error review); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>281 Conn. 613, 618 n.5, 916 A.2d 17, cert. denied, 552 U.S. 868, 128 S. Ct. 164, 169 L. Ed. 2d 112 (2007). Moreover, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>233 Conn. 211, 212, 658 A.2d 566 (1995), a unanimous Supreme Court, in a per curiam decision, held that a defendant need not invoke the guidelines of <em>Golding </em>to get review of an unpreserved insufficiency of the evidence claim because \u201c[i]t is an essential of the due process guaranteed by the [fourteenth [a]mendment that no person shall be made to suffer the onus of a criminal conviction except upon sufficient proof . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 212-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">In conclusion, although we do not make it mandatory for a defendant to cite <em>Golding </em>to obtain review of an unpreserved claim of a constitutional deprivation at trial, we do require that a defendant present a record that is adequare for review and affirmatively \u201c[demonstrate] that his claim is indeed a violation of a fundamental constitutional right.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240. In the present case, the defendant has provided a record adequate for review and has sufficiently demonstrated, by discussion of relevant authority, that his claim that the court improperly refused to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the information contained in the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file implicates his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses and his fourteenth amendment due process right to obtain exculpatory evidence, both of which are of constitutional magnitude. Therefore, he has met the requirements for review as set out in <em>Golding, </em>even though he failed to cite the case by name in his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Having concluded that the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claims are reviewable, we next determine whether a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial, such that he should prevail.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendant first claims that the court\u2019s refusal to grant him access to the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation. He argues that when the state\u2019s case rests on the victim\u2019s testimony and when the defense amounts to an attack on the victim\u2019s credibility, the defendant is entitled to access exculpatory information in the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file for possible use in cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">\u201cA criminal defendant has a constitutional right to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses, which may include impeaching or discrediting them by attempting to reveal to the jury the witnesses\u2019 biases, prejudices or ulterior motives, or facts bearing on the witnesses\u2019 reliability, credibility, or sense of perception.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>75 Conn. App. 447, 456, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>817 A.2d 122, cert. denied, 263 Conn. 919, 822 A.2d 244 (2003). Thus, \u201c[a] conflict exists between a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation and the public policy interest of preserving the confidentiality of certain records.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McKiernan, </em>84 Conn. App. 31, 47, 851 A.2d 1198, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 915, 859 A.2d 573 (2004). \u201c[I]n some instances, otherwise privileged records . . . must give way to a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to reveal to the jury facts about a witness\u2019 mental condition that may reasonably affect that witness\u2019 credibility. . . . The defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination does not, however, allow him to discredit and impeach in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defendant might wish. . . . [T]he right to cross-examine witnesses does not include the power to <em>require </em>the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that <em>might </em>be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u201cOur Supreme Court has set forth a specific procedure to accommodate the tension between the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of cross-examination and the privacy interest of a witness in her confidential records. If, for the purposes of cross-examination, a defendant believes that certain privileged records would disclose information especially probative of a witness\u2019 ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth, he may, out of the jury\u2019s presence, attempt to make a preliminary showing that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness. . . .<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If in the trial court\u2019s judgment the defendant successfully makes this showing, the state must then obtain the witness\u2019 permission for the court to inspect the records in camera. A witness\u2019 refusal to consent to such an in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>camera inspection entitles the defendant to have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u201cUpon inspecting the records in camera, the trial court must determine whether the records are especially probative of the witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences. ... If the court determines that the records are probative, the state must obtain the witness\u2019 further waiver of his privilege concerning the relevant portions of the records for release to the defendant, or have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken. If the court discovers no probative and impeaching material, the entire record of the proceeding must be sealed and preserved for possible appellate review. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u201cOur standard of review of a challenge to a court\u2019s refusal to disclose privileged records is whether there was an abuse of discretion. . . . Discretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. . . . It goes without saying that the term abuse of discretion . . . means that the ruling appears to have been made on untenable grounds. ... In determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, we must make every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. . . . Access to confidential records should be left to the discretion of the trial court which is better able to assess the probative value of such evidence as it relates to the particular case before it . . . and to weigh that value against the interest in confidentiality of the records. ... On appeal, this court has the responsibility of conducting its own in camera inspection of the sealed records to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to release those records to the defendant.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>supra, 75 Conn.

Therefore, we conclude that the defendant failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he has not demonstrated that the alleged constitutional violation exists. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The defendant next claims that the denial of access to the victim\u2019s Juvenile Court file violated his due process right to exculpatory material under <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). The defendant argues that \u201cthere is a slight suggestion [from the victim\u2019s juvenile probationary status] that meaningful and exculpatory information was available in those sealed records.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>supra, 373 U.S. 83, involves the duty of the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defendant. Typically, \u201c[a] due process violation occurs under <em>Brady </em>only if the prosecution withholds material evidence favorable to a defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>227 Conn. 751, 762, 631 A.2d 309 (1993). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 106, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 49 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1976), however, specifically approves the procedure of the court making an in camera determination. Therefore, although the heart of the holding in the <em>Brady </em>case is the prosecution\u2019s suppression of evidence; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 404, 439 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>387 (1981); and although here the state had no access to the records and thus could not have suppressed them, we must assume that \u201cif the trial court discovers, in the course of an in camera inspection, evidence which is exculpatory ... in the <em>Brady </em>and <em>Agurs </em>senses, it would have a similar duty of disclosure to the defense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Storlazzi, </em>191 Conn. 453, 461, 464 A.2d 829 (1983). Consequently, \u201c[a]fter performing an in camera inspection, the trial court is required to release only information that is material and favorable to the defense.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leduc, </em>40 Conn.

On the other hand, evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L.

The trial court, therefore, did not fail to disclose any evidence so material as to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 763. Accordingly, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion and that the defendant has failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he has not demonstrated that the alleged constitutional violation exists.

To accomplish this, a defendant must present this court with a coherent, logical argument for review with authoritative citations to precedent. I depart from the majority in its conclusion that the defendant has satisfied that latter requirement. The defendant\u2019s appellate brief sets forth a claim of a constitutional violation.
