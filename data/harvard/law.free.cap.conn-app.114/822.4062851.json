(Marten), and its insurer, Crawford &amp; Company, appeal from the decisions of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirming the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner\u2019s (1) finding of compensability, (2) award of a penalty pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-303 and (3) refusal to reduce the award to the plaintiff, Debra Hummel, by the amount of social security widow\u2019s benefits she receives. We affirm the decisions of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the issues on appeal. The plaintiff filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim after her husband, Henry Hummel, was found dead in the sleeper cab of his employer\u2019s truck. On April 24, 2003, Darius J. Spain, workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fifth district, found the following facts. \u201cThe plaintiffs husband, Henry Hummel, was a cross-country driver of an eighteen wheel tractor trailer for Marten. He was found dead in the sleeper cab of his truck on November 25, 1997. He had returned home from a cross-country trip early in the afternoon of November 24, 1997, looking dirty, tired and agitated. He had a heated dispute with a Marten official over the telephone about whether he was entitled to be paid following an apparent problem with the paperwork that he had submitted earlier. The plaintiff testified that she had known her late husband for more than thirty years and had never seen him in such an agitated state. She feared he would have a heart attack. Following a shower and some rest, he left home between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. He parked near his drop off point in Waterbury so that he could sleep and then drop off his load early the next morning. He died in the sleeper cab before morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>\u201c[Commissioner Spain] also found that Marten had urged Henry Hummel to drive as much as possible. He falsified his log books to hide from the transportation authorities the number of hours he drove. On the three week trip, completed shortly before his death, he had driven an average of 569 miles per day, and it was not unusual for him to drive 5000 miles in a week. He slept only two or three hours a day and never exercised. He did not eat a proper diet, nor did he eat on a regular schedule. He was a lifelong smoker and sometimes used cigars to wake himself up by burning his fingers when he fell asleep while driving. He was sixty-four years old at the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">\u201c[Commissioner Spain] concluded that \u2018[t]he stress of [Henry Hummel\u2019s] job and its limitations on his time for other activities was a substantial factor in the chain of events which led to [his] fatal ischemic heart disease.\u2019 [Commissioner Spain] accordingly ordered the payment of benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-306. . . .<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [Commissioner Spain] did not determine the amount of benefits to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">\u201cThe defendants appealed to the board, claiming that the plaintiff failed to prove within a reasonable degree of medical probability that her late husband\u2019s employment was a substantial factor in the cause of his death. The board reviewed all of the testimony, including that of two medical experts, and concluded that an adequate evidentiary basis existed for the commissioner\u2019s finding of compensability. The board did not issue a remand order from its decision despite the failure to determine the amount of the award. Thereafter, the defendants appealed to this court, raising the same sufficiency of the evidence claim.\u201d <em>Hummel </em>v. <em>Marten Transport, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number><em>Ltd., </em>90 Conn. App. 9, 10-12, 875 A.2d 575 (2005), aff'd, 282 Conn. 477, 923 A.2d 657 (2007). This court dismissed the defendants\u2019 appeal for lack of a final decision. Id., 12-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">After the board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s finding of compensability, \u201cthe plaintiff . . . brought [a] separate proceeding to determine, among other things, the amount of benefits to be paid. In addition to the calculation of widow\u2019s benefits, the plaintiff sought an order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (f) that the defendants pay her benefits pending . . . appeal and sought the imposition of penalties under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-300 and 31-303.\u201d Id., 12-13. On November 18,2003, following a formal hearing, Amado J. Vargas, workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fifth district, calculated the widow\u2019s benefits that the plaintiff was due under \u00a7 31-306, entered the \u00a7 31-301 (f) order and held open the issues of \u00a7\u00a7 31-300 and 31-303 penalties. The defendants again appealed to the board, raising the issues of whether (1) the defendants would receive an offset under General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 31-307 (e) for social security old age insurance benefits that the defendants claimed the plaintiff had received<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) the entire award of benefits may be withheld on appeal because General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (d) and (f), as read together, are contradictory and unconstitutional as a deprivation of property without due process. On November 19, 2004, the board remanded the case to the commissioner for further proceedings addressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>the application of \u00a7 31-307 (e). The board held that \u00a7 31-301 (d) and (f) serve different purposes and that the issuance of a \u00a7 31-301 (f) order was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">On April 13, 2006, after a hearing, Michelle D. Truglia, workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fifth district, held that there was no statutory authority under \u00a7 31-307 (e) that would entitle the defendants to a setoff against widow\u2019s benefits awarded under \u00a7 31-306. In addition, Commissioner Truglia determined that the November 18, 2003 calculation of benefits created a legal obligation to pay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The commissioner also found that the plaintiff was entitled to 10 percent interest, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-300 and 37-3a, on the unpaid portions of benefits. Furthermore, Commissioner Truglia found that the defendants wilfully had failed to pay the \u00a7 31-301 (f) award and ordered the defendants to pay the second injury fund $4500 pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-288 (a) and 31-289. Finally, Commissioner Truglia found that the defendants had unduly delayed the payment of compensation in violation of \u00a7 31-288 (b) and ordered the payment of $9000 to the second injury fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-289. Commissioner Truglia left open the issue of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 31-300 for future proceedings and also \u201cexercised [her] discretion\u201d not to award interest under \u00a7 31-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The defendants again appealed to the board, claiming that (1) \u00a7 31-307 (e) entitled them to offset \u00a7 31-306 benefits with any payments to the plaintiff of federal social security survivor benefits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 (e), (2) Commissioner Truglia improperly found that the defendants had unduly delayed the payment and (3) Commissioner Truglia improperly awarded the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>interest pursuant to \u00a7 31-300. The plaintiff appealed from Commissioner Truglia\u2019s failure to award a mandatory 20 percent penalty pursuant to \u00a7 31-303. On April 19, 2007, the board affirmed Commissioner Truglia\u2019s finding and award except her conclusion that the award of a penalty under \u00a7 31-303 is discretionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Commissioner Truglia, on November 13, 2007, found that under \u00a7 31-303, the plaintiff was due a 20 percent penalty for unpaid widow\u2019s benefits and statutory burial expenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, Commissioner Truglia found that pursuant to \u00a7 31-300, the plaintiffs attorney was due $9300 in attorney\u2019s fees for his \u201cextraordinary efforts\u201d expended to collect benefits under \u00a7 31-301 (f).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendants again appealed to the board. On May 14, 2008, the board affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision, holding that the \u00a7\u00a7 31-300 and 31-303 awards of attorney\u2019s fees and statutory penalties were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Thereafter, the defendants appealed to this court, claiming that (1) the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner improperly found that work-related stress was a substantial factor in Henry Hummel\u2019s death when no medical expert testified to that effect, (2) the board incorrectly held that the penalty pursuant to \u00a7 31-303 applied to nonpayment of an award pending appeal and (3) social security widow\u2019s benefits should be credited against workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">The defendants first claim that the commissioner improperly found that Henry Hummel\u2019s death was compensable. Specifically, the defendants claim that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>commissioner improperly found that the stress of Henry Hummel\u2019s job and its limitations on his time for other activities was a substantial factor in the chain of events that led to the decedent\u2019s fatal ischemic heart disease.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">At the hearing before Commissioner Spain, the plaintiff testified as to the following facts. Henry Hummel was hired as a cross-country truck driver for Marten on August 4,1994. His job was to drive across the United States and sometimes Canada with different freights, keeping him on the road every day of the week. Henry Hummel frequently complained about his employment with Marten. In the last year or two of his life, Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>Hummel\u2019s physical appearance changed; he went from having a clean appearance, with his hair cut and his face shaved, to having a dirty, unkempt appearance, with dirt in the cracks of his hands, long hair and a long beard. He also began wearing untied sneakers or work boots and carrying excess weight in his abdomen. In 1997, Henry Hummel did not take any vacations.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">The plaintiff also testified that Marten paid Henry Hummel thirty-three cents per mile so that the more miles he drove, the more money he earned.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He habitually falsified his logs to drive more hours in a day than he was allowed under the regulations promulgated by the department of transportation. He received his assignments via computer from a dispatcher of Marten, allowing him to receive a new assignment as soon as he completed one. He would try to drive 5000 miles each week so that he could have enough money to support his family. He typically was away from home for up to three months at a time, and, even at home, he would wake several times during the night for coffee or a snack. His diet also was dictated by his long hours; he bought inexpensive instant foods that could be cooked quickly in his truck. The only exercise that Henry Hummel engaged in when he was on the road consisted of his getting out of his truck to walk to a dock or to a truck stop to take a shower or have a cup of coffee.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Furthermore, the plaintiff testified that her husband would often call and ask her what his pay was for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>week, thinking that his pay would be good because of how hard he worked. The plaintiff frequently had to inform him that Marten took money out of his pay because of penalties for late deliveries, delays in paperwork for assignments and advances to cover expenses for cleaning the truck, fueling the truck and tolls. When that happened, he would become very upset and call the payroll department to dispute the amount of his pay. During the last two years of his life, Henry Hummel expressed dissatisfaction with his job almost every time that he called home.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The plaintiff also testified that Henry Hummel had begun to complain about pain and weakness in his legs. When the Hummels brought their son around the neighborhood on Halloween, Henry Hummel had to drive. In addition, during the summer of 1997, he had complained that he was feeling old and tired and could not walk or do the things that he used to do. In the year prior to his death, he could not even walk the length of the Hummels\u2019 street. On his last trip, he was having pain in his back and shoulder but attributed it to an incident when he slipped off of his truck. He told the plaintiff that he was tired of the road and that it was \u201ckilling him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The plaintiff testified that Henry Hummel had been a cigarette smoker for many years but had switched to cigars approximately one year before his death. He would light a cigar and, to make sure he stayed awake while driving, would keep it in his hand so that it would bum down and bum his fingers.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The plaintiff also testified that on November 24,1997, her husband arrived at their home in Seymour between 1 and 2 p.m. Henry Hummel parked his eighteen wheel tractor trailer on the street outside their home because it was loaded with hazardous materials, requiring him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>to keep it within sight at all times.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When he arrived home that day, he was sick with a cold.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff described him as \u201cgrubby looking. He hadn\u2019t been bathed. He was tired. He was agitated. It wasn\u2019t Henry.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He was upset in part because another truck driver had just been found after being dead by the side of the road for one week. Additionally, while home, he talked to his employer\u2019s dispatcher and a payroll employee. He had an argument about not receiving his pay that week. Henry Hummel was upset because he could not get his paycheck to buy groceries for Thanksgiving dinner. He began swearing at the payroll employee, which the plaintiff noticed because it was out of character for her husband to use the \u201cf word\u201d in front of other people. After the argument, he was shaking and crying because he was tired of dealing with his job conditions and could not wait until retirement. The plaintiff tried to calm down Henry Hummel and told him that if he did not calm down, he could have a heart attack. In the thirty-one years she had known Henry Hummel, he was in the worst condition in which the plaintiff had ever seen him.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He eventually began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>to calm down; he spent some time with the Hummels\u2019 son, took a shower and lay down to try to sleep. Most of the time that he was home, however, he continued to talk about different problems at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Finally, the plaintiff testified that Henry Hummel left home at approximately 11 p.m. so that he could unload his truck early the next morning in Waterbury, pick up a short run and still be home in time for Thanksgiving with the plaintiff and their children. He had to stay with his truck overnight because of the hazardous materials with which it was loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Police reports were admitted into evidence and showed that Henry Hummel was found dead in his tractor trailer on November 25, 1997. He was found cyanotic in the rear bunk of his cab. A witness observed the tractor trailer idling, seemingly unoccupied, from 3 a.m. on November 25, 1997. An autopsy report was admitted into evidence and established that the cause of Henry Hummel\u2019s death was ischemic heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Steven M. Horowitz, a physician, testified as an expert on the basis of his review of the plaintiffs deposition testimony and the report of the defendants\u2019 medical expert, James F. Flint, also a physician. Horowitz testified as to the following facts. Henry Hummel had vascular disease. He underwent an operation to his legs to treat claudication and treatment for heart disease in 1987. He did not take care of himself very well and was under constant stress to support his family. He experienced significant stresses as a truck driver. He had underlying cardiovascular disease with a significant degree of stenosis of two coronary arteries and significant atherosclerotic buildup. It is reasonably medically probable that chronic stresses play a role in the deposition of plaque in the cardiovascular system. Henry Hummel was under significant chronic stress because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>the rigors of truck driving and died as a result of his underlying cardiovascular disease, which was caused or contributed to by his plaque buildup.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Horowitz also testified that stress causes changes in the hormone system, which in turn cause elevated blood pressure and the constriction of blood vessels. Elevated blood pressure and constricted blood vessels stress the internal lining of blood vessels and can injure the internal lining, creating a chain of events that leads to the deposition of plaque. Stress plays some role in changing the vascular state of a person, and, in certain circumstances, that role may be substantial. An acute stressful situation ordinarily increases the risk of a heart attack within the first three to six hours but may lead to unstable anginal conditions that cause or lead to a heart attack.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In addition, Henry Hummel\u2019s compro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>mised vascular condition would make it easier for acute stress to \u201cpush him over the edge\u201d and cause sudden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Horowitz testified that it was \u201cmost likely\u201d that Henry Hummel had ischemic cardiomyopathy that further compromised his ability to oxygenate his cells, and that it was a \u201creasonable medical hypothesis,\u201d \u201cbased on reasonable medical probability,\u201d that an acute stressful situation could have caused Henry Hummel to develop angina and suffer a myocardial infarction, resulting in sudden death.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Horowitz added that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>his opinion, based on a reasonable medical probability, that \u201c[i]f the time frame were correct ... an acute stressful situation could have led to a decompensation in someone who has an ischemic heart problem and cause either unstable anginal condition or possibly an acute myocardial infarction and the possibility of death.\u201d Horowitz stated, however, that he knew about Henry Hummel\u2019s underlying cardiovascular status from reading Flint\u2019s report and that he had an \u201cinkling\u201d of the underlying mental stress from the plaintiffs deposition testimony but that he had no knowledge of the events of November 24, 1997. Horowitz opined that he would be more comfortable with the time line if Henry Hummel had been able to testify that he suffered some symptoms on November 24, 1997, but with the facts he had, he couldn\u2019t \u201cknow for sure whether the acute episode\u201d was related.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Horowitz also testified that being a truck driver is inherently dangerous and may cause heart attacks because of stress, loneliness, sleep deprivation, unhealthy diet and insufficient exercise and activity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Horowitz also testified that Henry Hummel\u2019s poor diet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>smoking, sleep deprivation and stress affected his vascular disease.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Horowitz testified that he reviewed a literature search because he was not an expert on whether truck drivers were at an increased risk of heart disease. The research revealed that there were a number of studies that discovered an increased risk of fatal coronary disease in commercial drivers and that the authors suggested that the causes may be the constant stress of driving and the attendant isolation, lack of sleep and other lifestyle characteristics that Henry Hummel demonstrated.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Horowitz stated that \u201c[t]here is a correlation and that is about all we should be saying,\u201d but conceded that some of the studies attributed the increased risk of fatal coronary disease to the lifestyle involved in commercial driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Flint testified that he reviewed Henry Hummel\u2019s medical records, a police report, the plaintiffs deposition and some abstracts from medical research articles.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Flint stated that the records revealed that Henry Hummel suffered from chronic atherosclerosis. Flint opined that Henry Hummel experienced sudden death most likely due to an arrhythmia, caused either by a heart attack or severe coronary insufficiency. Flint stated that Henry Hummel had severe and extensive vascular disease, which had progressed from a heart attack in the late 1980s to the condition that caused his death. Flint testified that the majority of heart attacks occur at rest, brought on by a sudden plaque rupture in an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>arteiy. Flint testified that stress is \u201cprobably one of the risk factors that predisposes to vascular disease.\u201d He continued, however, stating that it was not a primary or major role and not as potent as other risk factors such as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and smoking. Flint testified that he did not think that Henry Hummel\u2019s work as a truck driver was the \u201cper se\u201d cause of his death. He explained that every occupation is stressful, so it was \u201ckind of part of the ambient background, I think, of the way we live.\u201d Flint testified that it was a reasonable medical probability that Henry Hummel\u2019s death was a natural progression of his extensive vascular disease. Furthermore, he testified that Hemy Hummel had other major contributing factors that led to his atherosclerosis, including his smoking, irregular diet, preexisting vascular disease and lack of medical care. Flint conceded, however, that atherosclerosis may be caused by more than one significant risk factor.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Flint testified on cross-examination that he had reviewed the plaintiffs deposition testimony but could not recall how many miles Henry Hummel drove on average. Flint suggested that it was \u201cmaybe 1000.1 don\u2019t remember exactly, though.\u201d The following exchange occurred between the plaintiffs counsel and Flint:</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">\u201cQ. Okay. You don\u2019t recall testimony [of] his driving 5000 miles a week on average?</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">\u201cA. Five thousand miles a week? No, I don\u2019t remember that.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">\u201cQ. Would you find that incredible if he drove 5000 miles a week or 3500 miles a week?</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\u201cA. Yeah, I would find 5000 miles a week incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">\u201cQ. That might change your opinion as to the relative degree of impact that his truck driving had on his general status? If he drove 5000 miles a week?</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">\u201cA. Well, I would wonder if it would be physically possible to drive that many miles in a truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">\u201cQ. But if he did or approached that, it would certainly take its toll physically, would it not?</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">\u201cA. That would probably be over 100 hours a week of continuous driving, if not more. That would be exhausting.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">\u201cQ. That would be what?</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">\u201cA. Exhausting.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">\u201cQ. Okay. And it would have physiological sequelae of that type of regiment, wouldn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">\u201cA. Well, I think working, you know, the longer one works, the more\u2014more tiring it is, yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">\u201cQ. Okay. And you knew he was under a compulsion to put on miles in order to be paid?</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">\u201cQ. Because he was paid by the mile?</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">\u201cA. Yes. Yeah. I understand that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Flint also testified that plaque rupture caused by a sudden emotional or physical stress is one theory, but that it is not really accepted by cardiovascular experts as unequivocally the only sequence of events leading to plaque rupture. He also testified that \u201cif you have a really severe stress, that can precipitate a heart attack, but it typically occurs during the stress, not hours later. \u201d Flint also testified that the \u201cprobability is low that having an argument in the afternoon is directly responsible for dying the next morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b863-8\">Flint testified that chronic stress is a contributing factor in the progression of vascular disease and the development of atherosclerosis. He testified that stress was not considered to be a major determinant in the progression of atherosclerosis but conceded that \u201cit\u2019s also very difficult to quantify stress.\u201d He added that stress is subjective and that some people tolerate external pressure better than others. Flint testified that the long hours of hard work that Henry Hummel put in were very stressful and exhausting. Flint testified that, on the basis of a reasonable medical probability, chronic stress itself is a contributing factor to the development and progression of atherosclerosis.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>testified that one article demonstrated a physiological connection between stressful times of driving and an increased catecholamine response, and the attendant rise in heart rate, blood pressure and the risk of vascular damage.

It cannot review the conclusions of the commissioner when these depend upon the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. . . . The finding of the commissioner cannot be changed unless the record discloses that the finding includes facts found without evidence or fails to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed. ... It [is] the commissioner\u2019s function to find the facts and determine the credibility of witnesses ....</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\u201cIt is an axiom of [workers\u2019] compensation law that awards are determined by a two-part test. The [claimant] has the burden of proving that the injury claimed arose out of the employment and occurred in the course of the employment. There must be a conjunction of [these] two requirements ... to permit compensation. . . . An injury is said to arise out of the employment when (a) it occurs in the course of the employment and (b) [it] is the result of a risk involved in the employment or incident to it or to the conditions under which it was required to be performed. . . .

There must be a conjunction of [these] two requirements [of the test] ... to permit compensation. . . . The former requirement [of arising out of the employment] relates to the origin and cause of the accident, while the latter requirement [of occurring in the course of employment] relates to the time, place and [circumstance] of the accident. . . . Whether an injury arose out of and in the course of employment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>a question of fact to be determined by the commissioner. ...

In the present case, the defendants challenge only the commissioner\u2019s findings with regard to whether Henry Hummel\u2019s death arose out of his employment with Marten. \u201c[Traditional concepts of proximate cause furnish the appropriate analysis for determining causation in workers\u2019 compensation cases. . . . [T]he test for determining whether particular conduct is the proximate cause of an injury [is] whether it was a substantial factor in producing the result. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">\u201cOur role is to determine whether the [board\u2019s] decision results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . .

To be reasonably probable, a conclusion must be more likely than not. An expert\u2019s testimony as to the reasonable probability of the occurrence of an event does not depend on semantics or the use of any particular term or phrase, but rather, is determined by looking at the entire substance of the testimony. . . . The [commissioner] alone is charged with the duty of initially selecting the inference which seems most reasonable and his choice, if otherwise sustainable, may not be disturbed by a reviewing court. . . . Inferences may only be drawn from competent evidence. Competent evidence does not mean any evidence at all.

The commissioner was free to determine in the first instance which inferences seemed most reasonable. The evidence supported the finding with a reasonable medical probability that the stress of Henry Hummel\u2019s job and its limitations on his time for other activities was a substantial factor in the chain of events that precipitated his fatal ischemic heart disease.

Instead, the defendants argue, the terms in \u00a7\u00a7 31-301 (f) and 31-303 are ambiguous and require resort to the legislative history for a determination of their meaning. The defendants argue that to hold otherwise would make the twenty day grace period in \u00a7 31-303 \u201csurplusage.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The board determined that the plain meaning of \u00a7 31-301 (f) provides no alternative to the payment of an award during the pendency of an appeal if the claimant seeks payment. Although the board\u2019s interpretation of the statute is not entitled to deference, we nonetheless determine that its conclusion is correct. We can discern no ambiguity in \u00a7 31-301 (f); it clearly directs payment to a claimant \u201c[d]uring the pendency of any appeal of an award made pursuant to [the act] . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Additionally, \u00a7 31-303 is not ambiguous.

This interpretation is in line with the act\u2019s remedial nature. \u201cThe purpose of the act is to compensate workers [and their dependents] for injuries arising out of and in the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>of employment, without regard to fault, by imposing a form of strict liability on employers. . . .

Any interpretation of \u00a7 31-303 including an indefinite grace period for contested awards only rewards employers for continuing to contest liability. In the present case, the defendants were first ordered to pay the plaintiff on November 18, 2003. The defendants\u2019 continuing refusal to compensate the plaintiff for the compensable death of her husband in 1997 is plainly the type of behavior that \u00a7 31-303, by its terms, should prevent.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Finally, the defendants claim that \u00a7 31-307 (e) must be construed to allow them a setoff for social security widow\u2019s benefits. Specifically, the defendants argue that they are entitled to a setoff because Henry Hummel was planning on retiring when he became sixty-five years old, which would have occurred approximately ten months after his death, and \u00a7 31-307 (e) explicitly permits an offset against old age benefits.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>The defendants requested that the commissioner allow an offset of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits for any social security widow\u2019s benefits that the plaintiff was receiving. The commissioner found that there was no statutory authority under \u00a7 31-307 (e) that would entitle the defendants to a setoff from widow\u2019s benefits awarded under \u00a7 31-306. On appeal, the board considered the defendants\u2019 claim de novo. The board conducted an analysis of the text of \u00a7 31-307 (e) and determined that the defendants were not entitled to a setoff. The defendants also failed to persuade the board that the general policy against allowing a claimant a double recovery would be violated by the plaintiffs full recovery of her award.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The defendants have presented us with a question of law to which we afford plenary review. See <em>Rutledge </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 380. We must determine whether the meaning of \u00a7 31-307 (e) is plain and unambiguous and whether the result in this case shows the statute to be unworkable. See <em>Urich </em>v. <em>Fish, </em>supra, 112 Conn. App. 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 31-307 (e) provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, compensation paid to an employee for an employee\u2019s total incapacity shall be reduced while the employee is entitled to receive old age insurance benefits pursuant to the federal Social Security Act. The amount of each reduced workers\u2019 compensation payment shall equal the excess, if any, of the workers\u2019 compensation payment over the old age insurance benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">After a thorough review, we must conclude that the board\u2019s well reasoned decision, denying the defendants a setoff, is sound. The plain meaning of \u00a7 31-307 (e) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>shows it to be inapplicable to the plaintiffs simultaneous collection of \u00a7 31-306 widow\u2019s benefits and social security widow\u2019s benefits. We do not find this result\u2014 that dependent survivors may recover more than incapacitated workers\u2014absurd or unworkable. Rather, we, like our Supreme Court, must conclude that our legislature chose to restrict the setoff to a particular circumstance. See <em>Rayhall </em>v. <em>Akim Co., </em>263 Conn. 328, 347, 819 A.2d 803 (2003).

We need not address that assertion, however, because we note that two experts testified as to different and sometimes conflicting opinions and that factual testimony and exhibits were admitted for the commissioner\u2019s consideration.

Those may have been manifestations of progressive heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">\u201cI don\u2019t know what the time frame of the heart attack would have been. It could have been within\u2014if he had an acute arrhythmia on base of a heart attack it may well have been within the first fifteen to thirty minutes of the onset of the heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">\u201cQ. Heart attacks take time to evolve, you may have some vasoconstriction, angina and plaque rupture, partial occlusion which goes to full occlusion and then a cascade of events that lead to death. It takes time\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">\u201cA. Yes, but we believe that can occur over a very short period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-14\">\u201cQ. Can it occur over a longer period of time also?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">\u201cA. We certainly see people who have unstable anginal conditions which kind of start and stop over hours to a couple of days.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">\u201cQ. Unstable angina can degrade into more serious things?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">\u201cA. Left alone, it can cause a heart attack or it can lead to a heart attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-18\">\u201cQ. That could be over a period of hours or days?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">\u201cA. It can.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-20\">\u201cQ. The situation I described\u2014it could be such a type of acute emotional event that can precipitate some sequelae?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-21\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m disagreeing about that. I am just talking the time frame in which I would expect that to occur. ... If you are asking me whether an acute event might have caused him to develop unstable angina and eventually lead to a [myocardial infarction], that conceivably could occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-22\">\u201cQ. You can\u2019t rule that out?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-23\">\u201cA. Nor in.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-24\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t know one way or the other?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-25\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b858-5\"> Horowitz also testified on direct examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">\u201cQ. So, if he had a pristine cardiovascular system, the degree of stress that he was subjected to would probably have minimal or no effect whereas in a man as compromised as Mr. Hummel it is a different story?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">\u201cQ. It takes less to push him over the edge?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">\u201cQ. You do have, if in fact you accept the hypothesis that either acute or chronic stress was a precipitant of the cascade of events, the catecholamine release, the vasoconstriction and other phenomena that lead to the cardiac event that was done in combination with a severe underlying coronary artery disease, combination of both factors?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\">\u201cQ. And you can state that based on a reasonable medical probability?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b858-14\"> Specifically, Horowitz testified on direct examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\">\u201cQ.

Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-17\">\u201cQ. You did say you would agree that if Mr. Hummel did have an acute stress with his underlying heart disease that might have prompted an acute decompensation?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-18\">\u201cA.

You still believe that?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-22\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-23\">\u201cQ. What do you mean by an acute decompensation?</p>\n<p id=\"b858-24\">\u201cA.

Doctor, is there anything about being a truck driver that is unique or inherently dangerous that would cause heart attacks?</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">\u201cQ. What is that?</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">\u201cA. There have been some studies done in the Scandinavian nations showing that truck drivers and bus drivers have a significantly increased incidence of cardiac risk, of having fatal heart attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">\u201cQ. Is there an explanation as to why that takes place?</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">\u201cA. There are numerous explanations. Some because of stress, some because of loneliness, some because of the types of lives they lead on the road without enough sleep, with poor food, without enough exercise and activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-13\">\u201cQ. Doctor, in your opinion, did this man die because he was atruck driver?</p>\n<p id=\"b859-14\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t think he died because he was a truck driver. But I think that being a truck driver may have added to his risks for finally having him die of heart disease.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\"> Horowitz testified, however, that Henry Hummel may have had other risk factors that were unknown because of his lack of medical care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b860-7\"> Horowitz stated that it may be that there are more \u201ctype A\u201d personalities among truck drivers, causing them to work harder and suffer more \u201cpsychic pressure\u201d because of their working situation. He conceded, however, that the cardiologic literature now discounts being a \u201ctype A\u201d personality as a risk factor for heart disease, and that, in any event, personality type is believed to be controlled by an underlying genetic disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b860-8\"> The research abstracts were from Horowitz\u2019 research into the incidence of coronary disease in commercial drivers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b861-5\"> The following exchange occurred between the plaintiffs counsel and Flint:</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">\u201cQ. Although Mr. Hummel might have died from a cardiac event at some other time and place under some other circumstances, isn\u2019t it probable and likely that the stress of his occupation and the effects on his vascular system accelerated the time of his death?</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">\u201cA. Well, I think that from my reading of the deposition of the whole case, he experienced a great deal of stress and a lot of it had to do with meeting his financial obligations, and in order to do that he had to work long hours and working long hours was certainly stressful. So, it was kind of the totality of the existence [that] was stressful to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">\u201cQ. Which could have accelerated the timing of his\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">\u201cA. Which would contribute to the progression of his disease and ultimately his demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">\u201cQ. And that was a substantial contributing factor?</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">\u201cA. Well, it\u2019s very difficult to quantify that. It was a contributing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">\u201cQ. Of some significance?</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">\u201cA. Well, it\u2019s of some significance, but it\u2019s impossible\u2014you can\u2019t really quantify it. I would not regard it as of the same level of significance as his smoking and general lifestyle and the physiology with which he was born, probably.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">\u201cQ. Which you could have more than one significant risk factor, can you not?</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\">\u201cA. You can.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b863-9\"> The following colloquy occurred between the plaintiffs counsel and Flint:</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">\u201cQ. There may have been other risk factors, whether its hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia or smoking, which are also coronary risk factors which played a part, but in the context that I asked you\u2014as a truck driver, creating chronic stress is also a significant factor in the plaque deposition creating atherosclerosis?</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">\u201cA. Well, I think that just the general stress under which he existed was a contributing factor, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the dominant factor at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">\u201cQ. But it was also an important factor to be considered with other factors?</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">\u201cA. Yes.

Although the defendants refer in their brief to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (c), it is clear that they rely on \u00a7 31-301c (b), which provides: \u201cWhenever an employer or his insurer appeals a commissioner\u2019s award, and upon completion of the appeal process the employer or insurer loses such appeal, the Compensation Review Board or the Appellate Court, as the case may be, shall add interest on the amount of such award affirmed on appeal and not paid to the claimant during the pendency of such appeal, from the date of the original award to the date of the final appeal decision, at the rate prescribed in section 37-3a.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">The defendants\u2019 claim, however, disregards the legislature\u2019s direction that the penalty provided for by General Statutes \u00a7 31-303 applies \u201cin addition to any other interest or penalty imposed pursuant to the provisions of [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq.].\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-303; see also <em>Harpaz </em>v. <em>Laidlaw Transit, Inc., </em>286 Conn. 102, 121 n.13, 942 A.2d 396 (2008) (\u00a7 31-303 imposed 20 percentpenaltyin addition to existing remedy under General Statutes \u00a7 31-300).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b869-7\"> The defendants argue that the legislative history of the workers\u2019 compensation statutes confirms their proposed interpretation. Because we conclude that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-301 (f) and 31-303 are unambiguous, we need not look further than the statutes\u2019 plain meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b871-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-301 (g) provides a method for recovery of compensation paid, with interest, on a claim pursuant to \u00a7 31-301 (f) in the event that the final adjudication results in the denial of compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b872-7\"> The defendants also argue that Connecticut\u2019s public policy forbids a double recovery when workers\u2019 compensation benefits are involved. The defendants refer to <em>Ancona </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>217 Conn. 50, 584 A.2d 454 (1991), <em>Enquist </em>v. <em>General Datacom, </em>218 Conn. 19, 587 A.2d 1029 (1991), and <em>Middletown </em>v. <em>Local 1073, </em>1 Conn.

A review of those cases shows only that we have (1) not permitted the simultaneous recovery of widow\u2019s benefits and of workers\u2019 compensation benefits by the widow, (2) permitted the setoff of workers\u2019 compensation benefits against the workers\u2019 recovery from third party tortfeasors and (3) not permitted recovery under both workers\u2019 compensation benefits and town survivorship benefits when a town ordinance requires a setoff. We cannot conclude that there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>public policy that permits an employer to set off compensation benefits against any recovery of an injured worker or dependent from any source.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
