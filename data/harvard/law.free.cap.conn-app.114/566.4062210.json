On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly failed to give an instruction to the jury on intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-55a and 53a-55 (a) (1), as a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">The defendant was charged with murder in connection with the shooting death of Edward Gordon on May 11, 2002. In his statement to the police following the incident, the defendant admitted to being the shooter but denied that he had intended to kill the victim. The principal issue at the defendant\u2019s trial was whether he had intended to cause the death of the victim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In early May, 2002, the defendant witnessed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>argument between his friend, David Wash, and the victim, a man he had never met before, on Stillwater Avenue in Stamford. Approximately one week later, on May 11, 2002, the defendant and Wash went to a Stamford nightclub called Sonny\u2019s Cafe. They arrived at the club between 12:15 and 12:30 a.m. Shortly thereafter, the defendant noticed that the victim was also at the club. The victim \u201cwas staring at [Wash and the defendant] in a provoking manner.\u201d This made the defendant \u201cnervous and scared . . . that [the victim] was going to do or say something to [him].\u201d The defendant left the club and waited outside until closing time.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">After the club closed at approximately 1:45 a.m., fifty to sixty people continued to mingle outside. At approximately 2 a.m., the defendant saw the victim leaning on a vehicle parked in front of the club. The victim stared at the defendant and Wash and then approached a group of men as he pointed at the defendant. The victim said to the group: \u201cI\u2019m [going to] set it on these guys. Watch my back.\u201d The victim walked away, heading up the street and away from the club. The defendant followed the victim, pulled out his loaded gun and fired two gunshots in the victim\u2019s direction. The victim began to run, with the defendant chasing him and firing three more gunshots from about three to four feet away. Those three bullets hit the victim, causing him to collapse to the ground in the middle of the road. The defendant stood over the victim and fired two more gunshots at point blank range into the victim\u2019s body. The defendant fired a total of seven gunshots at the victim. The medical examiner found evidence of five gunshot wounds on the victim\u2019s body, all of which were located in the back portion of the trunk area.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In the course of an in camera discussion after the close of evidence, defense counsel represented to the court that he was not pursuing jury instructions on any of the lesser included offenses contained in his October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>19,2003 draft request to charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A conversation ensued regarding two lesser included offenses that were <em>not </em>included in that document, namely, intentional manslaughter in the first degree <em>with a firearm </em>in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-55a and 53a-55 (a) (l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and reckless manslaughter in the first degree <em>with a firearm </em>in violation of \u00a7 \u00a7 53a-55a and 53a-55 (a) (3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The parties specifically agreed that, given the nature of the murder and the evidence produced at trial, the jury should be instructed on the latter crime. Defense counsel represented that he did not intend to request an instruction on the former crime, as he believed there would be no practical advantage in arguing to the jury that the defendant possessed inconsistent mental states.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Immediately following this in camera discussion, the court held a charging conference on the record. Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>counsel stated: \u201cI will withdraw all requests included in that preliminary charge related to a lesser included offense with the exception of two and that is, reckless manslaughter with a firearm,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which I must advise the court that I respectfully request to be given in your charge.\u201d Defense counsel then stated: \u201cI still have mixed feelings about the intentional manslaughter<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and quite honestly my feelings are that it [is] . . . certainly not as applicable as the reckless charge and so I\u2019m focusing on a specific request for the reckless charge as we speak. . . . [A]ny other charges unrelated to a lesser included offense that were made in my preliminary draft I will leave to the discretion of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The prosecutor responded: \u201c[W]e\u2019ve spoken about this in chambers. . . . [T]he state\u2019s not objecting to the reckless manslaughter with a firearm charge coming in as a lesser included offense. ... I didn\u2019t quite understand counsel as to whether he was withdrawing his request as to the intentional manslaughter with a firearm. If he is still pressing it, I would argue that the evidence doesn\u2019t support the giving of that charge. [The defendant] testified [that] he couldn\u2019t control his conduct at the time, he was too intoxicated. And my understanding based on the totality of this testimony was that . . . essentially, he didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He also indicated in his statement that he was scared when he fired the shots. So, I don\u2019t see any evidence of intent to merely cause serious physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The court stated to defense counsel: \u201cI think that\u2019s consistent with what you just said . . . .\u201d Defense counsel replied: \u201cI think it is, too. . . . [C]learly, [the] reckless manslaughter charge applies here . . . along with intoxication. I leave it to the court\u2019s discretion with respect to the intentional manslaughter. I am not pressing that. . . . I\u2019m not really prepared to say I\u2019m going to remove that from my body of requests, but if . . . someone put a gun to my belly and asked me to make the right decision, the odds are that I don\u2019t think I could argue to this jury intentional manslaughter, but I know I can argue [recklessness]. And I hate being wishy-washy, I really do, and I apologize, Your Honor, if that\u2019s the way it comes through, but I think some can [see] my dilemma here and for that purpose I think what I\u2019ve said is about as much as I can say.\u201d The court stated: \u201cAll right. At this point in time, from what I have heard, it is clearly my intent . . . from the evidence that has been produced here and the testimony, specifically, of the defendant, I think a fair and reasonable request would be to include a charge on intoxication and reckless manslaughter by means of a firearm. . . . Anything else you want to talk about right now?\u201d Both counsel replied: \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">In its final instructions, the court instructed the jury on the charges of minder and reckless manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as a lesser offense included within the crime of murder. In light of the defendant\u2019s testimony that he was intoxicated at the time of the shooting because he had ingested both marijuana and a substantial amount of alcohol during the course of the evening and, therefore, could not control his actions, the court also instructed the jury on intoxication as a defense. At the conclusion of the court\u2019s charge, both counsel indicated that they were not taking any exceptions to the instructions. The jury returned a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>guilty verdict on the murder charge, and the defendant was sentenced to a term of fifty years incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. The state argues in response that the defendant is not entitled to review of this claim because he waived it when he withdrew his request for that instruction. The state further argues that the defendant is not entitled to review of his claim because it is unpreserved, and the defendant did not seek review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Finally, the state argues that even if the defendant\u2019s claim is reviewable, it fails to satisfy the <em>Whistnan</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We are not persuaded that the defendant waived his claim. \u201cWaiver consists of the intentional abandonment or voluntary relinquishment of a known right. . . . [It] involves the idea of assent, and assent is an act of understanding. . . . [W]aiver does not have to be express, but may consist of acts or conduct from which waiver may be implied. ... In other words, waiver may be inferred from the circumstances if it is reasonable to do so.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross V., </em>110 Conn. App. 1, 4-5, 953 A.2d 945, cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>denied, 289 Conn. 939, 958 A.2d 1247 (2008). The circumstances of this case, in particular, the argument and colloquy that took place at the charging conference, do not persuade us that the defendant waived his request that the court instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. During that colloquy, defense counsel explicitly stated that he would leave it to the court\u2019s discretion as to whether to charge the jury on that particular lesser included offense. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fabricatore, </em>281 Conn. 469, 481, 915 A.2d 872 (2007) (concluding there was waiver when defense counsel expressly stated he was satisfied with challenged juiy instruction). The defendant\u2019s failure to object once the court had declined to instruct the jury may bear on the issue of preservation, but it does not constitute waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">This leads us to the state\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s claim, if not deemed waived, was unpreserved. Under our mies of practice, to preserve a claim of instmctional error, a defendant must either cover the matter by a written request to charge or take exception immediately after the charge is delivered. Practice Book \u00a7 16-20. In this case, it is clear that the defendant did not take exception to the court\u2019s charge after it was delivered. What is not clear is whether the defendant filed a written request to charge. The defendant asserts that the October 19, 2003 document<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was his formal written request to charge. Yet, the court, in its memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion for rectification,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> stated: \u201cAt the commencement of jury selection, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the court solicited the state and the defense to provide it with rough drafts of possible jury instructions which they might request of the court at the close of evidence. In response, the defendant\u2019s attorney . . . submitted the [October 19, 2003] twenty-four page request to charge. The document constituted, in large measure, a compilation of jury instructions which [the defendant\u2019s attorney] had apparently used in other, earlier cases. That the document was not meant to constitute a formal request to charge pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 42-16 et seq. is demonstrated by the fact that it was filed prior to the presentation of evidence, and refers, at times, to other defendants and victims not connected to [this] case. In submitting this draft to the court, defense counsel never represented that he intended to file it with the clerk as a pleading, nor did he in fact do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">On the basis of our review of the October 19, 2003 draft request to charge, we agree with the court\u2019s characterization of that document. Because that document was not filed with the court in compliance with Practice Book \u00a7 42-17,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> it cannot be considered a written request to charge in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 16-20. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>a consequence, the defendant did not properly preserve his claim under our rules of practice. Despite the failure to preserve, however, because the instruction at issue concerns a lesser included offense, a question is raised as to whether the <em>Whistnant </em>test<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> supplants our general preservation requirements, in that the first prong of that test asks this court to determine whether the defendant requested \u201can appropriate instruction.\u201d <em>Whistnant, </em>in a sense, supplies its own preservation requirement. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The answer to this question is significant in the present case because, as we will discuss, relatively recent case law has expanded the concept of a \u201crequest for an \u2018appropriate instruction\u2019 \u201d under <em>Whistnant </em>to allow an appellate court to consider oral requests and colloquies with the court; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>262 Conn. 453, 467-68, 815 A.2d 1216 (2003); whereas previously, if the request was not in writing, it was considered inadequate. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rudd, </em>62 Conn. App. 702, 706-708, 773 A.2d 370 (2001). Moreover, that same case law also provides that as long as the trial court\u2019s attention was drawn to the factual and legal bases for the request, the defendant is regarded as having requested an \u201cappropriate instruction.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 467-68. Accordingly, under existing case law, an unpreserved claim that the court improperly refused to charge on a lesser included offense does not preclude the satisfaction of the first prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test. As a result, we must determine whether <em>Whistnant </em>supersedes our general preservation requirements in these particular circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Our existing case law provides no clear answer to this question. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Henning, </em>220 Conn. 417, 427, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991), the defendant did not request an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>instruction on the lesser included offense and took no exception to the charge as given by the court. Our Supreme Court first applied the general preservation rule, stating: \u201cSince the defendant neither requested an instruction on [the lesser included offense] nor took an exception to the trial court\u2019s charge, this court is not bound to review the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id. The court, however, went on to analyze the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Whistnant </em>and assumed, \u201cfor the purposes of [its] analysis,\u201d that the first prong was satisfied, even though its previous determination that the defendant did not request the instruction on the lesser included offense indicated that the first prong was not satisfied. Id., 428. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>71 Conn. App. 865, 878, 804 A.2d 937, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 942, 808 A.2d 1136 (2002), this court, referring to <em>Henning, </em>stated: \u201cDespite [Whistnant\u2019s] mandating that one party must request a charge to be entitled to have the charge given to the jury, our Supreme Corut has reviewed an unpreserved <em>Whistnant </em>claim.\u201d This statement indicates that we interpreted <em>Henning </em>to mean that the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>does, in fact, supplant our general preservation analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">We therefore proceed to determine whether the defendant in the present case made a request for an \u201cappropriate instruction\u201d in accordance with the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>\u201cIn considering whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, [179 Conn. 588] we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense. . . . [T]he jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in those cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested. . . . Otherwise the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence. . . . Under <em>Whistnant, </em>the evidence is sufficiently in dispute where it is of such factual quality that would permit the [jury] reasonably to find the defendant guilty on the lesser included offense. This requirement serves to prevent a jury from capriciously convicting on the lesser included offense when the evidence requires either conviction on the greater offense or acquittal. . . . Nonetheless, jurors are supposed to reach their conclusions on the basis of common sense, common understanding and fair beliefs, grounded on the evidence . . . from which inferences can fairly be drawn. . . . They should not [however] be encouraged to engage in speculation. ... On appeal, an appellate court must reverse a trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction if we cannot as a matter of law exclude [the] possibility that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>228 Conn. 147, 154-55, 635 A.2d 777 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u201cA proposed instruction on a lesser included offense constitutes an appropriate instruction for purposes of the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>if it complies with Practice Book \u00a7 854 [now \u00a7 42-18].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 261, 681 A.2d 922 (1996). Practice Book \u00a7 42-18 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cWhen there are several requests, they shall be in separate and numbered paragraphs, each containing a single proposition of law clearly and concisely stated with the citation of authority upon which it is based, and the evidence to which the proposition would apply. . . .\u201d \u201c[I]n the context of a written request to charge on a lesser included offense, [the] requirement of [Practice Book \u00a7 42-18] is met only if the proposed request contains such a complete statement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>essential facts as would have justified the court in charging in the form requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>260 Conn. 730, 746, 799 A.2d 1056 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 466, however, the defendant conceded that his written request to charge lacked a statement of the essential facts and, therefore, did not comply with all the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 42-18. Our Supreme Court determined that this noncompliance did not conclusively indicate that the defendant failed to satisfy the first prong of <em>Whistnant. State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 466. The court stated: \u201cAlthough strict compliance with the provisions of [Practice Book] \u00a7 42-18 is certainly the least perilous method of satisfying Whistnant's first prong, failure to do so is not, by itself, fatal to the defendant\u2019s claim. We have deemed the first prong of <em>Whistnant </em>satisfied when the record indicates that the trial court knew the precise point to which the defendant wished to call attention. . . . Indeed, even partial compliance \"with [Practice Book] \u00a7 42-18, accompanied by substantial additional support in the record from either party, such as detailed colloquies with the court and opposing counsel and a postcharge exception, will also satisfy the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>This is true as long as the trial court is informed adequately of the factual and legal bases for the instructional request. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">\u201cIn [this] case, despite the deficiency in the written request, the colloquy among the trial court, the state and the defendant indicates that the trial court was aware of and understood the facts underlying the defendant\u2019s request for the lesser included . . . instruction. The trial court, during the colloquy, acknowledged the significance of the defendant\u2019s statement in the context of the request. Moreover, after the jury was charged, the defendant took an exception, further alerting the trial court to his disagreement with the refusal to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>the lesser included offense instruction. Because the record . . . demonstrates that the trial court\u2019s attention amply was drawn to the factual and legal bases for the request to charge on the lesser included offense, we conclude that the defendant requested an appropriate instruction, thereby satisfying the first prong of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 466-68.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In the present case, the defendant argues that the October 19, 2003 document, which included a request for the court to instruct on intentional manslaughter in the first degree, coupled with his oral request for an instruction on intentional manslaughter in the first degree <em>with a firearm </em>made during the in camera discussion, amply drew the court\u2019s attention to the factual and legal bases for his request to charge and, therefore, constituted a request for an \u201cappropriate instruction\u201d under <em>Smith. </em>The circumstances of this case, however, are distinguishable from those of <em>Smith. </em>In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant filed a formal, written request to charge, and the issue was that it \u201clacked a statement of the essential facts and, therefore, did not comply completely with the provisions of Practice Book \u00a7 42-18.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 262 Conn. 466. Aside from the fact that the defendant\u2019s October 19,2003 document cannot be considered a written request to charge because the defendant failed to comply with Practice Book \u00a7 42-17, it is clear that the document makes no reference to the lesser included offense of intentional manslaughter in the first degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number><em>with a firearm, </em>nor does it set forth the evidentiary basis for such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In addition, the defendant failed to offer any factual or legal basis for his request to instruct on intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm during the in camera discussion or the colloquy with the court. On both occasions, he stated that he might want an instruction on that specific lesser included offense, but he did not make an argument as to the evidence that supported the giving of that instruction. Moreover, the defendant did not take exception to the court\u2019s charge as given and, therefore, failed to alert the court to his objection to the refusal to give the lesser included offense instruction. We cannot say, therefore, that the court was informed adequately of the factual and legal bases for the instruction at issue. We conclude that the defendant did not make a request for an \u201cappropriate instruction\u201d in accordance with the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>The defendant, therefore, was not entitled to a jury instruction on intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm as a lesser offense included within the crime of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The defendant further argues that \u201cin the unlikely event [that] this court finds [that] the first prong [of <em>Whistnant] </em>has not been satisfied, the claim should be reviewed for plain error.\u201d In support of this argument, the defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>19 Conn. App. 111, 144-45, 562 A.2d 43 (1989), rev\u2019d, 215 Conn. 538, 577 A.2d 694 (1990). <em>In Horne, </em>this court held: \u201cEven in the absence of ... a request . . . the trial court may, sua sponte, properly submit a lesser included offense to the jury. . . . Similarly, an appellate court may invoke the <em>[Whistnant] </em>doctrine where the trial court record justifies its application. . . . We may do so . . . and thus satisfy the first requirement.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>Our decision in <em>Home </em>essentially created an exception to the first prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>The defendant incorrectly characterizes it as plain error review. In any event, the trial court record does not justify the application of this exception in the present case. A person is guilty of the crime of intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm when, \u201c(1) <em>with the intent </em>to cause serious physical injury to another person, (2) [he] caused the death of such person or a third person (3) using, or threatening to use by displaying or representing by his words or conduct, that he possesses a firearm.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v.

During the trial, when asked why he shot the victim, the defendant responded that he \u201cwas very intoxicated so . . . [he] really had no control over [his] actions,\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what [he] was doing.\u201d This testimony is entirely inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal that when he shot the victim, he possessed the specific intent to cause serious physical injury to the victim.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the evidence does not support an instruction on intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-12\"> To establish a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), the crime of murder, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant not only caused the death of the victim but did so with the specific intent to cause death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\"> At the start of jury selection, the court instructed the parties \u201cto provide it with rough drafts of possible jury instructions . . . which they might request of the court at the close of evidence.\u201d In response, defense counsel submitted to the court a document dated October 19, 2003.

On December 11, 2007, the trial court denied the motion for rectification because it found, among other things, that the October 19, 2003 request to charge was a preliminary draft of possible jury instructions that was not intended to constitute a formal request to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Moreover, the court determined that the unfiled draft request did not include an instruction on intentional manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm.

On January 23, 2008, the Supreme Court granted the motion to review but denied the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The defendant\u2019s brief and accompanying appendix contained, respectively, quotations from the October 19,2003 request to charge and a complete copy of that document.
