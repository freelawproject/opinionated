In this case, a purchaser of goods and intangibles challenges the validity of a jury verdict holding it hable for damages for unjust enrichment despite a concurrent jury finding of breach of contract by the vendors. The purchaser also challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the court\u2019s acceptance of the jury verdict, but reverse its ruling with respect to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>In a four count complaint filed on October 19, 2006, the plaintiffs, Total Recycling Services of Connecticut, Inc. (Total Recycling), and Whitewing Environmental Corporation (Whitewing), brought an action to enforce their alleged rights under three contracts relating to the sale of an oil recycling business to the defendant, Connecticut Oil Recycling Services, LLC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs sought damages either for breach of contract by the defendant or for unjust enrichment of the defendant, claiming nonpayment of amounts due. The defendant denied any liability to the plaintiffs and filed a five part counterclaim for damages resulting from the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged failure to honor their contractual and statutory obligations to the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant also sought attorney\u2019s fees in accordance with the provisions of two of the contracts between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In special interrogatories submitted to the jury, the court asked the jury to make specific findings about the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover damages either for breach of contract or for unjust enrichment. The court also asked the jury to make findings on the defendant\u2019s right to recover damages as alleged in the various counts of its counterclaim. None of the parties objected to the submission of these interrogatories to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">In the responses to the interrogatories that are relevant to this appeal, the jury found:</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>(1) Although neither Total Recycling nor the defendant fully performed its obligations under the two contracts between the parties, Total Recycling\u2019s partial performance resulted in the unjust enrichment of the defendant and entitled Total Recycling to recover damages of $63,130.70 and interest of $6313.07;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">(2) Although Whitewing did not fully perform its obligations under its contract with the defendant, White-wing\u2019s partial performance resulted in the unjust enrichment of the defendant and entitled Whitewing to recover damages of $63,130.70 and interest of $6313.07;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">(3) Although the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of the express terms of one of their agreements with the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>did not entitle the defendant to recover damages, their breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the contracts between Total Recycling and the defendant entitled the defendant to recover damages of $39,015 and interest of $3901.50.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The trial court accepted the verdict of the juiy and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the award of damages to the plaintiffs. The court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees. The defendant\u2019s appeal challenges both of these rulings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">THE JURY VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision denying the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict describes the relevant facts that the jury reasonably might have found in support of its answers to the interrogatories. These facts are largely undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">The plaintiffs entered into three agreements for the sale of a waste oil recycling business to the defendant. In two asset purchase agreements, Total Recycling conveyed equipment to the defendant for an immediate payment of $100,000<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and transferred its customer list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>to the defendant in return for four years of future payments tied to the defendant\u2019s waste oil business.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the same time, in a separate agreement with the defendant, for similar future payments, Whitewing promised to refrain from soliciting the defendant\u2019s customers and from competing with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Both of the plaintiffs substantially performed their obligations under their contracts with the defendant. Total Recycling\u2019s sale of equipment to the defendant was, however, defective in part because three of the eleven vehicles transferred to the defendant were subject to liens held by the department of environmental protection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> During the time that these vehicles were unusable, the defendant incurred the cost of $39,015 for the rental of other equipment. Furthermore, although Total Recycling allegedly attempted to sell its customer list to a third party, the defendant introduced no evidence to show that the attempted sale caused it a loss of business or profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The defendant never made any of the payments related to the volume of its sales that were required by its agreements with the plaintiffs. There was evidence that the payments due from the defendant amounted to approximately $195,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In light of this factual record, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the jury verdict. It concluded that the evidence of the plaintiffs\u2019 substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>performance of their contractual obligations supported the jury\u2019s findings that the defendant had been unjustly enriched by the benefits conferred upon it by the assets, customer list and noncompete agreement it had received.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">In an appeal from a trial court\u2019s refusal of a motion to set aside a jury verdict, we \u201cconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, according particular weight to the congruence of the judgment of the trial judge and the jury, who saw the witnesses and heard their testimony. . . . The decision to set aside a verdict is a matter within the broad legal discretion of the trial court and it will not be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sutcliffe </em>v. <em>Fleet-Boston Financial Corp., </em>108 Conn. App. 799, 811, 950 A.2d 544 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">In this appeal, the defendant does not challenge the accuracy of the trial court\u2019s recital of the facts that the jury reasonably might have found in support of its answers to the interrogatories. It maintains instead that the court improperly failed, as a matter of law, to grant its motion to set aside the jury verdict. In its view, because both plaintiffs had the right to pursue legal remedies for breach of contract, and because the jury found that both plaintiffs had breached the contract, they were barred from recovering under <em>any </em>claim for unjust enrichment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>We note at the outset that it is late in the day for the defendant to argue that there is a fundamental legal inconsistency between the jury\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had breached the contract and its award of damages for unjust enrichment. At trial, the defendant did not object to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury expressly authorizing a verdict for the plaintiffs either on their claims of breach of contract or on their claims of unjust enrichment. Similarly, at trial, the defendant did not object to the submission of jury interrogatories that expressly authorized the jury to consider both sets of claims by both plaintiffs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Even if the defendant\u2019s argument were properly before us, however, it is unpersuasive on its merits. The defendant argues that the present case is governed by <em>Meaney </em>v. <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn., Inc., </em>250 Conn. 500, 735 A.2d 813 (1999), in which our Supreme Court held that the terms of an express contract may preclude recognition of a claim of an implied contract. Id., 517. <em>Meaney </em>acknowledged the general principle that a \u201cright of recovery under the doctrine of unjust enrichment is essentially equitable, its basis being that in a given situation it is contrary to equity and good conscience for one to retain a benefit which has come to him at the expense of another.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 511. The court nonetheless concluded that a former employee did not have a cognizable claim of unjust enrichment to recover incentive pay for his past services because of uncontested evidence that he had been unsuccessful in persuading his employer to include such compensation in his employment contract. Id., 522. As Professor E. Allan Farnsworth has observed, \u201ca party that has made a contract with another cannot simply disregard the contract and claim restitution from the other party for performance rendered under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>contract.\u201d 1 E. Farnsworth, Contracts (3d Ed. 2004) \u00a7 2.20, pp. 191-92. The facts of this case, however, bear no resemblance to those at issue in <em>Meaney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Vertex, Inc. </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 278 Conn. 557, is equally misplaced. One of the issues in <em>Vertex, Inc., </em>was whether the trial court had abused its discretion in dismissing two counts of the plaintiffs complaint in the absence of a motion to strike or a motion for summary judgment. Id., 566-70. In that context, the court, in a footnote, cited <em>Meaney </em>for the proposition that \u201cproof of an operative contract would have been incompatible with recovery on an unjust enrichment theory.\u201d Id., 570 n.12. We do not read this footnote to expand the holding of <em>Meaney </em>beyond its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdict of the jury in favor of the plaintiffs. Like the trial court, we are persuaded that the jury\u2019s verdict was neither inconsistent with the evidence at trial nor contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">In the defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees, it relied on the terms of the agreement to transfer Total Recycling\u2019s customer list and Whitewing\u2019s agreement not to compete. Each of these agreements entitled the defendant to recover \u201ccosts or damages, including reasonable attorney fees resulting from any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that these provisions were inapplicable because the jury had awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>damages to the defendant only with respect to Total Recycling\u2019s breach of the agreement to convey equipment, which did <em>not </em>contain such a clause. The defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s characterization of the damages award that the jury made. It contends, however, that the court improperly failed to consider the significance of the jury\u2019s uncontested findings that the plaintiffs had breached their obligations in the two contracts that <em>did </em>contain such a clause. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">\u201cIt is well established that we review the trial court\u2019s decision to award attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. . . . This standard applies to the amount of fees awarded . . . and also to the trial court\u2019s determination of the factual predicate justifying the award. . . . Under the abuse of discretion standard of review, [w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . [Thus, our] review of such rulings is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker v. Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 252-53, 828 A.2d 64 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The defendant maintains that the facts of record, as documented in the jury\u2019s responses to the jury interrogatories, establish that it was not reasonable for the trial court to have rejected, out of hand, its claim to an attorney\u2019s fee award. The plaintiffs have not challenged the jury\u2019s findings that Total Recycling breached the agreement to transfer its customer list and that White-wing breached the agreement not to compete. The attorney\u2019s fee clauses in these contracts did not require the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>defendant to prove more than breach. As our Supreme Court held in <em>Storm Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Baumgold, </em>186 Conn. 237, 245, 440 A.2d 306 (1982), in the absence of an applicable statute, a litigant \u201cderives its right to recover an attorney\u2019s fee . . . from its contract and not from a claim for damages.\u201d We hold, therefore, that the trial court improperly held that the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to the equipment purchase agreement precluded the defendant\u2019s recovery of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees under the other two contracts between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">It follows that we must remand this case for further proceedings in the trial court with respect to the defendant\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees. The parties have not had the opportunity, to date, to address the proper construction of the clause, in both contracts, that permits the defendant, on a showing of the plaintiffs\u2019 breach, to recover \u201ccosts or damages, including reasonable attorney fees . . . .\u2019\u2019It is, for example, not clear whether the phrase \u201cincluding attorney fees\u201d modifies both \u201ccosts\u201d and \u201cdamages.\u201d \u201c[W]here the text of an agreement reasonably allows for varying interpretations\u2014whether by the inadvertence or design of the draftsman\u2014the need for judicial construction cannot, and may not, be avoided.\u201d <em>Wards Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates, </em>761 F.2d 117, 120 (2d Cir. 1985). The parties similarly have not had the opportunity to present evidence on the reasonableness of the fees accrued by the defendant during the course of this litigation. A remand will provide an opportunity for the resolution of these issues and other related questions that the parties may want to present.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b695-8\"> Total Recycling is a wholly owned subsidiaiy of Whitewing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-9\"> Count one of the counterclaim alleged that certain assets sold by Total Recycling had been subject to liens, that certain customer lists improperly had been sold to a competitor of the defendant and that the plaintiffs had misappropriated certain checks.

Count three alleged that the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct as described in the first count constituted an unfair trade practice in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. Count four alleged that the defendant was the assignee of a contract right for payment from Total Recycling. Count five alleged that the defendant was the assignee of another contract right for payment from Total Recycling. In response to counts four and five, Total Recycling denied its liability on those alleged contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b696-8\"> In the jury\u2019s response to interrogatories relating to the first count of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleging breach of contract, the jury found that Total Recycling did not \u201cperform its obligation\u201d under the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement (Equipment)\u201d or under the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement (Good Will).\u201d The jury also found that the defendant did not perform its obligation under these two contracts.
