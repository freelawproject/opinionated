The defendants, Christopher Deojay and Tina Deojay, appeal from the judgment of the trial court enjoining them from performing any further work on their property and imposing a fine, costs and fees. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The following facts and procedural history are necessary for our resolution of the defendants\u2019 appeal. The defendants purchased property located at 234 North Society Road in Canterbury in October, 2004. Donald Aubrey, the town engineer, testified that the property at that time \u201cwas like a jungle, would be the best word in the common language. It was almost impenetrable. You could not see the house to the rear from the road.\u201d He also testified that in addition to \u201cthe residence in the rear, there was an abandoned house in the front, left-hand comer of the property, some outbuildings primarily, to the right of the driveway there was a tremendous amount of farm debris, implements, a trailer, heavily littered with very heavy secondary growing up through all of that.\u201d Christopher Deojay testified that at the time he bought the property, there was a trailer, a house and a residential garage on the property, all of which have since been removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">On November 5, 2004, Christopher Deojay filed an application for a certificate of zoning compliance with the plaintiff town of Canterbury (town), in which he noted that there were wetlands or watercourses on the property and described the activity to take place on the property as residential in nature. He did not indicate on the application any intention to use the property for agricultural purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He testified that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>mention his intention to conduct farming on the property \u201cbecause I felt it was exempt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Steven Sadlowski, one of the plaintiffs in this matter, was the town planner and zoning and wetlands enforcement officer at the time this action was commenced.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As part of his duties as the zoning and wetlands enforcement officer, he observed a wetlands area on property owned by the defendants and noticed that a drainage ditch had been dug in the area. Sadlowski notified the defendants in writing on July 20, 2005, that they were in violation of the town\u2019s inland wetlands and watercourses regulations (regulations) because such work is considered to be a regulated activity and therefore could not be performed unless permitted by the plaintiff inland wetlands and watercourses commission (commission). In the letter, Sadlowski also asked the defendants to stop any farther excavation on the site and invited them to attend the next meeting of the commission to discuss the violation, future plans and remediation of the site.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Sadlowski testified that the defendants did not attend the meeting, possibly due to short notice. On August 2, 2005, the defendants filed an application for a permit to undertake proposed activities on the wetlands, which included \u201cclear out debris, clean out and clear lot, correct drainage problem from previous owner\u2019s activity and traverse drainage created by town culvert being [too] high at right comer of lot. Relocate driveway, request to regrade up to road . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">At the August 24, 2005 commission meeting, at which Christopher Deojay was present, he discussed his work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>on the property, and the commission suggested that the wetlands area be flagged. The wetlands had not been flagged by the time of the September 28, 2005 commission meeting, and a commission member asked at that meeting that no further excavation be done on the site until the commission approved it.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Sadlowski testified that further activity had occurred on the property after he sent the July 20, 2005 letter; he observed that more trees had been cut down in and around the wetlands. Christopher Deojay admitted that he cut down trees in the wetlands area in 2005; he estimated that there were about thirteen trees in the wetlands area and that he left six of them standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The defendants\u2019 permit application was denied by the commission at its October 26, 2005 meeting. Sadlowski observed even more trees being cut down after that date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sadlowski then issued a cease and desist order (order) on January 26, 2006, which stated: \u201c[Y]ou were advised to get the wetlands flagged . . . and [t]o the best of my knowledge you have not had this done . . . yet and it has been over [three] months. Furthermore, it appears more clearing has taken place. Therefore, in order to stop any further damage to the wetlands, we are issuing the following order: You are ordered to Cease and Desist from any further activity on this lot until a new application is submitted to, and approved by, the [commission].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This letter was mailed to the defendants by certified mail on January 26, 2006, and it also informed the defendants that a show cause hearing would be held on February 2, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">At the February 2 meeting, Christopher Deojay stated that he could not flag the wetlands as requested because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>he could not get an accurate delineation of the water running off the road. The commission noted that it could not accept wetlands flagging from anyone other than a licensed soil scientist. Christopher Deojay stated that the allegation in the order that he was continuing to disrupt wetlands soils was not true, and he argued that the order should be lifted because his property was agriculturally exempt. A commission member made a motion to uphold the order with the condition that Christopher Deojay send a letter to the board of selectmen regarding the drainage on the property and that he come before the commission to discuss submitting an application. The motion was passed unanimously. Notice that the order was upheld at the show cause hearing was sent to Christopher Deojay by certified mail on February 9,2006. The court, in its memorandum of decision, found that no appeal was taken from this action confirming the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Christopher Deojay wrote a letter to the board of selectmen dated February 3,2006, per the commission\u2019s request.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the letter, he stated: \u201cMy objective is to remedy the property so my well will no longer be impacted by the road salt running onto the property from the street with the water. I do plan on rebuilding the rest of the structures on my lot and residing here in town.\u201d He also claimed that the town could be financially hable to remedy the problem caused by the runoff of water from the road onto his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Christopher Deojay wrote a letter to the commission dated February 15, 2006, in which he notified the commission of his letter to the board of selectmen, as requested by the commission, and requested a resolution to the water runoff from the town road onto his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>property. He also claimed that upholding the order violated his civil and constitutional rights of ownership and requested that the order be withdrawn immediately. He informed the commission that he could not receive a fair hearing from the commission and would therefore \u201cproceed with [his] original plan for the site as presented\u201d and requested that all commission members and Sadlowski keep away from his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">At the February 22, 2006 meeting, the commission noted that the defendants had yet to flag the property and suggested that a letter be sent to Christopher Deojay informing him that the wetlands needed to be flagged and a new permit application be submitted within thirty days. On February 27, 2006, Sadlowski wrote to Christopher Deojay, informing him that he needed to have the wetlands area on his property flagged within the next thirty days, after which he could resubmit his application to the commission. The letter acknowledged the problem of runoff water from the road spilling onto the defendants\u2019 land but stated that the commission could not allow wetlands to be modified without a permit. Christopher Deojay acknowledged receiving this letter. Sadlowski took photographs of the ditch area on the defendants\u2019 property on May 1 and June 1, 2006. The June 1 photographs show that more trees had been cut down since the May 1 photographs were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The plaintiffs filed a two count enforcement action on July 20, 2006, seeking enforcement of the order and an injunction prohibiting the defendants from conducting regulated activities in the wetlands or watercourse on their property, requiring them to remove all fill that was placed on the wetlands or watercourse and requiring them to restore the wetlands and watercourse that had been damaged by their unauthorized regulated activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Christopher Deojay filed a second application for a permit to conduct certain activities on his property on August 1, 2006.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The application requested permission to construct an agricultural pond, to plant blueberries, to place a shed and to construct a driveway within 100 feet of the wetlands, as well as permission for construction of a house, a well and a septic system. Sadlowski testified that prior to the receipt of this application, the defendants had not expressed any intention to use then-property as a farm. The subject of Christopher Deojay\u2019s second application was taken up by the commission at their August 23, 2006 meeting, at which Christopher Deojay asserted that he was currently operating a farm on the property and that the agricultural exemption of the regulations should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Aubrey testified that between February and September, 2006, all of the trees in the wetlands area had been removed. In addition, Christopher Deojay testified that during the cease and desist period, he dug a pond on his property, the proposed agricultural pond that he had referred to in his second application. He admitted that he made a conscious effort to proceed with his project despite the cease and desist order but claimed that he believed that the order was relative to the ditch only.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">On September 27, 2006, the commission voted to approve the defendants\u2019 second application and lift the order with the condition that the defendants post a bond in the amount of $8000 to ensure that the proposed farming activity would actually take place.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>found that the defendants did not post that bond at any point.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Trial was held before the court on the enforcement action on July 20 and August 29, 2007. The court issued its memorandum of decision on January 10, 2008, and found that \u201c[t]he defendants knowingly and wilfully conducted activities on their property in violation of the wetland regulations. These activities were conducted both before and after the . . . order approved by the commission on February 2, 2006.\u201d The court found in favor of the plaintiffs and enjoined the defendants from continuing any work on the property until they posted the security demanded by the commission or otherwise brought themselves into compliance with all regulations and the cease and desist order was withdrawn by the commission. The court further imposed a fine in the amount of $10,000 together with costs, expert witness fees and attorney\u2019s fees. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The defendants first claim that the court\u2019s decision to deny their request for leave to amend their answer was an abuse of discretion. As the court was within its discretion to refuse to allow an amendment to the pleadings requested more than two months after the completion of trial, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">The following additional facts are pertinent to the defendants\u2019 claim. After the plaintiffs filed the complaint against the defendants on July 20,2006, the defendants filed an answer on August 1, 2006, that stated only: \u201cNot guilty. Majority of property is 404 exempt. Wetland office requested site plan and wetland [delineation] at last meeting prior to court action [and] information was supplied as of [August 1, 2006] as requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>pending wetland review.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On November 13, 2007, approximately two and one-half months after the conclusion of the trial but before the court issued its memorandum of decision, the defendants filed a request for leave to amend, seeking permission to amend their answer to the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint to conform the pleadings to the evidence presented at trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Along with the request, the defendants submitted a proposed amended answer, which responded to each paragraph of the complaint in turn and set forth four special defenses.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The plaintiffs filed an objection to the request on November 28,2007. In the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, the court noted at the outset that the \u201c[r]equest for leave to amend is denied. The court will not consider an amended answer and counterclaims filed more than two months after the conclusion of the trial. This would raise new matters and require additional evidence. The court finds that proposed special defenses first through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>fourth raise issues already before the court. While these requests to amend are denied, the issues presented will be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The standard of review applicable to a court\u2019s decision to allow or deny leave to amend is abuse of discretion. \u201cThe motion to amend is addressed to the trial court\u2019s discretion which may be exercised to restrain the amendment of pleadings so far as necessary to prevent unreasonable delay of the trial. . . . Whether to allow an amendment is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. [A reviewing] court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s ruling on a proposed amendment unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretion. ... It is the . . . burden [of the party that requested the amendment] to demonstrate that the trial court clearly abused its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Clark Equipment Co., </em>259 Conn. 114, 128, 788 A.2d 83 (2002). \u201cThe factors to be considered include unreasonable delay, fairness to the opposing parties and negligence of the party offering the amendment.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>146 Conn. 443, 449-50, 151 A.2d 884 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">\u201cThe essential tests are whether the ruling of the court will work an injustice to either the plaintiff or the defendant and whether the granting of the motion will unduly delay a trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tornaquindici </em>v. <em>Keggi, </em>94 Conn. App. 828, 843, 894 A.2d 1019 (2006). \u201cThe trial court is in the best position to assess the burden which an amendment would impose on the opposing party in light of the facts of the particular case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Mastrolillo </em>v. <em>Danbury, </em>61 Conn. App. 693, 696, 767 A.2d 1232 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The defendants set forth no reason for the delay in filing the motion to amend; instead, their argument as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>to why the amendment should have been permitted fifteen months after their original answer was filed and more than two months after the trial\u2019s completion centers around the lack of prejudice to the plaintiffs had the amendment been allowed. The plaintiffs do not complain of any prejudice or unfair surprise that would result from permitting the amendment but merely point out that although the defendants\u2019 initial answer was filed pro se, they sought to amend their answer well after the completion of trial despite retaining counsel several months before trial. Most compellingly, the plaintiffs assert that \u201c [t]he claims raised in the proposed amendment do not arise from any factual issues raised at trial that were unknown to the defendants prior to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The cases cited by the defendants in support of their position, <em>State ex rel. Scala </em>v. <em>Airport Commission, </em>154 Conn. 168, 224 A.2d 236 (1966), and <em>Ideal Financing Assn. </em>v. <em>Labonte, </em>120 Conn. 190, 180 A. 300 (1935), although pertaining to posttrial amendments of an answer, both involve much shorter periods of delay than the delay in this case. Furthermore, the court, in its memorandum of decision, stated that although it would not allow the defendants to amend their answer, the amended answer was before the court and that it would consider the issues it presented. There was, therefore, no great injustice done to the defendants by refusing to allow them to amend their answer. We \u201cwill not interfere with the decision of a trial court not to permit an amendment unless an abuse of discretion is clearly evident.\u201d <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Jacovino, </em>161 Conn. 462, 471, 290 A.2d 225 (1971). We conclude that there was no such abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly determined that their agricultural use was not exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>from the regulations. They also claim, as a separate issue, that the court improperly granted an injunction against their continued agricultural use of their property because this use was permitted as of right. We consider both claims together.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Section 4.1 of the regulations provides in part: \u201cThe following operations and uses shall be permitted in inlands wetlands and watercourses, as of right: (a) grazing, farming, nurseries, gardening and harvesting of crops and farm pond of three acres or less essential to the farming operation . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Section 4.3 of the regulations provides in part: \u201cAll activities in wetlands or watercourses involving filling, excavation, dredging, clear cutting, grading and excavation or any other alteration or use of a wetland or watercourse not specifically permitted by this Section shall require a permit from the Agency . . . Finally, \u00a7 4.4 of the regulations provides: \u201cTo carry out the purpose of this section, any person proposing to carry out a permitted or non-regulated operation or use of a wetland or watercourse that may disturb the natural and indigenous character of the wetland or watercourse shall, prior to commencement of such operation or use, notify the Agency on a form provided by the Agency and provide the Agency with sufficient information to enable the Agency to properly determine that the proposed operation and use is a permitted or non-regulated use of the wetland or watercourse. The Agency or its designated agent shall rule that the proposed operation or use is a permitted or non-regulated use or operation or that a permit is required. Such ruling shall be in writing and shall be made no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Agency following the meeting at which the request was received. The designated agent for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Agency may make such ruling on behalf of the agency at any time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The defendants take the position that because an agricultural use is considered to be an as of right use under the regulation, they did not need permission from the commission for their tree cutting, excavation, pond draining and filling and blueberry planting. Specific procedures are set out in the regulations, however, to obtain a determination by the commission that a use is permitted or nonregulated, and one seeking such a determination must first, before undertaking any activity on the property in question, notify the commission of his or her intentions and obtain a written determination by the commission of the categorization of that use.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Whether the defendants\u2019 planting of blueberry bushes on their property is considered \u201cfarming\u201d for the purposes of General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 and \u00a7 4.1 of the regulations is not for us to determine. Such determination must be made by the commission in the first instance. The trial court cannot, nor by extension can we, make a finding that the defendants\u2019 actions could be considered farming without the commission first having considered the issue. In a case with similar factual circumstances, in which the plaintiffs alleged that the department of environmental protection could not order them to apply for a permit because their proposed agricultural use was exempt from regulation, the trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs\u2019 claim because they had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as a result of their never having received a determination by the department regarding whether their proposed use was agricultural and therefore exempt. <em>Cannatta </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 623, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990). Affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, our Supreme Court held that the exhaustion requirement mandates that the agency in question be the first to determine its jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>and stated: \u201cWhen a particular statute authorizes an administrative agency to act in a particular situation it necessarily confers upon such agency authority to determine whether the situation is such as to authorize the agency to act\u2014that is, to determine the coverage of the statute\u2014and this question need not, and in fact cannot, be initially decided by a court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Similarly, in <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Commission, </em>24 Conn. App. 163, 586 A.2d 631 (1991), the plaintiffs initially appealed from a ruling by the Killingworth inlands wetlands and watercourses commission requiring them to apply for a permit, and the trial court rendered judgment finding that the proposed activities constituted farming. Id., 165-66. The commission thereafter appealed to this court. Id., 166. The commission had concluded that the plaintiffs failed to prove that their proposed activities constituted farming because they did not submit all of the required information to the commission for it to make a determination of whether the activity in question was exempt but later reserved its decision on the issue because the plaintiffs had not presented the commission with a sealed site plan as requested. Id., 164-66. This court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the commission had not been given the first opportunity to determine its jurisdiction and upheld the order requiring the plaintiffs to apply for a permit to give the commission the opportunity first to determine whether the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed use was exempt from regulation, and, if not, whether to issue a permit. Id., 167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The defendants appear to have been under the mistaken assumption that because \u00a7 4.1 of the regulations and \u00a7 22a-40 provide that farming is a permitted activity in a wetlands area as of right, they needed no specific determination that their activities constituted farming. This determination, however, is a necessary step, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the court correctly concluded that \u201cthe defendant[s\u2019] use of the property, whether or not it was agricultural, was not permitted because the defendant[s] did not comply with \u00a7 4.4 of the regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The court did not abuse its discretion in enjoining the defendants\u2019 continued activity on the property. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-12, \u201c[i]f . . . any building, structure or land has been used, in violation of any provision of this chapter or of any bylaw, ordinance, rule or regulation made under authority conferred hereby, any official having jurisdiction, in addition to other remedies, may institute an action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use or to restrain, correct or abate such violation or to prevent the occupancy of such building, structure or land or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Although in general, \u201c[a] party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Renz, </em>46 Conn. App. 5, 15, 698 A.2d 328 (1997); it is unnecessary for a zoning enforcement officer to allege and prove irreparable harm and lack of an adequate legal remedy for an injunction to issue. See <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>225 Conn. 575, 588, 626 A.2d 259 (1993). Section 8-12 presumes that no adequate alternative remedy exists and that the injury was irreparable, and the town must prove only that an ordinance or regulation has been violated. Id. \u201cA prayer for injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and the court\u2019s ruling can be reviewed only for the purpose of determining whether the decision was based on an erroneous statement of law or an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Renz, </em>supra, 15.</p>\n<p id=\"A9H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Having concluded that the court properly found that the defendants\u2019 use of the property was in violation of the regulations, we further conclude that the court properly exercised its discretion in ordering the injunctive relief requested by the plaintiffs to prevent this unauthorized use.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Next, the defendants claim that the court improperly found that the commission had the authority to require them to post a bond to continue work on their property. More specifically, they claim that the commission did not have the authority under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36 through 22a-45 or under \u00a7 4.4 of the regulations to condition using a property for agricultural purposes, an as of right use, on the posting of a bond or surety. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">When the commission granted the defendants\u2019 second permit application on September 27, 2006, the approval of the application, and the lifting of the order, was conditioned on the posting of a cash bond or letter of credit in the amount of $8000. The defendants have not posted the bond or a letter of credit. Because no bond or letter of credit was ever posted, the order remained in effect, and any further activity on the property was a violation of the order. Indeed, the commission sent the defendants a certified letter on December 21, 2006, which stated: \u201cDue to the activity currently taking place on your property on North Society Road without the proper bonds in place, the [commission] has requested your attendance at [its] meeting on Wednesday, December 12, 2006 . . . .\u201d According to the minutes of the commission\u2019s December 12 meeting, a commission member expressed concern that work was taking place on the property when no bond had been put in place. Christopher Deojay stated that the treasurer refused to accept his bond, and it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>explained to him that the town does not accept insurance bonds. The defendants have still not posted a cash bond or letter of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a (d) (1) provides in part: \u201cIn granting, denying or limiting any permit for a regulated activity the inland wetlands agency, or its agent, shall consider the factors set forth in section 22a-41, and such agency, or its agent, shall state upon the record the reason for its decision. In granting a permit the inland wetlands agency, or its agent, may grant the application as filed or grant it upon other terms, conditions, limitations or modifications of the regulated activity which are designed to carry out the policy of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive. Such terms may include any reasonable measures which would mitigate the impacts of the regulated activity and which would (A) prevent or minimize pollution or other environmental damage, (B) maintain or enhance existing environmental quality, or (C) in the following order of priority: Restore, enhance and create productive wetland or watercourse resources. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This section gives the commission explicit authority to place conditions, modifications or limitations on the granting of a permit application and does not attempt to limit such conditions in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The court did not make any findings regarding the propriety of the bond beyond finding that no satisfactory bond or letter of credit was posted. It is the defendants\u2019 contention that because farming is an as of right use under the regulations and statutes, the condition of the posting of the bond attached to the approval of their permit application is improper. The defendants again ignore the fact that they never received a determination that their proposed use fell into the category of farming, and so their use of their property was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>simply an as of right use. Whether a proposed use is an as of right use has no place in the discussion of whether the commission is entitled to condition the approval of a permit application on the posting of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">Conditional approvals of wetlands permit applications have been held permissible by both this court and our Supreme Court. See <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Inland Wetlands Commission, </em>289 Conn. 12, 42, 959 A.2d 569 (2008) (listing Supreme Court and Appellate Court cases involving such conditional approvals); <em>Cioffoletti </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>209 Conn. 544, 561, 552 A.2d 796 (1989) (undertaking statutory analysis and concluding that requirement of performance bond consistent with \u00a7 22a-42 [c] because such measure reasonably designed to protect town\u2019s wetlands and watercourses), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>245 Conn. 551, 582, 715 A.2d 46 (1998) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, \u00a7 22a-42a gives the commission wide latitude to condition a permit approval on certain actions by the permittee to mitigate the impacts of the regulated activity. In this particular case, it appears that the commission was less concerned with the environmental impact of the defendants\u2019 proposed use of their property than with the fact that the defendants might be asserting insincerely that they proposed to use their property for \u201cfarming\u201d to circumvent the permit process. The commission imposed the bond in September, 2006, because it was unwilling to take the defendants\u2019 word at that juncture that they would be using their property for farming; the commission stated in the notice of action announcing the conditional approval that the bond\u2019s purpose was to \u201crestore the wetlands in the event the farming activity is not completed.\u201d The commission\u2019s decision was not unreasonable, particularly in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the fact that it informed the defendants at the time that their bond would be lifted in three years if, at that time, the commission believed that the lot was developed according to the defendants\u2019 plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Moreover, the defendants did not challenge the condition that they post a bond. Before raising a claim in this court, the defendants were required to exhaust their administrative remedies, and their failure to challenge the condition renders the commission\u2019s action final. See <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 96, 102, 616 A.2d 793 (1992). General Statutes \u00a7 8.8 (b) provides that appeals must be filed within fifteen days from the date that notice of the decision was published, and the record indicates that legal notice of the commission\u2019s decision conditionally approving the defendants\u2019 permit application was published in the Norwich Bulletin on October 3,2006. An appeal was not taken from the conditional approval of the defendants\u2019 application and, as such, they are barred from challenging it now.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly found that the commission published notice of its decision upholding the order. The defendants do not allege that they did not receive notice of the order but claim that both General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-43 and 8-8 require newspaper publication of an order, and because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>order was never published in a newspaper, it never took effect.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of the defendants\u2019 claim. As noted previously, Sadlowski issued a cease and desist order against the defendants on January 26, 2006, ordering them to stop any further activity on their property until a new permit application was submitted to and approved by the commission. The commission voted to uphold the order at its February 2, 2006 meeting, according to the minutes of the meeting, \u201cwith the conditions that a letter is sent to the Board of Selectmen and the Town Road Foreman to address the drainage on North Society Road Map 38, Lots 9 and 9A . . . .\u201d On February 9, 2006, the chairman of the commission sent a certified letter to Christopher Deojay informing him of the commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The court found that no appeal was taken from the February 6, 2006 action confirming the order and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201c[w]hile the commission did not \u2018publish\u2019 its February 2, 2006 meeting in a newspaper, \u2018publication\u2019 was accomplished. \u2018Publish\u2019 and \u2018publication\u2019 are not interchangeable terms as \u2018publication\u2019 is used in ... \u00a7 22a-43 (a).\u201d The court further concluded that \u201c[i]f \u2018publication\u2019 did not occur appeal by the defendant at this time is prevented by ... \u00a7 8-8 (r).\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">\u201cIssues of statutory construction raise questions of law, over which we exercise plenary review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Historic District Commission, </em>108 Conn. App. 682, 702, 950 A.2d 1, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 942, 943, 959 A.2d 1008 (2008). When construing a statute, \u201c[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>112 Conn. App. 492, 505, 963 A.2d 1027, cert. granted on other grounds, 291 Conn. 906, 967 A.2d 1220 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">A review of the applicable statutes and their relationship to other statutes reveals no requirement that notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>of such orders be published in a newspaper to take effect.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendants claim that \u00a7 22a-43, when read in conjunction with \u00a7 8-8, requires newspaper publication of the order, without which it will not take effect. Section 22a-43 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A]ny person aggrieved by any regulation, order, decision or action made pursuant to sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, by the commissioner, a district or municipality . . . may, within the time specified in subsection (b) of section 8-8, from the publication of such regulation, order, decision or action, appeal to the superior court . . . .\u201d Section 8-8 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A]ny person aggrieved by any decision of a board, including a decision to approve or deny a site plan pursuant to subsection (g) of section 8-3 .. . may take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located. . . . The appeal shall be commenced by service of process in accordance with subsections (f) and (g) of this section within fifteen days from the date that notice of the decision was published as required by the general statutes. ...\u201d Section 8-8 (b), in making reference to notice \u201cas required by the general statutes,\u201d points us to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-44 as the place to find the pertinent notice requirements, as it is the section that authorizes the commission to issue cease and desist orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, the relevant notice provisions are contained in \u00a7 22a-44 (a), and not in \u00a7\u00a7 22a-43 and 8-8. Section 22a-44 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf the inland wetlands agency or its duly authorized agent finds that any person is conducting or maintaining any activity, facility or condition which is in violation of sections 22a-36 to 22a-45, inclusive, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>or of the regulations of the inland wetlands agency, the agency or its duly authorized agent may issue a written order, <em>by certified mail, </em>to such person conducting such activity or maintaining such facility or condition to cease immediately such activity or to correct such facility or condition. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 22a-44 (a) makes no mention of any requirement that such an order be published in a newspaper, as the defendants claim. It merely provides that the agency must issue a written order, by certified mail, to such persons who are being ordered to cease their activities. The commission did just that. Section 22a-43 refers only to \u201cpublication\u201d and not to \u201cpublication in a newspaper of general circulation\u201d as do other sections of the statutes. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-42a (d) (1), 8-3, 8-26 and 8-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">An examination of \u00a7 22a-42a (d) (1) is instructive and sheds light on when the commission is required to publish certain items in a newspaper and whether such a requirement is imposed by \u00a7 22a-43. Section 22a-42a (d) (1), which concerns the \u201cgranting, denying or limiting [of] any permit for a regulated activity\u201d provides that after the commission makes such a decision regarding a permit application, \u201c[t]he applicant shall be notified of the agency\u2019s decision by certified mail within fifteen days of the date of the decision and the agency shall cause notice of their order in issuance, denial, revocation or suspension of a permit to be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in the town wherein the wetland or watercourse lies. In any case in which such notice is not published within such fifteen-day period, the applicant may provide for the publication of such notice within ten days thereafter.\u201d Section 22a-42a (d) (1) explicitly requires that notice of the approval, rejection or modification of a permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>application be published in a newspaper.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Section 22a-43 contains no such explicit language. Furthermore, \u00a7 22a-42a (d) (1) concerns notice only of the commission\u2019s decision on permit applications and makes no mention of orders such as the order in question. The commission satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 22a-44 by notifying the defendants by certified mail of its decision to uphold the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Section 22a-42a shows that when the legislature intends to require that notice of an act of the commission be published in a newspaper, it knows how to do so. Furthermore, the \u201cfundamental reason for the requirement of notice is to advise all <em>affected, parties </em>of the opportunity to be heard and to be apprised of the relief sought.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Jarvis Acres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>163 Conn. 41, 47, 301 A.2d 244 (1972). The requirement of publication in a newspaper of general circulation of the approval or rejection of a permit application under \u00a7 22a-42a or notice of a public hearing regarding establishing or changing zoning regulations or districts under \u00a7 8-3 has a place because presumably people other than the property owners have an interest in knowing that the current use of property in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>town will or will not be altered. In contrast, the issuance of a cease and desist order logically does not have a similar -widespread effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Next, the defendants claim that the court improperly found that they conducted activities in the wetlands area of their property before and after the order was issued. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">In its memorandum of decision, the court made the following findings: \u201cAlthough the facts are disputed, the court finds that the defendants conducted activities in the wetlands both before and after the . . . order. . . . The defendants knowingly and wilfully conducted activities on their property in violation of the wetlands regulations. These activities were conducted both before and after the . . . order approved by the commission on February 2, 2006.\u201d Christopher Deojay admitted in writing, in a letter to the chairman of the commission dated February 15, 2006, that he believed that his property was exempt from regulation and that \u201c[t]here is still brush, stumps and concrete on my property that needs to be cleaned up. My inability to continue my work by your orders has created more of an environmental impact and detriment than I could have ever created intentionally. . . . Therefore, I will proceed with my original plan for the site as presented, weather permitting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">\u201cOur review of the factual findings of the trial court is limited to a determination of whether they are clearly erroneous. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . Because it is the trial court\u2019s function to weigh the evidence and determine credibility, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>give great deference to its findings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Vernon </em>v. <em>Goff, </em>107 Conn. App. 552, 557, 945 A.2d 1017, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 920, 958 A.2d 154 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Our review of the record indicates that the factual findings challenged by the defendants clearly are supported by the evidence. Sadlowski made numerous visits to the defendants\u2019 property and documented its various stages of alteration. Christopher Deojay indicated in writing that he intended to ignore the order and to proceed with his original plans for the property, and he testified that he cut down trees in the wetlands area in 2005. He also testified that during the cease and desist period, he dug a pond on his property. He admitted that he made a conscious effort to proceed with his project despite the cease and desist order and, in August, 2006, testified: \u201cI\u2019m continuing [the work] right now.\u201d Indeed, Christopher Deojay has shown a continuing unwillingness to cooperate with the commission, to the extent that he testified: \u201cI\u2019m continuing [the work] right now. I\u2019ve been mowing it on a regular basis. There\u2019s blueberries in there, and it\u2019s for charitable use. I mean, if you\u2019re opposed to that, that\u2019s your problem.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The defendants again contend, as a reason why there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the findings that they conducted such activities, that because their agricultural use of their property is permitted as of right, their activities cannot be considered a violation of the regulations or the General Statutes. That has no bearing on their actual claim, however, which is a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Their contention that they did not violate the regulations or the statutes because such activity is permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>as of right is a challenge to the legal conclusion of the court. This argument is not addressed to the sufficiency of the court\u2019s factual findings and, again, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Because we cannot say that the court\u2019s factual findings were, as a matter of law, unsupported, incorrect or mistaken, they are not clearly erroneous. We must, therefore, affirm the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendants conducted activities in the wetlands both before and after the order was issued.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\"> Although both Deojays are parties to this appeal, as both were named defendants in the complaint, much of the paperwork was filed in Christopher Deojay\u2019s name only. In addition, he testified at trial while Tina Deojay did not, and it appears from the minutes of the meetings of the plaintiff inland wetlands and watercourses commission that he was often present, but it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>unclear whether she accompanied him to those meetings. When we refer to the defendants, therefore, we mean both Deojays, even though only Christopher Deojay\u2019s name may appear on the paperwork in question, unless the facts necessitate that we refer to him separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b720-9\"> The plaintiffs in this matter are the town of Canterbury, the town\u2019s inland wetlands and watercourses commission and Sadlowski.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b720-10\"> Sadlowski first took photographs of the property at about that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> Sadlowski took more photographs to document the status of the property at that time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\"> The letter is dated October 4, 2005, but contains a handwritten notation that it should have been dated January 26, 2006, and Sadlowski testified that the October date was a typographical error on his part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\"> The minutes of that meeting state: \u201c[Christopher] Deojay needs to send a letter to the Board of Selectmen regarding the drainage. . . .

We note that Practice Book \u00a7 10-60 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201c[A] party may amend his or her pleadings or other parts of the record or proceedings at any time subsequent to that stated in the preceding section in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">\u201c(1) By order of judicial authority; or</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">\u201c(2) By written consent of the adverse party; or</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">\u201c(3) By filing a request for leave to file such amendment, with the amendment appended, after service upon each party . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b726-11\"> The special defenses set forth in the proposed amended answer were: (1) the order was upheld by the commission with the condition that the commission contact the board of selectmen and the town road foreman about drainage issues, and because the commission never made such contact, the order never took effect; (2) the defendants stopped all conduct which led to the issuance of the order; (3) the defendants\u2019 use of their property is agricultural, which is a permitted use as of right under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (1) and \u00a7 4.1 (a) of the regulations; and (4) because the commission failed to publish notice of its purported decision upholding the order, the period during which the defendants could appeal the decision upholding the order has not passed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 22a-40 (a) (1) contains identical language.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b734-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22a-36a through 22a-45a are collectively known as the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act.

Even if such a procedure was adequate to constitute an appeal, the proceedings to which the defendants refer were related to the order and not to the conditional approval of their application. They may have raised the issue in the pleadings that they were making an agricultural use of their land, but that has no bearing on whether an appeal was taken from the condition that they post a bond for the order to be lifted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\"> The defendants also raise what appears to be a separate claim, which is framed in their brief as a subset of this issue, that the order never took effect for the additional reason that there is no evidence in the record that the commission complied with its condition of the upholding of the order that a letter be sent to the board of selectmen and the town road foreman. This section contains no analysis of the issue, and we decline to review the claim. \u201cWe are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief. . . .
