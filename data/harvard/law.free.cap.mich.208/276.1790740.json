Postal, brought suit to foreclose a real estate mortgage held as collateral to a promissory note. At the time the loan was made the defendant executed two promissory notes to plaintiff\u2019s assignor, one for $1,300 and the other for $59.42. It is claimed by defendant and admitted by plaintiff that included in these two notes is a 10 per cent, bonus or commission to James R. Postal, husband of plaintiff\u2019s assignor, through whom the loan was negotiated. Defendant in his answer set up facts which he claimed constituted usury. The case was heard in open court, all the parties in interest being examined orally and a decree was entered providing for the foreclosure of said mortgage but holding that the transaction was a usurious one and limiting the amount of the decree to the principal sum unpaid. From this decree plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b315-10\">Brooke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asz\"><em>{after stating the </em>facts). There would appear to be no dispute between the parties upon the facts in this case except that the plaintiff claims that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the 10 per cent, was exacted by James R. Postal as a commission to himself for negotiating the loan from his wife to the defendant, while defendant claims that the 10 per cent, was exacted by Postal as a bonus <em>to his wife </em>for making the loan. This conflict in the claims of the parties under our view of the case is unimportant. The statute, 2 Comp. Laws 1915, \u00a7 5998, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201cNo bond, bill, note, contract or assurance, made or given for or upon a consideration or contract, whereby or whereon a greater rate of interest has been, directly or indirectly, reserved, taken, or received, than is allowed by law, shall be thereby rendered void; but in any action brought by any person on such usurious contract or assurance, except as is provided in \u2019the following section, if it shall appear that a greater rate of interest has been, directly or indirectly, reserved, taken or received, than is allowed by law, the defendant shall not be compelled to pay any interest thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The mortgage and.notes provided for 7 per cent, interest (the highest legal rate), and the notes included the 10 per cent, additional. There is no claim made that more than $1,231.29 was paid out by Mrs. Postal and it is admitted that she received notes aggregating $1,359.42 payable to herself. The words of the statute are plain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u201cIf it shall appear that a greater rate of interest has been <em>reserved, taken or received, </em>than is allowed by law, the defendant shall not be compelled to pay any interest thereon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Whether Mrs. Postal or her husband received the avails of the 10 per cent, commission or bonus would seem unimportant. It certainly was reserved to her in the written instruments constituting the evidence of the transaction. In the course of his evidence James R. Postal testified that in negotiating the deal with defendant he was acting as agent for his wife. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>It should perhaps be noted that the plaintiff does not claim to be a holder for value without notice but admits that he takes the security with such infirmities, if any, as would have attached thereto in the hands of the original holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-6\">Bird, C.
