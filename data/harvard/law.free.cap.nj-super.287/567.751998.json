Kelly, appeals from an order granting summary judgment to defendant, Geriatric and Medical Services, Inc., t/a Cooper River Convalescent Center (CRCC), dismissing her personal-injury negligence complaint. The Law Division judge ruled that as a matter of law, she was a \u201cspecial employee\u201d of CRCC and, therefore, barred from bringing a tort action against her \u201cspecial employer\u201d by <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-8 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Plaintiff, a licensed practical nurse (LPN), was injured on January 16, 1991, when she slipped and fell on a wet floor while working at CRCC\u2019s health care facility. At the time, plaintiff was employed by Today\u2019s Staffing Services, Inc. (TSI), a labor services company in the business of supplying skilled nursing personnel to health care facilities on a temporary basis. Plaintiffs claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits through the insurance carrier for TSI was paid without contribution from CRCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">On November 12, 1992, plaintiff filed her complaint against CRCC, alleging that, on January 16, 1991, she was \u201cemployed by TSI,\u201d and \u201cin the course of her employment with TSI as a nurse,\u201d she slipped and fell on a freshly mopped, wet floor \u201cin the course of her ... work at the Cooper River Convalescent Center.\u201d Plaintiff alleged that as a \u201cbusiness invitee\u201d at defendant\u2019s health care facility, CRCC had a duty to provide her with a \u201csafe place to work,\u201d which it negligently breached by exposing her to \u201cunsafe conditions during the course of her employment.\u201d Among other defenses asserted, was that at the time of her accident, plaintiff was an \u201cemployee of this defendant\u201d and, therefore, her sole and exclusive remedy against it was \u201cunder the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">After completion of discovery, CRCC moved for summary judgment. CRCC acknowledged that plaintiff was an \u201cemployee ... of TSI,\u201d but argued that because plaintiff was an \u201cagency nurse\u201d obtained by defendant from \u201ca temporary personnel agency,\u201d CRCC was her \u201cspecial employer\u201d and plaintiff was, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u201cbarred by the workers\u2019 compensation statute\u2019s surrender of other remedies provision, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8.\u201d Plaintiff responded that \u201cat no time did she consider herself an employee of CROC,\u201d and that at the time of her accident, she was \u201cemployed by [TSI], a nursing agency,\u201d was an \u201cemployee of [TSI] only,\u201d and was \u201cnot the special or borrowed employee of [CROC].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">On September 23, 1994, the motion judge held that plaintiff was a \u201cspecial employee\u201d of CROC and, therefore, \u201cthe workers\u2019 compensation bar is applicable.\u201d He, therefore, entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of CROC and dismissed plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The facts are not in great dispute. For several years, plaintiff had been contemporaneously employed by TSI and several other temporary nurse staffing agencies, and had been temporarily assigned to work as an \u201cagency nurse\u201d at various health care facilities, including defendant\u2019s. Plaintiff had always worked as an agency nurse because she liked the scheduling flexibility it provided, which was not available to a \u201cstaff nurse\u201d regularly employed on the payroll of a health care facility. It was plaintiffs \u201cpersonal preference to be an agency nurse rather than a staff nurse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Before plaintiffs fall, defendant would from time to time decide that all nurses working at its various health care facilities \u201cshould go staff,\u201d that is, \u201cshould ... become employees directly of [CROC].\u201d Defendant had at these times \u201coffered plaintiff a position ... to work on staff.\u201d Plaintiff testified: \u201cwhen that happened, I refused to join staff and I would go work somewhere else,\u201d and \u201cthen ... the furor would die down and I would go back\u201d to defendant\u2019s facility \u201c[t]hrough an agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">The applicable, though not exclusive, legal criteria to establish a special employer-special employee relationship involves the following fact-sensitive five-pronged test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-10\">(1) the employee has made a contract of hire, express or implied, with the special employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-11\">(2) the work being done by the employee is essentially that of the special employer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>(3) the special employer has the right to control the details of the work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">(4) the special employer pays the employee\u2019s wages; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">(5) the special employer has the power to hire, discharge or recall the employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>See Antheunisse v. Tiffany &amp; Co., Inc., </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 402-03, 551 A.2d 1006 (App.Div.1988), <em>certif. denied, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>59, 556 A.2d 1206 (1989); <em>see Volb v. G.E. Capital Corp., </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>110, 116, 651 A.2d 1002 (1995); <em>see also </em>IB Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 48.00 at 8-434 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">CRCC urges that although plaintiff and defendant had no \u201cexpress contract of employment,\u201d an implied contract was entered into under which plaintiff \u201caccepted CRCC as her special employer.\u201d CRCC reasons that the regular business activity of plaintiffs general employer, TSI, was the placing of nurses in temporary employment with employers such as CRCC. Therefore, it argues, it was impossible for plaintiff to have been doing the work of her general employer, TSI, while at CRCC, and thus, the work she did at CRCC was that of her special employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Plaintiff does not dispute that the work she performed at defendant\u2019s facility was essentially that of CRCC. She notes, however, that the reverse side of the TSI written form, which plaintiff and CROC\u2019s staff supervisor had to fill out and sign to confirm that plaintiff had worked at defendant\u2019s facility on her assigned dates and shifts states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">Today\u2019s Staffing will supply staff personnel to Client upon Client request. Personnel <em>working for Client pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered employees of Today\u2019s Staffing only. </em>Today\u2019s Staffing shall be responsible for payment of wages, withholding of taxes and maintaining required insurance coverages, including general and professional liability insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">[Emphasis Added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">On the issue of control, CROC\u2019s assistant administrator testified at her deposition that \u201conce they [agency nurses] go on the floor they are working for us\u201d and are subject to the same \u201ccontrol\u201d while working on the floor as one of CROC\u2019s own staff nurses visa-vis \u201cwhat [has] to be done.\u201d Plaintiff agreed generally with this proposition, but noted that as a skilled LPN, no one had to tell her \u201cwhat to do\u201d vis-a-vis her duties as an LPN working on the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>As to the factor of who paid the employee\u2019s wages, the payor on all of plaintiff\u2019s paychecks was TSI. Plaintiff never received a paycheck directly from CROC, nor did she \u201creceive any benefits in terms of fringe benefits\u201d when she worked as an agency nurse at the facility. There is no evidence as to the breakdown of the fee paid to the agency by CROC, and no showing that the fee is directly tied to plaintiffs wages plus a fixed percentage for overhead. Defendant was never told what the agency nurse received as pay from the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">CROC could discharge an agency nurse only to the extent that it could cause the nurse to be removed from the facility. If an agency nurse \u201cperformed badly,\u201d the nurse\u2019s agency would be told by CROC to \u201cnot send that person to this facility\u201d in the future. Defendant maintained a \u201cdo not call list,\u201d and any agency nurse who did not perform professionally could be placed on the \u201clist of do not calls,\u201d and would not be allowed back regardless of what agency attempted to send the nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Given this factual background, we apply the law. New Jersey \u201callows an employee, for the purpose of workers\u2019 compensation to have two employers, both of whom may be liable in [workers\u2019] compensation.\u201d <em>Antheunisse, supra, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 402, 551 A.2d 1006. In such circumstances, the right to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits serves to bar the employee from maintaining a tort action against either employer. <em>See Ibid.; Murin v. Frapaul Const. Co., </em>240 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 606-07, 573 A.2d 989 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">A critical criterion in determining whether special employment exists is the requirement of a contract, express or implied, between the employee and the special employer. <em>See Antheunisse, supra, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 401-05, 551 A.2d 1006; <em>Chickachop v. Manpower, Inc., </em>84 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 137, 201 A.2d 90 (Law Div.1964); <em>see also </em>Larson, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 48.23 at 8-524, 8-528, 8-532 (\u201cemployers obtaining workers from the kind of labor service typified by Manpower, Inc., have usually, but not invariably, been held to assume the status of special employer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>A contract of employment \u201cmay be express or implied.\u201d <em>White v. Atlantic City Press, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>128,133, 313 A.2d 197 (1973). A hiring contract does \u201cnot require formality.\u201d <em>Gomez v. Federal Stevedoring Co., Inc., </em>5 <em>N.J.Super. </em>100,103, 68 A.2d 482 (App.Div. 1949). While assent to the offer of employment \u201cmust be manifested in order to be legally effective, it need not be expressed in words.\u201d <em>Ibid,. </em>The necessary assent may be expressed in words, or it may be \u201cimplied from conduct without words.\u201d <em>Ibid. See Deskovick v. Porzio, </em>78 <em>N.J.Super. </em>82, 86-87, 187 A.2d 610 (App. Div.1963) (\u201ccontract implied in fact calls for the establishment of a consensual understanding,\u201d which may be \u201cinferable from the circumstances under which one furnishes services\u201d). In <em>Antheunisse, supra, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 404, 551 A.2d 1006, we pointed out that \u201cplaintiff knew that [the personnel agency] would hire her out to various employers and accepted the terms of her employment with defendant.\u201d We also noted that plaintiff \u201chad the opportunity to refuse the job without fearing any reprisal from the agency.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, we found that plaintiff had \u201cimpliedly contracted with defendant when she reported voluntarily to work\u201d and proceeded to \u201csubmit to defendant\u2019s direction and control.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Plaintiff relies on the reasoning in <em>M.J. Daly Co. v. Varney, </em>695 S.W.2d 400 (Ky.1985) to support her contention that no implied contract arose. There, the plaintiff was injured on the premises of defendant\u2019s chemical distributing plant. 695 S.W.2d at 401. At the time of his accident, plaintiff was employed on the payroll of a labor service company, and defendant had contracted with Personnel Pool for his services. <em>Ibid. </em>The Kentucky Supreme Court noted that plaintiff \u201chad been offered employment by [defendant]\u201d but, \u201cpreferring to remain an employee of Personnel Pool on assignment to [defendant],\u201d plaintiff had \u201cexpressly refused status as an employee of [defendant] so that he could maintain his status as an employee of Personnel Pool.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401-02. Because plaintiff had expressly \u201crejected employment status with the special employer,\u201d the court held that plaintiff had \u201cretained the right to sue M.J. Daly &amp; Co.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>We reject the reasoning in <em>Daly, supra, </em>in favor of that supporting our holding in <em>Pacenti v. Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc., </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>188, 584 A.2d 843 (App.Div.1991). In <em>Pacenti, supra, </em>plaintiff was a \u201cdirect employee of the Johansen Company\u201d when he slipped and fell while working as a millwright on the premises of Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc. <em>Id. </em>at 189, 584 A.2d 843. The Johansen Company had a \u201ccontract with Hoffman-LaRoche to supply maintenance personnel,\u201d which \u201cspecifically provided that the personnel were not direct employees of Hoffman-LaRoche.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff argued that based on the \u201cexpress provisions in the contract between Johansen and Hoffman-LaRoche stating that the employee shall remain solely the employee of Johansen,\u201d no special-employment could exist. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 584 A.2d 843. We, however, pointed out that the \u201cemployment agreement necessary under the <em>Larson </em>tests involves the limited subject of supervision for workers\u2019 compensation purposes\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe focus is not upon the relationship between the two corporations, but rather between plaintiff and each of his potential employers.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We apply the holdings of <em>Pacenti </em>and <em>Antheunisse </em>and conclude that plaintiffs voluntary acceptance of work at CRCC gave rise to an implied contract of employment. We add that the element of control, as hereinafter discussed, was similarly voluntarily accepted by plaintiff when she complied with assignments and supervision at defendant\u2019s facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Plaintiff notes that generally, cases dealing with special employees have dealt with non-professionals. Plaintiff urges that, because she was an \u201cindependent skilled professional,\u201d defendant had \u201cno right to control the details of Joan Kelly\u2019s work.\u201d According to plaintiff:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">She was required to exercise her discretion and use her professional expertise in providing care to patients, dispensing prescribed medication and monitoring patient\u2019s conditions. The details of the manner in which she provided nursing care were entirely within her individual control, and CRCC had no right to control those details.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Under the \u201cright to control test,\u201d the actual exercise of control is \u201cnot as determinative as the <em>right </em>of control itself,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>because, in many instances, \u201cthe expertise of an employee precludes an employer from giving him any effective direction concerning the method he selects in carrying out his duties.\u201d <em>Smith v. E.T.L. Enterprises, </em>155 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 350, 382 A.2d 939 (App.Div.1978); <em>accord Santos v. Standard Havens, Inc., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 22, 541 A.2d 708 (App.Div.1988); <em>see Marcus v. Eastern Agric. Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>58 <em>N.J.Super. </em>584, 597, 157 A.2d 3 (App.Div.1959) (Conford, J.A.D., dissenting), <em>rev\u2019d on dissenting opinion, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>460, 161 A.2d 247 (1960) (\u201cwhile some measure of control is essential to a finding of an employer-employee relationship,\u201d the requirement of control is \u201csufficiently met where its extent is commensurate with that degree of supervision which is necessary and appropriate, considering the type of work to be done and the capabilities of the particular person doing it\u201d); <em>see also Trauma Nurses, Inc. v. Board of Rev., N.J. Dept. of Labor, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 137, 140, 146-47, 576 A.2d 285 (App.Div.1990) (a disability-benefits case involving \u201ctemporary nursing personnel\u201d supplied to hospital by company in \u201cbusiness of supplying hospitals with nurses on a temporary basis;\u201d we noted that, \u201conce a nurse is placed, the hospital is in complete control of his or her activities,\u201d but also recognized \u201cthat nurses are professionals and that the details of their work are ordinarily not subject to close supervision\u201d); <em>see generally Nation v. Weiner, </em>145 <em>Ariz. </em>414, 701 P.2d 1222 (Ct.App.1985) (registered nurse, regularly assigned to a hospital by an agency, held to be lent employee; hospital was her special employer and entitled to' immunity from negligence action under workers\u2019 compensation statute; contention that plaintiffs status as a licensed professional nurse precluded finding of special employee rejected).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">It is pivotal to the present case that plaintiff, while rejecting offers of direct employment with CROC, accepted an employment relationship at the convalescent center where her work duties and job performances were assigned, directed and overseen by CROC\u2019s supervisor. Plaintiffs daily activities were controlled by CROC and there was an absence of any such control by TSI. Though an LPN, plaintiffs assignments and the evaluation of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>performance were clearly under the day to day control of CRCC. Notwithstanding the language of the writing between TSI and CRCC, the right to direct the on-site work assignments and to control that work lay with CRCC. <em>See Thompson v. Grumman Aerospace Corp., </em>166 A.D.2d 578, 560 N.Y.S.2d 864 (App.Div.1990). No other manner of control would be acceptable as plaintiffs performance as an LPN was integral and necessary to the conduct of the business of the facility and its patients, and plaintiff as a professional knew she was subject to CRCC\u2019s exclusive control while on the job. <em>See Abramson v. Long Beach Mem. Hosp., </em>103 A.D.2d 866, 478 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>105 (App.Div.1984); <em>accord Riley v. Southwest Marine, Inc., </em>203 Cal.App.3d 1242, 250 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>718 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We do not find it of any moment that TSI actually paid plaintiffs wages. The money used to pay her wages came indirectly out of the fees paid by defendant for plaintiffs services. <em>See Antheunisse, supra, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 404-05, 551 A.2d 1006; <em>Chickachop, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 139, 201 A.2d 90. We have given little weight to this factor in our finding of special employment. It would have had greater importance, as an indicia of \u201cspecial employment,\u201d if the wages were paid directly by CRCC, or if the fee paid to the agency was based on a percentage scale linked to the employee\u2019s wages. In any event, this factor is not necessary for a determination that a special employment relationship exists. <em>See Volb, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 116, 651 A.2d 1002; <em>Antheunisse, supra, </em>229 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 403, 551 A.2d 1006.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Regarding the fifth prong of the test, that is, \u201cthe power [of the special employer] to fire, discharge or recall the employee,\u201d CRCC had no power to decide whether plaintiff could continue working out of TSI for other facilities, however, it had full control over whether she would continue to work at CRCC and indeed whether she would ever again work at any of its other facilities. We find this to be the functional equivalent of the power to discharge her.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The question of whether an employment relationship exists is reserved for the trier of fact where there is a conflict in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>evidence or the inferences to be drawn from it. <em>See Brill v. Guardian Life Insurance Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540-42, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Here, there is no such conflict and the question is one only of law, properly resolved by summary judgment. It is apparent that plaintiff was a special employee of CRCC at the time of her fall and that she is thereby precluded from maintaining the present action against her special employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
