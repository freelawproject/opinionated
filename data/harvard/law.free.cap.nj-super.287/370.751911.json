Devilla and Romeo Devilla, based on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to meet the verbal threshold.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">On June 19, 1992, plaintiff, Louis Scott Whitaker,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> suffered injuries when his car was hit from behind by a car owned by Romeo Devilla and operated by Ronald A. Devilla, on Route 518 in Montgomery Township. Plaintiff is a resident of Pennsylvania and is covered by a Pennsylvania automobile insurance policy issued by Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company, which is licensed to operate in the State of New Jersey. Plaintiff elected the \u201cfull tort\u201d option (comparable to New Jersey\u2019s \u201cno threshold\u201d coverage) and paid a higher premium for such coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">On October 5, 1994, defendants moved for summary judgment asserting that plaintiffs\u2019 action was subject to the \u201cverbal threshold,\u201d pursuant to the New Jersey Deemer Statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28\u2014 1.4, and plaintiffs failed to meet that threshold. Defendants\u2019 motion was granted on February 7,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">We agree that plaintiff failed to meet the verbal threshold requirements for the reasons expressed by the trial judge in her written decision of February 7, 1995, in which she held that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s proofs do not suffice to carry him beyond the verbal threshold.\u201d However, we reverse the granting of summary judgment, as we find that the New Jersey Deemer Statute <em>(N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.4) does not bar plaintiff\u2019s claim because plaintiff elected comparable \u201cno threshold\u201d coverage with a company licensed to do business in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Under New Jersey\u2019s Deemer Statute, a person insured under an automobile policy issued in another state, by a company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>licensed to do business in New Jersey, will be \u201cdeemed\u201d to have chosen and \u201cshall be subject to the tort option specified in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(a),\u201d the verbal threshold. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.4. If the company is not licensed to do business in this State, the Deemer provision does not bar a claim for non-economic losses by the non-resident. <em>Ibid.; Taylor-Segan v. Rajagopal, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>286, 292, 645 A.2d 1272 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">However, under New Jersey Law, New Jersey insureds must elect between a \u201cverbal threshold\u201d automobile policy and a \u201cno threshold\u201d automobile policy. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8. Under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-8(b), if a New Jersey insured elects \u201cno threshold\u201d coverage, he or she pays an additional premium, and has a right to recover for non-economic loss (pain and suffering) arising out of an automobile accident. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8(b). If, however, the insured elects the basic \u201cverbal threshold\u201d coverage, the insured pays less than under a \u201cno threshold\u201d policy and cannot recover for non-economic loss as a result of bodily injury <em>unless </em>the injuries and disabilities sustained satisfy at least one of nine statutorily enumerated categories. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We disagree with plaintiffs contention that the Deemer provision of <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.4 is unconstitutional because it \u201cdenies equal protection to a certain class of people, namely, out-of-state automobile drivers that operate an automobile in New Jersey and whose insurance carriers are authorized to transact or do business in New Jersey.\u201d <em>See Taylor-Segan, supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>286, 645 A.2d 1272. We need not decide if it would be unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff, by violating his right to Equal Protection, as he, although an out-of-state resident, did in fact select the \u201cno threshold option through a carrier licensed to do business in New Jersey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Applying the \u201cverbal threshold,\u201d however, to non-residents, such as the plaintiff, who specifically elect and pay for the broader coverage through a New Jersey company, does not advance the Legislature\u2019s, or the Governor\u2019s, intent of containing costs of automobile insurance by allowing recovery for \u201cnon-economic\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>damages only to those who pay for \u201cno threshold\u201d access to the courts. <em>See Governor\u2019s Reconsideration and Recommendation Statement, Senate No. </em>2637-L.1988, c. 119 (Statement pertains to both Deemer Statute and amendment to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-8(a)). There is no basis shown in the present case to distinguish between a New Jersey resident who pays a New Jersey insurance company for \u201cno threshold\u201d coverage and an out-of-state resident who opts for substantially the same coverage with the same insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">In any event, the result would be anomalous. Consider next-door neighbors living just over the border in a contiguous state. One pays for \u201cno threshold\u201d coverage with an insurance company authorized to do business in New Jersey, while his neighbor obtains his insurance from a company not so authorized, and does not pay for the greater coverage. If the Deemer provision is interpreted as applying to the first, he cannot recover for non-economic damages if he is injured in an automobile accident occurring here, but his neighbor, who has not paid the greater premium can recover non-economic loss without regard to the verbal threshold. We can not attribute so absurd and unnecessary an intention to our Legislature, particularly where the New Jersey authorized insurance company can probably control the optional premium for the \u201cno threshold\u201d coverage just as easily as it does with a New Jersey resident. \u201cA statute is not to be given an arbitrary construction, according to the strict letter, but rather one that will advance the sense and meaning fairly deducible from the context. The reason of the statute prevails over the literal sense of its terms.\u201d <em>Lesniak v. Budzash, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>1,14, 626 A.2d 1073 (1993) (quoting <em>Wene v. Meyner, </em>13 <em>N.J. </em>185, 197, 98 A.2d 573 (1953)); <em>see also Loftus v. Smith, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>477, 487 (App.Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">We conclude that the language employed by the Legislature in the Deemer provision, <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.4, was inadvertently over-broad and was not intended to restrict the rights of persons such as the present plaintiffs. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b402-10\"> Hereafter plaintiff refers to Louis Scott Whitaker.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
