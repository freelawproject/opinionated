We hold that the Special Civil Part mistakenly exercised its discretion by denying plaintiffs request for an adjournment to complete discovery within the 100 day period allowed by our rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">The facts are not in dispute. Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant alleging that $2,819.84 was due and owing on a book account. Defendant was served with the summons and complaint on February 21, 1995, and filed its answer consisting of a general denial on March 15, 1995. Plaintiff sent interrogatories and requests for admissions on March 25,1995. Defendant reciprocated by sending interrogatories on April 3, 1995. A settlement conference was conducted on April 3, 1995, and the trial was scheduled for April 27, 1995. On April 21, 1995, plaintiffs attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ney advised the clerk of the Special Civil Part by letter that discovery had not been completed and requested an adjournment of the trial. Although plaintiffs attorney received no response-to his letter, he did not appear on the scheduled trial date. Defendant\u2019s attorney, who was present in court, telephoned plaintiffs lawyer, who then contacted the clerk and renewed his request <em>for </em>an adjournment. The Special Civil Part judge denied plaintiffs request and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">We decide this ease in the following context. The parties were entitled to discovery as of right because the amount in controversy exceeded the monetary limit of the Small Claims Section. <em>R. </em>6:4-3(f). Pursuant to <em>R. </em>6:4-3(a), the parties had the right to serve interrogatories with the understanding that the time periods provided in <em>R. </em>4:17-2 and <em>R. </em>4:17-4 for serving and answering interrogatories are each reduced to thirty days in Special Civil Part actions. Under <em>R. </em>6:4-5, the parties were required to complete discovery within 100 days of the date of service of the original complaint. At the time plaintiff requested an adjournment, it had not yet received defendant\u2019s answers to its interrogatories. Moreover, its answers to defendant\u2019s interrogatories were not due until May 3, 1995, six days after the scheduled trial date. Further, the 100 day period for completion of discovery was to expire on June 1,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Against this backdrop, we are satisfied that the Special Civil Part mistakenly exercised its discretion when it denied plaintiffs request for an adjournment. Although <em>R. </em>6:4r-5 has never been amended, our Supreme Court has approved the practice of \u201cshort calendaring,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>scheduling trials within the 100 day period during which discovery must be completed. <em>Notice to the Bar: Special Civil Part \u201cShort Calendaring\u201d, </em>120 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>646 (1987). Nevertheless, applications for adjournments based on the need for discovery within the 100 day period \u201cshould be liberally granted.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We appreciate the desirability of expediting the disposition of civil cases. <em>See Connors v. Sexton Studios, Inc., </em>270 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>390, 395, 637 A.2d 232 (App.Div.1994); <em>Audubon Volunteer Fire Co. No. 1 v. Church Constr. Co., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 406-07, 502 A.2d 1183 (App.Div.1986). Ordinarily, the prompt resolution of civil disputes serves the parties\u2019 interests. <em>Audubon Volunteer Fire Co. No. 1 v. Church Constr. Co., </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 406-07, 502 A.2d 1183. However, swift justice demands more than the rapid disposition of cases. <em>Henderson v. Bannan, </em>256 F.2d 363, 390 (6th Cir.) (Stewart, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 <em>U.S. </em>890, 79 <em>S.Ct. </em>129, 3 L.Ed.2d 118 (1958). The prompt disposition of cases is an important value, but it is not the end in itself of judicial administration. It is only one method by which we seek to achieve the ultimate goal of our court system \u2014 the fair resolution of controversies and disputes. That is the purpose for which we as judges hold office.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We quickly add that we do not condone the conduct of plaintiffs attorney. Clearly, plaintiffs lawyer should not have relied upon his written request for an adjournment, to which he had received no response. Counsel should have appeared on the scheduled trial date to renew his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The order of dismissal is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Special Civil Part for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
