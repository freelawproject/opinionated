On August 7, 1991, he was monitoring the work of an outside contractor installing a new sewer pipe under a main street in Bay Head. This project consisted of the contractor digging a trench approximately four feet wide and four and a half feet deep and then laying sewer pipe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>in the trench. While petitioner was observing this work, a member of the Borough Engineer\u2019s office asked him to hold a rod used to measure elevations of the pipe. To perform this assignment, petitioner held the measuring device while leaning over the trench. As petitioner was standing in this position, the surface of the blacktop roadway suddenly collapsed, causing petitioner to fall straight down. Petitioner\u2019s lower back struck the pipe, resulting in disabling injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">After the Board of Trustees of the PERS (the Board) denied petitioner\u2019s application for an accidental disability pension on the ground that his accident did not constitute a \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d petitioner requested an administrative hearing. An Administrative Law Judge (AL J) found based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, which consisted solely of petitioner\u2019s own testimony, that the August 7, 1991, accident constituted a traumatic event. The Deputy Attorney General representing the Board filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision. The Board rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision and, incorporating by reference \u201cthe factual and legal discussion of the Deputy Attorney Generalas] ... exceptions letter,\u201d reaffirmed its decision denying petitioner\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>43:15A-43 provides that a member of the PERS under the age of 65 who is \u201cpermanently and totally disabled as a result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties,\u201d may retire on an accidental disability pension. The Board stipulated that petitioner is \u201ctotally and permanently disabled,\u201d that this disability is a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the August 7, 1991 accident, and that the accident occurred \u201cduring and as a result of [petitioner\u2019s performance] of his assigned duties.\u201d However, the Board denied petitioner\u2019s application on the ground that the collapse of the roadway and petitioner\u2019s resulting fall onto the metal sewer pipe did not constitute a \u201ctraumatic event.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The phrase \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d as used in statutes defining a public employee\u2019s eligibility for retirement on an accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>disability pension, refers to \u201ca mishap or accident involving the application of some kind of external force to the body or the violent exposure of the body to some external force.\u201d <em>Cattani v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 586, 355 A.2d 625 (1976). For an accident to constitute a traumatic event,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">a worker must demonstrate (1) that his injuries were not induced by the stress or strain of the normal work effort; (2) that he met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm; and (3) that the source of the injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\"><em>[Kane v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Moreover, this force or power \u201cmust originate from sources other than the injured party.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Slip and fall type accidents ordinarily do not qualify as traumatic events under these tests. <em>Maynard v. Board of Trustees of Teachers\u2019 Pension &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>169, 549 A.2d 1213 (1988); <em>Ciecwisz v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>180, 549 A.2d 1218 (1988); <em>Kane v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., supra. </em>As the Court pointed out in <em>Maynard, </em>\u201c[i]n slip-and-fall cases, no force or power originates anywhere except from the person falling.\u201d 113 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 549 A.2d 1213. The Court also recently held that a twisting type of injury that is not shown to have been the result of a \u201cgreat rush of force or uncontrollable power\u201d is not a traumatic event. <em>Mazza v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 25, 667 A.2d 1052 (1995). On the other hand, the Court held that correction guards who were assaulted by inmates \u201cclearly sustained injuries as a result of \u2018a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gable v. Board of Trustees of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>212, 222, 557 A.2d 1012 (1989). In reaching this conclusion, the Court distinguished between incidents that involve solely external causes \u2014 such as the violent acts of inmates \u2014 and those like slip and falls that result from an employee\u2019s own conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">Each incident was caused by a violent external force \u2014 the actions of an unruly inmate. This contrasts with <em>Maynard/Ciecwisz, </em>where the parties merely slipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and fell, the source of the force or power causing injury coming about as the result of their own conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We are satisfied that petitioner\u2019s accident constituted a traumatic event under the tests set forth in <em>Kane. </em>As in <em>Gable, </em>the force or power that caused the accident \u2014 the collapse of a roadway \u2014 was completely external to petitioner. And also as in <em>Gable, </em>\u201cthe source of [petitioner\u2019s injury] was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power,\u201d 115 <em>N.J. </em>at 225, 557 A.2d 1012, consisting of a sudden and unexpected fall straight down onto a metal sewer pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In contrast, the accident in <em>Mazza </em>did not involve a completely external force but rather the interaction between a mounted policeman and his horse. Furthermore, the resulting injury involved solely the twisting of the policeman\u2019s body, rather than a violent collision with an external, physical object as would have occurred if the policeman had been thrown from his horse and hit his back on a rock.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">In support of its decision, the Board relies upon <em>Barney v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>556, 570 A.2d 456 (App.Div.1990), which upheld the denial of an accidental disability pension to a fireman who lost his balance after stepping on a loose brick and then fell down five feet of stairs. We viewed the fireman\u2019s accident in <em>Barney </em>as a slip and fall that \u201cwas not appreciably different from the slip and fall of the teacher on the highly polished floor discussed in <em>Maynard.\u201d Id. </em>at 559, 570 A.2d 456. Thus, as in other slip and fall cases, the force or power that caused the accident was the fireman\u2019s act of stepping on the loose brick. Therefore, for <em>Barney </em>to be truly comparable to this case, the accident would have to have been caused by a collapse of the stairs rather than the fireman simply slipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">The Board also argues that the source of petitioner\u2019s injury was not \u201ca great rush of force or uncontrollable power\u201d because he fell \u201conly\u201d three and a half feet. However, since the lower back of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>a standing person is approximately three-and-a-half feet above the ground, and petitioner testified that his back \u201cfell straight down ... onto the pipe\u201d located three-and-a-half feet below the street, petitioner actually may have fallen as much as seven feet. In any event, all of the accidental disability pension cases that have turned on the distance of an employee\u2019s fall have involved slip and fall type accidents. <em>See, e.g., Cianciulli v. Board of Trustees, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>399, 582 A.2d 1004 (App.Div.1990); <em>Barney v. Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., supra; Quigley v. Board of Trustees of Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, 217-19, 555 A.2d 642 (App. Div.1989). Those decisions have construed the dictum in <em>Kane </em>that a fireman \u201cwho falls off the top step of a tall ladder\u201d experiences a traumatic event, 100 <em>N.J. </em>at 663, 498 A.2d 1252, as establishing an exception to the general rule excluding slip and fall type accidents from eligibility for accidental disability pensions. Consequently, those decisions have limited the scope of this exception to substantial falls that can be characterized as \u201cakin to the example in <em>Kane </em>... of the fireman who falls off the top of the ladder.\u201d <em>Cianciulli v. Board of Trustees, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Sys., supra, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 402, 582 A.2d 1004. However, when the cause of an accident is a violent external force rather than a slip and fall, we perceive no reason why the precise distance that an employee may have fallen should be decisive. We add that there is no suggestion petitioner\u2019s injury was an idiosyncratic or unexpected consequence of his accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Accordingly, the Board\u2019s final decision denying petitioner\u2019s application for an accidental disability pension is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
