Defendant had been indicted by the grand jury and charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance, heroin, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(1) (count one), and possession of a controlled dangerous substance within 1,000 feet of a school, contrary to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(1). Although the Pre-trial coordinator recommended defendant\u2019s admission, the prosecutor filed an objection. Judge Locascio articulated his reasons in a written opinion, which we approve for publication on this date. <em>State v. Wallace Baynes, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 671 A.2d 211 (Law Div.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">We conclude that the State\u2019s objection to defendant\u2019s admission into pre-trial intervention was in this case an arbitrary exercise of prosecutorial authority. Judge Locascio\u2019s decision is consistent with our recent decision in <em>State v. Fitzsimmons, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 668 A.2d 453 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
