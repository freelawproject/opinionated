Jefferson appeals from a summary judgment in favor of North Operating Company (North) determining that North was not required to indemnify Jefferson under a contractual indemnification clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Jefferson manufactures cardboard. Kennedy was the owner and operator of a tractor which he leased to North. North was in the trucking business and had entered into a written agreement to transport cardboard for Jefferson to Jefferson\u2019s customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In February 1991, Kennedy, using his tractor pulling a North trailer, was delivering a shipment of cardboard from Jefferson to Ultra Packaging (Ultra). The cardboard was on wood pallets in bundles weighing hundreds of pounds. Each pallet held two bundles of cardboard. When Kennedy arrived at Ultra, an Ultra employee, using a forklift, began to unload the palletized cardboard. The employee had removed five pallets when the bundles of cardboard on the sixth pallet fell on Kennedy, burying him and causing substantial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">Kennedy contended that the wooden pallet collapsed, causing the bundles to shift and fall. According to Kennedy, he observed rotten pieces of pallet wood after the incident. In a personal injury action which Kennedy brought against Jefferson, Kennedy alleged that Jefferson caused his injuries by negligently selecting and using defective pallets. Jefferson filed a third-party complaint against North, seeking indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">While Kennedy\u2019s personal injury action was pending, Jefferson began a separate declaratory judgment action against NJM and other carriers not involved in this appeal. NJM provided automobile liability coverage to North. Jefferson contended that it was entitled to coverage under NJM\u2019s policy because Jefferson was using North\u2019s trailer when Kennedy was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Eventually, Jefferson settled Kennedy\u2019s claim for $750,000. After Jefferson settled the Kennedy claim, NJM and North moved for summary judgment against Jefferson, and Jefferson cross-moved for summary judgment. As previously indicated, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>court granted Jefferson\u2019s motion against NJM on the ground that Jefferson was entitled to coverage because it was using North\u2019s vehicle when Kennedy was injured. The court granted North\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Jefferson on the indemnity claim because the court determined that Jefferson could not be indemnified for its own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We first address NJM\u2019s appeal. NJM contends that its policy does not cover Jefferson for Kennedy\u2019s claim because Jefferson\u2019s negligent act of selecting a defective pallet was not an integral part of the loading and unloading operation. NJM also contends that Jefferson never established the reasonableness of the $750,-000 settlement with Kennedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">An insurer\u2019s obligation to provide coverage to persons using a vehicle in a loading and unloading context is imposed by statute and is broad in scope. <em>Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc. v. Harbor Bay, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>402, 407, 575 A.2d 416 (1990). The statutes obligate motor vehicle liability insurers to provide coverage for injuries \u201carising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of\u2019 a vehicle. <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-3; <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6B-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">In the present ease, NJM\u2019s policy, which it describes as a \u201cTruckers Policy,\u201d tracks the statutory language regarding liability coverage. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">We will pay all sums the insured legally must pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an accident and resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a covered auto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">NJM does not contest the fact that North\u2019s trailer, which was being unloaded when Kennedy was injured, was a covered auto.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">NJM\u2019s policy contains the following definition of \u201cWho is insured.\u201d It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">1. You [North] are an insured for any covered auto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">2. <em>Anyone </em>else is an insured while using with your permission a <em>covered auto you </em>own, lease or borrow except:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">The exceptions are irrelevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">The issue is whether Kennedy\u2019s injury was \u201ccaused by an accident ... resulting from [Jefferson\u2019s] ... use of\u2019 North\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>trailer. If the answer is yes, then North\u2019s policy covers Jefferson for liability arising out of Kennedy\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">New Jersey courts have addressed the scope of omnibus coverage in a loading and unloading context in a number of cases. In <em>Ryder, supra, </em>the Supreme Court discussed, with approval, <em>Drew Chemical Corp. v. American Fore Loyalty Group, </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>582, 218 A.2d 875 (App.Div.1966) and <em>Bellafronte v. General Motors Corp., </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377, 376 A.2d 1294 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>533, 384 A.2d 513 (1977). <em>Drew </em>arose out of a personal injury claim by one Byford, an employee of Nappi Trucking Corp. Byford drove a tank truck to Drew Chemical Corp. (Drew) to deliver a load of fatty acid. Evans, Drew\u2019s employee, connected the tank truck to Drew\u2019s pipeline for the purpose of transferring the fatty acid to a vat. The connection was made using a flexible hose eighteen feet in length, which was part of the truck\u2019s equipment. The hose was attached to the truck and to the pipeline, but when Evans activated a pump, the acid did not flow. At Evans\u2019 request, Byford uncoupled the hose from the truck while Evans, using pressured steam, attempted to unclog the pipeline. During this operation, the free end of the hose began to whip, striking Byford.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Byford sued Evans and Drew, and Drew sought coverage under Nappi\u2019s automobile policy. The policy defined use of a vehicle as including loading and unloading. The carrier argued that it was not obligated to provide coverage because the unloading of the acid had not commenced and, alternatively, because unloading was not the efficient cause of Byford\u2019s injury. The trial judge granted summary judgment to the carrier on the second ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">This court reversed the judgment. We noted that two doctrines had evolved regarding coverage issues in loading and unloading contexts: the \u201ccoming to rest\u201d doctrine and the \u201ccomplete operation\u201d doctrine. We determined that the complete operation doctrine was \u201cthe more modern and enlightened one, supported by the weight of authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587, 218 A.2d 875. Under the complete operation doctrine, unloading \u201ccovers[s] the entire pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>cess involved in moving the goods, from the moment they are given into the insured\u2019s possession until they are turned over at the place of destination to the party to whom delivery is to be made.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 586-87,218 A.2d 875. Applying this definition, we ruled that Byford\u2019s injury occurred during unloading, though the fatty acid had not yet begun its movement from the tank truck into the pipeline. We observed that the complete operation doctrine \u201cobliterates the distinction between preparations for loading and the loading itself----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 587, 218 A.2d 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We resolved the issue of causation in favor of coverage. In doing so, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">In determining the existence of a causal connection, the proper approach is to consider whether the accident was, within reason, causally connected with the <em>complete operation of unloading </em>the Nappi truck. While the act of clearing the line was normally not a part of the unloading operation, it was, under the existing circumstances, a necessary one____ In short, the process of unloading the acid necessitated the very act (the clearing of the line) which, in turn, caused the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 591,218 A.2d 875.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\"><em>Bellafronte, supra, </em>involved a policy which, unlike the policy in <em>Drew, </em>did not define the use of a vehicle as including loading and unloading. To the contrary, the policy in question, issued by NJM, excluded as an additional insured any person loading or unloading the insured vehicle other than the named insured\u2019s employees, lessees, or borrowers. One of the issues in <em>Bellafronte, </em>therefore, was whether the word \u201cuse\u201d in New Jersey\u2019s financial responsibility statute, included the loading and unloading of a vehicle\u2019s cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The facts in <em>Bellafronte </em>were uncontested. Plaintiff was employed as a truck driver by Morrison Steel Company, a distributor of steel products. The plaintiff had delivered a load of steel to General Motors Corporation (GMC). One of GMC\u2019s employees began unloading the steel using GMC\u2019s crane. The crane\u2019s magnet attracted a steel beam which was still on the truck, causing the beam to move, striking and injuring the plaintiff. In plaintiffs suit against GMC, defendant sought coverage from NJM, Morrison\u2019s automobile liability carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Under the exclusion for loading or unloading in NJM\u2019s policy, GMC and its employees would not be covered. We held, however, that the word \u201cuse\u201d in the statutory omnibus coverage included the loading and unloading of a vehicle and, therefore, NJM\u2019s attempted exclusion was invalid. <em>Bellafronte, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382-83, 376 A.2d 1294. We also held that the injury to plaintiff arose out of the use of the vehicle because \u201cone who is in the process of unloading cargo from the vehicle is, for purposes of the omnibus coverage, a user of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\"><em>Parkway Iron and Metal Co. v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>386, 629 A.2d 1352 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>302, 639 A.2d 301 (1994), involved an attempt by NJM to avoid our <em>Bellafronte </em>decision. The case arose out of an injury allegedly caused by a crane operated by the consignee\u2019s employee for the purpose of unloading a truck. NJM\u2019s policy insuring the truck for motor vehicle liability contained an exclusion which provided that its insurance did not apply to injury \u201cresulting from the movement of property by a mechanical device ... not attached to the covered auto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 376 A.2d 1294. We held that the exclusion was invalid because it limited the statutorily required omnibus coverage for use of a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In the present case, as previously indicated, NJM\u2019s position is sharply focused. NJM contends in its brief that it is not obligated to provide coverage to Jefferson because \u201cJefferson\u2019s negligent selection of a defective pallet was the proximate cause of Kennedy\u2019s injuries and this was not an integral part of the overall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>loading and unloading operation. Because Jefferson Smurfit was not using the North trailer when it selected the <em>defective </em>pallet, it does not qualify as an omnibus insured under the NJM policy.\u201d In advancing this argument, NJM relies on <em>Cenno v. West Virginia Paper &amp; Pulp Co., </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 262 A.2d 223 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>99, 265 A.2d 149 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><em>Cenno </em>involved an injury to plaintiff truck driver while he was delivering a load of baled cardboard manufactured by defendant, West Virginia Paper &amp; Pulp Co. (Pulp). Pulp had baled the cardboard at its Hoboken plant, utilizing metal baling bands manufactured by Acme Steel Company. When plaintiff arrived at the consignee\u2019s plant, he attempted to move one of the bales within the truck. In doing so, plaintiff pulled on a metal band securing the bale. The band came apart and, as a result, plaintiff lost his balance and fell out of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Plaintiff sued Pulp and Acme Steel. Plaintiff contended that Acme Steel was responsible because it had defectively manufactured the bands. Plaintiff also contended that Pulp had negligently banded the bale, resulting in his injury. A jury determined that Pulp had been negligent, but returned a verdict of no cause for action in favor of Acme Steel. Based on this verdict, the trial court ruled that Pulp and Acme were additional insureds under a motor vehicle liability policy issued by American Mutual Liability Insurance Company (American) insuring the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">American\u2019s policywas written before our decision in <em>Bellafronte, supra. </em>It contained a definition of \u201cuse\u201d as including the loading and unloading of the insured vehicle. A panel of this court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. We noted that the jury determined that the accident was the result of Pulp\u2019s negligent banding of the cardboard. We concluded, therefore, that \u201cthe acts charged to defendants antedated delivery of the goods to Ahrens Motor Trucking, were unrelated to the loading or unloading of the truck, and were not covered by the comprehensive liability policy. The policy does not embrace all accidents happening during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>loading or unloading of the truck regardless of causation.\u201d <em>Cenno, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 45, 262 A.2d 223. We further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">The policy affords coverage as an additional insured to one while <em>using </em>the vehicle and specifies that \u2018(c) use of an automobile includes the loading and unloading thereof.\u2019 Therefore, the pertinent inquiry is whether the acts of negligence charged to defendants were a part of the overall loading or unloading operation so that, in the commission of the negligent acts charged, defendants can be said to have been using the vehicle and thereby became additional insureds under the policy. In other words, did the negligent act which caused the injury or is alleged to have caused it constitute a part of the loading or unloading process? The answer is clearly in the negative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\n<em>[Ibid]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The court summarized its holding, utilizing the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">In summary, we conclude that unless the alleged negligent act which is alleged to have caused the accident was an integral part of the overall loading or unloading operation, so that the mishap is causally connected with such loading and unloading and did not merely occur during it, the person charged with the negligent act is not considered to have been using the vehicle so as to be covered by the vehicle\u2019s liability policy for such act as an additional assured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 47, 262 A.2d 223.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">We are persuaded that the present case differs from <em>Cenno </em>in at least two important respects. In <em>Cenno </em>the court interpreted a <em>policy </em>provision defining \u201cuse\u201d as including loading and unloading. This court decided <em>Cenno </em>before our opinion in <em>Bellafronte. </em>In <em>Bellafronte, </em>as previously stated, we determined that the word \u201cuse\u201d in the statutorily required coverage included loading and unloading. In applying the statutory language, we also concluded in <em>Bellafronte, </em>that \u201cone who is in the process of unloading cargo from the vehicle is, for purposes of omnibus coverage, a user of the vehicle.\u201d 151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 382-83, 376 A.2d 1294. In <em>Bellafronte, </em>we applied the statutory meaning of \u201cuse\u201d to include within the umbrella of coverage a consignee\u2019s employee who is operating a crane, not connected with the insured vehicle, to unload steel. We perceive a qualitative difference between a case such as <em>Cenno, </em>in which the court construed policy language as an exercise in contract interpretation, <em>see Maryland Casualty Co. v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>48 <em>N.J.Super. </em>314, 321, 137 A.2d 577 (App.Div.) (holding that a clause in a policy defining use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>vehicle as including loading and unloading \u201cis a phrase of extension, expanding the term \u201cwhile using the automobile.\u2019 \u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>28 <em>N.J. </em>17, 145 A.2d 15 (1958), and cases such as <em>Bellafronte </em>and the present ease, in which we must determine the scope of compulsory coverage mandated by statute. <em>See Ryder, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>402, 575 A.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The other respect in which the present case differs from <em>Cenno </em>is factual. In the present case, the palletizing of the cardboard bundles and, therefore, selection of the pallets, were \u201cpreparatory actions\u201d to shipment of the goods. <em>Cenno, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. at </em>47, 262 A.2d 223. The use of pallets is a time-tested and common technique to facilitate the movement and shipment of goods. We conclude, therefore, that the use and selection of the pallets was \u201can integral part of the overall loading or unloading operation____\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It is not clear in <em>Cenno, </em>however, whether baling with metal bands was a requirement of Pulp\u2019s customer or was the typical method of shipment utilized by Pulp in the 1960\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Finally, to the extent that the differences between the present case and <em>Cenno </em>are not legally significant, we disagree with <em>Cenno. </em>In <em>Cenno, </em>as in the present case, manufacturers of goods were using a trucking company\u2019s trailers to transport goods. In both cases, devices used to facilitate loading, shipping and unloading failed, causing injury. The court in <em>Cenno </em>avoided coverage on the ground that Pulp\u2019s culpable act occurred outside the loading process. We are persuaded that the line drawn in <em>Cenno </em>is unworkable and would tend to narrow unduly the broad scope to be given omnibus coverage. <em>See Ryder, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 407, 575 A.2d 416. We so conclude because the argument could be made in <em>many </em>loading and unloading contexts that the culpable act of the shipper or consignee occurred prior to and outside the loading and unloading process, though the injury occurred during that process. For example, in <em>Bellafronte, </em>there would have been no coverage under <em>Cenno </em>if GMC\u2019s culpable act was in failing to adequately train the crane operator or in selecting a crane inap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>propriate for the unloading of steel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">NJM\u2019s reliance on <em>Lesniakowski v. Amerada Hess Corp., </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>416, 542 A.2d 940 (App.Div.1988); <em>Forsythe v. Teledyne Turner Tube, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 508 A.2d 1156 (App.Div. 1986); and <em>Wakefern Food. Corp. v. General Accident Group, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>77, 455 A.2d 1160 (App.Div.1983) is misplaced because they are distinguishable from the present ease. In <em>Lesniakowski, </em>we denied coverage to Amerada Hess on the ground that Amerada was not using the insured vehicle when plaintiff was injured. <em>Forsythe </em>involved an injury caused by a defective loading dock plate and <em>Wakefem </em>involved an injury caused when plaintiff tripped over debris on the pavement adjacent to a loading dock. In those cases we denied coverage under automobile liability policies because we concluded that the injured plaintiffs had asserted causes of action based on premises liability. In <em>Forsythe, </em>Judge Petrella defined the distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">We are unable to discern how negligence of the owner of premises in the inspection, maintenance and repair of its own loading dock, resulting in collapse of the docking plate upon a trucker engaged in attempting to prepare to unload, can reasonably be viewed as negligent use of the truck, triggering insurance coverage under the vehicle\u2019s policy. <em>See Wakefern Food Corp. v. General Ace. Group, supra </em>(188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 84) <em>[455 </em>A.2d 1160]. We distinguish between cases where there is negligence in the actual loading and unloading operation, such as by an employee of a warehouse in loading a truck, and those cases where the negligence is not directly related to the loading and unloading, but the accident occurs during the loading and unloading process, such as where there is a dangerous condition on the premises of the warehouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\"><em>[Forsythe, supra, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 616, 508 A.2d 1156.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The present ease involves an allegation of negligence in loading the truck using a defective pallet. We conclude that NJM\u2019s policy covers Jefferson for Kennedy\u2019s injury, because the injury was \u201ccausally connected with the complete operation of\u2019 loading and unloading North\u2019s truck. <em>Drew, supra, </em>90 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 591, 218 A.2d 875. We remand for a hearing to determine the reasonableness and good faith of Jefferson\u2019s settlement with Kennedy. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Griggs v. Bertram, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>347, 364, 443 A.2d 163 (1982); <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Security Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>63, 73, 367 A.2d 864 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">In light of our determination that NJM must cover Jefferson for Kennedy\u2019s injury, we deem Jefferson\u2019s appeal from the judgment in favor of North on Jefferson\u2019s indemnity claim to be moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The judgment in favor of Jefferson against NJM is affirmed. Jefferson\u2019s appeal from the judgment in favor of North is dismissed as moot.
