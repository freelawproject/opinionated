Hence, they were not parties entitled to seek judicial review under the provisions of Oregon Laws 1979, chapter 772, section 6a(l) and (2). Case CA 19690 is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The sole issue presented in case number 19892 is whether the facts found by LUBA are sufficient as a matter of law to support the determination that respondents had standing before LUBA, under Oregon Laws 1979, chapter 772, section 4(3)(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to contest Marion County\u2019s conceptual approval of a rural subdivision development. Merrill and Boatwright Engineering, Inc., planned a subdivision (\"Country View Estates\u201d), calling for division of 235 acres into 11 parcels: a 97-acre farm and ten smaller rural homesites. The subdivision was opposed at the county hearings by respondent neighbors, who resided on a hillside facing the development. After the county affirmed the conceptual approval granted by the planning commission, respondents petitioned for review by LUBA. Petitioners filed an \"Objection of Insufficient Standing and Motion for Evidentiary Hearing,\u201d and LUBA held three days of hearings on the subject of respondents\u2019 standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">In its order of October 20, 1979, upholding respondents\u2019 standing, LUBA found that respondents could see at least three of the proposed lots from their properties and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>would be able to hear noise from everyday human activity on the proposed subdivision. LUBA found a strong likelihood that the development as proposed would alter the scenic value of the land. LUBA also found that the development would increase by one-third the traffic on a road of substandard width that abutted respondents\u2019 property, resulting in an increase of danger in respondents\u2019 use of the road for walking and bike riding. We are bound by those findings of fact supported by substantial evidence. Or Laws 1979, ch 772, \u00a7 6a(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">LUBA\u2019s findings are sufficient to establish that respondents are persons \"whose interests are adversely affected or who * * * [are] aggrieved by the decision.\u201d Or Laws 1979, ch 772, \u00a74(3)(b), n 1, <em>supra.
