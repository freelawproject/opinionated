The sole issue presented on appeal is whether the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing to allow testimony of defendant\u2019s girlfriend as a penalty for the defense attorney\u2019s violation of the discovery statute. ORS 135.835.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Defendant makes two main contentions, first, that no sanction was permissible since defense counsel\u2019s misconduct caused the state no prejudice; and second, that this ruling violated his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The essential facts are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">After the state had rested its case-in-chief, defense counsel informed the court that in addition to calling defendant, he intended- to call defendant\u2019s father and defendant\u2019s girlfriend as witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prosecutor objected on the ground that defendant had not complied with ORS 135.835 by providing the prosecutor with the names and addresses of those witnesses. Defense counsel does not contest the fact that he failed without good cause to comply with the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial demand for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">In an attempt to remedy the problem created by the misconduct of defense counsel, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">\"THE COURT: Mr. Schneider, I\u2019m trying to devise a procedure whereby this witness might be allowed to testify. You have already acknowledged that you violated the discovery laws concerning the nondisclosure of this witness. Now, I\u2019m trying to get enough cooperation out of you, if you\u2019re interested in giving it to allow you to call that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>witness. Now, I will let you know plainly, sir, at this point, which is twenty til twelve, that we have nearly two hours between now and when we take up with your evidence, if you have any in this case. We will take up again with the matter of your violation of the discovery statute at 1:30. At that time I will, I will make inquire <em>[sic] </em>of the state\u2019s attorney as to what attempts she has made to avoid any surprise and prejudice that\u2019s been created by your, I think you called it, nonfeasance, and then we\u2019ll take up the questions of whether or not you\u2019ll be allowed to call that or any other witness that you have not disclosed to the state\u2019s attorney in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">After the noon recess the prosecutor advised the court that she had been unable to interview defendant\u2019s girlfriend or defendant\u2019s father because defense counsel had instructed both of them not to talk to the prosecutor. After argument about whether the witnesses could testify, the court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">\"The court will accordingly rule that not only has there been a violation of the discovery statutes with respect to calling of the two witnesses but that the only reasonable course the court can take in view of the situation including conduct of counsel will be to direct counsel not to call them as witnesses. I further advise you * * * not to refer in any fashion to them by name or in any other way during the balance of this trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Defendant\u2019s request to make an offer of proof was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">ORS 135.865<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> gives a trial judge broad discretion in the choice of sanctions which may be imposed in the event of the failure of a party to comply with the discovery provisions of ORS 135.805 <em>et seq. </em>In <em>State v. King, </em>30 Or App 223, 566 P2d 1204 (1977), <em>rev den </em>281 Or 1 (1978), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">\"[The] legislative history [of ORS 135.865] indicates that the various draftsmen intended: (1) trial courts would have discretion and could use ingenuity to fashion remedies for violation of the discovery statutes, subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>appellate court supervision; (2) that the extent of prejudice caused by nondisclosure would be relevant to the formulation of a remedy; (3) generally, an order to disclose and a reasonable continuance would be the most appropriate remedy in the majority of situations; and (4) that the sanction of ruling nondisclosed evidence excluded from the trial should be used only in the most extreme situations.\u201d 30 Or App at 228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We then held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\"* * * [N]o sanction for violation of the discovery statutes is warranted when the violation causes no prejudice in the preparation of the case for trial. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\"* * * [A] party aggrieved by a violation of the criminal discovery statutes who establishes substantial prejudice to the preparation of his case for trial is entitled to some remedy for the other party\u2019s breach of statutory duty. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\"* * * [T]he selection of a sanction to be imposed upon the offending party is limited by the guidelines noted above. * * *\u201d 30 Or App at 230.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">It is undisputed that defendant\u2019s attorney failed to furnish the names and addresses of witnesses in advance of trial as required by ORS 135.835. Further, it appears that in the course of trial and during a recess the defense attorney ordered defendant\u2019s girlfriend and his father not to talk to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">ORS 135.865 specifically authorizes the trial judge under these circumstances to refuse to receive in evidence the material not disclosed. In <em>State v. Wolfe, </em>273 Or 518, 524, 542 P2d 482 (1975). Our Supreme Court said, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\"We agree with the Court of Appeals in its opinion in this case to the effect that its previous opinion in <em>Curtis </em>does not impose a requirement that a party to a criminal case may not object to the calling against him of a witness whose name has not been previously disclosed by the other party unless he can show that he would be prejudiced by the calling of that witness. Neither does <em>Curtis </em>require the trial court to make a finding of prejudice in such a case as a condition of sustaining an objection to the testimony of such a witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-12\">The girlfriend was in effect a surprise witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Wolfe </em>provides us with direct guidance here. In <em>Wolfe, </em>as in the case at bar, defendant had failed to give the State notice that he intended to call two defense witnesses. As a penalty for these violations of the discovery statute the trial court refused to allow either to testify at the trial. The Supreme Court affirmed on two separate grounds: As to the first witness, the court held that in the absence of an offer of proof, any error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit the testimony was not a cognizable issue on appeal. As to the second witness, who was offered to impeach one of the State\u2019s witnesses on a collateral point, the court held that the exclusion of this witness\u2019 testimony as a penalty for violating the discovery statute was not reversible error where (a) defendant knew of the additional information to be supplied by the witness on the day before she was called, and (b) the offered testimony would not have been admissible anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">We find the case at bar to be an eminently proper case for the imposition of the sanction imposed by the trial judge. Defendant\u2019s counsel admitted that he violated the discovery statute. The trial judge tried to give the defense an opportunity to rectify the situation so that defendant could still call his witnesses. This was by allowing the prosecution to talk to the witnesses during the recess. Instead of cooperating in the salvage effort suggested by the court, defense counsel ordered the two witnesses not to talk to the deputy district attorney. This was impermissible. <em>See State v. York, </em>291 Or 535, 632 P2d 1261 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Because of defense counsel\u2019s own actions in blocking any form of discovery and frustrating the efforts by the court to rescue the defense from its own predicament, defendant is in no position to complain on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>U.S. v. Nobles, </em>422 US 225, 241, 95 S Ct 2160, 45 L Ed 2d 141 (1975), rejected the compulsory process argument by defendant where a trial court excluded testimony of a witness after defendant failed to meet discovery obligations. <em>See also Wardius v. Oregon, </em>412 US 470, 474, 93 S Ct 2208, 37 L Ed 2d 82 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>We need not consider whether it was error to deny defendant\u2019s offer of proof as to the proposed testimony of defendant\u2019s girlfriend since defendant does, not assign this as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Summarizing, we hold that under the facts presented the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant\u2019s girlfriend to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b370-10\"> ORS 135.835 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">\"* * * [T]he defendant shall disclose to the district attorney * * *:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\">\"(1) The names and addresses of persons, * * * whom he intends to call as witnesses at the trial, * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-13\">\u00ab* * * *</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-14\"> Defendant proposed to call two witnesses, Miss Cansler, defendant\u2019s girlfriend, and defendant\u2019s father.

The trial court ruled that one of those witnesses could not testify. Defendant was convicted. On appeal he contends the trial court erred, because (1) no sanction was permissible since defense counsel\u2019s misconduct caused the state no prejudice, and (2) this ruling violated his Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The majority holds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the witness to testify and that the defendant has no basis to complain about deprivations of his constitutional rights. I respectfully dissent and would hold that the trial court committed reversible error because: (1) the trial court made no findings concerning any prejudicial effect upon the state\u2019s case, (2) the record does not support the imposition of the particular sanction, and (3) the trial court denied the defendant an opportunity to make an offer of proof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Defense counsel was guilty of misconduct. First, he violated the clear mandate of ORS 135.835. Second, he improperly interfered with the legitimate efforts of the prosecutor to interview prospective witnesses by instructing them not to talk to the prosecutor or by telling them that they did not have to talk to the prosecutor and that it was his wish that they do not. <em>See State v, York, </em>291 Or 535, 632 P2d 1261 (1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Having recognized the misconduct of defense counsel, our inquiry turns to appropriate sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Insofar as the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery statutes is concerned, the appropriate inquiry is: what would the prosecutor have done differently to prepare for trial had the defense disclosed before trial its intent to call Miss Cansler as a witness? <em>State v. King, </em>30 Or App 223, 229, 566 P2d 1204 (1977), <em>rev den </em>281 Or 1 (1978). The record contains no answer to that question, because the trial court made no findings concerning any prejudicial effect upon the preparation of the state\u2019s case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number><em>State v. Johns, </em>44 Or App 421, 427, 606 P2d 640, <em>rev den </em>289 Or 1 (1980). My review of the record satisfies me that the prejudicial effect, if any, was minimal. The defense attorney had outlined his theory of the case in his opening statement. He proposed to call Miss Cansler to corroborate the defendant\u2019s testimony. There is nothing in the record from which I can deduce that the state\u2019s case would have been prepared differently had Miss Cansler\u2019s name and address been provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Next I consider the defense counsel\u2019s misconduct in instructing his witnesses not to talk to the prosecutor. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the prosecutor took appropriate action to overcome the obstacle sought to be imposed by the defense counsel, a point upon which reasonable persons might disagree, the trial court again failed to make any findings concerning any prejudicial effect upon the presentation of the state\u2019s case at trial resulting from defense counsel\u2019s misconduct. I find the record devoid of any evidence that defense counsel\u2019s misconduct had any prejudicial effect upon the ability of the prosecutor to prosecute the case successfully. <em>State v. York, supra; State v. King, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Similarly, the trial court failed to demonstrate on the record that the sanction of refusing to permit the witness to testify was warranted. In <em>State v. King, supra, </em>we said the sanction of ruling nondisclosed evidence excluded from the trial should be used only in the most extreme situations. 30 Or App at 228. Many alternative remedies and sanctions are available to a trial court confronted with misconduct by trial counsel. <em>King </em>simply requires, before a trial court orders nondisclosed evidence be excluded from the trial, that the court make a record showing other alternatives have been considered and rejected for sound reasons. No such showing has been made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">In summary, while I recognize that the defense attorney was guilty of misconduct for failing to comply with ORS 135.835 and for telling witnesses not to talk to the prosecutor, I nevertheless conclude that the imposition of the sanction was reversible error because the record does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>not support a finding that the state was prejudiced and because the trial court failed to demonstrate the necessity for the sanction imposed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I also would hold that the trial court committed reversible error when it denied the defendant an opportunity to make an offer of proof on the excluded evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"Aa3\">Joseph, C.J., joins in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> Art 1, \u00a7 11 of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution provide that an accused has the right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.

Texas, </em>388 US 14, 87 S Ct 1920, 18 L Ed 2d 1019 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Because I would reverse on other grounds, it is unnecessary for me to consider whether refusing to permit a defense witness to testify because the defense has failed to comply with discovery statutes is a violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to compulsory process, a question never directly answered by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See State v.

Furthermore, <em>Nobles </em>and <em>Wardius </em>are distinguishable on their facts. In <em>Nobles </em>the defense refused to produce a copy of an investigator\u2019s report which the defense had used during cross-examination of the government\u2019s witnesses. After the government had completed its case, the defense called the investigator as a witness. The trial court ruled that if the investigator testified, his written report must be provided to the prosecutor for purposes of cross-examination. When the defense refused to produce the report, the trial court ruled the investigator could not testify. The United States Supreme Court ruled that the trial court\u2019s preclusion sanction was an entirely proper method of assuring compliance with the trial court\u2019s order to produce. In <em>Wardius </em>the United States Supreme Court ruled that due process mandates that enforcement of a statute requiring a defendant to give pretrial notice of an alibi defense requires reciprocal discovery rights be given to the defendant, <em>i.e., </em>discovery must be a two-way street.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b375-5\"> While the defendant did not assign as error the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit an offer of proof, this court may take notice of errors of law apparent on the face of the record.

It is clear, however, that the trial court made no findings that the state was prejudiced in the preparation of its case for trial or in presenting its case at trial.

In footnote 3 of its <em>Wolfe </em>opinion, the Supreme Court cited the legislative history we have quoted extensively above. We therefore infer the court was aware of the draftsmen\u2019s intent that: (1) the extent of prejudice was relevant to the selection of sanctions for breach of discovery duties; and (2) the imposition of sanction was to be subject to appellate supervision. Aware of this history, we cannot believe the Supreme Court intended to hold that the trial courts\u2019 discretion was so broad as to allow imposition of no sanction for a highly prejudical violation of the discovery statutes or so broad as to allow imposition of an extreme sanction for a technical, nonprejudicial violation of the discovery statutes.

King </em>and its progeny, <em>sub silentio. See State v. Dyson, </em>52 Or App 833, 629 P2d 887 (1981); <em>State v. Sarratt, </em>52 Or App 443, 628 P2d 752 (1981); <em>State v.

Dyson, </em>52 Or App 833, 836, 629 P2d 887 (1981). In addition, willful misconduct may subject any lawyer to professional discipline.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
