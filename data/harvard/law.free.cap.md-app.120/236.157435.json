Tall, as parent and next friend of William L. Tall, Jr. (\u201cRoy\u201d), appellant, sued the Board of School Commissioners of Baltimore City (the \u201cBoard\u201d), appel-lee, and Robert Manning<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for negligence (Count I), assault (Count II), battery (Count III), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count IV), and violations of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (Count V). Appellee filed a motion to dismiss and, following a hearing, the court granted the motion. After the court granted appellant\u2019s motion for final judgment, Tall noted his timely appeal. He presents one question for our review, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">Did the trial court err in granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Appellant\u2019s son, Roy, suffers from Down\u2019s syndrome. During the summer of 1995, when Roy was nine years old, he participated in a special educational program at School No. 304, Harbor View Elementary, sponsored by the Board. During the course of the program, Manning, who was an employee of the Board, served as Roy\u2019s teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">While at school on July 18, 1995, Roy urinated in his pants. Manning responded by physically disciplining Roy; this included beating the child on his arms and legs with a ruler. When Roy arrived home that day, Gwyneth Tall, his mother, noticed that he was wearing a long-sleeved shirt and long <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>pants, which were different than the clothes he had worn to school that morning. As she helped Roy change his clothes, Ms. Tall discovered raised welts and bruises on her son\u2019s arms and legs. Consequently, she took Roy to the emergency room at Harbor Hospital Center, where Roy was x-rayed and treated for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Later that same day, the Tails reported the injuries to the Baltimore City Police, at the Southern District. An investigation of the matter culminated in criminal charges against Manning for child abuse, assault, and battery. Subsequently, Manning pled guilty to assault, for which he received a five year suspended sentence and five years of supervised probation. He was also ordered not to engage in any activity as a teacher or supervisor of any individual under the age of twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">On January 31, 1997, appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss First Amended Complaint. Attached to the motion was a copy of Maryland Code (1978, 1992 Repl.Vol., 1996 Supp.), \u00a7 7-305 of the Education Article (\u201cE.A.\u201d). Section 7-305(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-7\">(a) <em>Corporal punishment prohibited. </em>-Notwithstanding any bylaw, rule, or regulation made or approved by the State Board, a principal, vice-principal, or other employee may not administer corporal punishment to discipline a student in a public school in the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Appellee also attached to the motion a copy of the \u201cRULES OF THE BOARD OF SCHOOL COMMISSIONERS OF BALTIMORE CITY\u201d (the \u201clocal rules\u201d). Section 506.04 of the local rules provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">506.04-Corporal Punishment Prohibited</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcC\">The schools shall be governed without corporal punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Additionally, appellee appended a document entitled <em>\u201cInformational Guide for Parents and Students, Fall 1996 </em>\u201d (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201cSupplement\u201d), which contained a section entitled \u201cCorporal Punishment.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-4\">Corporal punishment usually happens when a teacher, principal, or other school employee hits students as a way of disciplining them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-5\">Corporal punishment is any deliberate striking, paddling, application of an object or body part against the body of a student, or any other physical punishment used as a corrective or retaliatory measure against a student.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-6\">In the Baltimore City Public Schools, corporal punishment is forbidden <em>(Rules of the Board of School Commissioners, 506. </em>(U).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">There are circumstances and/or conditions under which [Baltimore City Public School] employees are permitted to touch students appropriately. Maintaining a safe and orderly school environment, administering first aid, and attending to health needs are categories of these circumstances and/or conditions where touching students is permitted. Typical examples of these circumstances are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-8\">\u2022 Intervening in fights</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-9\">\u2022 Preventing accidental injury</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-10\">\u2022 Protecting oneself</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-11\">\u2022 Providing appropriate care to disabled students</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-12\">\u2022 Moving through a crowd to address an emergency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-13\">\u2022 Employing passive restraint with students with emotional disabilities</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">(Italics in original; boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Thereafter, the circuit court (Dancy, J.) conducted a hearing on the Board\u2019s motion to dismiss and, by order dated February 18, 1997, granted appellee\u2019s motion. Judge Dancy hand-wrote the following on the Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-16\">The Complaint fails to state a cause of action as the conduct of the Board\u2019s employee complained of is malicious and intentional and is outside the scope of his employment and not in furtherance of the Board\u2019s business of educating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>students. This is particularly so as this employee was a teacher specifically instructed not to use corporal punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Manning subsequently filed his answer to the amended complaint. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b), the court granted appellant\u2019s motion for final judgment with respect to the disposition of the claims asserted against appellee.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">We will include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether the trial court properly directed the entry of a final judgment. Absent a proper final order, of course, we have no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, because the court\u2019s ruling did not dispose of the case as to both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">In a case involving multiple parties, Maryland Rule 2-602(b) permits a court to enter final judgment as to a particular party so long as \u201cthe court expressly determines in a written order that there is no just reason for delay.\u201d Here, appellant filed a motion pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602(b) stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was no just reason for delay with respect to the claims against the Board. The court\u2019s written order granting appellant\u2019s \u201cMotion For Final Judgment\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-10\">Upon consideration of [appellant\u2019s] Motion for Final Judgment, any responses and replies filed thereto, it is ... ORDERED:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-11\">1. That [appellant\u2019s] Motion for a Final Judgment is GRANTED;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-12\">2. That Final Judgment is entered with regard to Defendant Board of School Commissioners of Baltimore City as it relates to the Court\u2019s Order dated February 18, 1997 dismissing [appellant\u2019s] claim against [the Board] for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>It is clear that the court failed to comply with Rule 2-602(b), because it did not make an express determination in the written order that there was \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d Consequently, the court\u2019s order granting final judgment was ineffective, and there is no final appealable judgment in favor of the Board. <em>Waters v. USF &amp; G, </em>328 Md. 700, 707-09, 616 A.2d 884 (1992); <em>see Gindes v. Khan, </em>346 Md. 143, 150-51, 695 A.2d 163 (1997). This flaw does not necessarily conclude the matter, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">Maryland Rule 8-602(e)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-5\">If the appellate court determines that the order from which the appeal is taken was not a final judgment when the notice of appeal was filed but that the lower court had discretion to direct the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-602(b), the appellate court may, as it finds appropriate, (A) dismiss the appeal, (B) remand the case for the lower court to decide whether to direct the entry of a final judgment, (C) <em>enter a final judgment on its own initiative </em>or (D) if a final judgment was entered by the lower court after the notice of appeal was filed, treat the notice of appeal as if filed on the same day as, but after, the entry of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">To be sure, certification under Rule 2-602(b) \u201cshould be used sparingly so that piecemeal appeals and duplication of efforts and costs in cases involving multiple claims or multiple parties may be avoided.\u201d <em>Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Smith, </em>333 Md. 3, 7, 633 A.2d 855 (1993); <em>see Huber v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>347 Md. 415, 423, 701 A.2d 415 (1997). Nevertheless, the trial court certainly had discretion to enter a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-602(b). Moreover, the court clearly intended to do so, and \u201cwould have accomplished such purpose if it had made the requisite written determination\u201d that there was no just reason for delay. <em>Waters, </em>328 Md. at 709, 616 A.2d 884. Accordingly, pursuant to Md. Rule 8-602(e)(l)(C), we shall, in the exercise of our discretion, \u201center a final judgment on our own initiative, treat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the notice of appeal as properly filed, and proceed with the case.\u201d <em>Waters, </em>328 Md. at 709-10, 616 A.2d 884; <em>see Shofer v. Hack Co., </em>324 Md. 92, 98, 595 A.2d 1078 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1096, 112 S.Ct. 1174, 117 L.Ed.2d 419 (1992); <em>Kamin-A-Kalaw v. Dulic, </em>322 Md. 49, 54, 585 A.2d 216 (1991); <em>Quartertime Video v. Hanna, </em>321 Md. 59, 63 n. 4, 580 A.2d 1073 (1990); <em>Seat Pleasant Baptist Church Bd. of Trustees v. Long, </em>114 Md.App. 660, 674, 691 A.2d 721 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">We next address appellant\u2019s contention that the circuit court improperly considered the local rules and the Supplement that appellee appended as an exhibit to its motion to dismiss. Appellant asserts that the court should not have considered the local rules and the Supplement because they were not supported by affidavit. Appellant\u2019s claim is not preserved. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">A party must lay the proper foundation for a document that is attached to a motion. <em>See Diffendal v. Kash and Karry Serv. Corp., </em>74 Md.App. 170, 181, 536 A.2d 1175 (1988). In their treatise, Niemeyer and Schuett explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">A document can be made part of the motion only through affidavit, deposition, or answers to interrogatories that adequately lay the proper foundation for the document\u2019s admission into evidence. Authenticity and relevancy of the document must be shown. Attaching documents to a motion for summary judgment without the necessary affidavit is no more acceptable than standing up in open court and attempting to offer the same documents into evidence without a witness or a stipulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Paul V. Niemeyer <em>&amp; </em>Linda M. Schuett, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary </em>332 (2d ed.1992); see <em>Moura v. Randall, </em>119 Md.App. 632, 641-42, 705 A.2d 334 (1998); see <em>also Hartford Accident and Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs. Ltd., </em>109 Md.App. 217, 264, 674 A.2d 106 (1996) (stating that \u201ca docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ment, otherwise admissible, may be used to show the existence of a factual dispute\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">Appellant complains that appellee failed to include an affidavit to support the documents. He asserts in his brief that he \u201cobjected to the court\u2019s consideration of the rules in his Memorandum in Opposition to Appellee\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.\u201d Our review of the record indicates, however, that appellant filed an opposition only in connection with appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the <em>original </em>complaint; he never filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss the <em>amended </em>complaint. Moreover, in that opposition, he focused on the fact that appellee failed to attach the local rules and the Supplement, and that those documents were unsupported by affidavit. Thereafter, when appellee filed its motion to dismiss the amended complaint, it attached the local rules and the Supplement.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">As noted, despite his original opposition, appellant then failed to file an opposition to the motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Moreover, at the hearing, appellant seems to have acquiesced to the court\u2019s apparent consideration of the local rules and the Supplement, because he failed to challenge the attachments. Nor did he dispute either the relevancy or the authenticity of the documents. Given appellant\u2019s failure to renew his objection \u201cto the lack of the prerequisite foundation, the objection is waived.\u201d Niemeyer <em>&amp; </em>Schuett, <em>supra, </em>at 332; <em>see </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a); <em>see also Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Medical Ctr., </em>313 Md. 301, 332, 545 A.2d 658 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">We must next resolve whether the court\u2019s consideration of appellee\u2019s attachments altered the character of the motion. When, as here, a court considers extrinsic material in connection with a motion to dismiss, the motion to dismiss is ordinarily transformed into a motion for summary judgment. <em>Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hosp. Ctr., Inc., </em>93 Md.App. 772, 783, 614 A.2d 1021 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>330 Md. 319, 624 A.2d 490 (1993); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-322; <em>Pope v. Board of Sch. Comm\u2019rs, </em>106 Md.App. 578, 590, 665 A.2d 713 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 116, 673 A.2d 707 (1996); Niemeyer &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Schuett, <em>supra, </em>at 333. In considering appellee\u2019s attachments, we are satisfied that the court \u201ctransmuted appellee[\u2019s] motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Hrehorovich, </em>93 Md.App. at 783, 614 A.2d 1021. Therefore, we shall review the matter accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Maryland Rule 2-501, which governs summary judgment, contemplates a two-level inquiry; it requires that, in order to grant summary judgment, the trial court must determine that no genuine dispute exists as to any material fact, and that one party is entitled to judgment as matter of law. <em>Bagwell v. Peninsula Regional Medical Ctr., </em>106 Md.App. 470, 488, 665 A.2d 297 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 172, 669 A.2d 1360 (1996); <em>see also Southland Corp. v. Griffith, </em>332 Md. 704, 712, 633 A.2d 84 (1993); <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Sachs v. Regal Savings Bank, FSB, </em>119 Md.App. 276, 277-78, 705 A.2d 1 (1998); <em>Bits \u201cN\u201d Bytes Computer Supplies, Inc. v. Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Tel. Co., </em>97 Md.App. 557, 580-81, 631 A.2d 485 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>333 Md. 385, 635 A.2d 425 (1994); <em>Seaboard Sur. Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 242-45, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992). In its review of the motion, the court must consider the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, <em>Dobbins v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Com\u2019n, </em>338 Md. 341, 345, 658 A.2d 675 (1995); <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 110-11, 492 A.2d 608 (1985), and construe all inferences reasonably drawn from those facts in favor of the non-movant. <em>Tennant v. Shoppers Food Warehouse Md. Corp., </em>115 Md.App. 381, 387, 693 A.2d 370 (1997); <em>Bagwell, </em>106 Md.App. at 488, 665 A.2d 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">To defeat a motion for summary judgment, the non-moving party must establish that a genuine dispute exists as to a material fact. <em>Moura, </em>119 Md.App. at 639-40, 705 A.2d 334. A material fact is one that will somehow affect the outcome of the case. <em>King, </em>303 Md. at 111, 492 A.2d 608. If a dispute exists as to a fact that is not material to the outcome of the case, the entry of summary judgment is not foreclosed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Scroggins v. Dahne, </em>335 Md. 688, 691, 645 A.2d 1160 (1994). Moreover, mere formal denials or general allegations are not necessarily sufficient to prevent the entry of summary judgment. <em>Shaffer v. Lohr, </em>264 Md. 397, 404, 287 A.2d 42 (1972); <em>Frush v. Brooks, </em>204 Md. 315, 320-21, 104 A.2d 624 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">In the absence of a genuine dispute as to material fact, we must decide if the trial court reached the correct legal conclusion. <em>Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 737, 625 A.2d 1005; <em>see also Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990); <em>King, </em>303 Md. at 111, 492 A.2d 608. Appellate courts ordinarily review the grant of summary judgment \u201conly on the grounds relied upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>Blades v. Woods, </em>338 Md. 475, 478, 659 A.2d 872 (1995); <em>see Hoffman v. United Iron and Metal Co., Inc., </em>108 Md.App. 117, 132-33, 671 A.2d 55 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">With these principles in mind, we must determine whether there are any disputes of material fact. If not, we must then decide whether the trial court was legally correct in its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Appellant alleged in his amended complaint that Manning was \u201can agent, servant, and/or employee of the School Board acting within the scope of his employment while he was teaching ... Roy....\u201d His claims against the Board are all premised on the doctrine of <em>respondeat </em>superior,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under this doctrine, the Board, as employer, cannot be liable for Manning\u2019s actions unless his conduct was within the scope of employment. Appellant argues that, merely because Manning\u2019s acts were intentional, this does not compel the conclusion that his conduct was beyond the scope of employment. Instead, appellant avers that he presented disputed questions of material fact that should have been resolved by the jury. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>He argues: \u201cA school board may be held vicariously hable for such [intentional] acts and it should be left to the fact finder to determine whether or not the acts were committed within the scope of employment.\u201d Therefore, in his view, the circuit court erred in deciding, as a matter of law, that Manning\u2019s conduct was outside the scope of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Appellant\u2019s argument is founded on the assertion that Manning\u2019s conduct was incidental to conduct authorized by the Board for educating special needs children, it was foreseeable, and it was in furtherance of appellee\u2019s objective of educating these children. According to appellant, Manning\u2019s physical contact with Roy was foreseeable because, as a result of Roy\u2019s disability, Manning was required to give him special attention, which included \u201cclothing, touching, and cleaning\u201d Roy. In addition, appellant observes that the Supplement \u201ccontemplate[d] that a teacher may touch a student to provide appropriate care for disabled students with emotional disabilities.\u201d Appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">It is a fair and reasonable inference that Defendant Manning\u2019s responsibilities included taking Roy and other such disabled students to the bathroom and that his duties included helping the students with their clothing, touching and cleaning them, <em>and disciplining them if they misbehaved or failed to listen. </em>It was during the carrying out of these duties and responsibilities by the teacher that the alleged misconduct occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">(Emphasis added).

He points out that C.J. \u00a7 5-353 did not provide that \u201cif a teacher acts with malice or gross negligence that the school board is automatically immune and absolved of all liability.\u201d Rather, he observes that it provided that \u201cthe plaintiff may seek recovery from both the school board and the teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Further, appellant contends that the language of the Local Government Tort Claims Act, codified in C.J. \u00a7\u00a7 5-401 through 5-404,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> supports his position that an intentional act does not necessarily foreclose appellee\u2019s liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> C.J. \u00a7 5-403(b)(1) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">Except as provided in subsection (c)[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] of this section, a local government shall be liable for any judgment against its employee for damages resulting from tortious acts or omissions committed by the employee within the scope of employment with the local government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellant also looks to C.J. \u00a7 5-402(b), which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">(b) <em>Immunity; </em>exceptions.-(l) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a person may not execute against an employee on a judgment rendered for tortious acts or omissions committed by the employee within the scope of employment with a local government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">(2)(i) An employee shall be fully liable for all damages awarded in an action in which it is found that the employee acted with actual malice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">(ii) In such circumstances the judgment may be executed against the employee and the local government may seek indemnification for any sums it is required to pay under \u00a7 5-403(b)(l) of this subtitle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Thus, appellant argues that \u201cthe [Legislature considered factual scenarios under which a local government may be liable for the intentional acts, even acts committed with \u2018actual malice,\u2019 by one of its employees within the scope of employment.\u201d In those cases, however, local governments may seek indemnification from the employee. He posits that the Board\u2019s immunity under C.J. \u00a7 5-353 should be interpreted in the same way. \u201cContrary to the lower court ruling in this case,\u201d appellant maintains that \u201cthere should not be an automatic bar to suits against the board for vicarious liability when the alleged acts committed within the scope of their employment are intentional or malicious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">In this case, we need not resolve appellant\u2019s contention that the Board is not immune merely because of the intentional nature of Manning\u2019s conduct. This is because appellant concedes, as he must, that the Board cannot be liable unless Manning acted within the scope of employment. As we see it, Manning did not act within the scope of employment in beating Roy.

Board of Education of Montgomery County, </em>292 Md. 481, 439 A.2d 582 (1982), is instructive. There, the Court observed that a school board \u201ccan only be held liable for the intentional torts of its employees committed while acting within the scope of their employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491 n. 8, 439 A.2d 582. In <em>dicta, </em>the Court also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">Where, as here, it is alleged that the individual educators have wilfully and maliciously acted to injure a student enrolled in a public school, <em>such actions can never be considered to have been done in furtherance of the beneficent purposes of the educational system. </em>Since such alleged intentional torts constitute an abandonment of employment, the Board is absolved of liability for these purported acts of its individual employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-7\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Appellant argues that the <em>dicta </em>in <em>Hunter </em>is not dispositive of the issue presented here. In observing that a school board could be liable for an employee\u2019s intentional torts committed within the scope of employment, he asserts that the <em>Hunter </em>Court contemplated that intentional torts could be \u201ccommitted at least in part in the furtherance of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Therefore, according to appellant, the ultimate determination in this case is one for a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">In support of his position, appellant relies on cases from other jurisdictions that have considered the scope of employment issue in the context of a teacher\u2019s assaultive conduct on a student. For example, he cites to <em>McIntosh v. Becker, </em>111 Mich.App. 692, 314 N.W.2d 728 (1981), in which the Court of Appeals of Michigan considered whether a school district could be held liable under the theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>for a teacher\u2019s verbal and physical assaults. The case arose from an incident involving the alleged choking and beating of a student by a teacher, and the alleged verbal assault upon the child, partly through the use of racial and sexual slurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The <em>McIntosh </em>court recognized that \u201ca governmental unit may be liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>for an agent\u2019s intentional misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>314 N.W.2d at 731. It thus reversed summary judgment in favor of the school district with respect to the physical assault claim and the claims involving non-racial and non-sexual verbal assaults. Nevertheless, it affirmed the lower court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the school district with respect to the claim concerning the racial and sexual slurs, because it did</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqc\">not believe that any factual development can arise which could justify the finder of fact in concluding that the racial and sexual slurs alleged to have occurred here were within the apparent scope of [the teacher\u2019s] employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\"><em>Id. </em>314 N.W.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Appellant also relies on <em>Randi F. v. High Ridge YMCA, </em>170 Ill.App.3d 962,120 Ill.Dec. 784, 524 N.E.2d 966 (1988). There, the Appellate Court of Illinois considered whether a day care center was vicariously liable for the alleged assault and sexual molestation of a three-year-old child by an employee of the day care center. The court concluded that the employee\u2019s conduct was \u201ca deviation from the scope of the employment having no relation to the business of the day care center or the furtherance thereof,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 789, 524 N.E.2d at 971, and agreed with the lower court that, \u201cas a matter of law, [the employee] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>was not acting within the scope of her employment but solely for her own benefit when she assaulted and sexually molested plaintiffs\u2019 daughter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 787, 524 N.E.2d at 969.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Despite the refusal of the <em>Randi F. </em>court to hold the day care center vicariously liable, appellant refers us to the following language in the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-5\">[I]f an employee commits an intentional tort with the dual purpose of furthering the employer\u2019s interest and venting personal anger, <em>respondeat superior </em>may lie; however, if the employee acts purely in his own interest, liability under <em>respondeat superior </em>is inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 788, 524 N.E.2d at 970. Appellant posits that this language establishes that \u201cthe jury as a fact finder may find that Defendant Manning was simply venting personal anger but that his actions were motivated in part for the furtherance of the Board\u2019s interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The above referenced cases do not persuade us to adopt appellant\u2019s position. In <em>McIntosh, </em>then existing Michigan law expressly permitted the teacher\u2019s use of reasonable force for discipline. In marked contrast, both Maryland law and the local rules expressly bar the use of corporal punishment. Further, the <em>McIntosh </em>court stated that the school district could be held liable, under the theory of <em>respondeat superior, </em>only \u201cif the plaintiffs son reasonably could have viewed [the employee\u2019s] actions as within the scope of his apparent authority----\u201d <em>McIntosh, </em>314 N.W.2d at 732. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we do not see how a nine-year-old child with Down\u2019s syndrome would view a physical assault by his special needs teacher, after that child had urinated in his pants, as being within the scope of the teacher\u2019s apparent authority. Moreover, the court in <em>Randi F. </em>rejected the vicarious liability claim, and thus that case is supportive of the Board\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">Although we have not uncovered any Maryland cases dealing with the precise issues presented here, other jurisdictions that have considered the scope of employment issue with respect to acts of assault or sexual child abuse committed by a teacher upon a student provide guidance. <em>Boykin v. District </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>of Columbia, </em>484 A.2d 560 (D.C.1984), is particularly illuminating.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In <em>Boykin, </em>the field coordinator of a program for deaf and blind children, who was employed by the District of Columbia, sexually assaulted a student. Thereafter, the employee resigned and entered a guilty plea to a charge of assault. The child\u2019s mother, as the legal representative of the child, then filed suit against the employee and, based on the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>against the District of Columbia. After the trial court granted the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, appellant appealed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <em>Boykin </em>court concluded that, as a matter of law, the employee\u2019s tortious conduct was not within the scope of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 561. Acknowledging that scope of employment is ordinarily a question for the jury, the court nonetheless recognized that it \u201cbecomes a question of law for the court ... if there is not sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that the action was within the scope of the employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">As in this case, the appellant in <em>Boykin </em>argued that the assault was a direct outgrowth of the employee\u2019s job assignment, because that assignment contemplated physical contact with the child. She asserted that \u201ca deaf, blind and mute child can be taught only through the sense of touch,\u201d and because \u201cphysical touching was necessarily a part of the teacher-student relationship,\u201d she claimed that it was \u201cforeseeable that sexual assaults could occur.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>Rejecting this argument, the <em>Boykin </em>court stated that it did \u201cnot believe that a sexual assault may be deemed a direct outgrowth of a school official\u2019s authorization to take a student by the hand or arm in guiding her past obstacles in the building.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The sexual attack by [the employee] on [the student] was unprovoked. It certainly was not a direct outgrowth of [the employee\u2019s] instructions or job assignment, nor was it an integral part of the school\u2019s activities, interests or objectives. [The employee\u2019s] assault was in no degree committed to serve the school\u2019s interest, but rather appears to have been done solely for the accomplishment of [the employee\u2019s] independent, malicious, mischievous and selfish purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajr-dedup-1\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The decision of the <em>Boykin </em>court is consistent with decisions from other jurisdictions that have refused to hold employers liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>for sexual assaults upon children perpetrated by school employees. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. American Express Travel Related Servs. Co., </em>179 Ariz. 131, 876 P.2d 1166, 1171 (App.1994) (holding that, as a matter of law, employer was not vicariously liable for sexual assault and harassment of employee, as acts were outside the scope of employment); <em>John R. v.

As we see it, appellant has not generated a genuine dispute as to whether the assaultive conduct alleged here is of a type that is sanctioned by the Board. Indeed, Manning\u2019s conduct violated E.A. \u00a7 7-305(a), and it constituted a drastic departure from the Board\u2019s policy, as reflected in the local rules and the Supplement. Moreover, as a result of his conduct, Manning was convicted of assault. Even if the criminal conviction is not dispositive of the issue, it surely establishes the egregiousness of Manning\u2019s misconduct, and lends support to the Board\u2019s claim that his action was outside the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We are thus unpersuaded by appellant\u2019s argument that Manning\u2019s conduct should be considered in furtherance of the Board\u2019s objectives, because it was arguably incidental to its objective of educating students. We recognize that there are legitimate occasions when a teacher may have to touch a student. These instances may include assisting in breaking up fights, preventing an accidental injury, protecting oneself, providing appropriate aid to disabled students, or employing passive restraint with a student who has emotional disabilities. Certainly, it is foreseeable that a teacher of a child with special needs may have to touch the student in order to assist the child in clothing himself, clean the child after the child eats, help the student in the bathroom, ensure that the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>does not physically injure himself, or attend to the child\u2019s health needs. That physical contact may be appropriate in certain situations, however, in no way constitutes implied authority for a teacher to beat a mentally disabled child as a means to discipline him. Indeed, as the Supplement indicates, \u201ctouching students is permitted\u201d only for the purpose of \u201c[mjaintaining a safe and orderly school environment, administering first aid, and attending to health needs____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">In sum, we fail to see how the act of physically striking a disabled child could be considered in furtherance of the Board\u2019s objective of educating disabled children, particularly when, as here, both State and local law forbid the use of corporal punishment for discipline purposes. Therefore, we conclude that no material factual dispute existed concerning whether Manning\u2019s conduct was within the scope of employment; Manning\u2019s conduct was neither expected, foreseeable, nor sanctioned. Rather, it was so extreme in nature, and so far beyond the bounds of appropriate behavior, that it cannot possibly be considered to have been in furtherance of appel-lee\u2019s objectives. Even when we view the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to appellant, as we must, we cannot say that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\">. Initially, appellant filed a complaint against the Board and Manning, as well as the City of Baltimore, Dr. Walter Amprey, (the Superintendent of Baltimore City Public Schools), and Barbara Avery-Anderson (the Principal of Harbor View Elementary School). Thereafter, the City, Dr. Amprey, Ms. Avery-Anderson, and appellee filed motions to dismiss. Prior to the resolution of the motions, appellant filed his First Amended Complaint against the Board and Manning only; appellant voluntarily dismissed defendants Amprey, the City, and Ms. Avery-Anderson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b266-12\">.

At the outset, we note that this case does not present an issue of negligent hiring. Nor is there any contention that the Board had prior knowledge of any assaultive behavior by Manning toward students. Therefore, we do not address whether the Board could be liable for such claims, and this opinion should not be construed to suggest that a school board could not be liable if it negligently hired a teacher or knowingly allowed an abusive teacher to remain in its employ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">.
