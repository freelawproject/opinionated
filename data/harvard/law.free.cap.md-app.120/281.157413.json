Wills were offset by her length of service retirement benefits, even though her receipt of retirement benefits was unrelated to the injury for which she was awarded workers\u2019 compensation. In Case No. 668 (September 1997 Term), the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (DeWaters, J.) granted summary judgment in favor of appellee Baltimore County, ruling that workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded to appellant Jerry L. Blevins for a time period before his retirement were offset by disability retirement benefits that he received from Baltimore County after his retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">As neither case presents a genuine dispute of material fact and the granting of summary judgment in each case was legally correct, we shall affirm the judgments in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>Wills v. Baltimore County</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">On March 26, 1992, Mary E. Wills, a clerical worker employed by Baltimore County in its Office of Aging, fell off her chair at work and sustained an injury to her back. Wills was hospitalized and subsequently treated by an orthopedist and a physical therapist. At the time of her injury, Wills was 70 years old and had been employed by the County for 30 years. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>She was earning $492.08 per week. Wills\u2019s back injury prevented her from returning to her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Wills filed a claim for benefits with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201ccommission\u201d) and on August 31, 1992, the commission awarded her temporary total disability benefits of $300.00 per week. The County paid Wills her full salary in lieu of that award. Approximately six months later, on February 8, 1993, Wills retired. Effective February 11, 1993, Wills began receiving a service-related retirement benefit of $300.23 per week from Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On March 4, 1994, the commission held a hearing in Wills\u2019s case on issues of accidental injury, causation, and pre-existing disability. Wills testified that she was receiving a retirement benefit from the County. The County did not then seek to offset the retirement benefits against the workers\u2019 compensation award, under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a). The commission passed an order on March 17,1994 attributing 75% of Wills\u2019s injury to her accident and the remaining 25% to a pre-existing condition. It further directed the County to pay Wills permanent total disability benefits of $329.00 per week, beginning as of January 1, 1993, for 500 weeks, not to exceed the sum of $164,500.00 allowable under \u201cother cases,\u201d with continuing benefits to be assumed by the Subsequent Injury Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Baltimore County and the Fund filed a petition for judicial review of the commission\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. They did not raise the issue of an offset under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a). On November 9, 1995, the circuit court affirmed the commission\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In January, 1996, the County filed issues with the commission, requesting that it offset Wills\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits by the amount of her retirement benefits. The commission held a hearing on the County\u2019s request on May 20, 1996. On June 7,1996, it issued an order denying the request. The County and the Fund filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Motions for summary judgment were filed by all parties. The court held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>hearing and, on April 1, 1997, it granted the motions for summary judgment of the County and the Fund, reversing the commission\u2019s decision and granting the County\u2019s request for an offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Wills noted this appeal, presenting the following questions for review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">I. Was the commission\u2019s June 7, 1996 decision appeal-able?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">II. Did the trial court err in reversing the commission\u2019s ruling that the County was barred from seeking an offset under L.E. \u00a7 9-601 because an offset must be sought at the time of the initial award?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">III. Did the trial court err in ruling that, given the elimination of the word \u201csimilar\u201d from the governmental employee offset provision of the Act, benefits that are not \u201csimilar\u201d are now offset against workers\u2019 compensation benefits under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">\n<em>Blevins v. Baltimore County</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Jerry L. Blevins worked full-time for the Baltimore County Police Department for 28 years. In 1994, he was a Deputy Police Chief, earning a yearly salary of $77,000.00. On January 21, 1994, Blevins was going about his police duties when he slipped and fell on a patch of ice in the parking lot of the Baltimore County Police Headquarters. Blevins sustained injuries to his neck, back, and shoulder. He was treated by an orthopedist, a physical therapist, and a pain management specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Blevins did not miss any time from work on account of his accident. Nevertheless, he filed for accidental disability retirement benefits with the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Baltimore County. His application was approved and, on November 16,1995, Blevins retired. From that time forward, Blevins has received disability retirement benefits of $1,038.25 per week ($53,989.00 per year).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">After he retired, Blevins filed a petition for permanent partial disability benefits before the Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Commission. On February 9, 1996, the commission held a hearing on Blevins\u2019s claim and, on February 23, 1996, it awarded Blevins permanent partial disability benefits under the \u201cother cases\u201d category, for a 20% loss of industrial use of his body. The award directed that Blevins be paid benefits of $170.00 per week for the period from January 22, 1994 (the day after his accident) until November 16, 1995 (his retirement date). It specified that any permanent partial disability payments attributable to a period after Blevins\u2019s retirement were offset by his pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">On March 4, 1996, Baltimore County filed a petition for judicial review of the commission\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. It then filed a motion for summary judgment, which Blevins opposed. The circuit court held a hearing and on March 5,1997, it granted the motion for summary judgment, reversing the commission\u2019s award. Blevins noted this appeal, presenting two questions for review, which we have combined and reworded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">I. Did the lower court err in reversing the commission\u2019s ruling that L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) did not entitle Baltimore County to offset his retirement disability benefits against workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded for a period before his retirement?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Our task in reviewing a trial court\u2019s granting of a summary judgment is two-pronged. First, we determine whether there was a dispute of material fact that rendered summary judgment improper. Then, if there is no such dispute, we must determine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling that the prevailing party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law was legally correct. <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Prods., Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 8, 327 A.2d 502 (1974); <em>McKinney Drilling Co. v. Mach I Ltd. Partnership, </em>32 Md.App. 205, 209, 359 A.2d 100 (1976). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>these cases, we need only perform the second prong of our task, as the parties agree that there are no disputes of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In addition, in reviewing the ruling of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">[w]e, as was the circuit court, are to be guided by the general statutory command that \u201cthe decision[s] of the Commission [are] entitled to prima facie correctness.\u201d A court, therefore, may reverse a commission ruling only upon a finding that its action was based upon an erroneous construction of the law or facts ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\"><em>Frank v. Baltimore County, </em>284 Md. 655, 658, 399 A.2d 250 (1979)(quoting <em>Md. Bureau of Mines v. Powers, </em>258 Md. 379, 382, 265 A.2d 860 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\n<em>The Governmental Employee Offset Provision of the Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">By Chapter 8, \u00a7 2 of the Acts of 1991, section 33(d) of Article 101 of the Maryland Code, which set forth the \u201cgovernmental employee offset\u201d provision of the Act, was recodified at \u00a7 9-610(a) of the Labor and Employment Article. Former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">Whenever by statute, charter, ordinances, resolution, regulation or policy adopted thereunder, whether as part of a pension system or otherwise, any benefit or benefits are furnished employees of [public] employers ... the benefit or benefits when furnished by the employer shall satisfy and discharge pro tanto or in full ..., the liability or obligation of the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund for any benefit under this article. If any benefits so furnished are less than those provided for in this article the employer or the Subsequent Injury Fund, or both shall furnish the additional benefit as will make up the difference between the benefit furnished and the similar benefit required in this article ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Md.Code (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum.Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 33. L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a), entitled \u201cOffset against other benefits,\u201d now reads, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">(a) <em>Covered employee of governmental unit or quasi-public </em>corporation.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">(1) If a statute, charter, ordinance, resolution, regulation, or policy, regardless of whether part of a pension system, provides a benefit to a covered employee of a governmental unit ... that is subject to this title under \u00a7 9-201(2) of this title ... payment of the benefit by the employer satisfies, to the extent of the payment, the liability of the employer and the Subsequent Injury Fund for payment of benefits under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">(2) If a benefit paid under paragraph (1) of this subsection is less than the benefits provided under this title, the employer, the Subsequent Injury Fund, or both shall provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit paid under paragraph (1) of this subsection and the benefits provided under this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In the cases <em>sub judice, </em>it is undisputed that L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) was in effect at the time of the workers\u2019 injuries, <em>see Baltimore County v. Fleming, </em>113 Md.App. 254, 255-56, 686 A.2d 1161 (1996), and that when they were injured, Wills and Blevins were covered employees of a governmental unit, within. the meaning of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a). To resolve the issues presented in each case, we must interpret the meaning of the governmental employee offset provision in its present form. In doing so, we are guided by well-established principles of statutory construction. &gt;</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994); <em>Stapleford v. Hyatt, </em>330 Md. 388, 400, 624 A.2d 526 (1993); <em>Taxiera v. Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 480, 578 A.2d 761 (1990); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988). In determining legislative intent of a statute, \u201c \u2018[t]he primary source ... is, of course, the language of the statute itself.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number><em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996)(quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">If [the language of a statute] is clear and unambiguous, then we need look no further. In such a case, a plainly worded statute must be construed without forced or subtle interpretations designed to extend or limit the scope of its operation. Doing so merely provides the clearest indication of the legislative intent and is thus the primary source for all statutory construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Harris v. City of Baltimore, </em>306 Md. 669, 673, 511 A.2d 52 (1986) (citations omitted). The language of a statute is to be given its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Buckman, </em>333 Md. at 523, 636 A.2d 448; <em>Harford County v. University of Md. Medical Sys. Corp., </em>318 Md. 525, 529, 569 A.2d 649 (1990). Although in some circumstances we need only look at the \u201cstatutory language to determine the legislative purpose,\u201d we \u201cmay always consider evidence of legislative intent beyond the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>Pagano, </em>341 Md. at 133, 669 A.2d 1339. In construing a statute, the Court \u201cseek[s] to avoid results which are \u2018illogical,\u2019 \u2018unreasonable,\u2019 or \u2018inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Romm v. Flax, </em>340 Md. 690, 693, 668 A.2d 1 (1995)(quoting <em>Tucker, </em>308 Md. at 75, 517 A.2d 730).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\"><em>Wills: </em>Preliminary Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Ad_\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Appealability</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Wills argues that the commission\u2019s June 7, 1996 order denying the County\u2019s request for an offset under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) constituted a refusal by the commission to reopen a claim under L.E. \u00a7 9-736(c), which is not an appealable order, except in limited circumstances that do not apply here. The County counters that the commission did not refuse to reopen the claim. Rather, it exercised its continuing jurisdiction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>issued a substantive ruling on the issue presented, rejecting the offset request. As such, the commission\u2019s order was appealable. We agree with the County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">L.E. \u00a7 9-610(c)(2) provides that \u201c[a] claim that comes under this section is subject to the continuing powers and jurisdiction of the commission.\u201d Those powers are enumerated in L.E. \u00a7 9-736, entitled \u201cReadjustment; continuing powers and jurisdiction; modification,\u201d which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"adg-dedup-0\">(b) <em>Continuing powers and jurisdiction; </em>modification.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">(1) The Commission has continuing powers and jurisdiction over each claim under this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">(2) Subject to paragraph <em>(3) </em>of this subsection, the Commission may modify any finding or order as the Commission considers justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-7\">(3) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the Commission may not modify an award unless the modification is applied for within 5 years after the last compensation payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Wills asserts that the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Robin Express, Inc. v. Cuccaro, </em>247 Md. 262, 230 A.2d 671 (1967), and the holding of this Court in <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Gray, </em>40 Md.App. 66, 389 A.2d 407 (1978), support her contention that the June 7, 1996 commission order was not appealable. In <em>Robin Express, </em>the commission issued an award of benefits to an injured employee after the employer did not respond to the claim or participate in the hearing. Thereafter, the employer filed a motion for rehearing, asking the commission to reopen the claim so it could present evidence demonstrating that it was not the injured workers\u2019 employer. The commission denied the motion and the employer sought judicial review in the circuit court. The circuit court dismissed the employer\u2019s claim, ruling that the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>appeal from the commission\u2019s refusal to grant a rehearing is limited to situations involving aggravation, termination, or diminution of injury, under \u00a7 40(b) of former Article 101. The Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>See also Gold Dust Corp. v. Zabawa, </em>159 Md. 664, 666-69,152 A. 500 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">Like the employer in <em>Robin Express, </em>the employer in <em>Roadway Express, supra, </em>failed to take action to respond to an injured worker\u2019s claim. The commission passed an order awarding temporary total disability benefits, which was forwarded to the employer. The employer did not take steps to obtain judicial review. Instead, it filed a motion to rescind or modify the commission\u2019s order, asserting that the worker had failed to report the accident as required, had failed to file the claim report and medical records, and that there was not sufficient evidence before the commission on which to base its award. The commission affirmed its original award and the employer then petitioned for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The circuit court in <em>Roadway Express </em>dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. We affirmed, holding that the employer\u2019s effort to obtain judicial review of the commission\u2019s denial of its motion to rescind or modify was a collateral attack on the award, taken after the time to obtain judicial review had expired: \u201cTo permit the [employer] to raise these issues in a collateral proceeding would defeat the purpose of requiring appeals to be filed within a mandatory period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 389 A.2d 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">These cases do not support Wills\u2019s argument that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to review the commission\u2019s June 7, 1996 order. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the County contested Wills\u2019s claim and participated fully in the hearing on the claim and the appeal from the commission\u2019s award of benefits that followed. Subsequently, the County invoked the continuing jurisdiction of the commission over claims for offsets referenced in L.E. \u00a7 9-610(c)(2) and filed issues requesting an offset for the first time. The record of the commission hearing reveals that the commissioner gave substantive consideration to the County\u2019s offset request. The commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>did not refuse to reopen the claim or to exercise the commission\u2019s continuing powers and jurisdiction under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(c)(2). To the contrary, the commissioner remarked that he understood that the issues were filed by the County pursuant to that statutory provision. The commissioner entertained the County\u2019s request for an offset but denied it on the ground that L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(3) bars entitlement to an offset after the \u201cinitial award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In <em>Robin Express, </em>the Court compared an appeal from the commission\u2019s refusal to reopen a claim to consider an issue, which is not permitted, to an appeal from a decision made by the commission once it has reopened the claim for purposes of deciding the issue, which is permitted. Observing that a decision refusing to reopen a claim is \u201conly a decision not to interfere with a previous decision settling the merits of the claim\u201d which, if appealable, would lead to interminable litigation, <em>Robin Express, </em>247 Md. at 264, 230 A.2d 671 (quoting <em>Gold Dust, </em>159 Md. at 666, 152 A. 500), the Court remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a6q-dedup-0\">If a court or administrative body reopens a case its second decision, be it the same or different from its previous decision, is a new holding; if it refuses to reopen, it decides only not to interfere with its previous decision which stands unimpeached as of its original date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 265, 230 A.2d 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Here, the commission exercised its continuing jurisdiction, considered the County\u2019s request for an offset, and ruled that the County was barred from obtaining an offset. It did not refuse to consider the offset issue or simply decide not to interfere with its original award settling the merits of the claim. As such, the commission\u2019s order was an appealable \u201cnew holding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Timing of Offset Request</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">Wills next argues that the language of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(3) requiring computation of an \u201cadditional benefit ... at the time of the initial award\u201d barred the County from filing issues with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the commission requesting an offset under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a), after the commission had issued its March 17, 1994 award. The commissioner agreed with Wills on this point, interpreting L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(3) to mandate that any governmental employee offset be assessed at the time of the initial workers\u2019 compensation award and precluding a governmental employer from obtaining an offset any time thereafter. The circuit court took a contrary view, construing L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(3) so as not to bar the County\u2019s request for an offset. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(3) pertains to the \u201cadditional benefit\u201d referenced in L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(2) and must be analyzed in light of that related subsection. If the workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded to a governmental employee exceed the retirement, pension, or other \u201cbenefit\u201d that the governmental employer is seeking to apply as an offset, L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(2) applies and provides that \u201can additional benefit that equals the difference between\u201d the two benefits shall be paid to the employee by the employer or the Fund or both. Under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(c)(l)(ii), the commission is empowered to \u201cmake an award against the employer or the [Fund] or both to provide [the] additional benefit ...\u201d L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(3) specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">The computation of an additional benefit payable under paragraph (2) of this section shall be done at the time of the initial award and may not include any cost of living adjustment after the initial award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The language recited above is part of a statutory scheme and, as such, should not be construed in isolation. <em>Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery County Lodge No. 35 v. Mehrling, </em>343 Md. 155, 180, 680 A.2d 1052 (1996). Subsection (a)(1) establishes generally the right to an offset. That subsection does not contain a time limitation for seeking an offset or any reference to time at all. Subsection (a)(3), which Wills argues bars offset requests made after the \u201cinitial award,\u201d does not apply to all requests for offsets or to the general right to request an offset. To the contrary, it is a narrowly drawn provision applicable only to those cases in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>which there is less than a complete offset. Its subject matter is the computation of the additional benefit. Read in context, it prescribes the method for computing an \u201cadditional benefit\u201d to which a governmental employee may be entitled by targeting the time-frame relevant to the computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">An interpretation of the time reference in subsection (a)(3) to create a general hmitations period applicable to all offset claims when that subsection is only triggered in the subset of offset claims that involve computation of an additional benefit ignores the limited function of that provision in the statutory scheme. In the absence of a judicially crafted exception, such an interpretation would prevent a governmental employer from seeking an offset after an initial award of workers\u2019 compensation benefits even when the other benefit had not been in existence at the time of the initial award. Likewise, it would prejudice the rights of the Fund in those cases in which it is impleaded after the initial award. Indeed, it would render the clause in subsection (a)(3) prohibiting inclusion of cost of living adjustments in the calculation of an \u201cadditional benefit\u201d meaningless in all but those cases in which the other benefit post-dated the award (and in which the offset request would be barred in any event.). L.E. \u00a7 9-638 provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that workers\u2019 compensation paid as permanent total disability \u201cis subject to an annual cost of living adjustment.\u201d If an offset request cannot be sought after the initial award, the \u201cadditional benefit\u201d will be calculated before cost of living adjustments come into play anyway, making the prohibition in (a)(3) purposeless. We will not read any part of a statute to be superfluous. <em>Polomski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>344 Md. 70, 83, 684 A.2d 1338 (1996); <em>Schlossberg v. Citizens Bank of Maryland, </em>341 Md. 650, 660, 672 A.2d 625 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Finally, we note that the continuing powers clause of L.E. \u00a7 9-736(b) provides at subsection (3) that an application for modification of an award by the commission must be made \u201cwithin 5 years after the last compensation payment\u201d and that, under L.E. \u00a7 9-610(c), that express time limitation applies to a \u201cclaim\u201d for an offset. Wills\u2019s interpretation of subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>(a)(3) of the offset statute would make that statute internally inconsistent with respect to the time for asserting an offset claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\"><em>Wills: </em>Status of <em>Newman v. Subsequent Injury Fund </em>in light of 1991 Recodification of Workers\u2019 Compensation Act</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In <em>Newman v. Subsequent Injury Fund, </em>311 Md. 721, 537 A.2d 274 (1988), the Court of Appeals held that a workers\u2019 compensation award to a governmental employee could not be offset by the employee\u2019s length of service retirement benefits. In that case, an employee of Prince George\u2019s County was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a work-related injury. She returned to work and, several months later, elected to take retirement, for which her age and years of service made her eligible. Prince George\u2019s County sought to offset her retirement benefit against her workers\u2019 compensation award, under former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The Court of Appeals held that Prince George\u2019s County was not entitled to an offset. It reasoned that the use of the phrase \u201csimilar benefit\u201d in former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) limited application of the governmental employee offset to benefits that are similar or comparable to workers\u2019 compensation benefits and that a retirement benefit based on age and length of service is not such a benefit. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">Newman was awarded workers\u2019 compensation because of the impairment of the industrial use of her body as a result of her work-related injury. On the other hand, it appears that she was entitled to the benefits under the retirement plan merely because she had elected to retire after attaining a prescribed age and 20 years service with the county. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>payment of these benefits had no relation whatsoever to her injury and the disability resulting therefrom. Age and length of service were not a prerequisite for her entitlement to [workers\u2019] compensation benefits; anatomical disability was not a prerequisite for her entitlement to the retirement benefits____ The two benefits were not similar and not comparable. Therefore, the offset provisions of \u00a7 38[ (d) ] were not applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">311 Md. at 724, 537 A.2d 274. <em>See also Oros v. City of Baltimore, </em>56 Md.App. 685, 468 A.2d 693 (1983), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>301 Md. 460, 483 A.2d 748 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The Court in <em>Newman </em>distinguished the cases permitting offsets by retirement benefits on the ground that they involved disability retirement benefits that were conferred because the worker had sustained an injury and not because of the worker\u2019s age and length of service. <em>See Frank v. Baltimore County, supra </em>(disability pension benefits); <em>Feissner v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 413, 384 A.2d 742 (1978)(disability retirement pay); <em>Mazor v. State, Department of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 369 A.2d 82 (1977)(accidental disability pensions).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">In <em>Polomski v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, supra, </em>the Court succinctly summarized the interpretation of former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) announced in <em>Newman: </em>\u201c[S]imilar benefits for the same injury trigger the offset provision ... Dissimilar benefits, therefore, render the offset provision inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 81, 684 A.2d 1338. The \u201csimilar benefit\u201d phrase on which the holding in <em>Newman </em>rests appeared once in former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d). It was not contained in the sentence of \u00a7 33(d) establishing the offset generally. Rather, it was included in a later sentence in the subsection pertaining to calculation of additional benefits (the statutory predecessor to L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The word \u201csimilar\u201d was not included in the governmental employee offset provision as first enacted in Md.Code (1939), Art. 101, \u00a7 46. That offset provision stated simply that municipal employees were excluded from workers\u2019 compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>tion coverage if the municipality made \u201cequal or better\u201d provision for its employees. The word \u201csimilar\u201d was first introduced into the governmental employee offset statute when five sections of former Art. 101 were repealed and reenacted by Chapter 741, 1970 Laws of Maryland. No history accompanies that legislation. One year later, the Legislature again repealed and re-enacted Art. 101, \u00a7 33. 1971 Md. Laws 785. The 1971 legislation contains a purpose clause explaining that the offset provision was meant to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeH\">provide that whenever benefits are furnished by an employer, as defined, equal to or better than the benefits provided under Article 101 of the Ann.Code of Md., such defined employer shall be released of any obligation thereunder, but should such benefits be less than those required by the said Article 101, such defined employer shall make up the difference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><em>Id. </em>The purpose clause does not mention the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d phrase or explain its purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">When former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) was recodified at L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(l)-(2) in 1991, the word \u201csimilar\u201d was not included in the statute as revised. Neither House Bill 1 (1991) nor the Report on that bill mentions the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d language of former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) or its absence from the revised statutory language. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the County argued and the circuit court agreed that the elimination of the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d phrase from the offset statute in 1991 materially changed the law so that benefits paid to a governmental employee that are not injury or disability related, <em>i.e., </em>are not \u201csimilar\u201d to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, now are offset against workers\u2019 compensation benefits awarded to the employee. That interpretation of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) entitles the County to offset the service-related retirement benefit that it pays Wills against the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that the commission has directed it to pay her, even though the two benefits are not similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Wills challenges that statutory interpretation, contending that the omission of the word \u201csimilar\u201d from L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>did not effect a change in the law because it was \u201conly for the purpose of clarity and brevity.\u201d In support, she cites the Revisor\u2019s Note to L.E. \u00a7 9-610, which, states that the section \u201cis new language derived without substantive change\u201d from certain portions of former Art. 101, \u00a7 33, including the second sentence of subsection (d), in which the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d phrase appeared.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wills also maintains that, even though the word \u201csimilar\u201d no longer appears in the offset statute, a proper reading of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(l) limits those benefits that may be offset to like or similar benefits. Finally, Wills argues that any statutory interpretation that does not limit the governmental employee offset provision to similar benefits is contrary to the underlying purposes of the Act. We disagree with Wills\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Our starting point in construing the meaning of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) is the language of the statute itself, as revised through recodification in 1991. Speaking with particular reference to the complete recodification of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act in the 1991 revision of the Maryland Code, the Court of Appeals has observed that, for the most part, recodifications are not substantive in nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">This Court consistently has presumed that general recodifi-cations of statutes, such as Title 9 of the Labor <em>&amp; </em>Employment Article, are for the purpose of clarity only and not substantive change, unless the language of the recodified statute unmistakably indicates the intention of the Legislature to modify the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>DeBusk v.

While the Revisor\u2019s Note to L.E. \u00a7 9-610 serves as evidence of legislative intent it is not, in and of itself, determinative of legislative intent. It is one factor that we consider in deciding whether the 1991 elimination by recodification of the word \u201csimilar\u201d from the governmental employee offset provision \u201cunmistakably indicates the intention of the Legislature to modify the law.\u201d <em>DeBusk, </em>342 Md. at 444, 677 A.2d 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Also important to our inquiry is the presumption that the Legislature has full knowledge of existing laws, including decisions of the Court of Appeals, when it effects a statutory change. <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Polomski </em>106 Md.App. 689, 697, 666 A.2d 895, <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>344 Md. 70, 684 A.2d 1338 (1996). <em>Newman v. Subsequent Injury Fund </em>had been the law for three years when L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) was enacted. A reading of that case makes plain that inclusion of the words \u201csimilar benefit\u201d in former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) was the lynchpin of the Court\u2019s holding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Polomski, </em>344 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Md. at 82, 684 A.2d 1338 (\u201cOur cases construing former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) relied heavily, if not exclusively, upon the \u2018similar benefits\u2019 language employed in that statute.\u201d). While the Court in <em>Newman </em>discussed at length the consistency between its interpretation of \u201csimilar benefit\u201d and the legislative intent behind the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the reasoning of the Court depended upon the presence of the word \u201csimilar\u201d in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">We presume that the General Assembly was fully aware of <em>Newman </em>when it revised the governmental employee offset provision by leaving out the statutory language that was instrumental to the holding in that case. In addition, a comparison of the sentence in former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d), containing the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d phrase, to its replacement counterpart in L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(2) makes plain that the elimination of the word \u201csimilar\u201d as a modifier of the word \u201cbenefit\u201d (or \u201cbenefits\u201d) from the latter is a language change that differs qualitatively from all other language changes that were made to that section. Those changes relate strictly to form. The omission of the word \u201csimilar\u201d from the present law, however, cannot be explained on the basis of style, grammar, or punctuation. Moreover, the word \u201csimilar\u201d not only was eliminated as a modifier of \u201cbenefit\u201d in the clause that is the present version of the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d clause of former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d), but also was not included in other parts of the section where its use would have been logical if modification of the word \u201cbenefit\u201d to retain the meaning ascribed to it in <em>Newman </em>had been intended by the Legislature. The importance of the word \u201csimilar\u201d to the <em>Newman </em>holding and the lack of any explanation based on form alone for its disappearance upon recodification from the current governmental employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>offset provision is compelling evidence that the Legislature took positive action to remove the word from the statute for a substantive purpose, <em>i.e., </em>to modify the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The Legislature\u2019s retention of the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d phrase in another subsection of L.E. \u00a7 9-610 further convinces us that the deletion of the word \u201csimilar\u201d from the governmental employee offset provision was a material change intended to modify the law. L.E. \u00a7 9-610(b), entitled \u201cCovered employee of Military Department of State,\u201d pertains to benefits conferred by federal law upon certain employees of the Military Department of the State. Subsection (2) of L.E. \u00a7 9 \u2014 610(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">If federal law provides benefits for a covered employee of the Military Department of the State that are less than the benefits provided by this title, the State ... shall provide an additional benefit that equals the difference between the benefit provided by federal law and the similar benefit provided by this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">(emphasis supplied). That language was derived from the third sentence of former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">Should any benefits provided by the federal government be less than those provided by this article, the State ... shall furnish the additional benefit in order to make up the difference between the benefit provided by the federal government and the similar benefit provided by this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">(emphasis supplied). The federal military benefit offset provision in that sentence was a mirror image of the only sentence in the governmental employee offset provision of \u00a7 33(d) that contained the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d phrase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\">If any benefits so furnished are less than those provided for in this article the employer or the Subsequent Injury Fund, or both shall furnish the additional benefit as will make up the difference between the benefit furnished and the similar benefit required in this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">(emphasis supplied). The Legislature\u2019s failure upon recodifi-cation to carry over the word \u201csimilar\u201d from the predecessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>statute to L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(l)-(2) when it did carry over the word \u201csimilar\u201d from the parallel predecessor statute to L.E. \u00a7 9 \u2014 610(b) is unmistakable evidence that it intended the change in the wording of the governmental employee offset provision to modify the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Wills argues that the following sentence in L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(1) limits the offset to benefits that are awarded on account of injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\">If a statute ... provides a benefit to a covered employee of a governmental unit ... that is subject to this title under \u00a7 9-201(2) of this title ... payment of the benefit by the employer satisfies ... the liability of the employer ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIT\">Wills contends that the phrase \u201csubject to this title\u201d modifies the word \u201cbenefit;\u201d as such, she argues, a retirement benefit \u201cmust be the subject of the workers\u2019 compensation statute <em>[ie., </em>relate to an injury, disability of disease to which workers\u2019 compensation would apply] for the offset to apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">We do not accept Wills\u2019s strained construction of the plain language of the offset statute. \u201cAs a corollary of the rule that we accord words their ordinary meaning, we must accord sentences an ordinary grammatical structure.\u201d <em>Mazor, </em>279 Md. at 363, 369 A.2d 82. Under Wills\u2019s reading of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a)(l), the phrase \u201csubject to this title\u201d is incomplete and unconnected to the words that follow it. The full phrase, read correctly, is \u201csubject to this title under \u00a7 9-201(2) of this title.\u201d L.E. \u00a7 9-201, headed \u201cEmployers subject to title,\u201d provides: \u201cThis title applies to the following employers: ... (2) each governmental unit or quasi-public corporation that has at least 1 covered employee.\u201d It is thus clear that the phrase on which Wills bases her argument modifies the word \u201cgovernmental unit,\u201d not the word \u201cbenefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">As presently worded, L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) contains no language qualifying or limiting the nature or type of benefit that may be offset against a governmental employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefit. \u201cWhen ... the \u2018statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, the courts are not at liberty to insert or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>delete words with a view toward making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning.\u2019\u201d <em>Frank, </em>284 Md. at 661, 399 A.2d 250 (quoting <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 617, 224 A.2d 677 (1966)); <em>Fikar v. Montgomery County, </em>333 Md. 430, 434-35, 635 A.2d 977 (1994); <em>Potter v.

The Legislature deleted the very word in former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) that was operative to the <em>Newman </em>holding. Irrespective of the comment in the Re-visor\u2019s Note, we are not at liberty to read the current version of the same statute as if the deleted word were still there. <em>See Polomski, supra </em>(noting that \u201cslight word changes were in fact made to [L.E.] \u00a7 9-503(d)(2)\u201d even though the Revisor\u2019s Note indicates the provision was \u201cadopted without substantive change.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The reasoning employed by the Court of Appeals in its construction of L.E. \u00a7 9-503(d)(2), an offset provision in the fire fighter and policemen heart-lung occupational disease statute of the Act, lends support to our statutory interpretation in this case. In <em>Polomski, supra, </em>the Court held that a fire fighter\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits for occupational disease were to be adjusted by his length of service retirement benefits. The offset statute under scrutiny in <em>Polomski </em>reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeHm\">The benefits received under this title shall be adjusted so that the weekly total of those benefits and retirement benefits does not exceed the weekly salary that was paid to the fire fighter....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The fire fighter contended that, just as benefits must be \u201csimilar\u201d to be offset under former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d), retirement benefits must be \u201csimilar\u201d to workers\u2019 compensation benefits to trigger an adjustment under L.E. \u00a7 9-503(d)(2). The Court disagreed. Remarking that, \u201cnotwithstanding years of revision and recodification ... [L.E. \u00a7 9-503(d)(2) and its predecessors] have never employed the \u2018similar benefits\u2019 language,\u201d it held that it would be unreasonable to read a \u201csimilar benefits\u201d requirement into L.E. \u00a7 9-503(d)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Unlike Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d), \u00a7 9-503(d)(2) and its predecessors make no distinction between retirement benefits accruing by reason of age and service versus those accruing as the result of a disability, and no reasonable inference to that effect can be drawn from the section\u2019s clear language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX3\"><em>Id. </em>at 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Likewise, the clear language of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) no longer draws a distinction between retirement or pension benefits that are service-related and those that accrue due to disability. That the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d phrase once appeared in the statutory predecessor to L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) does not lead logically to the conclusion that the concept still applies to the statute, absent the language. Indeed, it compels the contrary conclusion: that the Legislature intended by its clear language to eliminate the distinction that once existed in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Our conclusion that the governmental employee offset provision of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) is not intended by the Legislature to be restricted to benefits similar to workers\u2019 compensation benefits is based primarily on \u201cthe language chosen by the General Assembly to express its intention.\u201d <em>Frank, </em>284 Md. at 658, 399 A.2d 250. We are cognizant, however, that as we \u201cgive the words of the statute their ordinary and common meaning with the context in which they are used ...

To be sure, the Act maintains a no-fault compensation system for employees and their families for work-related injuries where compensation for lost earning capacity is otherwise available. At the same time, however, the Act also recognizes the need to protect employers from the unpredictable nature and expense of litigation, and the public from the overwhelming tax burden of \u2018caring for the helpless human wreckage found [along] the trail of modern industry.\u2019 In other words, the Act provides employees suffering from work-related accidental injuries, regardless of fault, with a certain, efficient, and dignified form of compensation. In exchange, employees abandon common law remedies, thereby relieving employers from the vagaries of tort liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">344 Md. at 76-77, 684 A.2d 1338 (quoting <em>Liggett &amp; Meyers Tobacco Co. v.

The Court noted that, in addition to wage-loss protection, the Act \u201caffords employees medical benefits, the opportunity for vocational rehabilitation, and, in the event of death, dependent survivor benefits and allowances for funeral expenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77, n. 6,160 A. 804 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In <em>Frank v.

That intention, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag-\">[I]s also consistent with the generally recognized policy underlying all wage-loss legislation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">Wage-loss legislation is designed to restore to the worker a portion ... of wages lost due to the three major causes of wage-loss: physical disability, economic unemployment, and old age.

The purpose of anti\u201cdouble dipping\u201d legislation is \u201cto minimize the burden on the public treasury that would result from providing duplicate benefits to public employees.\u201d <em>Frank, </em>284 Md. at 661, 399 A.2d 250. <em>See also Tsottles v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>55 Md.App. 58, 59, 460 A.2d 636 (1983)(former Art. 101, \u00a7 33 \u201cattempts to prevent double payment from the public treasury to civil servants for an injury arising out of the employment relationship by providing that government employees covered by both a pension plan and workmen\u2019s compensation are entitled to but a single recovery for a single injury\u201d); <em>Oros, </em>56 Md.App. at 694, 468 A.2d 693 (1983); <em>Nooe v. City of Baltimore, </em>28 Md.App. 348, 352, 345 A.2d 134 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In <em>Newman, </em>the Court found that the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d limitation in the governmental employee offset provision of former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) was consonant with the anti-\u201cdouble dipping\u201d purpose of the offset statute, in that it prevented a governmental employer from having to pay benefits twice on account of a single injury suffered by an employee. The case <em>sub judice </em>raises the broader related question whether an offset provision that is not restricted to like or similar benefits is inconsistent with its anti-\u201cdouble dipping\u201d purpose or, more important, with the overall objectives of the Act. We hold that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The primary and overriding objective of workers\u2019 compensation legislation is wage-loss protection. The Court of Appeals explained in <em>Mazor v. State, Department of Correction:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">[Wjorkmen\u2019s compensation is one facet of an overall system of wage-loss protection, ... the underlying principle of the system is to restore to the worker a portion of the wages lost by physical disability, unemployment, or old age. It follows that although two or more causes of wage loss may coincide, the benefits need not cumulate, for the worker experiences but one wage loss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">279 Md. at 363, 369 A.2d 82. Allowing a government employer to offset the sum that it pays to an employee as an age and length of service retirement benefit against its liability to the employee for an unrelated workers\u2019 compensation award does not undermine the wage-loss protection objective of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">A government worker who receives workers\u2019 compensation as a result of an accidental work-related injury but who elects to retire and receive benefits to which he is entitled on account of age and years of service: 1) experiences wage-loss due to age and years of service, not due to injury; and 2) is afforded protection for that wage-loss in the form of an employer paid retirement benefit. Once such a worker elects retirement, the workers\u2019 compensation that he would have received to protect him against what would have been an injury induced wage-loss becomes a dual and duplicate benefit. Limiting the operation of the offset statute to require the governmental employer to continue to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits in that situation does not advance the wage-loss purpose of the Act and runs counter to the fiscal anti-\u201cdouble-dipping\u201d objective of the offset statute. We note also that the Court\u2019s refusal, in <em>Polomski, </em>to read \u201csimilar benefit\u201d language into the adjustment provision of L.E. \u00a7 9-503(d)(2) strongly suggests that the broad legislative objectives of the Act are not undermined or thwarted by allowing offsets and adjustments for government paid length of service benefits against government paid workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Wills\u2019s average weekly wage before retiring after 31 years of employment by Baltimore County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>was $492.08. Under former Art. 101, \u00a7 38(d) and the holding in <em>Newman, </em>after retirement, Wills would receive $629.23 per week from Baltimore County ($329.00 in workers\u2019 compensation plus $300.23 in retirement benefits), which is a sum $137.15 greater than the sum she earned while gainfully employed. By eliminating the word \u201csimilar\u201d from the governmental employee offset provision of the Act, the Legislature precluded that result. In so doing, it protected the public from having to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits for a civil servant whose wage-loss was already protected by publicly funded benefits of another sort. That result is not inconsistent with the purposes of the offset provision or of the Act generally. Indeed, it is consistent with the legislative intention \u201cto minimize the burden on the public treasury that would result from providing duplicate benefits to public employees.\u201d <em>Frank, </em>284 Md. at 661, 399 A.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\"><em>Blevins: </em>Timing of Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Although appellant Jerry Blevins sustained a work-related injury on January 21, 1994, he did not lose any time from work. He was paid at his full salary of $77,000.00 per year until he took a disability retirement on November 16, 1995, at which time he stopped receiving his salary and started to receive disability benefits equal to 66.6% of that salary, tax-free. Several months later, he applied for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which were awarded and partially back-dated. The lower court ruled that the commission erred in refusing to apply the governmental employee offset provision of L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a) to that portion of Blevins\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation award that was back-dated to the period from the day after his injury to the date of his retirement. Blevins now contends that the circuit court erred because the offset does not apply to workers\u2019 compensation benefits that pre.-date the retirement benefits by which they are offset. He is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">In <em>Frank, </em>Judge Digges, writing for the Court of Appeals, addressed a similar argument. There, a Baltimore County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>police officer suffered a work-related injury. At first, he did not lose any time from work and was paid as usual. Six months later, however, he started to lose time from work and decided to take a disability retirement. He retired approximately 8 months after the injury and immediately started to draw disability retirement benefits. At approximately the same time, he petitioned for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. One year later, he was awarded workers\u2019 compensation of a certain sum per week for a period of time beginning on his retirement date. The commission offset the entire award by the officer\u2019s retirement benefit under former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d). The circuit court affirmed the commission\u2019s decision. Before the case was decided by this Court, the Court of Appeals issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Officer Frank argued that the governmental employee offset provision did not apply to his workers\u2019 compensation award, in part because he had contributed to the pension plan from which he was receiving disability benefits. He reasoned that until he was repaid in the form of pension benefits a sum equal to his contributions to the plan, Baltimore County was not paying him a benefit and the offset provision was inapplicable. The Court rejected this argument because, <em>inter alia, </em>it was premised on the \u201cflaw[ed] ... assumption that the benefits of the two plans are only to be compared for the period in which the two will be simultaneously due.\u201d 284 Md. at 661, 399 A.2d 250. The Court explained that the wording of the statute did not comport with the position that Frank was urging upon it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">This argument ... would also require an addition to the statutory language because there is no provision in the act that places a time limitation upon the contrast that is to be made. The statute simply provides for a comparison of the two benefits and, after making such a comparison in this case, we agree with the commission that there is a complete offset.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Blevins contends that the holding in <em>Frank </em>does not apply to this case for two reasons. First, the workers\u2019 compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>benefits being offset in <em>Frank </em>were awarded for a time period after the worker\u2019s retirement date. Here, the workers\u2019 compensation benefits at issue were awarded for a time period preceding, and ending upon, Blevins\u2019s retirement. Second, in <em>Frank, </em>there was a period of overlap between the workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the disability retirement benefits. Here, there is no temporal overlap between the benefits. The workers\u2019 compensation benefits apply only to the period from the time of injury to retirement and the disability retirement benefits apply only to the period from the date of retirement forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">These arguments miss the general principle set forth in <em>Frank. </em>The Court of Appeals held that, even if it assumed that a portion of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits that the officer received pre-dated his disability benefits, the offset provision would apply. The officer\u2019s date of retirement was not central to <em>Frank. </em>To the contrary, the Court\u2019s holding that the amounts of the two benefits were to be compared irrespective of the timing of the benefits made the date of retirement irrelevant to the application of the offset provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The lack of overlap between benefits that Blevins argues distinguishes this case from <em>Frank </em>is not only irrelevant, it is an illusion. The commission awarded Blevins workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the date of his injury forward, into the period of retirement during which Blevins receives disability benefits. Thus, there was a substantial period of overlap of benefits. Under <em>Frank, </em>the entire workers\u2019 compensation award should have been compared to the entire disability retirement award, irrespective of time frame. The commission erroneously divided the workers\u2019 compensation award into pre- and post-retirement date benefits and then incorrectly applied the offset provision by comparing the disability retirement benefits to the post-retirement workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The lack of overlap that Blevins contends distinguishes this case from <em>Frank </em>is thus the product of legal error by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The general principle that was stated in <em>Frank </em>and that is overlooked by Blevins is this: under the language of former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d), the timing of the two benefits being compared has no relevance to the application of the offset. As the Court in <em>Frank </em>made plain, if the Legislature had intended for there to be a temporal component to the comparison, it would have included language to that effect in the statute. In the absence of such language, the two benefits are compared without reference to the timing of the award or the period that they cover.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">When the Legislature recodified former Art. 101, \u00a7 33(d) as L.E. \u00a7 9-610(a), it did not revise the statute to \u201cplace a time limitation upon the contrast that is to be made.\u201d <em>Frank, </em>284 Md. at 661, 399 A.2d 250. Just as the Court in <em>Frank </em>refused to read a time-frame for comparison of benefits into the language of the governmental employee offset provision, we will not do so. Indeed, we must conclude from the Legislature\u2019s presumed awareness of <em>Frank </em>and its demonstrated intention to modify the \u201csimilar benefit\u201d rule in revising the Act that it intended for the law pertaining to the timing of benefits to remain unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\">.
