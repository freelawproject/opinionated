Deitz, Sr. (the \u201cdecedent\u201d) by his son, August S. Deitz, Jr. (Deitz), the estate\u2019s personal representative, and by Peter B. Turney (Turney), counsel for the personal representative. Deitz\u2019s siblings, who were among the beneficiaries named in the decedent\u2019s will, filed a petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County to compel the personal representative and Turney to close the estate and to reimburse them for their attorneys\u2019 fees. The orphans\u2019 court ruled against the personal representative and Turney, but the exact nature of its ruling is not shown by the record. In any event, the matter was appealed to the circuit court where, in a <em>de novo </em>review, Deitz\u2019s siblings received a judgment in their favor, in the amount of $15,439.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The ensuing complex procedural history will be discussed below in detail, but to summarize briefly, as a result of the judgment, Deitz\u2019s wages were garnished at $75.00 per week. When approximately $4,000 had been garnished, Deitz filed a tort action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against his siblings (and also against one sibling\u2019s husband) and their attorneys, claiming that the defendants had tortiously represented to the circuit court in the garnishment proceeding that the judgment they sought to enforce was against \u201cDeitz, individually,\u201d when, according to Deitz, the judgment was \u00e1gainst \u201cDeitz\u201d in his representative capacity. John E. Harris, Sr. (Harris) represented Deitz in the tort action.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">The circuit court (Hinkel, J.) dismissed Deitz\u2019s complaint and granted sanctions against Harris for $12,325.18. Deitz and Harris noted timely appeals, which were docketed as one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>action. Appellants present five questions for our review, which we have condensed and rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">1. Did the trial judge err in not allowing Deitz to relitigate the issues of whether the judgments of the circuit court were against him, individually, and whether he, individually, was a party to the underlying suit filed in the orphans\u2019 court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">2. Did the trial judge err in dismissing Deitz\u2019s complaint for failing to state a cause of action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">3. Did the trial judge err in awarding sanctions against Harris?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"ajx-dedup-0\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">The decedent\u2019s will called for the personal representative to subdivide one of three parcels of real property in the estate. Deitz hired Turney to act as the attorney for the estate. As a result of Deitz\u2019s and Turney\u2019s unsuccessful attempts at subdividing the parcel, the estate remained open more than five years after the decedent\u2019s death. Deitz\u2019s three siblings retained Anthony P. Palaigos and Thomas A. Bowden of Blum, Yumkas, Mailman, Gutman &amp; Denick, P.A. (collectively, \u201cBlum, Yumkas\u201d) to represent their interests as beneficiaries of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">On March 2, 1992, the siblings filed a petition in the Orphans\u2019 Court for Baltimore County to compel \u201cthe Personal Representative and his attorney\u201d to close the estate and to reimburse them for their attorneys\u2019 fees. Deitz answered the petition as \u201cAugust S. Deitz, Jr., Personal Representative, by Peter B. Turney, his attorney.\u201d The orphans\u2019 court granted relief to the siblings. Pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 1989 RepLVol.), section 12-502(a) of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article, an appeal was filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">The circuit court (Bollinger, J.) heard the matter <em>de novo </em>during a two-day trial and entered a judgment on April 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>1993, against the \u201cPersonal Representative\u201d and Turney in the amount of $15,439.90. In the first paragraph of the Amended Opinion and Order, Judge Bollinger stated, \u201cPetitioners aver that their brother, August S. Deitz, Jr., Personal Representative of their late father, in concert with the Personal Representative\u2019s attorney, Peter B. Turney, Esquire, improperly administered the estate, causing unnecessary legal expenses and unnecessary use of estate funds.\u201d The court later stated that it was \u201cconvinced that there [was] both a breach of the fiduciary responsibility of the Personal Representative of the estate and his attorney.\u201d Judge Bollinger entered judgment against \u201cthe Personal Representative and his attorney jointly and severally\u201d for $6,700.00, with interest from March 25, 1993, to reimburse the siblings for additional expenses incurred in attempts to subdivide the property. The siblings had paid Deitz these funds to close the estate, but Deitz had used the $6,700 in order to make additional attempts to subdivide the property even though the orphans\u2019 court previously had ordered him to make no further attempts at subdivision. The court also entered judgment against \u201cthe Personal Representative\u201d and his attorney for $7,905.00 (with interest) to cover the siblings\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and for $834.90 (with interest) to reimburse the estate \u201cfor expenses incurred outside of the fiduciary activity of the Personal Representative and his attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">B. The. First Appeal and Its Immediate Aftermath</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Upon an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, a panel of this Court on February 4, 1994, initially affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. Following a motion for reconsideration, however, the Court found, \u201cAlthough the [lower] court clearly made a finding of both bad faith and a lack of substantial justification as to Mr. Turney, it made no such finding as to Mr. Deitz.\u201d <em>Deitz v. Edens, </em>No. 918, slip op. at 1 (Md.Ct. Spec.App. May 2, 1994). The Court noted, \u201cThis may have been an oversight, for the record indicates that it was Mr. Deitz who was the driving force behind the lack of settlement of the estate, but the omission exists nonetheless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>also stated that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was incorrectly calculated and should have amounted to approximately $4,500. On May 2, 1994, the court vacated the award of $7,905 for attorneys\u2019 fees, which the panel said was \u201c[p]art of the judgment entered by the circuit court ... against <em>August S. Deitz, Jr. </em>and his attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2 (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals denied <em>certiorari. Deitz v. Edens, </em>336 Md. 224, 647 A.2d 444 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">On remand to the circuit court, Judge Bollinger entered a judgment on February 15, 1995, against \u201cthe [defendant, <em>August S. Deitz, Jr. </em>and his attorney, Peter B. Turney, Esquire, jointly and severally,\u201d for $4,500.00 in attorneys\u2019 fees. (Emphasis added.) To summarize, the $4,500.00 judgment was entered against \u201cDeitz and Turney\u201d and the $7,534.90 judgment (comprised of the $6,700.00 and $834.90 judgments) remained entered against \u201cthe Personal Representative and his attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">C. The Second Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Deitz and Turney filed a second appeal to this Court, and, on April 2,1996, a panel of the Court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. <em>Deitz v. Edens, </em>No. 810, slip op. at 7 (Md.Ct.Spec.App. Apr. 2, 1996). The Court rejected appellants\u2019 argument that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter judgments against them. The panel emphasized that Maryland Code section 12-502(a) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article commands that an appeal from an orphans\u2019 court judgment is to be heard <em>de novo </em>and that the circuit court is required to \u201c \u2018give judgment according to the equity of the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Deitz, </em>No. 810, slip op. at 3-4 (quoting \u00a7 12-502(a)(l)). With respect to the $6,700.00, the Court stated that Deitz was liable in his individual capacity because Deitz breached his fiduciary duty. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. The panel opined that the \u201ccircuit court properly entered judgment against <em>Deitz and Turney </em>for failing to comply with the order of the orphans\u2019 court [to forego the subdivision of the property and to close the estate].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7 (emphasis added). Regarding the $834.90, the Court held that this cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201cassessed against <em>Deitz and Turney </em>w[as] entitled to be recovered by the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Finally, with respect to the $4,500.00, the Court stated that \u201c[i]n view of <em>Deitz\u2019s and Turney\u2019s </em>conduct, the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in <em>ordering them </em>to reimburse appellees for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Deitz also argued in the second appeal that the circuit court did not have personal jurisdiction over him because he was named in the petition to the orphans\u2019 court only in his representative capacity. In rejecting this argument, the Court stated that, according to Maryland Rule 2-322(a)(l), the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction must be made before the answer, if an answer is required. <em>Deitz, </em>No. 810, slip op. at 8. Because Deitz raised this defense only on the second appeal, the Court concluded it was not preserved for appellate review. <em>Id. </em>Subsequently, the Court of Appeals denied Deitz\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari. Deitz v. Edens, </em>343 Md. 564, 683 A.2d 177 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">D. The Bankruptcy Court Proceeding and Its Interplay With the Garnishment Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Following the April 22, 1993, judgment in the circuit court against \u201cthe Personal Representative and his attorney,\u201d the siblings filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, a request for a writ of garnishment against Deitz. The writ was issued on July 14, 1993, but it was revised on May 31,1995, to reflect the February 15, 1995, $4,500.00 circuit court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Deitz filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on August 18, 1993, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, which resulted in a stay of the garnishment proceeding. By that point, $300 of Deitz\u2019s wages had been garnished. On October 21,1993, Deitz filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court to recover the wages that already had been garnished. The siblings filed a counterclaim to determine dischargeability of debt (\u201cdebt\u201d referred to the three money judgments against \u201cDeitz\u201d for $6,700.00, $834.90, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>$7,905.00). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Meanwhile, the stay of the garnishment action was annulled by a bankruptcy court order dated March 17, 1995. Deitz moved to alter or amend this order, claiming that the pleadings in the state court that were referenced in the bankruptcy court\u2019s order \u201ccontain[ed] no indication that relief was being sought against the debtor [Deitz] individually\u201d and that the amended order of the circuit court entered judgment only against the \u201cPersonal Representative.\u201d Deitz\u2019s motion to amend the stay also alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">3. Notwithstanding the above, the order of the state court dated Feb. 15, 1995, purports to enter judgment against \u201cthe Defendant, August S. Deitz, Jr.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">4. Whether the action was against the debtor as personal representative, or as an individual, is an issue never raised in that state court action. The order of Feb. 15, 1995[,] was entered by the state court, <em>sua sponte, </em>without notice, hearing, or opportunity for argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">5. That same issue has been specifically raised in this court in the debtor\u2019s motion for summary judgment, briefed on both sides, and scheduled for argument on May 8, 1995.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">The bankruptcy court (Derby, J.) denied Deitz\u2019s motion regarding the stay order on April 18, 1995, saying that \u201cit [is] the intent of this court that all issues of liability and extent be made by the State\u2019s courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">About three weeks later, on May 8, 1995, the bankruptcy court (Hill, J.) held a hearing on Deitz\u2019s complaint, the siblings\u2019 counterclaim, and the cross-motions for summary judgment. The bankruptcy court\u2019s Final Judgment on All Claims, entered on May 15, 1995, denied Deitz\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and in regard to the siblings\u2019 motion, stated that the $6,700.00, $4,500.00,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and $836.90 circuit court judgments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>against <em>\u201cAugust S. Deitz, Jr.,\u201d </em>were not discharged by Deitz\u2019s filing for bankruptcy. In making this ruling, Judge Hill, at the hearing on May 8, noted that the state court found that the debtor breached his fiduciary duties, which made the debt nondischargeable under section 523(a)(4) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (defining exceptions to discharge of debts in bankruptcy). Judge Hill\u2019s order cited the judgments against <em>Deitz </em>in the amounts of $6,700.00 and $836.90 that were contained in the circuit court\u2019s April 22, 1993, order and the judgment against <em>Deitz </em>in the amount of $4,500.00 that was contained in the February 15, 1995 order, and stated that, under the principles of collateral estoppel, the issue of whether there was a breach of fiduciary duty would not be relitigated. Judge Hill\u2019s order also stated, \u201cIf the Courts of the state of Maryland modify these orders <em>to vary the dollar amounts or damages awarded, </em>then and to that extent, this judgment shall be modified correspondingly without further order of this Court.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The bankruptcy court also dismissed Deitz\u2019s complaint and allowed the siblings to \u201ccontinue, enforce, and perfect the judgments of the state court in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy state law.\u201d On June 9,1995, Judge Hill denied Deitz\u2019s motion to amend the final judgment in which Deitz asserted that \u201cthe final judgment is in error to the extent that it authorizes renewal of garnishment proceedings.\u201d In so doing, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order stated that \u201c[ijnherent in a determination of nondischargeabilityt,] in the context of a Chapter 7 case, is the ability of the prevailing party to pursue the enforcement of that judgment to the extent provided by applicable nonbankruptcy state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Deitz then appealed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. In a memorandum opinion dated July 25, 1996, the federal district court (Legg, J.) noted that the state courts found that the debtor breached his fiduciary duties, and \u201cas a result of the state court proceedings, judgments were entered <em>against the Debtor </em>and Turney totaling $12,034.90.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Judge Legg affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision that the principles of collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>estoppel applied and that the debts resulting from a breach of fiduciary responsibility were nondischargeable in bankruptcy. On appeal, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, in an unpublished opinion dated June 11, 1997, affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">E. Proceedings in the Subject Case</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Following the judgment rendered by this Court in Deitz\u2019s second appeal, Deitz filed the complaint in the instant case in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The complaint was filed on July 10, 1996. At this time, Deitz\u2019s motion to amend the final judgment of the bankruptcy court had already been denied, and approximately $4,000 of Deitz\u2019s wages had been garnished. Deitz sued Blum, Yumkas and the siblings, including one sibling\u2019s husband,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging abuse of process, libel, \u201cwrongful attachment,\u201d \u201cfraud on the part of the creditors,\u201d and malicious prosecution. In an amended complaint filed November 27, 1996, Deitz limited his claim to three counts: abuse of process, \u201cwrongful attachment,\u201d and conversion. Deitz claimed that the defendants, in obtaining a writ of garnishment against his wages, misrepresented to the circuit court that he, Deitz, was the judgment debtor. Therefore, according to Deitz, the attachment of his wages was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The defendants moved to dismiss Deitz\u2019s complaint or, in the alternative, to grant summary judgment in their favor because, among other reasons, (1) his claim was barred by the doctrines of <em>res judicata, </em>collateral estoppel, and collateral attack because the Court of Special Appeals, as well as the bankruptcy court, had already determined that the judgments were against Deitz individually, and (2) Deitz\u2019s complaint did not state a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Deitz opposed the defendants\u2019 motion by asserting that (1) he was not a party to the siblings\u2019 petition in the orphans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>court, and (2) the judgment below was against the personal representative. He acknowledged that \u201c[i]f it is decided that the judgment was against [Deitz] as an individual, then he has no eause[s] of action\u201d against any of the defendants in the tort suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Following a hearing on December 23, 1996, the circuit court (Hinkel, J.) \u201cdismissed\u201d the complaint on January 3, 1997. Judge Hinkel opined that the \u201cunderlying issue of individual liability has already been decided adversely to the plaintiff by the Court of Special Appeals.\u201d Deitz\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment was denied on February 3, 1997. Deitz noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">On January 29, 1997, Blum, Yumkas moved for sanctions against Deitz for filing and maintaining this action \u201cwithout substantial justification and with bad faith.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Blum, Yumkas claimed that Deitz sought to relitigate issues he consistently had lost in the prior case, and therefore, the suit was barred by <em>res judicata, </em>collateral estoppel, and collateral attack. Moreover, according to Blum, Yumkas, each of the individual counts failed to state a cause of action. Following a hearing on May 12, 1997, at which time the defendants argued for sanctions against both Deitz and Harris, Judge Hinkel granted sanctions in the amount of $12,325.18 against Harris. He denied sanctions against Deitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Although Judge Hinkel agreed with Deitz\u2019s premise that he had been sued in his representative capacity and not individually, the judge noted that whether this argument was correct made no difference. Judge Hinkel held that the claim was brought without substantial justification because after this Court\u2019s decision of April 2, 1996, there was \u201cin place a judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against August Deitz and Peter Turney individually and jointly and severally. But individually. That\u2019s the law of that case. <em>Cert[iorari </em>] was denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Judge Hinkel continued, \u201cEven if you believe that [Judge] Bollinger and the Court of Special Appeals [were] wrong and the Court of Appeals was wrong in denying cert[iorari], even if you believe all of that, there\u2019s still a <em>valid </em>judgment upon which a judgment creditor can exercise his post judgment rights.\u201d (Emphasis added.) According to the trial judge, Deitz\u2019s attorney, Harris, knew these facts before he filed suit and therefore lacked substantial justification in bringing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Maryland Rule 2-322(c) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7J\">If, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 2-501____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">Notwithstanding the fact that the trial judge\u2019s order granted a \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d the trial judge looked outside the four corners of the complaint and relied upon the determinations made by this Court in the prior action. Therefore, we will treat the trial judge\u2019s order as one granting summary judgment. <em>See Pope v. Board of School Comm\u2019rs, </em>106 Md.App. 578, 590, 665 A.2d 713 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 116, 673 A.2d 707 (1996); <em>Hrehorovich v. Harbor Hospital Ctr., Inc., </em>93 Md.App. 772, 782-83, 614 A.2d 1021 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>330 Md. 319, 624 A.2d 490 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Under Rule 2-501(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">The court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">The trial court\u2019s function on a motion for summary judgment is to assess whether the parties disagree as to any material facts. If such disagreement exists, summary judgment is inappropriate. When determining whether a factual dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>exists, all facts, and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, must be viewed in a light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985). We will affirm an order granting a motion for summary judgment if there are no material issues in contention and if the trial court was legally correct in granting the motion.. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. Lorkovic, </em>100 Md.App. 333, 354, 641 A.2d 924 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">III. THE GRANT OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Deitz\u2019s main contention is that his wages were wrongfully attached because he was not made a party to the siblings\u2019 petition in the orphans\u2019 court. Therefore, according to Deitz, the circuit court, on appeal from the orphans\u2019 court or on remand from the Court of Special Appeals, did not have jurisdiction to enter any judgment against him individually. Deitz concludes by stating that the circuit court not only <em>did not </em>enter judgments against him individually, but given the fact that he was not a party to the action and that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction over him individually, the court <em>could not </em>enter personal judgments against him. Deitz correctly notes that \u201cto sustain a decision for the defendants it must be demonstrated that some court having jurisdiction over Deitz[,] the individual!,] made the decision that he was individually liable per the judgments of April 22, 1993[,] now for $7,534.90, and February 15, 1995, for $4,500.00 in bad faith counsel fees.\u201d We hold that the defendants did make such a demonstration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Two closely related issues are presented in this case\u2014 (1) whether the circuit court judgments were rendered against Deitz, the individual, and (2) whether Deitz, in his individual capacity, was a party to the action brought by his siblings. The bankruptcy court, a court clearly having personal jurisdiction over Deitz, the individual, determined both issues adversely to Deitz, and as such, Deitz is collaterally estopped from relitigating these matters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, \u201c \u2018[w]hen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Murray Inti Freight Corp. v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 547, 555 A.2d 502 (1989) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982) [hereinafter Restatement]). Stated another way, the principal elements of the doctrine require that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">(1) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior litigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">(2) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party in the prior litigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">(3) the issue decided in the prior litigation is identical with the issue presented in the subsequent litigation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">(4) the issue actually litigated was essential to the judgment in the prior action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>See Pope, </em>106 Md.App. at 594, 665 A.2d 713 (1995) (citing <em>MPC, Inc. v. Kenny, </em>279 Md. 29, 35, 367 A.2d 486 (1977), and <em>Graham, </em>315 Md. at 550-52, 555 A.2d 502); <em>see also Esslinger v. Baltimore City, </em>95 Md.App. 607, 627, 622 A.2d 774, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 479, 628 A.2d 1066 (1993); <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Ehrman, </em>89 Md.App. 741, 758, 599 A.2d 875 (1992). Additionally, the party against whom the doctrine is asserted must have been given a fair opportunity to appeal the judgment in the prior action. <em>See Pope, </em>106 Md.App. at 594-95, 665 A.2d 713; <em>see also </em>Restatement \u00a7 28(1) (citing this element as an exception to the availability of the collateral estoppel doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">A. Judgment against Deitz, Individually</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The first three elements of collateral estoppel are met easily in the instant case. There is no question that the judgment of the bankruptcy court was a final judgment on the merits. <em>See </em>Restatement \u00a7 13 (defining \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for purposes of collateral estoppel as including \u201cany prior adjudication of an issue in another action that is determined to be sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect\u201d). Regarding the element requiring an identity of the party against whom collateral estoppel is applied, Deitz was undeniably a party in his individual capacity in the bankruptcy proceeding, and he is a party in the instant suit in the same capacity. Furthermore, the issue of whether Deitz was found individually liable, which Deitz raises in the subject case, is the same issue that was addressed by the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In this case, meeting the fourth element, that the issue was actually litigated and essential to the judgment, is more complex. In arguing to the bankruptcy court that summary judgment should be granted in his favor and that the siblings\u2019 motion should be denied, Deitz contended that the siblings had no right to attach his bank account because the judgments were not against him personally. This issue was decided against him when the bankruptcy court denied his motion on May 15, 1995, and granted summary judgment in favor of the siblings. An issue determined in a grant of summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ment is considered \u201cactually litigated\u201d for purposes of collateral estoppel. <em>See Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund v. Soffas, </em>89 Md.App. 663, 671, 599 A.2d 837 (1991); <em>see also </em>Restatement \u00a7 27 cmt. d.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Judge Hill\u2019s Final Judgment on All Claims stated the judgments in the amounts of $6,700.00 and $836.90 that were contained in the circuit court\u2019s April 22, 1993, order were against <em>Deitz </em>and the judgment in the amount of $4,500.00 that was contained in the February 15, 1995, circuit court order was also against <em>Deitz. </em>Judge Hill relied on the doctrine of collateral estoppel to hold that the issue of individual liability had already been decided against Deitz, and Deitz was not permitted to relitigate the issue in the bankruptcy court. In other words, the bankruptcy court relied on the determinations made by the circuit court and interpreted the circuit court decisions as holding Deitz individually liable. According to the Restatement, \u201c[wjhen an issue is properly raised, by the pleadings or otherwise, and is submitted for determination, and is determined, the issue is actually litigated within the meaning of this [sjection.\u201d Restatement \u00a7 27 cmt. d. The resolution of the issue using the doctrine of collateral estoppel meets this definition of actual litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Deitz\u2019s individual liability was not only actually litigated, but its determination was also essential to the judgment. The judgment of the bankruptcy court could not have been rendered without deciding the issue of Deitz\u2019s individual liability. <em>See Graham, </em>315 Md. at 550, 555 A.2d 502. That is, the bankruptcy court could not have held that Deitz\u2019s wages could be attached to satisfy the circuit court money judgments if the bankruptcy court adopted Deitz\u2019s position that the circuit court judgments were against Deitz but only in his representative capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Lastly, Deitz had the opportunity to appeal the judgment of the bankruptcy court, as well as the judgments of the circuit court. He took that opportunity and lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>B. Deitz, Individually, as a Party to the Underlying Action</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In this appeal, Deitz claims that he was not, as an individual, a party to the orphans\u2019 court action. We hold that this claim is barred. Contrary to Deitz\u2019s assertion, the issue of his party status was actually litigated in the bankruptcy court. In Deitz\u2019s motion to alter or amend the stay order, filed in the bankruptcy court, he judicially admitted that the issue of \u201c[wjhether the action was against the debtor as personal representative, or as an individual\u201d was \u201cspecifically raised in ... the debtor\u2019s motion for summary judgment, briefed on both sides, and scheduled for argument on May 8,1995.\u201d The identical issue is now raised by Deitz in this litigation. The bankruptcy court rejected Deitz\u2019s argument when, on May 15, 1995, it denied Deitz\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted the siblings\u2019 motion. <em>See generally Yamaha Corp. of Am. v. United States, </em>961 F.2d 245, 256, (D.C.Cir.1992) (holding that issue preclusion extends to a matter that the court \u201cmust necessarily, albeit implicitly,\u201d have decided), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1078, 113 S.Ct. 1044, 122 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). Regardless of whether the bankruptcy court was right or wrong in its determination, because that court rejected Deitz\u2019s argument that he was not a party to the siblings\u2019 action, the doctrine of collateral estoppel prevents him from relitigating the issue in this civil suit. <em>See Cassidy v. Board of Educ., </em>316 Md. 50, 64, 557 A.2d 227 (1989) (stating the general rule that if the court in the earlier proceeding had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties an erroneous judgment will not prevent that judgment from barring relitigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In summary, a court with jurisdiction over Deitz, the individual, determined the two issues raised by Deitz. The bankruptcy court determined that he was a party to the siblings\u2019 action and that he was individually hable for the three money judgments that had been entered during the proceedings following his appeal of the orphans\u2019 court judgment. These determinations were essential to the bankruptcy court\u2019s final judgment against Deitz. Deitz, a party to the prior litigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>in the bankruptcy court, is estopped from relitigating these issues in his tort suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">IY. DEITZ\u2019S CAUSES OF ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The trial judge held that Deitz could not state a cause of action for abuse of process, \u201cwrongful attachment,\u201d and conversion against appellees. All three causes of action hinged on whether appellant could prove in the tort suit that appellees had no right to attach his wages because the siblings had no valid judgment against him individually. For reasons spelled out above, the collateral estoppel doctrine prevented Deitz from proving that element of the causes of action. The trial judge, therefore, did not err in \u201cdismissing\u201d Deitz\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">V. SANCTIONS AGAINST HARRIS A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">Maryland Rule 1-341 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\">In any civil action, if the court finds that the conduct of any party in maintaining or defending any proceeding was in bad faith or <em>without substantial justification </em>the court may require the offending party or the attorney advising the conduct or both of them to pay to the adverse party the costs of the proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, incurred by the adverse party in opposing it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">To be substantially justified, the legal position taken must be \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d <em>Newman v. Reilly, </em>314 Md. 364, 381, 550 A.2d 959 (1988); <em>see also Major v. First Va. Bank-Central Md., </em>97 Md.App. 520, 531, 631 A.2d 127, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 480, 628 A.2d 1067 (1993), <em>and cert. denied, </em>334 Md. 18, 637 A.2d 1191 (1994); <em>Johnson v. Baker, </em>84 Md.App. 521, 529, 581 A.2d 48 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>322 Md. 131, 586 A.2d 13 (1991). We review the imposition of sanctions by first examining whether the circuit court\u2019s finding of lack of substantial justification was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d or involved an erroneous application of law. <em>Inlet Assocs. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Harrison Inn Inlet, Inc., </em>324 Md. 254, 267, 596 A.2d 1049 (1991). If this finding was not erroneous, we will reverse the trial judge\u2019s imposition of attorneys\u2019 fees based on this finding only if the trial judge abused his discretion in so doing. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 596 A.2d 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">B. Lack of Substantial Justification</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The trial judge ruled that Harris \u201ctotally\u201d lacked \u201csubstantial justification for the filing of the suit.\u201d Although he noted that there was \u201cnothing in [the orphans\u2019 court] case that indicates that August Deitz was initially sued in anything other than his representative capacity, as personal representative,\u201d he nevertheless concluded that this circumstance was irrelevant once the Court of Special Appeals rendered its decision on April 2, 1996. He also opined that \u201cit was clear to anybody at the time the suit was filed that there was a valid judgment in place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">To make a judgment <em>valid </em>against an individual, more is needed than merely a judgment against that individual. In its April 2, 1996, opinion, a panel of this Court stated that Deitz was too late in raising his defense that the circuit court lacked personal jurisdiction over him, individually.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The law in Maryland is that \u201cthe principles of <em>res judicata </em>[claim preclusion and issue preclusion] apply to a jurisdictional question when that question has actually been raised, litigated and determined in favor of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Tucker, </em>35 Md.App. 710, 713, 373 A.2d 16 (1977). What is not firmly established is what rule applies when a question, raised for the first time on appeal, is not answered on the merits because it is deemed to have been waived due to a failure to present the issue below at the appropriate time. Given this situation, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>agree with Harris that, based on Deitz\u2019s second appeal to this Court (but excluding the effect of the proceedings in the bankruptcy court), the issue of whether he was a party to the siblings\u2019 suit, and whether the orphans\u2019 court or the circuit court had personal jurisdiction over him, as an individual, was still \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d Sanctions should not have been meted out against Harris for his failure to appreciate the possible preclusive effect of the decision by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Nevertheless, in the trial judge\u2019s discretion, the lower court could have considered sanctions for two other reasons, not involving the preclusive effect of the opinion of this Court, <em>viz: </em>(1) the preclusive effect of orders of the bankruptcy court proceeding, and (2) the failure of several counts in the complaint to state a cause of action even if appellants could have shown that the circuit court judgments were not against Deitz personally.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because sanctions were not awarded on those grounds, we remand the case so that the trial court can consider an award of sanctions on these grounds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">C. Calculation of Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The appellees\u2019 motion for sanctions was made not against Harris but against Deitz, his client. The first time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>anyone asked for sanctions against Harris was on the morning of the sanctions hearing when appellees\u2019 counsel, in oral argument, made such a request. A part of the sanctions leveled against Harris was for opposing sanctions. Such an award was improper. It cannot be said that Harris lacked substantial justification in opposing sanctions against his client, Deitz, when he successfully opposed them. <em>See U.S. Health, Inc. v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 116, 132, 589 A.2d 485 (holding that Rule 1-341 \u201cdoes not provide for expenses incurred in asserting the claim [for sanctions] under the rule except, perhaps, to the extent that the offending party resists the claim for counsel fees without substantial justification for doing so\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>324 Md. 69, 595 A.2d 482 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">JUDGMENT AGAINST APPELLANT HARRIS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION;</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">JUDGMENT OTHERWISE AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT BY APPELLANT DEITZ AND TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\">.
