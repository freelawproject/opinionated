On July 25, 1997, the court sentenced Pickett to thirty years incarceration for attempted second degree murder, and merged the remaining convictions. The court suspended all but twenty years of the sentence and also mandated, pursuant to Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 643B, that the first ten years be served without the possibility of parole. Pickett noted an appeal and raises the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">Did the trial court err in allowing the State to \u201cimpeach\u201d its own witness with otherwise inadmissible testimony that appellant admitted to stabbing and robbing a man in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot in June of 1996?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">We find that the trial court erred in admitting the impeachment evidence and, because the court\u2019s error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we reverse Pickett\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">On the afternoon of June 11, 1996, while walking from his Southview apartment to a local shopping center, Donnell Hester was attacked, in an apparent robbery attempt, by a group of teenagers and an older man, their \u201cleader,\u201d whom Hester identified as appellant, Reginald Pickett. Hester testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>fied that appellant stabbed him once before Hester managed to flee to a nearby McDonald\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Hester used the pay phone at the McDonald\u2019s and called 911. As he was waiting for the police to arrive, Hester once again saw appellant in the parking lot. Appellant approached him, took a swing at him, but missed. Hester then saw other members of the group come toward him. He attempted unsuccessfully to flee, but stated that \u201cit seemed like I was grabbed from a whole bunch of different sides.\u201d Hester was then beaten, stabbed repeatedly, and robbed. He testified that he recalled seeing his stolen wallet in appellant\u2019s possession after the beating. Hester later selected appellant\u2019s photograph out of a six-photo array shown to him by police, and identified appellant as the \u201cleader\u201d in the June 11th assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">At trial, the State called to the stand appellant\u2019s sister, Wilhelmina Pickett. She testified that her brother lived with her for three or four weeks in June of 1996. She also acknowledged that her brother frequently associated with a group of teenagers. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney then engaged Ms. Pickett in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Okay. And there came a time ... when you talked to [your brother] and he made some admissions with respect to this incident to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">[Ms. Pickett]: He never. I told you that. He never made none to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Isn\u2019t it a fact that he told you that he stabbed a person multiple times in a\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">[Ms. Pickett]: No, he did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Your answer is no?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">[Ms. Pickett]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Isn\u2019t it a fact that you called Crime Solvers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">[Ms. Pickett]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: And you reported that your brother was involved, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">[Ms. Pickett]: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">* * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Just so the record is clear, ma\u2019am, you\u2019re testifying under oath that Mr. Reginald Pickett never told you that he stabbed a person multiple times in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">[Ms. Pickett]: Reginald Pickett ain\u2019t the one that told me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AiK\">Defense counsel did not cross-examine Ms. Pickett.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The State then called Prince George\u2019s County Police Detective William Chinn. When the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney began questioning Detective Chinn regarding conversations he had with Ms. Pickett, defense counsel objected on the grounds that the State was eliciting inadmissible \u201cdouble hearsay\u201d or, alternatively, impermissible impeachment evidence. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, without claiming to be surprised by Ms. Pickett\u2019s testimony, argued simply that \u201cthe two statements ... directly contradicted each other ... I\u2019m only introducing [Detective Chinn\u2019s] statement as inconsistent to what she said here today.\u201d Without addressing the impeachment argument, the trial court found that the proffered statement satisfied exceptions to the hearsay rule and, accordingly, allowed Detective Chinn to testify to what Ms. Pickett told him.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">Well, I conclude that, in this case, that we really don\u2019t have a hearsay within hearsay situation, that is, Ms. Pickett\u2019s original statement of \u2014 she said to someone else that her brother said. The \u201cher said\u201d part of that could be a hearsay statement, but it is not hearsay, since she\u2019s a witness who\u2019s here, available to testify in court, so she\u2019s an available witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-11\">The second portion of it is hearsay, [but], within the exception, because it\u2019s a statement against interest by the declarant, the defendant in this case, so for those reasons, I\u2019m going to allow the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Detective Chinn then testified, over appellant\u2019s repeated objections, that \u201cMs. Pickett advised [him] that [appellant] and another individual were bragging to her about robbing and stabbing an individual in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot earlier in the month of June.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The only issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erred in allowing Detective Chinn to testify that appellant confessed to his sister his involvement in the stabbing incident. Appellant argues that Chinn\u2019s testimony constituted impermissible impeachment evidence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The Maryland Rules of Evidence provide that the credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness. Maryland Rule 5-607. One method of attacking the credibility of, or impeaching, a witness is to show that the witness has previously made a statement inconsistent with present testimony. Md. Rule 5-616(a)(1). Even if that prior inconsistent statement would otherwise be inadmissible as hearsay, it may be admissible for the limited purpose of impeaching the witness. At a criminal trial, however, there are limits on the State\u2019s power to impeach its own witness by presenting prior inconsistent statements. See <em>United States v. Ince, </em>21 F.3d 576, 579 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">In <em>Spence v. State, </em>321 Md. 526, 583 A.2d 715 (1991) and, again, in <em>Bradley v. State, </em>333 Md. 593, 636 A.2d 999 (1994), the Court of Appeals reversed convictions because the trial court erroneously permitted the State to impeach its own witness and, in so doing, allowed the State to \u201ccircumvent the hearsay rule and parade inadmissible evidence before the jury ...\u201d <em>Spence, </em>321 Md. at 530, 583 A.2d 715. In <em>Spence, </em>the State called to the stand Vincent Cole, Spence\u2019s alleged accomplice, who had pleaded guilty to the robbery charge on which Spence was being tried. During a bench conference, prior to any questioning of Cole, the prosecutor indicated that Cole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>would testify that Spence was not involved in the robbery, but that his purpose for calling Cole was to get-before the jury prior out-of-court statements Cole had made to police officers that inculpated Spence. The prosecutor then requested that the court call Cole as a court\u2019s witness. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the court called Cole and questioned him regarding Spence\u2019s involvement. Cole denied that Spence was involved in the crime. Predictably, the State\u2019s next witness was the detective who interviewed Cole, who was permitted to testify, again over objection, that Cole made an earlier statement to him acknowledging Spence\u2019s involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed Spence\u2019s conviction, holding that \u201c[t]he State cannot, over objection, have a witness called who it knows will contribute nothing to its case, as a subterfuge to admit, as impeaching evidence, otherwise inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 583 A.2d 715. \u201cThe sole value to the State from Cole\u2019s testimony was that it opened the door for the \u2018impeaching\u2019 testimony of Cole\u2019s prior inconsistent statement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In <em>Bradley, </em>the State again knew that its \u201cturncoat\u201d witness would deny making the very statements that the State wished to produce. Nevertheless, the trial court allowed the State to question the witness, elicit the expected denial, and then, over objection, \u201cimpeach\u201d his testimony by calling a police officer to the stand to testify to the witness\u2019s prior, inconsistent, out-of-court statements. Adhering to the rationale of <em>Spence, </em>the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \u201ca defendant is denied a fair trial if the State, with full knowledge that its questions will contribute nothing to its case, questions a witness concerning an independent area of inquiry in order to open the door for impeachment and introduce a prior inconsistent statement.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>333 Md. at 604, 636 A.2d 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Unlike <em>Spence </em>and <em>Bradley, </em>in the case before us, there is no clear statement on the record that would allow us to conclude that the State knew, prior to calling Ms. Pickett, that she would deny her brother\u2019s involvement. Nor do we expect the trial judge to \u201ccrawl inside the prosecutor\u2019s head to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>divine his or her true motivation\u201d in calling a witness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Ince, </em>21 F.3d at 580 (4th Cir.1994). Nevertheless, in determining whether a witness\u2019s testimony offered as impeachment is admissible, or, on the contrary, is a \u201cmere subterfuge\u201d to get before the jury otherwise inadmissible hearsay, the trial court is required, as is the case with any evidence, to weigh the testimony\u2019s probative value against its tendency to prejudice the defendant unfairly or to confuse the jury. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); Md. Rule 5-403;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see also United States v. Webster, </em>734 F.2d 1191, 1193 (7th Cir.1984) (defendant may \u201cargue that the probative value of the evidence offered to impeach the witness is clearly outweighed by the prejudicial impact it might have on the jury because the jury would have difficulty confining the use of the evidence to impeachment\u201d). In these circumstances, the testimony\u2019s probative value is defined as its value for impeachment purposes, that is, its likelihood of actually damaging the witness\u2019s credibility. <em>Ince, </em>at 580-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The prejudicial impact of Detective Chinn\u2019s testimony is self-evident. His statement \u2014 that appellant bragged to his sister about robbing and stabbing someone in the McDonald\u2019s parking lot \u2014 not only serves as a detailed admission of the crimes charged, but also portrays appellant as a ruthless and remorseless thug. As the Fourth Circuit noted in <em>Ince, </em>\u201c[i]t is hard to imagine any piece of evidence that could have ... a greater prejudicial impact than such a supposed naked confession of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 581. Furthermore, the jury was permitted to hear this bald confession from the mouth of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>a police detective, whom the jury is likely to find trustworthy. See <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>475 F.2d 376, 380-81 (D.C.Cir. 1973) (discussing \u201cproblem that jurors tend to attach disproportionate weight to the testimony of police officers\u201d). Finally, Detective Chinn was recounting appellant\u2019s alleged confession through a third person; as such, it was \u201chearsay of the worst variety, incapable of being countered by direct evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Crouch, </em>731 F.2d 621, 624 (9th Cir.1984); see <em>also United States v. Morlang, </em>531 F.2d 183, 190 (4th Cir.1975) (citing <em>Bridges v. Wixon, </em>326 U.S. 135, 153-54, 65 S.Ct. 1443, 1452-53, 89 L.Ed. 2103 (1945)) (\u201cforemost among [the notions of fairness upon which our system is based] is the principle that men should not be convicted on the basis of unsworn testimony\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Given the likely prejudicial impact of Chinn\u2019s testimony, the trial court should have excluded it, absent some extraordinary probative value. Again, because Chinn\u2019s testimony was admitted solely for purposes of impeachment, its probative value must be tested solely in terms of its effectiveness in impeaching Ms. Pickett\u2019s credibility. <em>See Ince, supra, </em>at 580-81. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Chinn\u2019s testimony did very little to impeach Ms. Pickett\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">First, the State had no need to attack Ms. Pickett\u2019s credibility because her testimony did not affirmatively damage the State\u2019s case \u2014 she merely refused to give testimony that the State had hoped she would volunteer. <em>See Id. </em>at 581 (citing 27 Charles Alan Wright &amp; Victor James Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a7 6093, at 515 (1990) (\u201cIf testimony does no damage, impeachment evidence has no probative value.\u201d))<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; and <em>Spence, </em>321 Md. at 531, 583 A.2d 715 (\u201cThe improper prejudicial effect [of the State\u2019s purported impeachment evidence] is obvious.\u201d \u201c[It] was not offered because the State needed to impeach a witness it insisted be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>called \u2014 the hearsay was really being offered as evidence of Spence\u2019s guilt.\u201d) Indeed, much of Ms. Pickett\u2019s testimony was valuable to the State. She helped corroborate Hester\u2019s description of his assailants (a group of teenagers and an older man) by acknowledging that her brother frequently associated with a group of juveniles. She also admitted calling Crime Solvers to report the crime, and even admitted reporting that her brother was one of the culprits. Given the totality of Ms. Pickett\u2019s testimony, we fail to see the justification in allowing the State to attack her credibility simply because she denied that her brother told her that he committed the crime. As we conclude that the probative value of Detective Chinn\u2019s testimony was clearly outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice, we hold that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The State argues that any error resulting from the admission of Detective Chinn\u2019s \u201cimpeachment\u201d evidence was harmless. We disagree. Under the \u201cstrict standard\u201d adopted in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), we are unable to \u201cdeclare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict ...\u201d <em>Graves v. State, </em>334 Md. 30, 43, 637 A.2d 1197 (1994). The principle is well settled that when, as here, the erroneously admitted evidence is the defendant\u2019s confession, we shall \u201cexercise extreme caution before determining that the [error] was harmless.\u201d <em>Bradley v. State, </em>333 Md. at 608, 636 A.2d 999 (quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 296, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 1258, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991)). As Justice Kennedy stated in his concurring opinion in <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. at 313, 111 S.Ct. at 1266,' \u201c[i]f the jury believes that [the] defendant has admitted the crime, it doubtless will be tempted to rest its decision on that evidence alone, without careful consideration of the other evidence in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">The State\u2019s harmless error claim rests largely on its belief that the trial court was able to purge the evidentiary error through limiting instructions. After reviewing the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>efforts to correct the error, however, we disagree. First, the court gave no limiting instruction immediately after Detective Chinn recounted appellant\u2019s alleged confession. As we discuss below, the court\u2019s failure to instruct at this juncture was fatal, for an unequivocal statement directing the jury to disregard Chinn\u2019s testimony altogether, at a minimum, would have been necessary in attempting to cure the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Second, when the court did finally instruct the jury at the close of evidence, that instruction did not, and, we believe, could not have rectified the error. Prior to jury instructions, the State requested instruction number 3:19 of the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions. That instruction reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">PRIOR STATEMENTS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">You have heard testimony that [the witness] made a statement [before trial]. Testimony concerning that statement was permitted only to help you decide whether to believe the testimony that the witness gave during this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">It is for you to decide whether to believe the trial testimony of [the witness] in whole or in part, but you may not use the earlier statement for any purpose other than to assist you in making that decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Defense counsel objected to this jury instruction and, ultimately, the court did not give instruction 3:19 but, rather, instructed the jury generally on the credibility of witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ac0-dedup-0\">In determining what testimony you will find to be true, credible, and believable, you may consider the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">... whether and the extent to which the witness\u2019s testimony in court differed from the statements made by the witness on any previous occasion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">Defense counsel made no objection at the conclusion of jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">The State argues that appellant has \u201cwaived any claim of error\u201d by \u201cfailing to object to the court\u2019s instructions, and ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>by objecting to [pattern instruction 3:19].\u201d We need not decide that issue, however, as we conclude that neither the instruction actually given, nor the instruction requested, would have remedied the earlier admission of improper testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we noted above, had the court directed the jury to disregard completely Detective Chinn\u2019s testimony, our harmless error determination may have been different. On the other hand, any instruction directing the jury to consider evidence for the \u201climited\u201d purpose of assessing the witness\u2019s credibility, as instruction 3:19 does, is inadequate because, as we have concluded, Detective Chinn\u2019s testimony was improper, not only as substantive evidence, but also for its purported impeachment value. If, as we have held, the State had no business impeaching Ms. Pickett\u2019s credibility because her testimony did not damage the State\u2019s case, then an instruction requiring the jury to consider Detective Chinn\u2019s testimony as it bore on Ms. Pickett\u2019s credibility is inapposite. Since the court did not completely exclude the tainted evidence from the jury\u2019s consideration, we are unable to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that \u201cthe erroneously admitted statement \u2018in no way influenced the [jury\u2019s] verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bradley, </em>333 Md. at 608, 636 A.2d 999 (quoting <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d 665). Consequently, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">. We need not decide whether, as a prerequisite to impeachment, the State must demonstrate surprise. We note, however, on the record before us, that the State never indicated that it expected Ms. Pickett to testify that her brother bragged to her about committing the crime. In his opening statement, the prosecutor did not mention Ms. Pickett or her anticipated testimony. More important, Ms. Pickett\u2019s testimony itself, \"I told you that ...
