Hill in one year, with interest semi-annually. To secure the note Hoff and his wife executed, on the same day, to complainant, Fox, as trustee, a deed of trust covering a stock of merchandise and goods in a store on Pennsylvania avenue, \"Washington, D. 0. The schedule attached to the deed after enumerating and describing a number of stoves, ranges,\" &amp;c., described the other mortgaged goods as follows : \u201c Together with a large assortment of general tin ware and house furnishing goods * * * <em>and, every article that may be purchased, by way of replenishing said stock after this date and prior to the payment of the matter secured by said </em>trust.\u201d Ploff, by the terms of the deed, was to be permitted to retain possession of and use the mortgaged property until default made in payment of the note. The deed was recorded on the day of its execution. A short time afterward the complainant'Perreard became purchaser, for value, of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-12\">\u2019 About four months after the execution of this trust, Hoff executed to the defendant Davidson an assignment of all the goods, fixtures, &amp;c., contained in the same store, except those exempt from execution at law, in trust to sell the same, and from the proceeds <em>\u201c </em>to pay <em>pro rata </em>or according to their legal priorities,\u201d all the debts which Hoff then owed. These debts were enumerated in a schedule attached to the assignment and aggregated $3,472.50, the first two being described as follows: E. J. Hill, chattel mortgage, $500; rent, E. Carusi, $600.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>After the execution of this assignment Hoff continued in possession of the store and its contents, and settled all the \u25a0debts mentioned in the schedule at 35 cents on the dollar, \u25a0except the two above given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-4\">On the 30th of August, 1879, Davidson, the assignee, without notice to plaintiff, took possession of all the goods in the store and sold the same at auction for $396.30. Some of the articles sold were among those specifically described in the trust deed to Fox, and the assignment to Davidson ; the remainder had been bought by Hoff subsequently to the date of the trust deed for the purpose of replenishing his stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">At the date of the execution of the. assignment (June 12, 1878), the landlord of the premises had a claim for six months rent at one hundred dollars per mouth, which had not been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">Fox, trustee, and Perreard filed their bill claiming the fund by virtue of their deed of trust, alleging that Davidson intended to divert the money from them, and praying that their right might be established. Perreard also claimed that by the terms of the assignment to Davidson, he, as holder of the $500 note, was made a preferred creditor, and in that \u2022character, if not as mortgagee, he should receive the fund.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">After the bill was filed Mrs. Lowe intervened by petition \u25a0alleging that she was landlord of the premises at the time of the assignment; that she had a lien upon the goods, &amp;c., for ,$300, being three months rent then unpaid, and claiming the whole fund by virtue of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">The case was referred to the auditor to state the distribution of the fund (which had been paid into court) and the assignee\u2019s account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-9\">The auditor in his report, after allowing commissions to the assignee and the expenses of the assignment, awarded the residue to Mrs. Lowe, the petitioning creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-10\">To these allowances and award complainants excepted, and upon the overruling of their exceptions and confirmation of the report they appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-11\">Messrs.

The deed of trust from Hoff to Fox was fraudulent and void as to creditors, and a court of equity will not lend its aid to enforce it. Edgall <em>vs. </em>Hart,\"13 Barb., 380; Selling <em>vs. </em>Kimmel, S. C. D. C., May, 1868; Robinson <em>vs. </em>Elliott, 22. Wall., 513.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-14\">2. The deed of trust being void, complainant is driven to. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>claim, as a creditor, under the assignment to Davidson. The assignment directs the creditors to be paid according to their legal priorities, <em>i. </em>e.rat the time the assignment was executed. At the time the assignment was executed the landlord had a lien upon the stock for three months\u2019 rent in arrears, which commenced with Hoff\u2019s tenancy and prior to the deed of trust to Fox. Therefore, the lien for rent was entitled to priority over the deed of trust. Eev. Stat.', D. C., sec. 678; Webb <em>vs. </em>Sharp, 13 Wall., 1; Fowler <em>vs. </em>Kap-ley, 15 Wall., 828.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-4\">3. Even if the assignment were fraudulent and void as to creditors, this could not help complainant for the deed of trust being void, as already shown, equity will not enforce it, therefore complainant stands in the position of a simple contract creditor who has not obtained judgment and issued execution thereon. Such a creditor cannot come into equity to set aside a fraudulent assignment. Berely <em>vs. </em>Staley, 5 G. &amp; J., 451, 452; Day <em>vs. </em>Washburn, 24 How., 356; Case <em>vs. </em>Beauregard, 99 H. S., 129.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-5\">Mr. Justice Wylie</author>\n<p id=\"AcC\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Under the circumstances of this case and the language of this deed of trust, we are bound to interpret it as authorizing the maker of the deed to carry on his business, and to sell and use the proceeds of the property as he thought proper, and then at the time that the note fell due that the holder of the note secured should be preferred to everybody else in case of a sale of the property by the trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Now, we have decided on former occasions<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that any deed of trust given upon a stock of goods which authorized the party who makes it to use and dispose of the goods at his own discretion is void as against creditors. We are of opinion, therefore, that as against the creditors of Hoff this deed is. invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The next question then in this case is upon the effect as between the holder of the Hill note for $500 and the landlord of the premises, of the words in the assignment \u201c <em>according to their legal </em>priority,\u201d for this Hill debt is recognized by the assignment, although the deed of trust which secured it is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Now, at the date of the, assignment there were three months and more rent due by Hoff to the landlord, and that instrument professes to secure this rent to the amount of $600. If the original deed of trust which secured this $500 note had been valid, that would give it legal priority over the landlord\u2019s claim, but as the deed is void, the question recurs, has it any legal priority by virtue of the general assignment as between it and the claim for rent? The language of that paper does not <em>give </em>it any legal priority or preference of any sort, it is merely provided that it shall be paid <em>\u201caccording </em>to its legal priority.\u201d Well, what is that priority? It derives none from the deed of trust, as that is void, and if it derives none from the deed it is nothing more than an ordinary debt having no priority over any other. But the landlord has a legal priority given him by the statute<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> to the extent of three months\u2019 rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We have concluded, therefore, that the landlord in this case is entitled to his three months\u2019 rent according to the priority given him by law, and that, together with the expenses of the assignment, exhausts the fund.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Smith vs. Kenny, ante, <em>p. </em>12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"ACA\">R.
