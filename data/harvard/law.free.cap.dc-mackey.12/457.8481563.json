His widow assumed the administration of his estate and the guardianship of the child. The rents of the latter\u2019s estate amounted to about S3,500 per annum. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-13\">In June, 1879, the daughter having married, this suit was brought for an account of Mrs. Weser\u2019s guardianship she having been, on the petition of hef daughter, by her husband as next friend, removed from that trust March 1, 1879. The cause was thereupon referred to the auditor of the court, with directions to state an account. The report found a balance of |13,779.44 against the defendant, and the court below entered a decree for the sale of the defendant\u2019s dower interest in her late husband\u2019s real estate for the payment and satisfaction of this balance less the credit obtained by the allowance of several exceptions as to certain items of the account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-14\">From this decree defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-15\">M.

Dower, before assignment to the widow, is not the subject of- sale for the satisfaction of creditors. Jackson <em>vs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Aspell, 20 John., 411.

There would seem to beAprecedent for the action of the court below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-5\">Now, if a widow\u2019s dower before assignment cannot be taken and sold on execution at law, we fail to see any reason why, before assignment, an equity court can take hold of it any more than a court of law ; it certainly is not because the estate or interest is any more tangible in that form than in the other. It certainly will not be seriously maintained here that chancery trustees have more efficient means of <em>effecting </em>a sale of such an interest than the marshal has. In this case the widow was dowable in five separate pieces of property. The proper course for the plaintiff to have taken was, first, to have asked the court to appoint a receiver of the dower interest in this property ; then that the dower be assigned ; and, last of all, that it be sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-6\">2. Permanent improvements are to be charged to the heir and not to the widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-7\">The evidence disclosed the fact that the guardian had expended about $4,000 in permanent improvements upon her ward\u2019s estate. The auditor charged one-third the cost of permanent improvements to the widow. This was error: the whole cost of these improvements should have been charged to the ward. 1 Boper H. &amp; W., 349 ; Park on Dow., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>257 ; Kent, vol. 4, 65 ; 1 Wash.

We are of opinion that both thes\u00e9 questions should be resolved in favor of the <em>appellant; </em>the decree appealed from is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded to \u2019 the court below with directions to recommit the cause to the auditor with instructions to charge the cost of all permanent improvements to the heir, and to re-examine his account on the other points excepted to and which were overruled in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
