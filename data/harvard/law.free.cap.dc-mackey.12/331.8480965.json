The first count set out that plaintiff was the tenant in possession of premises known as 905 D street, in the city of Washington, which were supplied'with gas pipes and fixtures connected through a metre with the main pipe in the street, in front of said premises, for the purpose of having the same lighted for the use and accomodation of the plaintiff, and that the defendant, without just cause, on the 17th December, 1877, cut off the flow of gas to said premises, and has failed to supply plaintiff with gas since, though often requested so to do, whereby he has sustained great loss and damage. The second count alleges that plaintiff having his said premises so supplied with gas fixtures connected with the main pipe belonging to defendant, and not being indebted in any way for gas consumed on said premises, the defendant, without just cause or right, on the 17th day of December, ^1877, cut off' and stopped the flow of gas through said pipd and fixtures, and has refused since to turn on the gas, or allow the same to flow through said pipes.

A. Linger, a witness produced and svrorn in its behalf, that he, said witness, was a wholesale manufacturer of mattresses, in the city of Washington, and used coal oil whenever he worked in said manufacture at night' having no gas at his place of manufacture \u2014it appearing upon cross-examination of said witness that he did not work much at night, and did a very small retail business \u2014 and defendant rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Whereupon the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-4\"><em>First. </em>That there was no obligation, on the part of defendant, to furnish plaintiff with gas, aside from the contract between it and said plaintiff, and that no such obligation can be implied from the fact that the premises in question were supplied with pipes and fixtures connected with defendant\u2019s main, and that the relations between plaintiff and defendant in respect to the supplying of gas originate in, and are to be controlled by, the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-5\"><em>Second. </em>That if the plaintiff for the purpose of obtaining-the defendant\u2019s gas, signed a contract wherein he agreed that defendant might at any time discontinue the supply of\" gas to him (plaintiff) when he became, or was delinquent in the payment of any debt he might owe defendant for its gas, -whether used upon, or supplied to, the premises then occupied by him or any other, and that plaintiff, being SO' indebted, refused to pay such debt, then \u2014 under the contract in question \u2014 defendant had a right to discontinue the supply of gas to the said plaintiff at the premises then occupied by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-6\"><em>Third. </em>That if plaintiff', when the gas was discontinued, could have used some other light, and did not, defendant could not be made responsible for any loss arising from plaintiff\u2019s neglect to use such other light, notwithstanding-that the use of such other light might be accompanied with danger or inconvenience.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>That if plaintiff', by the payment of the sum of $10.25 \u2014 the amount due from him for gas consumed at 819 Tenth street \u2014 could have obtained a supply of gas at the premises 905 D street, and did not do so, but preferred to abandon his business, either in whole or in part, defendant is not responsible for any loss arising from plaintiff\u2019s refusal to pay such indebtedness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b348-8\"><em>Fifth. </em>That if a waiver of the right of defendant to collect the amount in arrears at 819 Tenth street, by discontinuing gas to plaintiff is to be presumed from the fact that defendant entered into a new contract with plaintiff, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>such arrears wrere unpaid, the effect of such waiver is done away with by the notice given to plaintiff by defendant that the supply of gas would be discontinued at premises No. 905 I) street, unless such arrears were paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-4\">Which said several instructions so prayed by defendant, the court then and there refused to give, to which refusal the defendant, by its counsel, prayed leave to except, and that the court would sign this, its bill of exceptions, according to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and which is accordingly done this 11th day of March in the year 1881.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-5\">[seal.] Arthur Mao Arthur,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b349-6\">\n<em>Justice.</em>\n</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b349-8\">W. B. Webb for defendant (plaintiff in error) :</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoo\">The declaration in this case proceeds distinctly upon the aground of a breach of duty on the part of the defendant. No contract is set out, and it is not insisted any where, either in the pleadings or in the proofs, that the damages claimed result from the breach of any express contract on the part of defendant to furnish the plaintiff with gas. The charge is that \"''the plaintiff occupied premises.supplied with gas pipes and fixtures connected through a meter with defendant\u2019s main, . and was entitled to have them supplied with gas by defendant, and that defendant, without right, and without the consent of the plaintiff, cut off the gas from the said premises, and has refused to renew the supply, though requested so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b349-13\">As far as the matter of a contract is concerned, it makes 'a/1 H &gt; difference that the plaintiff was not indebted to the d,e-'A }i\\ endaut, as is alleged, at the time the flow of gas was discofir \u00ed - ^ tinued to his premises. The fact remains, there was no\\ contract alleged and none proved on the part of plaintiff It is submitted that under these allegations the plaintiff must recover, if he recover at all, for the breach of a duty imposed upon the defendant either by express law, or arising out of the peculiar relations existing between it and its customers. <em>There can be no recovery under the pleadings, in this case, ut auy implied contract. </em>Under these circumstances, the\u201e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>question to be considered is raised by the first instruction asked of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-4\">In this, the court is asked to instruct the jury that there is no obligation on the part of the defendant to furnish gas to the plaintiff, and that such obligation cannot be inferred from the fact that the premises occupied by him were furnished with fixtures connected by pipes with defendant\u2019s main.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-5\">Both in this country and in England this very question has been before the courts in several cases, and it has been uniformly held that there is no such obligation resting upon the manufacturers of illuminating gas. See the cases following : McCune <em>vs. </em>Norwich City Gas Co., 30 Conn., 522 ; Pattison Gaslight Co. <em>vs. </em>Brady, 3d Dutcher, 246 ; The Hod-deson Gas and Coke Co. <em>vs. </em>Haselwood, 6 C.

Bigelow for plaintiff (defendant in error):</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-7\">The record consists of the pleadings, a partial statement of the evidence, and the defendants\u2019 five rejected prayers. The first of which is comprehensive enough to cover the whole case, no matter what the proofs were. It contains the proposition that the defendant is under no obligation to furnish the plaintiff gas, by reason of anything contained in its charter. Sec. 7 (9 U. S. Statutes at Large, p. 722, July 8, 1848) provides: \u201cThat the president and directors shall have full power and authority to manufacture, make and sell gas, to be made of coal oil, tar, peat, pitch or turpentine, or other material, and to be used for the purpose of lighting the city of 'Washington, or the streets thereof, and any buildings, manufactories or houses therein contained and situate,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-8\">Under such a provision in the charter o\u00a3 a gaslight company a mandamus will lie in behalf of a citizen who has complied with the general rules and regulations of the company, to compel it to furnish gas.

This is the main Object of the charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-4\">2. The remaining four prayers are subject to the same objection, viz.: The record does not purport to contain all the evidence in the case. In point of fact, it contains only a partial statement of the testimony of the plaintiff, and no statement at all of the testimony of several witnesses. It does not appear by the record when the gas bill at No. 819 Tenth street was paid, or what the bargain or agreement was between Lloyd and the owner of the premises in reference thereto, or whether the owner was jointly obligated with Lloyd to pay the same to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-5\">\u201c When the bill of exceptions does not purport to set out all the evidence, the appellate court will presume that a general affirmative charge was justified by the evidence.\u201d School Commissioners v. Goodwin, 30 Ala., 242. Fleming v. Ussery, lb., '282.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">When a bill of exceptions does not purport to contain all of the evidence, the court will not examine to see if it sustains the verdict, but will presume that there was other and sufficient evidence to support it. Peoria, &amp;c., R. R. Co. <em>vs. </em>Mclntire, 39 Ill., 298; Central R. R. Co. <em>vs. </em>Garish, lb., 370.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-7\">Hence it is utterly impossible to say whether the jury was influenced one way or the other by the ruling of the court. The grounds not covered by the second, third, fourth and fifth prayers are amply sufficient to warrant the verdict. The doctrine of the third prayer is found in the first, and means simply that under no circumstances outside of a special contract to that effect, is the defendant bound to supply gas to the plaintiff. Because the verdict may be justified by the law and the evidence not in the record, arises the rule of law that an appellate court, in such a case, will presume that a general affirmative charge was given justified by such evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-8\">3. The question whether the defendant, under its charter, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>haB the right to adopt .a.rale to-visit the default \u2022 of' one of its gas consumers at his dwelling, situate in one part of the. city, upon his place of business situate in another part of the city, and where there has been no default, is presented in the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-4\">Under its charter-and its'amendments this- gas company can make all necessary rules-that are reasonable. The company may be the judge of whether a rule is necessary\u00bf but whether it can be reasonable is for the court to determine. The court below very properly considered- The company\u2019s-third rule, reserving to itself the right to cut off its gas at the place of bnsiness for a default' at\"the dwelling-house of a consumer, to be unreasonable and <em>ultra-vires. </em>\u25a0 But as before stated, however the court may resolve it, the solution cannot disturb the verdict and judgmeii't'iii the-Case.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b352-5\">Mr. Justice Jambs</author>\n<p id=\"ABd\">delivered the opinion, of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">This suit is brought to recover damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff\" in consequence of the cutting off the gas from his establishment on I) street in this city, by the. defendant, The Washington Gaslight Company. It appears that the plaintiff\" had been residing at a house in another portion of the city, and that he had left there without paying his gas bill. When he moved into his I) street place of business he signed a contract, which will be mentioned presently,, with the gas company, for the supply of gas to that place. The company discovering that the plaintiff\u2019s bill for gas furnished at his Tenth street house was still unpaid, demanded payment of this bill and threatened in the event of his failure to do so, to discontinue the supply at his store. The plaintiff\" refused to pay the bill. As a consequence the company turned off\" the gas, claiming the right to do sounder the following contract, which was signed by the plaintiff\":</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cWe whose names are hereunto subscribed, agree to take gas from the Washington Gaslight Company upon the condition that the company reserves to itself the right to refuse to furnish or- at any time to discontinue gas to any premises, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>bbe'-owneit. or?,occupant ..of, which shall -be indebted to the .company-for, gas- or fittings, used upon such premises or else-,w.here.\u2019&gt; <em>\\y</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-3\">- \" The defendant, claimed tliat this contract gave it the rigM to. .turn off, the gas after it . had entered-upon a contract for its supply, because.of the previous delinquency occurring' ber fore .the-execution, of this, .contract and at another place. We have looked carefully at the terms of this contract and ,we-.are .of.-the opinion that it does not embrace such a case: .\"We think the, words are to. be construed as relating toa delinquency,that .should, occur in the.future and not one having.already occurred..</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u25a0The qompany,,then,.having agreed to supply, the plaintiff with gas and entered upon the execution of that agreement, afterwards violated it by stopping the supply. We think this was a-breach of contract for which they are liable. Whether the amount of damages assessed by the jury is excessive .or not, the record does not .permit us to inquire into, and-the, judgment of the court below must therefore be affirmed. , . \u25a0 \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"A3Z\">Mr. - Justice' Wylie,\u2019</author>\n<p id=\"ABT\">dissenting, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">. This \u2022 case: presents- the . question whether a man who moves about from one house to another and runs away without paying his gas bill can compel the gas company to furnish him with gas at every new removal without-being obliged to pay his old bill. The plaintiff here was in default to the gas company for a bill on his Tenth street house The company then gave him notice that u-nless he paid this bill it would turn off the gas from his D street place. The plaintiff\" refused to pay and the company accordingly shut off the supply of gas, and the court have allowed him to recover damages upon this state of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">It may be said that, because this gas company carries on a business analogous to that of a common carrier, it is obliged to furnish gas to every person who applies for it ; and yet it is laid down by all the authorities that even a common carrier may, for good reasons, refuse to carry for certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>persons. Suppose that A, having Had His goods transported, should refuse to pay the freight after delivering at their place of destination, and then a few days after should offer for ship-roient another lot of goods to the same carrier. The latter might well say: \u201cPay for what we have already carried, and we will carry these.\u201d But A answers: \u201cNo, you are a common carrier, and you must carry all the goods that I want you to whether I pay you the former bill or not.\u201d Now will any court in a case of that kind mulct the carrier in damages because it refuses to carry for a man who refuses to pay his freight bill. I think there is no such law' as would require that. I put my dissent to this decision of the court, upon grounds entirely independent of the special contract entered into by the parties. My learned brethern are of the opinion that this contract relates to the future entirely. I think, however, a fair construction of that agreement would bring this case within it, but I do not insist upon that. I base my opinion upon general principles. The business of a gas company is in some respects like that of a common carrier, and a common carrier is not bound to carry a man\u2019s goods indefinitely who refuses to pay up for past dues. And this company, I think, had a perfect right to say to this man, \u201cWe will not continue to furnish you with gas unless you pay up your arrears.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
