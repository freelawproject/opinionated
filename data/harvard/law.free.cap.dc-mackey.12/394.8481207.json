It shows that \u201c after the evidence had been given as set forth in the foregoing bills of exception, * * * the plaintiffs announced that they rested their case. Thereupon the defendant prayed the court to instruct the jury that upon the whole evidence their verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d The bill further sets forth certain reasons on which the court based its conclusions, and then adds : \u201cAnd the court, therefore, gave to the jury the instruction prayed, and the jury, under instruction, returned a verdict ?br'the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">It is not stated in terms that the bills of exception contain the \u201c whole \u201d of the evidence admitted at the trial; but a statement that the plaintiffs rested their case \u201c after the evidence had been given as set forth in the foregoing bills \u201d may be accepted as equivalent, besides, a presumption that other evidence was given by the plaintiffs would be a presumption against the decision of the court ; in other words, that error had been committed ; and this is not admissible. The bills of exception describe the evidence, of course, only as \u201c tending to show ;\u201d but the instruction to \u2018the jury answers the same purpose as a demurrer to evidence, and should be tested by the same rule. <em>\u201cA </em>demurrer to evidence admits not only the facts stated therein, but also every conclusion which a jury might fairly and reasonably infer therefrom.\u201d Parks v. Ross, 11 How., 362, (373); Richardson v. The City of Boston, 19 How., 263, (268). In accordance with this rule we. have to state the facts established at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">At the beginning of the late war the State of Texas was the holder of certain bonds which had been issued to it by the United States under the act of Congress approved September 9, 1850, (9 Stat., 446.) During the war these securities were transferred by a certain military board to certain persons, for the purpose of enabling the State to carry on hostilities against the United States, and some of them were delivered to a firm known as White &amp; Chiles, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>still remained within the United States; the residue had been delivered to one Swisher, and were by him sent to England, -where they were held, partly, by the house of Droege &amp; Co., and partly by the Manchester Bank. The Supreme Court of the United States, by its decree in a certain litigation, established the invalidity of the transfer by the military board to White &amp; Chiles of the bonds held in the United States. Thereupon Chiles set up title to all the bonds then held abroad, under a distinct contract made, as he alleged, between the military board and himself alone,, and served notice of his pretension upon Droege &amp; Co. and the Manchester Bank. Neither of these parties claimed any title to or interest- in the bonds held by them, and the adverse claim of Chiles \u201c constituted the single obstacle- and impediment \u201d to their recognition of the right of the State of Texas to reclaim the securities. Meantime, after the decree of the Supreme Court against White &amp; Chiles, and in the year 1873, Mr. Davis, then governor of Texas,, employed the plaintiffs to prosecute, in the United States. Court of Claims, a suit against the United States, in the name of the State of Texas, for the recovery of proceeds of the bonds which had been tranferred to England, upon a contingent compensation of 20 per centum of what might be recovered to the State by means of that suit. What was done with that suit beyond bringing it is not shown. Afterwards, on June 2,1874, a written contract was made between Kichard Coke, as Governor of Texas, and J. D. Giddings, and the defendant in the following words :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">\u201cThe State oe Texas, Executive Oeeioe,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201c AustiN, <em>June </em>2,1874.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201cThese presents show that J. D. and D. C. Giddings have been appointed agents for the State of Texas to pursue, by suit, all persons having claims adverse to the State of Texas to all or any part of the United States five per cent, bonds known as Texas Indemnity Bonds, which passed out of' the possessson of Texas, by means of the operation of the military board; the said J. D. and D. C. Gid-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>dings being also authorized to compromise with said adverse claimants upon such terms as may be approved by the-Governor of Texas. It is further shown that said J. D. and D. C. Giddings are to receive, as compensation for their services, a contingent fee of ten per cent, for all sums of money recovered and actually received under their said appointment, by compromise, and are to receive twenty per cent, on all sums recovered and actually realized by suit and no more ; and said per cents, respectively, are to cover all costs and expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees, whether accrued heretofore or to be incurred hereafter, so as to give the State of Texas all of the money so to be obtained, save and except-the ten per cent, and twenty per cent, aforesaid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-3\">\u201cSigned by both parties, the 2d day of June, A.

Seueey.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">This contract was made by J. D. Giddings diming the absence of the defendant, who, upon his return, surrendered it to the governor, and on the 13th day of October, 1874, the following was endorsed thereon by the governor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">\u201cExecutive Oeeioe,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">\u201cAustin, <em>Oct. </em>13,1874.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">\u201c Whereas apprehensions have been expressed by J.

D. and D. C. Giddings. On that date, June 2d, 1874, Governor Coke communicated to the plaintiffs his desire to appoint an agent for the State in respect of the bonds, provided it could be done without consuming too large a proportion of what might be received in attorneys\u2019 fees, and his further wish that the Giddings might co-operate with the plaintiffs in securing a recovery for the State ; and on the 3d day of the. following September he advised the plaintiffs that, though the Giddings had been so appointed, with power to compromise and adjust controversies relating to the bonds, \u201cthey were but the outside aids of the counsel conducting the litigation, and were not designed to vary or interfere with the prosecution of such litigation by such counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Up to this point there is no evidence of any other employment of plaintiffs than that under the contract with Governor Davis, to prosecute in the Court of Claims the-suit against the United States for the recovery of the proceeds of the bonds, upon a contingent compensation of 20 per cent, of what might be recovered <em>by means of that suit-</em>These communications from Governor Coke recognize continued employment, and it may be claimed that they are evidence from which the jury might fairly have inferred a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>mew and different employment. But it is to be observed tbat the terms of such inferred new employment are not shown, \u25a0and that there is nothing from which it can be inferred that they differed from those of the contract with Governor Davis. It must be assumed, therefore, that if plaintiffs were already employed in September to conduct any other proceeding than the suit in the Court of Claims, it was upon a compensation contingent upon recovery by <em>direct </em>effect of such proceedings. As nothing appears to have been collected or recovered in this way, neither the original employment by Governor Davis, nor such inferred new employment by Governor Coke can make any figure in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">But it appears that afterwards in November and December, 1874, they were specifically employed on behalf of the State of Texas by Governor Coke, to conduct other and further proceedings in the Supreme Court of the United States, for the purpose of removing and avoiding the new pretension .and title set up by Chiles to the bonds held in England under the pretended contract between the military board and himself individually ; that at the time of this new employment Governor Coke was informed by the plaintiffs that nothing could be collected by process or execution upon any decree or judgment which might be obtained against Chiles under these further proceedings, but that the object and value of these proceedings would consist wholly in so binding Chiles as to prevent his further adverse assertion of claim to the securities, and in enabling the State, in consequence of such prevention, to obtain the bonds, or their proceeds, held in England. Accordingly, it was agreed in this new contract that, in case the State should succeed in obtaining the bonds so held in England, or their proceeds, by means of the aid and assistance which might be furnished through such further proceedings, about to be conducted by the plaintiffs, they should receive, for their compensation, twenty per centum of what might be so obtained by the State. Under this contract the plaintiffs did prosecute, in the Supreme Court of the United States, such further proceedings that, on the 29th day of March, 1875, by the judgment of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>court, Chiles was adjudged guilty of contempt, in setting up* claim to the bonds held in England, and ordered to pay fine of $250, and to stand committed until that fine' Was-paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\">Governor Coke requested the plaintiffs to communicate1 directly with him or with the Giddings in the course of' the1 conduct of said business, and plaintiffs did communicate witK'1 the latter, and the Giddings were informed as to all legal proceedings taken by plaintiffs, and urgently requested the \u00a1plaintiffs to take such action in the premises as would dispose-of the claim set up by Chiles, so that the obstruction of that-claim to a settlement with the holders of the bonds might be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">It next appears that the defendant,- proposing to go to1 England, and, if no settlement could' be1 had, to bring suits there against the holders of the- bonds-,- called on Governor Coke for funds to pay fees and costs of suit, and declined to' incur the costs and expenses of sueh an undertaking; when Governor Coke, replying that he had no money for that purpose, made the following proposition:' \u201c If you will go, and advance your expenses, costs, and whatever is necessary, and bring it to a close during my administration, I will see that you are paid a just and fair compensation, independent of all contracts; -but if you fail, I will not agree for the State to pay anything.\u201d Upon the contract thus modified the defendant undertook the trip to Europe. On July 24th, 1875, he did go to Europe, for the purpose of effecting a settlement with the holders of the bonds; having, prior to his departure, been furnished by the plaintiffs, with a view to that end, with duly certified copies of the various proceedings conducted in the Supreme Court in relation to the bonds. He succeeded in collecting bonds, and proceeds of bonds, to an amount equivalent to $339,240]; and this collection was effected solely in consequence of the judgment obtained for the State in the Supreme Court against Chiles, for the contempt above mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Before his departure, the defendant was fully informed of plaintiff\u2019s contract with Governor Coke, and that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>claimed, under that contract, 20 per cent, of what might be collected upon the bonds in England; and both before and after his return to America, the defendant promised the plaintifl's that he would hold, and not pay over to the State or to the Governor, the fund thus collected, until that compensation due plaintifl's for their services should be paid; and he informed the plaintifl's that the Governor had given, him the assurance that all fees might be paid from the fund1 collected, before the same should be paid to the State. A settlement, however, was made between defendant and Governor Coke, on the 21st of October, 1875, in the following manner: The Governor determined that, of the fund collected by defendant, the State should receive $300,000, and that the residue, $39,240, <em>\u201c </em>should be' dedicated and appropriated to pay all costs and char'ges, and all attorney and counsel fees that might be due by the State to the several counsel and attorneys engaged in the service of the State,\u201d in respect of the bonds collected; and thereupon the defendant, at the Governor\u2019s request, paid over to the State the sum of $300,000; and, upon the defendant\u2019s request that the governor should determine what proportion of the residue the Messrs. Giddings should retain for themselves, the governor adjudged to them the sum of $31,240, and to the plaintifl\u2019s, $8,000. The defendant retained possession of the whole $39,240 for some months, and then delivered $8,000 to the governor, still retaining the residue. In the end, the plaintiffs accepted the $8,000, and executed to the State a receipt in full for all demands against her. As counsel for the plaintiff's has suggested, the circumstances under which this receipt was required need not be stated here, since they make no figure in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">It is claimed by the plaintiffs that upon this evidence\u2014 which we have stated as facts only on the theory of a demurrer to evidence \u2014 two contracts are established, namely: 1st. A contract made by the defendant directly with the plaintiff's to retain and pay over to them the compensation for which they stipulated with the State; and, 2d. A contract made by the defendant in terms with the State, but for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>benefit of the plaintiffs; and that the-first of these is set up in the special count, but that a recovery may be had upon either of them under the common count alone, on the ground that both have been completely executed on the part of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The theory of the first of these contracts, insisted upon by the plaintiffs, is, that the evidence has established the following facts: First, an actual promise, made by the defendant some time in the year 1875, that he would retain and pay l over to the plaintiffs the compensation for which they had [^stipulated with the State; second, that the services rendered' by the plaintiffs in the proceeding against Chiles were the consideration by which this promise was supported, and that these services were a sufficient consideration, because they \\ constituted a- benefit conferred by the plaintiffs on the f .defendant \u25a0 at the defendant\u2019s request; and third, that the' I promise was made with the consent of the State of Texas, i to which the moneys so to be held and paid over belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"Adg\">The evidence \u2014 and on the theory of a demurrer to evidence, the fact \u2014 was that the defendant promised that he would \u201c <em>hold </em>\u201d the fund collected in Europe, and \u201c <em>not fay it over to the State </em>\u201d until the compensation due the plaintiffs should be paid, and that he informed the plaintiffs at the same time that the governor had given him the assurance that all fees might be paid from the fund. Rec., 16. A promise to retain the moneys of the State, and a promise to pay a pai't of them over to the plaintiffs involve widely different degrees of control over the fund, and the difference between them is important in this case. \u00a5e think that this record discloses no evidence on which a jury would have a right to find that the defendant undertook to do anything more than to hold and not pay over to the State the fund collected in Europe ; and that there is no evidence of a promise to pay over to the plaintiffs a part of this fund. Clearly there is no express promise to that effect, and we think there is nothing in evidence from which such a promise can fairly be inferred. An inference that he promised to pay over to them out of this fund, the fees for which they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>stipulated with the State, without an ascertainment and adjustment of those fees between the State and the plaintiffs, would be unreasonable, for he would certainly have no right to act, in disposing of the State\u2019s moneys, upon the information given him by the plaintiffs that their compensation was to be 20 per cent, of that fund. The supposed proceeding necessarily contemplated a meeting of all the parties for the purposes of ascertainment and adjustment of the fees, and this, of itself, would define and limit the legal intent of the contract, and would show it to be a contract simply to retain the fund until the governor, by uniting with the plaintiffs in this settlement, should in effect consent hereafter that plaintiff\u2019s fees should be paid out of the fund in defendant\u2019s hands. And this again would show that the promise contemplated that such paymexft should really be made, not by him but by the governor of Texas. Now. if defendant\u2019s promise was simply to retain the fund, his breach of contract would consist of failing to do so, and of paying it over to the State before plaintiffs\u2019 fees were settled by the State ; and he would be liable only for the injury caused to the plaintiffs by such breach. That injury must arise from their consequent inability to collect their fees from the State. They have themselves shown, however, that they afterwards settled with the State, with full knowledge of the defendant\u2019s violation of contract, and received the sum of $8,000, for which they gave to the State a receipt, \u201c acknowledging the same to be in full for all demands against the said State, in and about the recovery. of the said bonds.\u201d Ve think that this settlement, although it may not affect their claim upon the other contract set up by them, does defeat any action upon this contract, as construed by us, for damages arising from defendant\u2019s failure to hold the fund until plaintiffs\u2019 fees should be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">It is next insisted that the services rendered by the plaintiffs in the proceeding against Chiles constituted a benefit conferred' by the plaintiffs upon defendant at his request,, and, therefore, furnished a consideration which supports the; subsequent promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>A somewhat curious and important question here presents itself, which, does not appear to have been well settled yet. If these services were in fact the very services which the plaintiffs were already bound to perform by virtue of a subsisting contract with the State of Texas, were they capable of serving as the consideration for any promise by the defendant, notwithstanding they might result, and did result,^ in a benefit to him? \"We have examined several cases bearing upon this question. In Shadwell <em>vs. </em>Shadwell, Ex\u2019r, 30 Law J. Rep. Com. Pls., 145, which was heard in the Common Pleas in 1860, the declaration stated that the testator in his lifetime, in consideration that the plaintiff' would marry E, N., promised plaintiff in the terms contained in the following letter: \u201c I am glad to hear of your intended marriage with E. N.; and as*I promised to assist you at starting, I ana happy to tell you that I will pay to you one hundred and fifty \u25a0pounds yearly during my life,\u201d &amp;c. To this were added the proper averments to entitle plaintiff to an aotion. The executors pleaded that, before and at the time of the supposed promise, the said marriage was, without any request on the' part of the testator, but at the request of the plaintiff, agreed upon between plaintiff and E. N., of which the testator had notice ; that after this agreement the marriage was actually had at the request of the plaintiff and without the request of the testator, and that, except as expressed in the letter set forth in the declaration, there never was any consideration for testator\u2019s promise. To this plea the plaintiff replied that the promise was in writing, setting out the letter in full, and averred that the plaintiff\" afterwards married E. N., relying on testator\u2019s promise contained in that letter. The case was heard on demurrer to the replication. It -was urged on the part of the defendant that the marriage was referred to in the letter as an obligation already incurred by the plaintiff; and that, therefore, the consideration on which the testator\u2019s promise was based, was a consideration that the plaintiff should do what he was already bound to do, and that was not sufficient. Erie, C. J., and Keating, J., held that a sufficient consideration appeared. Byles, J., dissented. In delivering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the opinion of the majority, Erie, C. J., said: <em>\u201c </em>The consideration must appear in the writing containing the promise, that is, in the letter of 11th of August, 1838, and in the surrounding circumstances to be gathered therefrom, together with the averments on the record. The circumstances are that the plaintiff had made an engagement to marry E. N., <em>his uncle 'promising to assist him at starting, </em>by which, as I understand the words, he meant on commencing his married life. Then the letter containing the promise declared on is said to specify what the assistance would be, namely, one hundred and fifty pounds per annum during his uncle\u2019s life ; * * * and a further averment, that the plaintiff', relying upon his promise, did marry E. N.\u201d Byles, J., dissenting, said: \u201c The well-known cases which have been cited at the bar in support of the position, that a promise, based on the consideration of doing that which a man is already bound to do, is invalid, apply to this case ; and it is not necessary, in order to invalidate the consideration, that' the plaintiff\u2019s prior obligation to afford that consideration should have been an obligation to the defendant. It may ha.ve been an obligation to a third person. The reason why the doing what a man is already bound to do is no consideration, is not only because such a considerations in judgment of law of no value, but because a mah can hardly be allowed to say the prior legal obligation was not his determining motive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">The majority of the court forbore to discuss the\" question^ whether the doing of an act which the plaintiff\u2019 was already f bound to do was of itself a sufficient consideration for a/ promise by a third party, and clearly went on the grounds that other circumstances were so connected with and added! to this act, as to show that this was not the sole considera-j tion. Byles, J., excluded those circumstances, holding thatj the consideration was reduced to this act alone, and was, therefore, insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Two months .later the case of Scotson <em>vs. </em>Pegg, 6 Hurl. &amp; N., 295, was heard in the Exchequer. The promise there delared on was in consideration of the delivery by the plaintiffs of certain coals from their ship. The defendant pleftdad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>that, when he made this promise, the plaintiffs were bound' by a subsisting contract with another party to deliver these coals to their order; that he had bought the coals from that party who had given an order for delivery to him ; in other words, that the plaintiff was already under a subsisting obligation to another party to do just what he had done, and that, therefore, there was no consideration for his promise. This case also was heard on demurrer. It is evident from the opinions of Martin and Wilde, barons, that they assumed the existence of a further consideration beside the mere \\ doing of an act which the plaintiff had already bound him-^elf to a third party to do. Martin, B., said: \u201cIt is cons sistent with the declaration that there may have been some dispute as to the defendant\u2019s right to have the coals, or, it may be that the plaintiffs detained them for demurrage; in either case there would be good consideration that the plaintiffs, who were in possession of the coals, would allow the defendant to take them out of the ship. Then is it any answer that the plaintiffs had entered into a prior contract with other persons to deliver the coals to their order upon the same terms, and that the defendant was a stranger to that contract? In my opinion it is not. We must deal with this case as if no prior contract had been entered into.\u2019\u2019 And Wilde, B., said: \u201cHere the defendant, who was a stranger to the original contract, induced the plaintiffs to part with the cargo, which they might not otherwise have been willing to do, and the delivery of it to the defendant was a benefit to him, f I accede to the proposition that,1 if a person contracts with another to do a certain thing, he \u25a0cam' not make tfie performance of it a consideration fob a new\"~~ promise to the same individoah But there is no authority ' for the proposition that whore-there.-haa.heen a promise to : one person ~to\"~dd a'certain thing, it is not possible to ma|e\u201c '\"aT'vali(\u00ed_p?;\u00f3misfi\u2019to anothet to do the same thing.\u201d These tOpinions'i5gg\u00e9sfi\u201c'two-oBsefvafiofisr~~\u2019When Mart\u00edn, B., said that it was consistent with the declaration that there may have been some dispute as to the defendant\u2019s right to have the coals, or that there may have been a claim for demurrage,! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>and that the prior contract was no answer in that case, he plainly went on the ground that it was consistent with the declaration that there may have been a consideration beside the mere doing of an act which the plaintiffs were already bound to do by their contract with another party. The remark quoted from Wilde, B., indicates the same view. The other observation is, that his statement as to the possibility of a valid <em>\u25a0promise </em>to a new party, that is, to the defendant, notwithstanding a prior promise to another person to do the same thing, indicates some inattention to the actual case before the court. If there had been any such promise', there would cleaiiy have been a sufficient, because a new consideration, moving directly from plaintiff to defendant. In that case the consideration for defendant\u2019s promise would have been the perfprmance of an <em>obligation of the plaintiff directly to him, </em>arising at the same time and wholly new, and not of an obligation to another person still subsisting.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Mr. Frederick Pollock, in his treatise on the Principles of Contract, (p. 163), seems to suppose that this case involved a new promise by the plaintiff', and not merely the <em>act </em>of delivering on the strength of defendant\u2019s promise. He says: <em>\u201c </em>In the case where the party is already bound to do the same thing, but only by contract with a third person, there is some difference of opinion. But there seems to be no valid reason why the <em>promise </em>should not be good in itself, and therefore .a good consideration. <em>It creates a new and distinct right, </em>which must be always of some value in law, and may be of appreciable value in fact. There are many ways,, in which B may be very much interested._in.A!s.^performing his conrracTwiW\u00fc) but yet so that the circumstances which give him affInterest in fact do not give _ him _any interest which ImWan'asSeft at law! It may well be worth his while to give something for <em>being_\u00e9v^\u00cd^ftojr\u00e1isi'mli,is_qwn right </em>on the thiug heirig done. This opinion has been expressed and acted on in the Court of Exchequer, (Scotson <em>vs. </em>Pegg), and seems implied in the judgment of the majority of the Court of Common Pleas some weeks earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">On the other hand, it had been held, more than a century <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>before these decisions, that even when the plaintiff \u201c under-tookf-\u2019-at-the-defendanf^s request, to do an~acT^iroh-hQ-was . already under an obligation to another \"party to \"doTThe 'defendant\u2019fi-promise \u2014 hr-consideration of that~undertakmg' .\u2022was not binding. See Atkinson <em>vs. </em>Settree, Willes, 482. (A. D. 1744), as explained in, a note by LangdelL Lang-dell\u2019s Select Cases on Contracts, p. 189. Subsequently, in Herring <em>vs. </em>Derrell, 8 Dowling\u2019s Prac. Cases, 604, decided in 1840, it was held by Coleridge, J., that a promise made in consideration of_the_mere doing of an act which the promisee was \"already under a legalNjbiigationNoa thTfcf\" party to do, was without consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">We have found time to discover but few cases in this country touching this question. In Davenport <em>vs. </em>First Congregational Church, 33 Wis, 390, the court said: \u201cIt was proposed to show that the plaintiff agreed to surrender and discharge all his debts against the defendant providing the defendant would, within a reasonable time, pay its indebtedness to its former pastor; and the defendant accepted the proposition and, at a good deal of trouble and expense, raised the money and discharged that indebtedness. The only consideration for plaintiffs\u2019 promise, upon these facts, was the payment by the \u2022defendant of a debt justly due. It might cause the defendant some trouble and inconvenience to pay its debts, but we are not aware of any principle of law which would make such payment alone a sufficient consideration for a promise on the part of its creditor to release his claim.\u201d So, too, in Johnson\u2019s Adm\u2019r <em>vs. </em>Sellers, 33, Ala. 265, it was held that a promise by defendant to plaintiff\u2019, made to induce the latter to comply with an existing contract between him and other persons was without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"AxO\">The rule established by these authorities is, that a promise made in consideration of the doing of an act which the promisee is already under obligation to a third \u25a0party to do, though made as an inducement to secure the \u00bfloing of that act, is not binding because it is not supported by a valuable consideration. We conceive this to be el&amp;irly true when the act done on the part of the promisee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>involves nothing more than <em>performance of the original </em>obliga<em>tion toward the party to whom it was due. </em>On the other hand, if the promise be made in consideration of a <em>promise </em>to do that act, entered into directly with the promisor, as indicated by Mr. Pollock, or in consideration that some dispute is thereby determined, or that some right is waived, as suggested by the remarks of Martin, B., in Seotson <em>vs. </em>Pegg, then the promise is binding, because not made in considera-i tion of the .performance of a subsisting obligation to another] [person, hut upon a new consideration moving between the \u00a1promisor and promisee! W e do not perceive that Shadwell <em>vs. </em>Shadwell or Scotson <em>vs. </em>Pegg are opposed to this view; \u25a0though some observations were thrown out by the learned .judges during^tife argument which we cannot reconcile with it, and which we cannot assent to. /</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">We think that the consideration on which this defend-\u25a0ant\u2019s promise to the plaintiffs is alleged to have been founded is governed by the rule which we have stated. It is claimed/ that the services rendered by the plaintiffs in the proceeding against Chiles, in tlie'feupreme Court of the United States, were rendered \u00bft <em>tjm </em>request of the defendant, and constituted the consideration for his subsequeht promise.</p>\n<p id=\"Asm\">But it appears that, at the time when they are said to have carfied on these proceedings at his request, they had already been retained by and were under a legal obligation to the State of Teaxs to perform these services; and it is not shown that they prqgiised the defendant that they*]/ would continue them, or thaij^they were induced by defend- j ant\u2019s request to determine any dispute a\u2019s\u2018 to their obligations, or to waive any claim. In_a word,.no\u2019Other consider.- , ation for any,promise by the defendant, than the perform-^ anee of what they were legally bound to perform by a subsisting contract with another party, is shown;; and the plaintiffs have shown on the other hand, in their own behalf, that they actually did perform that act under their prior contract. We hold that these services could npk_serve as a consideration for any promise by the defendant, evenTlfNt had been made at the tiftie of the requestTfor their perform-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>anee. It may be added that, even if they eonld serve this purpose, they are not shown by any evidence to have been, <em>as a matter of fact, </em>the consideration on which the promise here insisted on was based. What the consideration for a promise was, is a matter of evidence, and this consideration is not shown to have been referred to, or to have been in the minds of the parties. We know of no principle which would have authorized a jury to assume, in the absence of affirmative proof, that some past benefit, conferred at a party\u2019s request, was intended to serve as a reason or consideration of a subsequent promise, whose terms in no way referred to it, merely because it was an event which had once happened between the same parties. The antecedents of parties are not to be sifted for a consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"AGe\">Again, it should appear in some way that these services were <em>in fact </em>rendered in consequence of defendant\u2019s request. If the plaintiffs were already bound by their contract with another party to perform them, and were actually performing them at the time of defendant\u2019s request; in other words, if they were already moved by a sufficient legal cause, the mere fact of a request by a new party is not evidence that they were caused by that <em>request; </em>and this record discloses no other affirmative evidence tending to show that the plaintiffs did in fact act upon that request. Indeed, by showing, in their own behalf, that they obtained judgment against Chiles under their contract with the State of Texas (Rec., 15), they have shown that they did not act upon defendant\u2019s reqnest.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">But if it had been shown that these services were in fact contemplated by the promisor as the consideration of his promise, and that they were in fact rendered in consequence of his request, and if it should be conceded that they might serve as a valuable consideration for some promise on his part, notwithstanding the plaintiffs were under a prior subsisting obligation to another party to perform them, we should still be confronted with the question, whether the particular promise here insisted upon can be supported by that consideration. We think that the contract here set up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>cannot be built upon that foundation. If plaintiffs\u2019 services in the proceedings against Chiles can be regarded as a benefit conferred by them on the defendant in consequence of his request, and as a consideration for\" some promise on his part, it would follow that the law at <em>once -implied </em>a promise by'him (since he made no express promise at the time), to pay for the services which he thus caused, what they were reasonably worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The contract between the plaintiffs and the defendant in relation to those services, would in that case be complete and closed up. In that contract the services would stand as the consideration for a perfect promise, although that promise would be established only by implication. Now, it has been established that, where a past consideration, that is, a thing previously done by the plaintiff at the request of the defendant, is one from which the law implies a promise, a subsequent express promise different from, or in addition to, that which the law implies, is <em>nudum pactum. </em>Among the authorities in which this doctrine is recognized are Brown <em>vs. </em>Crump, 1 Marsh, 567; Granger <em>vs. </em>Collins, 6 Mes. &amp; <em>W., </em>458; Roscorla <em>vs. </em>Thomas, 3 Q. B., 234; and Bradford <em>vs. </em>Roulston, 8 Irish Com. L. Rep., 468. If this were not the rule there would be two distinct and perhaps antagonistic promises resting upon one consideration. \"We suppose that it is not necessary, in applying this principle to the case before us, to demonstrate that a promise to retain out of a fund belonging to the State of Texas, and pay over to the plaintiffs, a compensation due them from the State of Texas, is different from an implied promise of the defendant to pay the plaintiffs himself, and out of his own moneys, the value of services rendered at his request. <em>JVe </em>must hold j under the authorities referred to, jthat plaintiffs) services cannot in this case serve as a consideration for the subse-, quent express promise insisted on. If a consideration at all, they had already carried one promise and will not carry another.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Finally, as to the assent of the State to this contract, by which its fund was to be disposed of. It is claimed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Giddings had, by virtti\u00e9 o\u00ed their Contract of June- <em>2\u00f1^ </em>1874', with Governor Coke, a lien \u00fcpOft this fund for the^purpose,, among others, of paying Out of it the plaintiffs\u2019\"' f\u00e9'es, andl that the law implied the consent of the State to an-act which\"', would execute the purpose of the lien. In this-.way the- assent of the State to the contract under consideration is said i to bo itoade Out. W\u00e9 think that the provision\u2022 referred:to &gt; neVOir had the effect claimed for it, and that; .even- if if-might b\u00e9'\u00e1ir \u2018\u2018such \u00e1 construction it was rescinded \u2018 before it could leild any Support to this later contract:. But as it' forms the basis\u2019of the second proposition presented to us;, the questions'of its effect and of its rescission: will b'e considered under that head.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\">This second proposition is, that a contract' was made by the defendant, in terms, with the State,.but'fOr the benefit of the [plaintiffs, and that by virtue of'this contract he is bound to pay their fees, at least to the. extent. of' the compensation allowed to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">The contract of June 2d, 1874, sets .forth .that J. D. and' D. C. Giddings were appointed agents for .the State of Texas, '\u201c\u2019to pursue <em>by suit </em>all persons having;claims adverse to the :State of Texas,\u201d to the bonds in question ; and, after stating their compensation and authorizing them to proceed also .by compromise, it provided that their, percentage were \u201c to cover all costs and expenses and attorneys\u2019 fees, whether accrued heretofore or to be incurred hereafter.\u201d' It is not claimed that plaintiffs\u2019 fees had \u201c accrued heretofore,\u201d or that any fees have been earned under.the then outstanding contract with Governor Davis, made in. 1878, by -which they were to be entitled to twenty per cent, of what might be recovered to the State by means of the suit against the United States. The basis of their claim is the contract with Governor Coke, made in November or December, 1874. The-question, therefore, is, whether the provision relating to attorneys\u2019 fees \u201c to be incurred hereafter,\u201d meant that the Giddings were to pay out of. their percentages whatever fees the State should subsequently choose to contract to pay to attorneys for services in. respect of these bonds. On re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>burring to the first clause of the agreement, we find that they were to pursue <em>by suit </em>all persons having adverse claims\u00bb It was contemplated, then, that they should employ attorneys, and to the fees of these attorneys, at least, the clause relating to attorneys\u2019 fees to be incurred hereafter, would apply. Was it understood that the same words should apply to attorneys employed, not by these agents and in suits which they should cause to be brought, but by the State ; and that the compensation of these attorneys, over which they could have no. control, and which might, as: the compensation claimed by the plaintiffs undoubtedly would, sweep away the whole of their own percentage, should be paid out of these percentages ? We think that an intention which it would be so improvident and even absurd for them to entertain, is not to be gathered from this provision, when it may be satisfied by another and reasonable appli-. cation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">This is a familiar test in ascertaining the intention of statutes and contracts. It is to be observed, moreover,.that this instrument provides for a particular, and what on its,\u00bb face would seem to be a complete agency, by means of which' suits should be pursued or compromises made <em>; </em>and that it contains no express indication that the State\u00bb intended to employ, or reserved the right to employ, any other agency, and at the cost of the Giddings. In vie*tf of this general purpose of the instrument, and of' the\u201d omissions of such an express provision, we think itjas inadmissible to apply the clause in question to the fens of the attorneys afterwards employed by the State, independently of the agents. We are aware that the record shows that the State did in fact afterwards make \u00f1 contract with the plaintiffs for services and compensation, but that fact does not construe this agreement ; it must be construed by its own terms and by the circumstances existing at the time of its execution. And if we are to look to any construction given by the parties, it appears that they both construed and modified the original contract, before the defendant was -willing to act under it, by the indorsement of October 18,1874. The terms of thig <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>indorsement clearly indicate a purpose to prevent undue, liability on the part of the agents, and to secure t\u00f3 tliem a reasonable compensation, in case their percentages should be swept away by the charges laid upon them; and yet for this purpose they provided only for the case of those percentages being absorbed by claims under <em>\u201c </em>outstanding contracts.\u201d The parties plainly assumed that these were the only source of damages, and it is not intelligible that they should have understood that the object of the indorsement might yet be defeated by contracts which the State should choose to make with other persons. As this indorsement was made before the defendant would consent to act under his appointment, the two papers must be construed as one instrument ; and, when so construed, they exclude any application of the clause in question to the fees of attorneys afterwards retained by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">But, if even the original contract had contained a promise to the State, that the Giddings would pay plaintiffs\u2019 fees, those parties had a right to modify or rescind it at any time before the plaintiffs made themselves privies by accepting and acting upon it. Trimble <em>vs. </em>Strother, 25 Ohio St., 378; Davis <em>vs. </em>Calloway, 30 Ind., 112; Durham <em>vs. </em>Bishoff, 47 Id., 211; Thorp <em>vs. </em>Coal Company, 48 New York, 257. And it appears that the State and its agents did in fact agree upon a new basis and method of compensation-, while the' original contract was thus open to modification, and that, under the new arrangement the defendant could have no connection with plaintiffs\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"Azd\">It was agreed between the defendant and Governor Coke, that, if the defendant would go to Englaud, and pay all costs arid expenses incident to the collection of the bonds there held, and should collect them during Governor Coke\u2019s administration, he should have a fair compensation independent of all contracts. We think that by this arrangement the original terms of compensation were essentially altered. Under the original contract the defendant was to have reasonable\" compensation in case his percentages should be exhausted by the charges laid upon them; but that cumbrous arrangement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>was superseded, and the defendant was now to work simply for a reasonable contingent compensation \u201cindependent of all contracts.\u201d Whatever compensation he was now to have was to come to him in that character, and of course exempt from any charge for the benefit of the plaintiffs ; inasmuch as a fair or reasonable compensation subject to be consumed by charges is an unintelligible conception. With these views as to the intent of the original contract, and of the effect of the final modification, we must hold that the compensation actually received by the defendant did not constitute a fund out of which he was bound to pay fees to the plaintiffs, or money received for their use. We think, therefore, that the court below was right in directing the jury to find a verdict for defendant upon both the special and common counts;</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
