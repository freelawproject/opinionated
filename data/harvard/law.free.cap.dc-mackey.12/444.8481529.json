The action for mesne profits was a <em>chose </em>in action, unasssignable at law, even by the legal owner thereof, much\" less by the equitable owner. Surely the assignment of this equitable claim by the <em>cestui que trust, </em>describing it as his interest in a pending suit, could not destroy . the legal title thereto of the trustee, so that he could not, if , necessary, maintain the suit for the use of the equitable, assignee. \u2022</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>W.

These terms then become a matter of the first importance, for upon them depend the power and right of the plaintiff in this case. As some stress is put upon the language of the habendum clause, we quote the whole of that portion of the deed under which the trust arises.

Id., sec. 320, and note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A14\">This same doctrine is laid down in Hill on Trustees, and numerous authorities are cited in support of it, and the cases where the estate of a trustee has terminated by law, or in which there is the presumption of a conveyance or surrender, are excepted from the general rule that the possessor of the legal title must sue in ejectment. Hill on Trustees, 274, and note ; and to the same effect are Doe vs. Nicholls, 1 Barn. &amp; Cress., 336 ; Nicoll vs. Walworth, 4 Denio,.389.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-7\">But it is conclusive on this point that the Supreme Court of the United States has in more than one case sustained the doctrine announced by the text-writers to the fullest extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-8\">In Webster <em>vs. </em>Cooper, 14 How., 499, the court says : <em>\u201c </em>A devise to trustees and their heirs to the uses mentioned, carries the legal estate to the <em>cestui que use, </em>unless the will has imposed on the trustees some duty, the performance of which requires the legal estate to be vested in them. And in that case they would take an estate commensurate with the exigencies of their trust.\u201d And the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the court cites a number of authorities in support of this doctrine. The same doctrine was again announced by the Supreme Court of the United States in Doe, lessee of Poor, <em>vs. </em>Considine, 6 Wall., 471.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-9\">Chancellor Kent says: \u201c The general rule is not to continue beyond the period required by the purposes of the trust; and notwithstanding the devise to the trustees, <em>and their heirs, </em>they take only a chattel interest where the trust does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>require, an estate of higher qualities. This doctrine rests upon a solid foundation of reason and authority, irrespective of the presence or absence -of the statute of uses.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-3\">And again: and as its latest expression on that subject, in a case that went up from this court, the Supreme Court in express terms endorsed the doctrine laid down in Poor <em>vs. </em>Considine,\u201d and determined that a conveyance made by a trustee, &amp;c., \u201c was void, because his powers as such trustee had ceased.\u201d Young <em>vs. </em>Bradley, 101 IT. S., 788.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-4\">It will be contended that under the interpretation put upon the statute of uses, a use cannot be linrted upon a use, and that in such case the statute executes the first use only, and applying that interpretation to the case at bar, the use in Leonard Mackall is alone executed, so as to vest him with the legal title, thereby leaving the whole remaining estate a trust. \"While it may be questionable how far this interpretation of the statute governs the courts in this country, it is enough to say that the doctrine only applies to those cases where the trust created requires some estate in the trustee for its proper execution. All the cases cited will be found to be cases of this \"kind. Naked dry trusts, or trusts which, by their terms, or by operation of law, require no estate to support them, or trusts where a surrender or recon-veyance will be presumed, or trusts which, by operation of law, have terminated, do not come within the rule prohibiting the limitation of a use upon a use. In such cases there is no estate in the trustee the trust is executed in the <em>cestui que trust. </em>In point of fact the <em>cestui que trust </em>in such cases becomes the real party in interest, and the only party in whose name the recovery of the property in question can be had.

In effect it is an execution of the trust contained in the deed to the plaintiff.

Whatever else may be thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>or siad of this deed, there can be no question that its intent was to put the title to the property in Brooke Mackall, junior, and if effective, it leaves the plaintiff in this action either totally divested of all title, or clothed with such a title as a court of law will not regard as sufficient to maintain an action of ejectment.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b467-3\">Mr. Justice James</author>\n<p id=\"Ane\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The plaintiff, Leonard Mackall, who claims to hold as trustee for Brooke Mackall, senior, sues the defendant Richards in ejectment. The trustee asserts his title to the property in question under a deed to him containing the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201c To have and to hold the said lot, piece or parcel of N-nds and premises, with the appurtenances, unto said party of the second part, his heirs and assigns forever, for his and their sole use, benefit and behoof forever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cIn trust, nevertheless, for the uses and purposes following and none others, that is to say, to hold the same for the use and benefit of the aforesaid Brooke Mackall, senior, and subject to his absolute control and disposal, and to sell and dispose of the same as the said Brooke Mackall, senior, may in writing direct and require.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">A good deal of the argument of the counsel for the plaintiff has been devoted to showing that the statute of uses did not execute the trust here and that a legal estate was taken by the trustee. It was hardly necessary to have spent any time upon that branch of the case for it is well settled since the statute of uses that where the conveyance is to the trustee for his own use, that is the first use and the legal estate is prevented by the statute from going to the <em>cestui que use, </em>the trustee himself taking it. The question here is what sort of a legal estate did the trustee take? It is very common learning that where an \u00e9state is \u201c conveyed \u201d \u2014 that is the strict technical term \u2014 by will to a trustee, the latter\u2019s estate is ascertained by the intention. JDoes the same rule apply when the conveyance is by deed? <em>We </em>have looked into the authorities very carefully \u00e1nd without citing any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>number of cases, we find, as was declared in a Massachusetts case by the learned real estate lawyer Wilde, and afterwards in a later case reiterated by him, and again in the most positive manner sustained by Chief-Justice Shaw, that while the general common law rule requires the use of the word <em>\u201c </em>heirs \u201d in order to pass an estate in fee simple, deeds in trust are always an exception to the rule, the latter being invariably construed according to the intention. The exception arose in the desire to reach the same end that was attained by means of conveyances to uses before the statute, when the courts of that day held that the common law rule in regard to words of inheritance being necessary did not apply to such conveyances. Hence, since the statute it has been declared that neither does the rule apply to trusts and that they are to be given the same construction. Accordingly, it is held in courts of equity, that if the intention is to give the trustee an estate in fee simple, he takes such an estate ; on the other hand, the same court declares that if the intention be that he shall take a less estate, a fee would not pass notwithstanding the words of inheritance were in the instrument of conveyance. In section 312 of Perry on Trusts, it is said that: \u201c In all cases where an estate is given to one for the use of another, in such manner that the statute of uses steps in and executes the estate in the <em>cestui que trust, </em>the statute executes in the <em>cestui que trust </em>only the estate which the first donee or trustee takes,\u201d that is, the statute executes or transfers the exact estate given to the trustee. Therefore, if A give an estate to B and his heirs, for the use of C and his heirs, the statute will execute the fee simple in C. But if A gives an estate to B for the use of C and his heirs, the statute will execute only an estate for the life of A in C ; for that is the extent of the estate conveyed to B by a deed in that form, that is, by a deed that has no words of inheritance in B.' While this is the rule in respect to estates which the statute executes, a very different rule applies to estates upon a trust or use not executed by the statute. In these cases, the extent or quantity of the estate taken by the trustee is determined, not by the circumstance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>that words of inheritance in the trustee are or are not used in the deed or will, but by the intent of the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-3\">It is to be observed that, although it was decided in New York, as reported in 10 John. Rep., 495, that the word <em>\u201c </em>heirs \u201d was not necessary to create a fee in a trustee, yet a Pennsylvania case, in inferring to that decision, seems to imply that such a view could only be taken in equity. But this can hardly be sound ; for when courts of equity come to take hold of the question, it is often necessary for them to determine whether or not by law a legal estate has vested, and how large an estate has been passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">In a Massachusetts case, for example there was a bill filed for specific performance, and the facts were that the person who had bought from the trustee, made a contract for the sale of the property, and agreed to give a good title, but the proposed vendee refused to take it, being of the opinion that the trustee had only a life estate ; the question coming before the court whether it was a good title at law, it was held to be a good fee, on the ground that these were exceptions to the rule of common law conveyances, and that a conveyance to trustee without words of inheritance, could give him a fee simple, if such an estate was necessary in him for the execution of the trust. He was, in other words, to take as large an estate, and no larger, as was necessary for this purpose. This accords with the rules laid down in \"Washburne and Perry, and explains, as Washburne says, how an estate to A and his heirs, in trust for B until the latter shall attain the age of twenty-one years is a mere chattel interest, and if the trustee dies it could not be executed by his heir, but had to be executed by his executor during the remainder of the minority of the <em>cestui que trust. </em>If we apply this rule to the case at bar, we will see that the estate conveyed is for the benefit of Brooke Mackall, senior. This trustee could not, under the language of this deed, control the property, nor could he, as has been contended, bring an action of ejectment against his <em>cestui que trust, </em>for though the general rule was pressed upon us that a trustee could maintain ejectment against his <em>cestui que trust, </em>there are certain essentials neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>sary to enable Mm to do so ; it is elementary law that be must have the legal title and the right of entry, but this trustee had no right of entry against his <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The <em>cestui que trust </em>had reserved to him, by the very declaration of the trust, an absolute control and power of disposition, and right of possession ; and it is plain that the trustee could not, therefore, maintain ejectment against him. Now, the grantor and <em>cestui que trust, </em>Brooke Mackall, senior, having brought action in the name of the trustee against a so-called stranger, disposed of his interest after the suit was brought, and the estate of the trustee ceased thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The trustee had no right of possession save in behalf of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and the latter had conveyed all his right to another, including his right of possession. In such a case the trustee could have no right to recover. It is said, however, that he has the right to go on and recover <em>mesne </em>profits ; but this can only be where the two rights go together. Here the loss of one involves the loss of the other ; they are bo,th in the same boat, and both go down together. The right of action having determined, the suit must fail. Cases might be cited where a different rule applies, as where the defendant shows that he has acquired a better title since the action began, but we have found no such application to the entire loss of the plaintiff\u2019s title. The ground is not taken here that the defendant had acquired a new estate after the action began, but that the plaintiff\u2019s right of action disappeared with the right of possession in the <em>cestui que trust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The judgment below must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Mr. Justice Wylie dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
