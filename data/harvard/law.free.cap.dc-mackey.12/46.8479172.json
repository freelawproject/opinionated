The declaration consisted of a special count against the defendant as endorser, with the common money counts added.

Tenney, a witness for plaintiff, testified, \u201c that he was connected, during the month of December, 1872, with the banking house of Jay Cooke &amp; Co., as confidential clerk and manager; that this note was received from the defendant by Mr. TIenry D. Cooke, one of the firm of Jay Cooke <em>&amp; </em>Co., and he gave him the'money for it. When I saw the note I objected to the rate of interest, which, in the way the note was drawn, would have been only 6 per cent. I therefore called Mr. Cooke\u2019s attention to it, and told him we should have a higher rate of interest than that. He said that the understanding with Mr. Shepherd ivas that he was to pay 9 per cent, interest on the note. I therefore added the words, \u201c at nine per cent,\u201d as a memorandum for my guidance when the note should be paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-8\">The signature and endorsement of the note^ having been proved to be in the handwriting of the defendant, the plaintiff offered the same in evidence, but the court refused to admit it -for any purpose. Whereupon the plaintiff, to establish his claim under the common money counts, offered to prove from the cash-book of Jay Cooke &amp; Co. that, on the 6th day of December, 1872, a note of Alexander E. Shepherd for $2,500 -was negotiated by Jay Cooke &amp; Co., and $2,500 paid by them on the note. To this the defendant objected, but the court overruled the objection; the defendant excepting thereto. The plaintiff then made good his offer and rested his case. Whereupon the defendant, after having testified that he received no consideration for the note, but received - the money thereon for a third party to w'hom he paid it over in the bank, and that the words, <em>\u201c </em>at 9 per cent.\u201d had been added to the note by some other person and without his knowdedge or consent, and that the same had been done after it had passed out of his hands, rested his defense, and prayed the court to instruct the jury that\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201cIf the jury believe from the evidence that the note declared on, when made and passed to Jay Cooke &amp; Co., did not bear the words, \u00a3at 9 per cent.\u2019 and that in consideration of said note, the said Jay Cooke &amp; Co. paid the sum of $2,500 ; and that thereafter the said Jay Cooke &amp; Co. altered or caused to be altered said note, by adding the said words and figures,\u00a3 at 9 per cent.,\u2019 the plaintiff is not entitled to recover upon either count of the declaration.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\">The court refusing to grant this prayer, the defendant, after excepting, asked the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-5\">\u201c If the jury believe from the evidence that the note sued on was originally drawn with the words \u2018 and interest \u2019; and, after being delivered to Jay Cooke &amp; Co., (if it was so delivered) it was altered by said Jay Cooke &amp; Co., or by their agents, upon misrepresentations made to Tenney by ITenry D. Cooke, by adding after those words, the words and figures <em>\u2018 </em>at 9 per cent.,\u2019 with fraudulent intent to measure and change the liability of the defendant, and without his knowledge or consent, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-6\">Which prayer the court also refused, the defendant noting his exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-7\">The court thereupon instructed the jury that the note set forth in the special count of the declaration, having been altered in a material matter had been ruled out of the case and excluded from their consideration, but that the case was submitted to them on the evidence as to the reception of the money by the defendant and from whom he received it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-8\">\u25a0 Verdict for the plaintiff for $2,500 without interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-9\">A motion for a new trial was not made by the defendant within four days after the verdict, nor was it ever made in the court belown Accordingly, -when the defendant tendered his bill of exceptions- to the court for its approval, the plaintiff interposed and objected to the signing of the same on the ground that, as no motion for a new trial had been made under the 60th and 61st Rules of Practice, the justice presiding had no power to sign and seal the exceptions. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the court overruled <em>(pro forma) </em>the objection of the plaintiff, and signed and sealed the exceptions.

Lems, trustee- of the estate and: effects of Jay' Cooke &amp; Co., brings this action, in assumpsit upon a promissory note executed by the defendant, Alexander R. Shepherd,, to himself arid by him endorsed.- In the hands of Jay Cooke &amp; Co-the note underwent a very serious alteration.. As originally executed it was a note without interest. As-sued upon and presented in proof it was a note with interest-at 9 per cent., a very material and serious change in the* promise-; a change of such' a character and import that the-justice trying the case would not allow the note to-be given; in evidence as a promise of the defendant- The note having* been thus taken fr&amp;m the consideration of the jury, the* special count in the- declaration predicated upon it -was1 abandoned, and the plaintiff passed* over to* the common-count for money bad and received- Here tli'e court permitted the plaintiff to enter the field'of proof, to* substantiate* bis claim,-which was based, we suppose,upon the consideration; of the note ; and- the first difficulty presented in considering; the ruling of the court below, is that, attending the common count, was- a hill of particulars consisting of nothing more* than this very note which had been made- the subject of the* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>\u25a0special count. Now how this note could be good for nothing in one place and good for something in another is the puzzle \u25a0.that we have had to resolve,; and we have -come to the con-\u2022elusion that the common counts with this note annexed as ;a bill of particulars is a Little worse 'than the special count \u2022; \u25a0for it is patent from the testimony in the ease that the defendant\u2019s liability was a liability under his undertaking as an endorser, which does not imply a further liability by reason \u2022of the money that was advanced upon the note. In addition to which the common count upon which the recovery was had was damaged with the same Infirmity, by reason <em>-of </em>;the altered note as a bill of particulars, .that existed in the special count predicated upon this same' note. We consider these objections fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">The case is remanded for a new trial, with liberty to the plaintiff to amend as he may be -advised.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
