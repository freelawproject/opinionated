The testimony showed that the defendant went to the store of the plaintiffs, who were carriage dealers, and stated that she wanted to purchase a carriage, saying at the same time that she was living in the country and wanted the carriage to ride backwards and forwards to look after her property in the city. It was in evidence that she owned a house on Sixth street in this city. A carriage was accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ingly sold her, and some time afterwards when she was called upon to pay she said that her property was encumbered and that she was trying to straighten it out and as soon as this was done she would pay the bill. The defendant offered no testimony, but prayed the court to instruct the jury that on the whole evidence, if believed by them, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. But the court refused so to instruct the jury and thereupon charged them that if they believed from the evidence that the defendant purchased from the plaintiffs the carriage as charged in the declaration, and that she stated at the time of the purchases that she was living in the country and wanted the carriage to ride backwards and forwards to look after her property in the city, and that she owned a house in the'city then the plaintiffs were entitled to recover.
