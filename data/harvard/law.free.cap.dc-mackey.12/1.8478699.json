We further find that said furniture was bought and used by the defendant for furnishing a house forming a part of her separate estate, which house so furnished, said defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>thereafter rented. Ve further find that said defendant, at the time of making said contract, was a married woman ; and being ignorant in point of law what our verdict should be upon the above facts, we find for the plaintiffs for the amount claimed, $1,834.33, with interest from the first day of March, 1878, if the court shall be .of opinion that upon said facts the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in point of law ; and if the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiffs ai\u2019e not entitled to recover upon said facts in. point of law, then we find for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b16-4\">J. J. Darlington for plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-5\">The \u201cMarried Woman\u2019s Acts\u201d have been liberally construed in a majority of the States. This court having, however, in Rich <em>vs. </em>Iiyatt, Wash. Law Rep., Yol. 7, No. 13, indicated its disposition to adhere to the \u201c strict construction \u201d school, the authorities cited will be confined to the decisions of the courts of those States, in which these statutes haye been <em>most strictly construed, </em>viz.: <em>New Hamp-. shire: </em>Bailey <em>vs. </em>Pearson, 29 N. II., 77 ; Ames <em>vs. </em>Foster, 42 N. H., 381; Muzzey <em>vs. </em>Reardon, 57 N. H., 378; <em>Illinois: </em>Carpenter <em>vs. </em>Mitchell, 50 Ill., 470 ; Williams <em>vs. </em>Hugunin, 69 Ill., 214 ; <em>New - York: </em>Yale <em>vs. </em>Dederer, 18 N. Y., 265 ; Si C. 22 N. Y., 450.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-6\">The language of the New Hampshire act is as follows : \u201c Married women, in the cases aforesaid, shall * * * be liable to be sued at law and in equity upon any contract by them made, or any wrong by them done, in respect to such property * * * in the same manner and with the same effect as if they were unmarried.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b16-9\">. In the case of Batchelder <em>vs. </em>Sargent, 47 N. H., a case strikingly analogous to the present, the court said; \u201c The power to hold property to the wife\u2019s sole and separate use,, necessarily implies a power to hold whatever .is essential to make that use beneficial; such as farming tools, stock, and the like ; and as incident to holding such tools and stock, must be the right to purchase them, and pledge her credit' for the price. * * * The wife has used her credit, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>stock her farm, and she enjoys the benefit of it; and a decision which would discharge her from the obligation to pay for it, would not only be painfully unjust and productive of much mischief in that direction, but would, we are persuaded, be inconsistent with the policy of our legislation, which is to place the wife in respect to such property upon the footing of a <em>feme sole.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-4\">This case is cited, first, because it is the decision of a court than which none has been a more strict constructionist qf the class of legislation in question; secondly, because it is the decision of a court whose views in Ames <em>vs. </em>Foster were adopted and apparently most relied upon by this court in Each <em>vs. </em>Hyatt; and, thirdly, because the case itself cannot be distinguished in principle, in a single particular, from the case at bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-5\">From the authorities of the States above mentioned, the following may be stated as contracts \u201cin relation to the separate estates of married women\u201d in the sense of the Married Woman\u2019s Acts, and which when made are binding upon them, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b17-6\">1.

The doctrine of courts of. equity upon this subject will be found in Willard <em>vs. </em>Eastham, 15 Gray, 328.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b18-5\">Hagner &amp; Maddox argued the case for the defendant, but filed no brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b18-6\">Mr. Justice Wylie</author>\n<p id=\"A4k\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"An\">Our married woman\u2019s act of 1869 declares that a married woman may contract as a <em>feme sole </em>in regard to any matter relating to her separate estate, and the question in this case is whether the purchase by a married woman of furniture for a house forming her separate estate is such a contract as relates to that estate. We think that it is. A woman who owns a farm, if she lives on it herself, may stock it. If she finds that she can rent it to better advantage by stocking it than by renting it without the stock, we think it is such an incident to the farm as would enable her to buy stock for that purpose. Under a similar statute in New Hampshire, just such a case has been cited by the plaintiff\".</p>\n<p id=\"b18-8\">The house in question was in this city and was the property of the defendant, a married woman. It was of no use to the owner unless occupied or rented. Now a married woman may contract to repair her house or to do anything that will put it in a condition to make it rentable. We think it is a fair inference from the verdict in this case that the defendant, in order to rent the house to advantage, had to furnish it. Now to allow a woman owning property of this description to go to a furniture establishment or to a merchant and represent that she is the owner of a house and wants to furnish it so that she may rent it, and then permit her to come into court and say that she had no power to make such a purchase, would be allowing her to commit a fraud upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the parties who trusted her, and would be a construction o\u00ed the law that we ought not to give to it.- Although the purchase of furniture may not strictly be said to be a contract relating to her separate estate, it would be a very narrow construction to allow the woman to defraud her creditors by keeping the furniture ; for to turn the creditors over to the husband, who would probably set up the defense that he was not bound, would be to deprive them of a remedy anywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-3\">We, therefore, direct that a judgment for the amount found to be due the plaintiff on the special verdict be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
