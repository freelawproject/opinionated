Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments concerning the content of the draft ballot title submitted to the Secretary of State and who therefore are entitled to seek review of the ballot title certified by the Attorney General. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning the ballot title certified by the Attorney General. We conclude that none establishes that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title fails substantially to comply with the standards for such ballot titles set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d) (1997). Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">DECLARES SPECIFIED HUMAN RIGHTS; CREATES COMMISSION; AUTHORIZES ADMINISTRATIVE, JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: <em>\u201cYes\u201d </em>vote declares specified human rights; creates commission to enforce rights through administrative, judicial processes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-9\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects declaring specified human rights, creating commission; leaves existing laws, protections in place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-10\">SUMMARY: Adopts statute declaring specified human rights, including provisions relating to torture, inhuman treatment, equal rights, \u201csocial security,\u201d health care, collective bargaining, environment, employment conditions, discrimination, disabilities, education, tolerance. Creates seven-member commission appointed by governor. Authorizes commission to: investigate complaints against persons alleged to have violated rights; hold contested case hearings; compel testimony; impose civil penalties up to $10,000 for violations; initiate court actions for civil penalty, injunction; adopt administrative rules. Authorizes suspension of occupational, professional, driving, liquor licenses, until violations cease. Other provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Ballot title certified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
