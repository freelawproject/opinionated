The referred measure, House Joint Resolution 2, would add a new section 34 to Article IV of the Oregon Constitution. The new section would provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, the Legislative Assembly by law may impose limitations on the damages that may be recovered in civil actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments concerning the content of the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title and who therefore are entitled to seek review of the ballot title certified by the Attorney General. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement). The Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cAMENDS CONSTITUTION: ALLOWS LEGISLATURE TO LIMIT RECOVERY OF DAMAGES IN CIVIL ACTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">\u201cRESULT OF YES\u2019 VOTE: Yes\u2019 vote adds constitutional provision allowing legislature to limit recovery of damages in civil actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cRESULT OF \u2018NO\u2019 VOTE: \u2018No\u2019 vote retains restrictions on legislature\u2019s authority to limit recovery of damages in civil actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">\u201cSUMMARY: Amends Constitution. Under current judicial interpretation of the Oregon Constitution, there are restrictions on the legislature\u2019s authority to limit recovery of damages in civil actions. These restrictions include a prohibition barring the legislature from limiting recovery of noneconomic damages in personal injury actions. This measure overrides those restrictions by adding a new constitutional provision expressly allowing the legislature to impose limits on damages that may be recovered in civil actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">We address the arguments made by each petition separately. Petitioners DeLashmutt, Gallant, and Oxley challenge only the \u201cno\u201d result statement and the summary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title. We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments, but conclude that none establishes that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title fails to comply with the standards for such ballot titles set out in ORS 250.035(2)(c) and (d) (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we turn to the arguments advanced by petitioner Love.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Petitioner Love challenges only the summary of the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title. The summary must be <em>\u201ca </em>concise and impartial statement of not more than 85 words summarizing the measure and its major effect.\u201d ORS 250.035(2)(d) (1997). Petitioner Love asserts that the Attorney General\u2019s summary fails the foregoing test because it neither identifies adequately the state of current law nor describes adequately the breadth of the proposed measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Petitioner Love\u2019s first argument is premised on the idea (with which the Attorney General agrees) that the referred measure is a legislative response to <em>Lakin v. Senco Products, Inc., </em>329 Or 62, 987 P2d 463 (1999). <em>In Lakin, </em>this court invalidated ORS 18.560(1), a statute that purported to place a $500,000 \u201ccap\u201d on awards of noneconomic damages in personal injury cases, on the ground that the statute impermissibly interfered with the constitutional guarantee of a right to trial by jury found in Article I, section 17, of the Oregon Constitution. We accept that premise. From it, petitioner Love asserts that the second sentence of the Attorney General\u2019s summary should be modified by adding the words, \u201cawarded by juries,\u201d after \u201cdamages.\u201d We agree with petitioner Love that such an addition might make the sentence better, but we do not view the absence of the phrase as making either the sentence or the summary as a whole inadequate under the statutory standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Petitioner Love next argues that the sweep of the second sentence is too great, in that it appears to state that the Oregon Constitution presently impedes the legislature\u2019s ability to limit damage awards in any and all civil actions. That objection is well taken. The sentence speaks of constitutional \u201crestrictions on the legislature\u2019s authority to limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>recovery of damages in civil actions\u201d and is a statement of apparent general applicability. On several occasions, however, this court has approved, against a variety of constitutional challenges, legislative choices to limit damages in some kinds of civil actions. <em>See, e.g., Greist v. Phillips, </em>322 Or 281, 906 P2d 789 (1995) (upholding limitation on damages in wrongful death actions); <em>Hale v. Port of Portland, </em>308 Or 508, 783 P2d 506 (1989) (upholding limitation on damages in tort claims against public bodies). We modify the sentence in question in the manner set out below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">Finally, petitioner Love argues that the Attorney General\u2019s summary fails to state adequately the breadth of the referred measure. The measure, Love argues, speaks without limitation to \u201ccivil actions,\u201d thereby authorizing the statutorily directed reduction (or even elimination) of damages in any category of case that falls under that broad umbrella. Thus, Love reasons, the Attorney General\u2019s choice to include the specific and limited discussion of \u201cnoneconomic damages in personal injury actions\u201d in the third sentence of the summary narrowly and incorrectly focuses the reader\u2019s attention on the result of the <em>Lakin </em>decision, rather than on the broader policy choice embodied in the referred measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Again, we agree. The measure\u2019s unrestricted reference to \u201ccivil actions\u201d includes not merely personal injury actions, but also contract actions, trespass actions, and economic tort actions, among others. The sentence in question should be eliminated. The summary also should be modified in other respects to eliminate its overly narrow focus. The following summary (in which the omissions have been bracketed and the additions have been italicized) addresses the well-founded objections made by petitioner Love:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">SUMMARY: Amends Constitution. Under [current judicial interpretation of] the Oregon Constitution, [there are restrictions on] <em>the right to jury trial restricts </em>the legislature\u2019s authority to limit recovery of <em>some kinds of </em>damages in <em>some </em>civil actions. This measure overrides that restriction by adding a new constitutional provision expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>allowing the legislature to impose limits on damages that may be recovered in <em>any </em>civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Based on the foregoing discussion, we certify the following ballot title for the referred measure to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">AMENDS CONSTITUTION: ALLOWS LEGISLATURE TO LIMIT RECOVERY OF DAMAGES IN CIVIL ACTIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">RESULT OF \u2018YES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Yes\u201d vote adds constitutional provision allowing legislature to limit recovery of damages in civil actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains restrictions on legislature\u2019s authority to limit recovery of damages in civil actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">SUMMARY: Amends Constitution. Under the Oregon Constitution, the right to jury trial restricts the legislature\u2019s authority to limit recovery of some kinds of damages in some civil actions. This measure overrides that restriction by adding a new constitutional provision expressly allowing the legislature to impose limits on damages that may be recovered in any civil action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">Ballot title certified as modified.
