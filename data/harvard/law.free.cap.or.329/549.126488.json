Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments concerning the content of the draft ballot title submitted to the Secretary of State and who therefore are entitled to seek review of the ballot title certified by the Attorney General. <em>See </em>ORS 250.085(2) (setting that requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments concerning the ballot title certified by the Attorney General. We conclude that none establishes that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title fails substantially to comply with the standards for such ballot titles set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d) (1997). Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">BANS BODY-GRIPPING ANIMAL TRAPS, SOME POISONS; RESTRICTS FUR COMMERCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">RESULT OF \u2018YES\u201d VOTE: \u2018Yes\u201d vote bans: body-gripping traps, commerce in fur from such trapping, certain animal poisons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote rejects ban on: body-gripping traps, related commerce in fur, certain animal poisons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">SUMMARY: Prohibits use of steel-jawed leghold traps and other body-gripping traps to capture mammals. Prohibits sale, purchase, barter, exchange of raw fur from mammal trapped in such traps in Oregon. Allows use of specified types of traps for protection of health and safety, animal control, research, and protection of endangered species if permit obtained from Oregon Fish and Wildlife Department. Prohibits use of sodium fluoroacetate, also known as Compound 1080, or sodium cyanide, to poison or attempt to poison any animal. Penalties for violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Ballot title certified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
