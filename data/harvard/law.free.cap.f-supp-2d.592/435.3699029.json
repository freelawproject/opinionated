(collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) conspired to fix or maintain artificially the prices of Digital Music. Plaintiffs are fifteen individuals (collectively, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) from nine states who seek to represent a putative nation-wide class of purchasers of Digital Music. Defendants move [dkt. no. 75] to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (\u201cSCAC\u201d) under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and, in the alternative, to strike certain portions of the SCAC pursuant to Rule 12(f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs move [dkt. no. 104] to amend one paragraph of the SCAC to add certain allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Defendants\u2019 motion is GRANTED, and Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"AUO\">According to the SCAC, Digital Music is music that is manufactured as a digital file. (See SCAC \u00b62, In re Digital Music, 06 MDL. 1780 (filed June 13, 2007) (hereinafter \u201cSCAC\u201d).) It is delivered in two allegedly interchangeable formats: on compact discs (\u201cCDs\u201d) and through the internet (\u201cInternet Music\u201d). (See <em>id. </em>\u00b641.) The SCAC defines the relevant market in this action as the market for sales of all Digital Music (both CDs and Internet Music) in the United States; Defendants, described as the four largest record companies in the United States, allegedly control in excess of 80% of that market. (See <em>id. </em>\u00b6 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In general, the SCAC alleges that Defendants conspired to inflate and maintain at supracompetitive levels the price of Digital Music. (See <em>id. </em>\u00b6 126.) They achieved this by fixing a high price for and restraining the availability of Internet Music <em>{id. </em>\u00b666), which, in turn, buoyed the price of CDs \u201cdespite declining costs of production associated with the introduction of new technologies\u201d <em>{id. </em>\u00b6 126; see <em>also id. </em>\u00b6 105). Explains the SCAC: \u201c[a]cting alone, no defendant could sustain the su-pracompetitive prices for CDs prevailing in the market. This inability to charge high CD prices, as market factors made consumer demand for CDs more elastic over time at the prices charged by Defendants during the conspiracy, gave Defendants motive to conspire.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 83.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Defendants\u2019 manipulation of the market for Internet Music is described in two phases of conduct. The first phase centers on two joint ventures \u2014 \u201cMusicNet\u201d and \u201cpressplay\u201d \u2014 created by Defendants to distribute their Internet Music. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 67.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second phase alleges manipulation through Defendants\u2019 business dealings with third-party licensees. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">A. <em>The First Phase: The Joint Ventures</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4N\">The SCAC appears to include principally two allegations concerning the joint ventures. First, it alleges that the joint ventures directly restricted the wide-spread distribution and use of Internet Music by charging supracompetitive prices and imposing unpopular digital rights management (\u201cDRM\u201d) rules on the Internet Music they sold to consumers. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 75-78; <em>see id. </em>\u00b6 81 (\u201cDefendants collectively refused to utilize or license a system that was convenient, not burdened with use restrictions and competitively priced.\u201d).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to the SCAC, Defendants enforced those price and use restrictions through their use of most-favored nations clauses (\u201cMFNs\u201d) and \u201cside agreements,\u201d where-under each Defendant would license its songs to the joint ventures at a price not lower than the price secured by any other Defendant. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 92-94, 96-97.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u201cDefendants\u2019 collusion in setting high prices for Internet Music, as well as their collusion in imposing unfair and one-sided terms on its use, made Internet Music less attractive to consumers, allowing Defendants to sell CDs at supracompetitive prices.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Second, the SCAC alleges that the joint ventures were shams that were designed solely to \u201cprovide[] Defendants with opportunities and forums to meet and further conspire to cooperate to maintain the prices and terms for Internet Music.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 87.) This follows, alleges the SCAC, from the fact that certain aspects of the joint ventures\u2019 business model were contrary to the economic self-interests of each individual Defendant. Thus, \u201c[a]ny one of the Defendants might have removed these unpopular DRM and gained additional market share and profits and most or all would have but for the conspiracy, just as independent labels not party to the conspiracy sell DRM-free Internet Music.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 76; <em>see also id. </em>\u00b6 78 (\u201c[Rjather than pursue their individual interests by competing with each other, the new method of distribution was used as a pretext for Defendants to meet and conspire.\u201d).) Plaintiffs allege that the same was true of the way Defendants structured their compensation from the joint ventures: because Defendants were not paid on a per-song basis, their \u201ceconomic incentives were to charge monopoly prices for Internet Music rather than compete with one another on price.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 89.) Thus, instead of legitimate business entities, the joint ventures were merely \u201cvehicles through which the Defendants effectively exchanged price information, policed their cartel and imposed restrictive licensing arrangements that retarded the growth of Internet Music.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 98.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The SCAC further alleges that Defendants attempted to conceal many of the joint ventures\u2019 allegedly anticompetitive practices. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 113.) For instance, Defendants \u2014 through the joint ventures \u2014 allegedly \u201cconspired to mask their anticompetitive conduct by pretex-tually establishing rules to prevent antitrust violations, ignoring them, and then using these sham rules to convince the United States Department of Justice [ (\u201cDOJ\u201d) ] to drop the investigation it launched in 2001.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 90, 91.) Defendants also allegedly attempted to conceal the use of MFNs in their agreements with the joint ventures because \u201cthey knew they would attract antitrust scrutiny by DOJ and others\u201d <em>{id. </em>\u00b6 93); one such MFN \u2014 between EMI and Mu-sicNet \u2014 was allegedly memorialized as a \u201cside-letter\u201d agreement \u201cbecause \u2018there are legal/antitrust reasons why it would be a bad idea to have MFN clauses in any, or certainly all, of these agreements\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 94-95).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">B. <em>The Second Phase: Third-Party Licensees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">According to the SCAC, Defendants also manipulated the market for Internet Music through their direct dealings with third-party licensees. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 99.) Defendants allegedly set a \u201cwholesale price floor at 70 cents per song [and] placed restrictions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the use of Internet Music that unreasonably limit its utility and attractiveness to purchasers.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 100). Agreement as to the price floor is demonstrated, argue Plaintiffs, by the fact that, in May 2005, Defendants each raised their price for Internet Music from approximately 65 cents to 70 cents. <em>(See </em>Pis.\u2019 \u00b6 99 Mem. Ex. A (Proposed Third Amended Complaint).) As was the case with the joint ventures, Defendants allegedly enforced this price floor by requiring third-party licensees to sign MFNs specifying that each licensee must pay each Defendant no less than it pays other Defendants. (SCAC \u00b6 99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The SCAC describes the experience of eMusic, allegedly the \u201cmost popular online music service that sells Internet Music owned by independent labels\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 103), which sells Internet Music for only $0.25 per song without any DRM restrictions <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 103). According to the SCAC, Defendants refused to do business with eMu-sic, despite the fact that it is \u201cthe #2 Internet Music retailer\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 104) because eMusic refused to impose the same Internet Music price and use restrictions as Defendants <em>(id.). </em>According to the SCAC, such uniform behavior is consistent only with prior agreement: \u201c[a]bsent an agreement not to compete with each other, Defendants would try to gain advantages over each other by selling Internet Music with fewer unpopular restrictions; hence the lack of such competition on price or quality shows continuing collusion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In addition to this conduct, the SCAC also notes that Defendants either are or were under investigation for certain conduct by various governmental agencies. For instance, Defendants\u2019 price fixing is the subject of an investigation by the Office of the New York State Attorney General <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 106), and, in 2006, the DOJ \u201copened an investigation into collusion and price fixing.of Internet Music by the Defendants\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 107-08). Defendants were also allegedly \u201csubject to a number of government investigations and lawsuits concerning the pricing of CDs\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 110) and settled claims by the New York Attorney General and the FCC concerning Defendants\u2019 purported \u201cschemes of paying radio stations for playing certain songs\u201d <em>(id. </em>\u00b6 111).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The SCAC includes three counts for relief. Count One alleges violations of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 (2000); <em>see also </em>SCAC \u00b6\u00b6 123-34. Count Two alleges violations of various state antitrust and consumer protection laws (SCAC \u00b6 136(a)-(u)), and Count Three alleges unjust enrichment also under the laws of various states <em>(id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 138-45). In their motion, Defendants argue principally that the SCAC fails to state a \u00a7 1 claim under the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1969, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007); <em>see also </em>Defs.\u2019 Mem. 7. They argue that the state antitrust claims must also be dismissed for that reason <em>(see </em>Defs.\u2019 Mem. 24 n. 14) and that the consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims fail for various reasons <em>(see id. </em>at 24-28, 30-32, 34-38). Because so much of this motion involves the pleading requirements after <em>Twombly, </em>I begin my discussion there.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">A. <em>The Sherman Act Count</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVb\">1. Pleading Standards After <em>Twombly</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Rule 8(a)(2) requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, it is well-settled that a court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, <em>Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit, </em>507 U.S. 163, 164, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993), and afford the plaintiff every reasonable inference, <em>see Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 118, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">It was once similarly well-settled that \u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). The Supreme Court retired that language in <em>Twombly, </em>however, instead holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">[w]hile a complaint attacked on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964-65 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, while <em>Twombly </em>did \u201cnot require heightened fact pleading of specifics,\u201d it did require that a pleading include \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">To fully appreciate the significance of <em>Twombly, </em>it is necessary to understand the antitrust context in which it was decided. Because \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act reaches only those restraints of trade effected by \u201ccontract, combination or conspiracy,\u201d <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1; <em>see also Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., </em>465 U.S. 752, 761, 104 S.Ct. 1464, 79 L.Ed.2d 775 (1984) (\u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act incorporates the \u201cbasic distinction between concerted and independent action\u201d), it is fundamental that a \u00a7 1 claim allege \u201csome form of concerted action between at least two legally distinct economic entities.\u201d <em>Tops Mkts., Inc. v. Quality Mkts., Inc., </em>142 F.3d 90, 95-96 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., </em>467 U.S. 752, 775-76, 104 S.Ct. 2731, 81 L.Ed.2d 628 (1984) (\u201c[T]his Court has recognized that \u00a7 1 is limited to concerted conduct at least since [1919].\u201d). While such concerted action need not result from explicit agreement, <em>see United States v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>384 U.S. 127, 142-43, 86 S.Ct. 1321, 16 L.Ed.2d 415 (1966), a \u00a7 1 violation based on \u201ctacit collusion\u201d or \u201cconscious parallelism\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requires more than a bare showing of parallel conduct. <em>See, e.g., Theatre Enters., Inc. v. Paramount Film Distrib. Corp., </em>346 U.S. 537, 541, 74 S.Ct. 257, 98 L.Ed. 273 (1954) (\u201c[T]his Court has never held that proof of parallel business behavior conclusively establishes agreement or, phrased differently, that such behavior itself constitutes a Sherman Act offense.... \u2018[CJonseious parallelism\u2019 has not yet read conspiracy out of the Sherman Act entirely.\u201d); <em>see also Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964 (\u201cThe inadequacy of showing parallel conduct or interdependence, without more, mirrors the ambiguity of the behavior: consistent with conspiracy, but just as much in line with a wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.\u201d). Instead, under those circumstances, \u201cthere must be evidence that tends to exclude the possibility of independent action.\u201d <em>Monsanto, </em>465 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>U.S. at 768, 104 S.Ct. 1464; <em>see also Theatre Enters., </em>346 U.S. at 540, 74 S.Ct. 257 (\u201cThe crucial question is whether [a defendant\u2019s] conduct ... stemmed from independent decision or from an agreement tacit or express.\u201d). Thus was born the jurisprudence of \u201cplus factors\u201d \u2014 the additional circumstantial evidence, beyond parallel conduct, that must exist to ensure \u201cthat the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action.\u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>see also </em>ABA Section of Antitrust Law, <em>Antitrust Law Developments </em>11 n. 57 (6th ed. 2007); 6 Philip Areeda &amp; Herbert Hovenkamp, <em>Antitrust Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1434(a)-(e) (2d ed. 2003) (\u201cAreeda &amp; Hovenkamp\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Whatever those \u201cplus factors\u201d or \u201cfactual enhancements\u201d may be, suffice it to say for present purposes that, after <em>Twombly, </em>they must appear in a \u00a7 1 plaintiffs complaint. As the Court noted, in the antitrust context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">[a] statement of parallel conduct, even conduct consciously undertaken, needs some setting suggesting the agreement necessary to make out a \u00a7 1 claim; without that further circumstance pointing toward a meeting of the minds, an account of a defendant\u2019s commercial efforts stays in neutral territory. An allegation of parallel conduct is thus much like a naked assertion of conspiracy in a \u00a7 1 complaint: it gets the complaint close to stating a claim, but without some further factual enhancement it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of \u201centitle[ment] to relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-9\"><em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1966 (citation omitted). Rather, the Court held that \u201cstating such a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest that an agreement was made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">2. Assessing the SCAC After <em>Twombly</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">At its heart, the SCAC alleges that Defendants imposed the same price and use restrictions on their sale of Internet Music to make that means of delivery of Digital Music less attractive to consumers, thereby buoying the prices of CDs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Plaintiffs advance essentially three arguments to support an inference that Defendants\u2019 parallel conduct resulted from an agreement: (a) that Defendants\u2019 creation of and participation in the joint ventures makes plausible the inference that their subsequent parallel conduct was the result of an agreement; (b) that further factors \u2014 acts against Defendants\u2019 economic self-interests, motive to conspire, suspicious price increases, Defendants\u2019 \u201cantitrust record\u201d and opportunities to conspire through the RIAA <em>(see </em>Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 9-12) \u2014 indicate that Defendants\u2019 parallel conduct resulted from agreement; and (c) that certain economic indicators \u2014 market concentration and high barriers to market entry \u2014 are sufficient to ground a \u00a7 1 conspiracy <em>(see id. </em>at 8-9, 11). I discuss each individually below and, affording Plaintiffs every reasonable inference, <em>see Zinermon, </em>494 U.S. at 118, 110 S.Ct. 975, conclude that the further facts alleged by Plaintiffs, considered alone and collectively, do not place Defendants\u2019 con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>duct \u201cin a context that raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1966. Therefore, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act and Count 1 of the SCAC must be DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">a. The Joint Ventures</p>\n<p id=\"An1\">Because Plaintiffs do not challenge the legality of the joint ventures themselves, it is somewhat unclear how they contend those ventures support an inference of agreement. They appear to argue that the creation and operation of the joint ventures yields an inference of agreement because those ventures were mere sham organizations designed solely to provide a forum in which to discuss and agree to the terms of the later agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">To begin, the bald allegation that the joint ventures were shams is conclusory and implausible. It ignores the context in which those entities were created: an environment of widespread unauthorized downloading of Internet Music. <em>{See, e.g., </em>Almeida Decl. Ex. B <em>{Bulcao </em>Compl.) \u00b6 37 (\u201cThe distribution of digital music exploded in the late 1990s with the emergence of Napster, the most popular online music service (which had tens of millions of users) Kazaa and other services offering free peer to peer file sharing, <em>i.e., </em>the ability of one person to share Online Music with anyone else via a website.... Napster initially provided file sharing for free.... \u201d).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result of that unauthorized downloading, \u201cthe major recording companies that control the copyrights to most popular music [were] generally unwilling to license their music for online sale except in protected formats.\u201d <em>{See id. </em>Ex. C <em>{Tucker </em>Compl.) \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Viewed in that context, each reason offered by Plaintiffs to support their sham allegation has an entirely reasonable independent justification: \u201cunpopular\u201d use restrictions and compromise in the collaboration\u2019s pricing structure are each consistent with a collaborative effort to address widespread music piracy. In the absence of any formal veil-piercing allegations and without challenging the legality of those joint ventures under the antitrust laws, Plaintiffs cannot now call into question their legitimacy simply by describing conduct consistent with rational business decisions. For that reason alone, I could decline to infer that the joint ventures were vehicles to create an antitrust conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">There is a further reason, however, not to draw such a negative inference. It is common sense that some level of information sharing must inevitably occur in the operation of a joint venture. As Judge Marilyn Hall Patel recently observed in a passage upon which Plaintiffs rely, \u201ceven a naif must realize that in forming and operating a joint venture, [record label] representatives must necessarily meet and discuss pricing and licensing.\u201d <em>In re Napster, Inc. Copyright Litig., </em>191 F.Supp.2d 1087, 1109 (N.D.Cal.2002). Judge Patel drew a negative inference from the possibility of such communication, allowing further discovery into Napster\u2019s allegation that the joint ventures themselves violated the antitrust laws. <em>See id. </em>at 1108-10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Of course, Plaintiffs offer no direct challenge to the joint ventures here. This situation is, therefore, more like the situation in <em>Twombly, </em>where the Supreme Court declined to draw a negative inference from allegations of information sharing that resulted from defendants\u2019 participation in a concededly legal industry trade group. <em>See </em>127 S.Ct. at 1971 n. 12. It is similarly unwarranted to draw a negative inference from allegations involving the unchallenged collaboration between and among Defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">A more subtle argument could be made that a later illegal tacit agreement can be inferred from the fact of Defendants\u2019 explicit prior agreement with materially the same terms, reached in the context of the joint ventures. What scarce authority there is on this issue \u2014 the parties have cited no reported decision, and research has disclosed but one \u2014 does not address the precise issue. <em>See United States v. Nat\u2019l Malleable &amp; Steel Castings Co., </em>Civ. No. 30,281, 1957 U.S. Dist. Lexis 4209, 1957 Trade Cas. \u00b6 68,890 (N.D.Oh. Nov. 26, 1957), <em>affirmed, </em>358 U.S. 38, 79 S.Ct. 39, 3 L.Ed.2d 44 (1958) (mem.). In the <em>Steel Castings </em>case, the court confronted a price-fixing conspiracy that was alleged to have existed after defendants discontinued a trust agreement among themselves. <em>See id. </em>at *10-12. Though its legality was unchallenged, all appear to have agreed that the prior trust agreement was discontinued because it would have been considered illegal under then-recent changes in the law. <em>See id. </em>at *12. The court refused to conclude that the prior trust agreement was illegal; the court further refused to conclude that the prior agreement had \u201cended only in its outward manifestations\u201d based on certain economic evidence and other testimony about the market in question. <em>See id. </em>at *19-20.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">I conclude that an inference of subsequent agreement based on prior, unchallenged explicit agreement is unreasonable. By not challenging the legality of the joint ventures, Plaintiffs concede the possibility that Defendants, acting collectively through the joint ventures, were permissibly motivated in imposing the price and use restrictions in question. <em>Cf. </em>U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just. <em>&amp; </em>Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n, <em>Antitrust Guidelines for Collaborations Among Competitors </em>5-6 (2000) (recognizing that joint ventures offer significant pro-competitive benefits) Conceding that possibility, it is just as likely that each Defendant was motivated on its own by the same permissible impulses that motivated the group as a collective, and Plaintiffs offer nothing now to create a reasonable inference that Defendants were not so motivated.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>For these reasons, I reject as unreasonable Plaintiffs\u2019 invitation to infer that Defendants\u2019 subsequent adoption of parallel price and use restrictions resulted from agreement based on their creation of or membership in the unchallenged joint ventures.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">b. Other Circumstantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The other circumstances alleged by Plaintiffs are similarly equivocal and do not justify the inference that Defendants\u2019 parallel conduct resulted from agreement. For instance, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation of a \u201cmotive to conspire\u201d is nothing more than an assertion of interdependence. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants possessed such a motive because they understood that price competition among them would only drive down the price of Digital Music. <em>(See </em>SCAC \u00b6 83.) There is no agreement, however, merely because an oligopolist charges an inflated price knowing (or even hoping) that other oligopolists will match his high price. Such is bald conscious parallelism, and, as the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cparallel conduct, even conduct consciously undertaken,\u201d does not itself state an antitrust conspiracy. <em>See Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1966; <em>see also </em>6 Areeda <em>&amp; </em>Hovenkamp, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1433 (surveying cases); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1432a (concluding that no agreement exists <em>\u201cmerely </em>from recognized interdependence without the addition of any facilitators\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">As noted above, the Supreme Court observed in <em>Twombly </em>that the mere participation in an industry trade association would not yield an inference of improper inter-firm communication. <em>See </em>127 S.Ct. at 1971 n. 12. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation concerning the RIAA in this action suffers a similar fate. That fact is, at best, neutral and thus adds nothing that would \u201c \u2018nudge [plaintiffs\u2019] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d \u2019 <em>In re Elevator Antitrust Litig., </em>502 F.3d 47, 50 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Defendants\u2019 \u201cantitrust record\u201d supports an inference of agreement is even less helpful. First, Plaintiffs overstate the weight that should be afforded to such evidence. <em>See </em>6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1421b(1) (\u201cpri- or conspiracy is not alone probative of present collusion\u201d); Richard A. Posner, <em>Antitrust Law </em>79 (2d ed. 2001) (antitrust record of an industry is useful to help enforcement agencies target limited resources). Indeed, as one commentator has suggested, \u201ccaution is required lest the defendants\u2019 demonstrated moral infirmities distract the court\u2019s attention from the distinction between tacit coordination through mere interdependence and traditional conspiracy.\u201d 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1421b(2). Still greater caution is required here, where the alleged \u201cantitrust record\u201d hardly illustrates any \u201cdemonstrated moral infirmities.\u201d As at least one other court has noted, mere investigation by governmental agencies does not show an \u201cantitrust record.\u201d <em>See In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig., </em>527 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1024 (N.D.Cal.2007) (investigation alone \u201ccarries no weight in pleading an antitrust conspiracy claim\u201d). Moreover, the investigations alleged here do not support the inference Plaintiffs urge: the DOJ closed its investigation after it \u201cuncovered no evidence that the major record labels\u2019 joint ventures have harmed competition or consumers of digital music\u201d (Almeida Decl. Ex. 5 (DOJ Press Release)), and the relevance of the New York State Attorney General\u2019s payola investigation is not apparent. Such an \u201cantitrust record\u201d cannot justify the already problematic inference that \u201conce a criminal, always a criminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 conclusion that the imposition of price and use restrictions was against Defendants\u2019 economic self-interests is implausible and, likewise, cannot support an inference of agreement. As discussed above, the imposition of use restrictions was, in fact, not contrary to Defendants\u2019 collective economic self-interests when viewed against the backdrop of widespread unauthorized music downloading. <em>(See supra </em>442.) That observation remains true for each individual Defendant. Indeed, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion, the unpopularity of Defendants\u2019 Internet Music use restrictions with consumers is hardly reflective of each Defendant\u2019s economic self-interest. <em>(See </em>SCAC \u00b6 76 (\u201cAny one of the Defendants right have removed these unpopular DRM and gained additional market share and profits.... \u201d).) Surely, any Defendant who decided to give its product away for free would have been popular with consumers, but refusing to do so is hardly the economically-irrational decision Plaintiffs portray it to be. Especially under the circumstances of widespread pirating, the fact that customers disliked each Defendant\u2019s attempt to secure its copyrights shows nothing. Nor do Plaintiffs derive support from the fact that the price for Defendants\u2019 Internet Music converged at a higher price than that charged by the independent music labels. It is beyond peradventure that different products will fetch different prices, and, though the parties have not briefed the issue of what price disparity would be reasonable here. I need not decide that issue to conclude that the mere existence of a disparity does not itself bespeak an act against self-interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Finally, Plaintiffs\u2019 ambiguous allegation of price increases does not support an inference of agreement because that conduct, as alleged, is consistent with sequential parallelism.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As commentators note, \u201c[n]o additional fact, such as advance agreement, is needed to explain that process,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cagreement is ordinarily more difficult to infer from sequential actions.\u201d 6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1425d(1). On the other hand, an inference of prior agreement may be warranted from simultaneous parallel price conduct where no actor had prior knowledge of or time to consider the other actors\u2019 conduct. <em>See Taxi Weekly, Inc. v. Metro. Taxicab Board of Trade, Inc., </em>539 F.2d 907, 911-12 (2d Cir.1976) (inference of prior agreement justified where taxi fleet owners each called to cancel subscription to trade publication within one half hour of each other one day after meeting); <em>see also </em>6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1425c. Here, Plaintiffs allege only that prices rose \u201cin or about May 2005.\u201d Affording Plaintiffs every reasonable inference, <em>Twombly </em>nevertheless requires that they plead further facts tending to show conspiracy; \u201cfacts\u201d such as these that are just as consistent with independent action are insufficient as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 588, 106 S.Ct. 1348 (\u201c[Cjonduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy .... \u201d (citing <em>Monsanto, </em>465 U.S. at 764, 104 S.Ct. 1464)).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">c. Economic Indicators</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Finally, Plaintiffs suggest that the existence of certain economic indicators is sufficient to justify the inference that Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>dants\u2019 parallel conduct resulted from agreement. <em>(See </em>Pls.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 9.) For this proposition, they rely principally on the work of Judge Richard A. Posner, who describes an approach to identifying and punishing tacit antitrust collusion based solely on economic evidence. <em>See </em>Posner, <em>supra, </em>at 69. That approach posits two sets of economic data: indicators that \u201cidentif[y] those markets in which conditions are propitious for the emergence of collusion\u201d and indicators that reveal \u201cwhether there really is collusive pricing in any of those markets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first set of indicators, while valuable to help enforcement agencies direct limited resources, <em>see id. </em>at 69, 79, do not show that the alleged conduct \u201cstemmed from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express.\u201d <em>Theatre Enters., </em>346 U.S. at 540, 74 S.Ct. 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Without reaching the question whether economic evidence alone may be sufficient to support an inference of agreement,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to do so here fails on its own terms. In this case, Plaintiffs allege only facts that would identify the market for Digital Music as one \u201cin which conditions are propitious for the emergence of collusion.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>(See </em>SCAC \u00b6\u00b6 6 (high seller-side concentration), 47 (low buyer-side concentration), 70-71 (similar cost structures among Defendants), 72 (industry-wide cooperative practices).)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As Judge Posner recognizes, however, those facts do not render plausible the inference of agreement among these Defendants: just because you grow up in a high crime area does not make you a criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that the SCAC does not allege the further facts required by <em>Twombly </em>to state a \u00a7 1 claim based upon parallel conduct. Count One is, therefore, DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">B. <em>The State Antitrust and Consumer Protection Count</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">1. The State Antitrust Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">As noted above, Count Two of the SCAC asserts claims under the antitrust laws of the following 16 jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Washington, D.C., Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendants argue that those claims must be dismissed for the same reason as the federal claim. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">At its heart, <em>Twombly </em>is a decision about the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure: to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a pleading must include allegations that make its claim for relief plausible, not merely possible. <em>See </em>127 S.Ct. at 1974 (pleading must include \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\u201d). That purely procedural standard of pleading binds this Court\u2019s evaluation of state law claims, <em>see, e.g., </em>5B Charles Alan Wright <em>&amp; </em>Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 1357 (3d ed. 2008), and, while it has caused much ado in the legal community, <em>see, e.g., Iqbal v. Hasty, </em>490 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir.2007) (finding \u201c[cjonsiderable uncertainty concerning the standard for assessing the adequacy of pleadings\u201d after Twombly), it did not alter the substantive federal law of antitrust: parallel conduct alone, even if consciously undertaken by individual firms, does not constitute a conspiracy to restrain trade in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act. The question, therefore, is not whether the relevant state courts would decide <em>Twombly </em>the same way but, rather, whether the state\u2019s antitrust law incorporates the same substantive principle of federal antitrust law regarding conscious parallelism.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">I answer this question in the affirmative for several reasons. First, some courts have explicitly adopted, as a matter of state substantive antitrust law, the federal approach to the question of whether consciously parallel conduct alone constitutes an antitrust conspiracy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Second, several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>states\u2019 antitrust statutes explicitly direct state courts to consider, as persuasive or controlling authority, federal court decisions construing the federal antitrust laws.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Third, even absent such a statutory mandate, the courts in each jurisdiction overwhelmingly look to federal antitrust decisions to construe their own antitrust statutes.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is irrelevant that states have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>declined to follow federal antitrust law for the proposition that indirect purchasers lack standing to sue. <em>See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, </em>431 U.S. 720, 97 S.Ct. 2061, 52 L.Ed.2d 707 (1977). As the Supreme Court of Iowa explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-4\">The purpose behind both state and federal antitrust law is to apply a uniform standard of conduct so that businesses will know what is acceptable conduct and what is not acceptable conduct. To achieve this uniformity or predictability, we are not required to define who may sue in our state courts in the same way federal courts have defined who may maintain an action in federal court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Harmonizing our construction and interpretation of state law as to what conduct is governed by the law satisfies the harmonization provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em>Comes v. Microsoft Corp., </em>646 N.W.2d 440, 446 (Iowa 2002); <em>accord Hyde v. Abbott Labs., Inc., </em>123 N.C.App. 572, 579, 473 S.E.2d 680, 685 (N.C.Ct.App.1996) (declining to follow <em>Illinois Brick </em>for other reasons). That is to say, disagreement about who can sue does not entail disagreement about when they may recover. Finally, however, the simple fact remains that each state statute requires some form of agreement,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and independently undertaken parallel conduct, even if undertaken consciously, does not itself demonstrate agreement. For those reasons and in light of my discussion of the federal claims, the state antitrust claims are DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">2. State Consumer Protection Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">As noted above, Count Two of the SCAC also asserts claims under the consumer protection laws of the following eight juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>dictions: California, Washington D.C., Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Mexico and North Carolina.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> To support those claims, Plaintiffs allege the same conduct that forms the basis of their antitrust claims. <em>(See, e.g., </em>Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 2 (\u201cThe pertinent state consumer protection laws encompass price-fixing claims because price fixing is a form of unfair, unconscionable or deceptive conduct.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 34 n.39.) While the statutes at issue may embrace a violation of federal antitrust laws as a grounds for relief,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> my conclusion that Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged such a violation necessarily precludes their attempt to recast that violation as an unfair business practice.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">For the reasons stated above, therefore, Count Two of the SCAC is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">C. The Unjust Enrichment Count</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Count Three of the SCAC alleges unjust enrichment: \u201cThe economic benefit of the overcharges and unlawful profits sought by and derived by Defendants through charging supra competitive and artificially inflated prices for Internet Music and CDs is a direct and proximate result of Defendants\u2019 unlawful practices.\u201d (SCAC \u00b6 141; <em>see also </em>Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 40 (\u201c[T]he economic benefit gained by <em>Defendants </em>from Plaintiffs through Defendants\u2019 price-fixing and anticompetitive conduct is precisely the issue here. The proper focus is on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>amounts by which Defendants were enriched.\u201d (emphasis in original)).) Having concluded above that the SCAC fails to allege a violation of the antitrust laws, Plaintiffs cannot now maintain their unjust enrichment claim predicated on the benefit accruing to Defendants as a result of that alleged violation. Therefore, Count Three of the SCAC is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"AnO\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">For the reasons stated above, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the SCAC [dkt. no. 75] is GRANTED, and Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend SCAC Paragraph 99 [dkt. no. 104] is DENIED as futile.

Some guidance may also be taken from the cases limiting the inference that may be drawn from allegations of antitrust conspiracy in other markets, <em>see, e.g., Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 595-96, 106 S.Ct. 1348, or from commentary recognizing the limits of allegations of earlier conspiracy in the same market, <em>see </em>6 Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1421b(3).

Further, it is worth noting that SCAC\u2019s description of the market for Internet Music is inconsistent in some basic respects with the type of market Judge Posner describes as vulnerable to price collusion. That is to say, as it is described in the SCAC, the Internet Music market is not characterized by the relative inability of competitors to increase supply or decrease prices to challenge effectively the conspirators\u2019 market control, <em>see </em>Posner, <em>supra, </em>at 63-64, but rather as one where, for instance, eMusic was able to increase its \"production\u201d rapidly through relationships with \"hundreds of independent record labels,\u201d sufficient even to surpass Defendants in the market <em>(see </em>SCAC \u00b6 104).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b486-9\">.It should be noted that the paragraphs in the SCAC invoked to support the claim that Plaintiffs have pleaded high barriers to market entry <em>(see </em>Pis.\u2019 Opp\u2019n 11 (citing SCAC \u00b6\u00b6 55-57)) do not mention barriers to market entry.
