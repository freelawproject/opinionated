KYLE, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">The federal courts are frequently confronted with sympathetic plaintiffs who are, nevertheless, without remedy by operation of law. Doctrines such as qualified immunity often shield defendants from liability even when plaintiffs have been injured by the defendants\u2019 conduct. As one court has stated, \u201c[ljitigants must believe that judges spend an inordinate amount of time wringing their hands while informing persons who have been [injured] that the court will do nothing. This is not because judges like to make litigants feel bad \u2014 or themselves feel good by expressing sympathy \u2014 but because it is important to point out that the absence of a particular remedy ... does not imply ... the lack of a legal wrong.\u201d <em>Pacelli v. deVito, </em>972 F.2d 871, 879 (7th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">Like qualified immunity, the doctrine of federal preemption also leaves some plaintiffs without judicial recourse to pursue claims for damages. In one recent example, hundreds of people injured by the release of noxious gas following a 2002 train derailment in Minot, North Dakota were left without any remedy because their claims were preempted by the Federal Railroad Safety Act. <em>See Lundeen v. Canadian Pac. Ry. Co., </em>532 F.3d 682, 687 (8th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Medtronic, the Defendant in this multidistrict litigation,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> asserts the same doctrine here, arguing that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u2014 sounding in negligence and strict products liability \u2014 are preempted by the Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 <em>et seq. </em>Having carefully considered the parties\u2019 voluminous submissions, the Court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-15\">I. The statutory and regulatory framework and the pre-market approval process</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-16\">Every medical device intended for human use is placed into one of three categories by the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), based on the risks of injury or illness the device presents; each category is subjected to a different level of FDA scrutiny. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c(a)(1); <em>Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 999, 1003, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). Devices that either \u201csupport! ] or sustain! ] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>human life\u201d or \u201cpresent[] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury\u201d are categorized as \u201cClass III\u201d devices. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c(a)(l)(c)(ii). Class III devices are subject to the greatest level of FDA scrutiny and \u201cmust complete a thorough review process with the FDA before they may be marketed.\u201d <em>Buckman Co. v. Plaintiffs\u2019 Legal Comm., </em>531 U.S. 341, 344, 121 S.Ct. 1012, 148 L.Ed.2d 854 (2001). Through this process, known as pre-mar-ket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d), a device maker must provide the FDA with \u201creasonable assurance\u201d that its device is both safe and effective. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">The PMA process is \u201ca rigorous one.\u201d <em>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, </em>518 U.S. 470, 477, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996). \u201cManufacturers must submit detailed information regarding the safety and efficacy of their devices, which the FDA then reviews, spending an average of 1,200 hours on each submission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When analyzing that information, the FDA must weigh the \u201cprobable benefit to health from the use of the device against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(C). Accordingly, the FDA sometimes grants PMA to potentially life-threatening devices, if they \u201coffer great benefits in light of available alternatives.\u201d <em>Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1004; <em>accord Heisner ex rel. Heisner v. Genzyme Corp., </em>No. 08-C-593, 2008 WL 2940811, at *5 (N.D.Ill. July 25, 2008) (\u201cOut of practical necessity and the cold calculus of nationwide regulation, the FDA may be aware of a certain failure rate associated with a medical product and yet approve it.\u201d). The PMA process also requires the FDA to review a device\u2019s proposed labeling to ensure that it is neither false nor misleading. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">If a device receives PMA, the manufacturer may not change its design specifications, manufacturing processes, labeling, or any other attribute that would affect the device\u2019s safety or efficacy without FDA approval. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360e(d)(6)(A)(i). Should a manufacturer wish to make such changes, it must submit to the FDA an application for supplemental PMA, which is evaluated \u201cunder largely the same criteria as an initial application.\u201d <em>Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1005; <em>accord </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 814.39(c) (\u201cAll procedures and actions that apply to an application [for PMA] also apply to PMA supplements.\u201d). In addition, once a device receives PMA, a manufacturer must inform the FDA when it becomes aware of adverse events in patients using the device. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 803.50, 803.53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">II. The FDCA\u2019s express preemption clause</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">In response to a bevy of state laws regulating medical devices largely enacted due to the failure of the Daikon Shield contraceptive in the 1970s, Congress passed the Medical Device Amendments to the FDCA in 1976. <em>See Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1003. The Medical Device Amendments include an express preemption clause that \u201cswept back some state obligations and imposed a regime of detailed federal oversight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The preemption clause states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-9\">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-10\">(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1190-11\">(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">The scope of Section 360k(a) has been the subject of repeated litigation and the results are, charitably speaking, utterly conflicted. The Supreme Court got into the act in 1996 in <em>Lohr, </em>but did little to clear up the confusion. That \u201cwondrously complex\u201d decision, <em>In re Medtronic, Inc. Implantable Defibrillators Litig., </em>465 F.Supp.2d 886, 892 (D.Minn.2006) (Rosenbaum, J.) \u2014 which has been described by one court of appeals as \u201cfractured in an all but irreconcilable manner,\u201d <em>Goodlin v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 1367, 1371 (11th Cir.1999)\u2014concluded that the plaintiffs claims for negligence and strict products liability arising out of the use of a Med-tronic pacemaker were not preempted by Section 360k(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Justice Breyer agreed with the <em>Lohr </em>plurality that the plaintiffs claims were not preempted, he also agreed with the four dissenters that the Medical Device Amendments \u201cordinarily ... pre-empt ... state-law tort action[s].\u201d 518 U.S. at 504-05, 116 S.Ct. 2240 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Given the uncertainty left in <em>Lohr\u2019s </em>wake, in the years that followed courts were divided over how broadly Section 360k(a) reached in medical-device cases. <em>Compare Goodlin, </em>167 F.3d at 1382 (concluding that state tort-law claims regarding alleged defects in Medtronic pacemaker lead were not preempted) with <em>Kemp v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>231 F.3d 216, 237 (6th Cir.2000) (concluding that state tort-law claims regarding the <em>same </em>types of defects in the <em>same </em>Medtronic pacemaker lead <em>were </em>preempted). Nevertheless, over time the scales began to tip decidedly in favor of preemption, with more and more courts ruling that state-law claims concerning FDA-approved medical devices were indeed preempted. <em>See In re Sulzer Hip Prosthesis &amp; Knee Prosthesis Liab. Litig., </em>455 F.Supp.2d 709, 716 (N.D.Ohio 2006) (canvassing case law and concluding that majority view is that \u201cvirtually all state law claims seeking to hold a defendant liable for injuries caused by an FDA-approved medical device are preempted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-9\">Early last year, the Supreme Court confirmed that the prevailing view is the correct one. In <em>Riegel, </em>the Court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims for strict products liability, breach of implied warranty, and negligence in the design, testing, inspection, distribution, labeling, marketing, and sale of an FDA-approved medical device were preempted under the FDCA. 128 S.Ct. at 1007-10. In reaching that conclusion, the Court undertook a two-step analysis. First, tracking the language of Section 360k(a), the Court opined that pre-market approval of a medical device by the FDA imposes \u201crequirements\u201d under the FDCA, because the device must be \u201cmade with almost no deviations from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>the specifications in [the PMA] application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1007. Second, the Court opined that permitting the plaintiffs\u2019 claims to proceed would impose requirements \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d the requirements imposed via the PMA process. <em>Id. </em>In so holding, the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1192-4\">[s]tate tort law that requires a manufacturer\u2019s [device] to be safer, but hence less effective, than the model the FDA has approved disrupts the federal scheme no less than state regulatory law to the same effect. Indeed, one would think that tort law, applied by juries under a negligence or strict-liability standard, is less deserving of preservation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1008. Because both prongs of Section 360k(a) had been met, the Court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">In the ten months following <em>Riegel, </em>courts across the country have applied Section 360k(a) broadly, preempting all manner of claims from strict products liability and negligence, <em>see, e.g., Bausch v. Stryker Corp., </em>No. 08 C 4248, 2008 WL 5157940 (N.D.Ill. Dec. 9, 2008); <em>Despain v. Bradburn, </em>372 Ark. 272, \u2014 S.W.3d -, 2008 WL 1067202 (2008), to breach of warranty, <em>see Link v. Zimmer Holdings, Inc., </em>\u2014 F.Supp.2d -, 2008 WL 5047677 (N.D.Ill. Nov. 26, 2008); <em>Blanco v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>158 Cal.App.4th 1039, 70 Cal.Rptr. 3rd 566 (2008), to failure to warn and manufacturing-and-design-defect, <em>see Parker v. Stryker Corp., </em>584 F.Supp.2d 1298 (D.Colo.2008), to negligence <em>per se, see Heisner, </em>2008 WL 2940811.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-13\">Yet <em>Riegel </em>left open a back door for plaintiffs: claims alleging that a manufacturer failed to adhere to the specifications imposed by a device\u2019s PMA are not preempted. <em>Id. </em>at 1011; <em>accord Stevens v. Pacesetter, Inc., </em>No. 3:07-cv-3812, 2008 WL 2637417, at *1 (D.S.C. Apr. 1, 2008) (noting that a \u201cnarrow category\u201d of claims survive <em>Riegel </em>\u2014 those \u201calleging a failure to comply with the federal standards which were established through the PMA process\u201d). Such claims are not preempted because they merely \u201cparallel\u201d federal requirements \u2014 that is, they do not <em>add to </em>or <em>differ from </em>federal requirements, which is the cornerstone of FDCA preemption. <em>Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1011 (citing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-14\">III. Medtronic and the medical devices at issue here</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-15\">The following allegations, which the Court must accept as true for purposes of the instant Motion, <em>e.g., Stodghill v. Wellston Sch. Dist., </em>512 F.3d 472, 476 (8th Cir.2008), are set forth in Plaintiffs\u2019 Master Consolidated Complaint for Individuals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>Medtronic is a Minnesota corporation with its principal place of business in Minneapolis. (Compl. \u00b67.) It is one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of medical devices, including implantable cardiac defibrillators (\u201cICDs\u201d). <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 2.) ICDs are small devices implanted in patients\u2019 chests to monitor heart rates and correct heart-rhythm abnormalities. <em>{Id.) </em>They do so through small wires called \u201cleads\u201d that on one end are attached to the ICD and on the other end are attached directly to the patient\u2019s heart muscle through a coronary vein. <em>{Id.) </em>If electrodes on the leads detect that the patient\u2019s heart is out of rhythm, the ICD sends an electric shock to the heart muscle through the leads in order to correct the problem. <em>{Id.) </em>ICDs and the leads attached to them are categorized as \u201cClass III\u201d devices under the FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\">Medtronic has manufactured ICD leads since at least 1992, when it submitted an application (later approved) for PMA of its Transvene Leads System. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 18.) Since that time, Medtronic has manufactured several different types of ICD leads, which have grown progressively smaller in subsequent iterations. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For example, Medtronic\u2019s Sprint Quattro leads, approved by the FDA in 2001 as part of a PMA supplement to the Tran-svene Lead System, measured 2.8 inches wide. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 20, 27.) Later, in November 2003, Medtronic submitted a PMA supplement for its Sprint Fidelis leads,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which measured 2.1 inches wide. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 21.) The FDA granted Medtronic\u2019s applications for supplemental PMA of the Sprint Fidelis leads in June 2004.(M) According to Plaintiffs, the Sprint Fidel-is leads substantially differ from the Sprint Quattro leads and were not adequately tested by Medtronic prior to seeking FDA approval. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22, 24.) Plaintiffs further claim that the method of manufacturing the Sprint Fidelis leads, which involves \u201cdirect resistance spot welding of two different metals,\u201d is prone to damaging them, and that Medtronic knew (but failed to disclose to the FDA) that such a welding technique was likely to result in the leads failing. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32, 34.) Finally, Plaintiffs claim that Med-tronic failed to take adequate steps to ensure that the Sprint Fidelis leads were not damaged during production, including failing to perform adequate testing on the leads\u2019 components and failing to take corrective action to prevent lead failures. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">In 2006, patients with ICDs using Sprint Fidelis leads began to suffer unnecessary and painful shocks. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 43.) An investigation by a physician at the Minneapolis Heart Institute concluded that the shocks were caused by fractures in the leads and that the leads were failing at a significantly higher rate than the Sprint Quattro leads, a sentiment echoed by another physician at Cornell University Medical Center in New York. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 43, 45, 49-52.) Plaintiffs claim that upon being confronted with this information, Medtronic undertook a campaign to defend the Sprint Fidelis leads, even though it knew that they were unsafe. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-61.) As part of that campaign, Medtronic purportedly delayed filing \u201cadverse event reports\u201d with the FDA concerning failures of the leads. <em>{Id. </em>\u00b6 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1154\">*1154</page-number>In May 2007, Medtronic filed a supplemental PMA application containing design and manufacturing changes to the Sprint Fidelis leads. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 58.) According to Plaintiffs, Medtronic filed this supplement in order to correct defects endemic to the leads; <em>(Id.) </em>Yet, Medtronic did not advise the FDA that it was filing the PMA supplement because of the lead failures and the resulting \u201cpublic health crisis,\u201d instead merely informing it that the proposed changes were intended to make the leads more \u201crobust.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The FDA approved Medtronic\u2019s PMA supplement in July 2007, but previously manufactured (and allegedly defective) Sprint Fidelis leads continued to be shipped to hospitals and implanted into patients. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">On September 10, 2007, Medtronic \u201cfinally\u201d filed more than 120 adverse event reports concerning Sprint Fidelis leads. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 62.) On October 7, 2007, Medtronic suspended sales of the leads but did not inform the FDA, doctors, or the public of its decision, and they continued to be implanted into patients. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 63.) On October 15, 2007, Medtronic recalled the Sprint Fidelis leads, and the FDA issued a \u201cClass I\u201d recall shortly thereafter. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 64-65.) A Class I recall is \u201cthe most serious type of medical device recall\u201d and occurs only when \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that the use of the producft] will cause serious injury or death.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>At the time of the recall, approximately 257,000 Sprint Fidelis leads remained implanted in patients. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 69.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">Following the recall, plaintiffs across the country began to file actions against Med-tronic alleging (among other things) claims for negligence, strict products liability, fraud, and breach of express and implied warranties regarding the Sprint Fidelis leads. On February 21, 2008, 536 F.Supp.2d 1375, the Judicial Panel on Mul-tidistrict Litigation consolidated 27 of those actions before the undersigned for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407. Scores of other cases were later transferred here as \u201ctag along\u201d actions. The Court has, appointed lead counsel for Plaintiffs and a steering committee to direct the course of the litigation on their behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-7\">Pursuant to the Court\u2019s Order dated June 4, 2008 (Doc. No. 115), Plaintiffs\u2019 steering committee has now filed a Master Consolidated Complaint against Medtronic containing 21 claims, each of which is deemed incorporated into the Complaints in the individual actions pending before the Court in this Multidistrict Litigation. <em>(See id. </em>\u00b6 17.A.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Medtronic now moves to dismiss each of the claims as preempted by the FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-9\">The recent Supreme Court case of <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), sets forth the standard to be applied when evaluating a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). To avoid dismissal, a complaint must include \u201cenough facts to state a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1155\">*1155</page-number>to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1974. Stated differently, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts \u201cto provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of Ms \u2018entitle[ment] to relief,\u2019 [which] requires more than labels and conclusions, and [for which] a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1964-65 (citation omitted). Thus, a complaint cannot simply \u201cle[ave] open the possibility that a plaintiff might later establish some \u2018set of undisclosed facts\u2019 to support recovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1968 (citation omitted). Rather, the facts set forth in the complaint must be sufficient to \u201cnudge[ ] the[ ] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\">When reviewing a motion to dismiss, the complaint must be liberally construed, assuming the facts alleged therein as true and drawing all reasonable inferences from those facts in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Id. </em>at 1964-65. A complaint should not be dismissed simply because a court is doubtful that the plaintiff will be able to prove all of the factual allegations contained therein. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, a well-pleaded complaint will survive a motion to dismiss \u201c \u2018even if it appears that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-6\">Medtronic argues that, following <em>Riegel, </em>each claim in the Complaint is preempted under Section 360k(a) because it requires a determination that \u201cthe leads should have been designed, manufactured, tested, marketed, or labeled differently from the manner approved by the FDA via the PMA process.\u201d (Def. Mem. at 11.) Plaintiffs respond that Medtronic lost its preemption argument when the Sprint Fidelis leads were recalled and, in any event, that their claims fall within the narrow window left open by <em>Riegel </em>for \u201cparallel\u201d claims. (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 16-32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">I. The recall does not deprive Medtronic of its preemption argument</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-9\">Plaintiffs first argue that Medtronic \u201chas lost its federal preemption defense altogether\u201d because the recall \u201cinvalidated\u201d the leads\u2019 PMA. (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 16-18.) Building on that assertion, Plaintiffs contend that the federal interest preemption is intended to protect \u2014 the PMA process \u2014 no longer exists because the PMA is no longer valid. <em>(Id. </em>at 17.) This argument is flawed for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-10\">First, the argument is predicated on the faulty assumption that the recall invalidated the leads\u2019 PMA. Plaintiffs have cited no authority for that proposition, and Med-tronic correctly notes that the PMA process is governed by a completely separate statutory and regulatory regime than that governing withdrawal of a PMA \u2014 a process to which the Sprint Fidelis leads have never been subjected. Several courts have recognized this distinction. <em>See, e.g., Theofanis ex rel. Theofanis v. Boston Scientific Corp., </em>No. IP 01-752-C-Y/K, 2003 WL 24049229, at *2 (S.D.Ind. June 24, 2003) (noting that notwithstanding manufacturer\u2019s recall of device, \u201cthe PMA for the [device] has never been revoked by the FDA\u201d); <em>Blanco, </em>70 Cal.Rptr.3d at 580 (\u201cThe fact the FDA has implemented a Class I recall does not necessarily mean the FDA has completely removed the device from the marketplace.\u201d). The FDA, too, recognizes the distinction between the recall of a device and the revocation of a device\u2019s PMA \u2014 it has noted that \u201c[w]hen a company recalls a medical device, it ... takes action to prevent the problem <em>from, happening again.\u201d </em>http://www.fda.gov/ cdrh/recallsAearn.html# 1 (emphasis added) (last visited January 2, 2009). There cannot be an \u201cagain\u201d for a recalled device if the recall invalidated the device\u2019s PMA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>Second, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument ignores that PMA for the Sprint Fidelis leads was in place <em>at the time the leads were implanted. </em>This is what matters, because liability under Plaintiffs\u2019 various legal theories hinges upon whether the leads were defective <em>at that time. See Baker v. St. Jude Med., S.C., Inc., </em>178 S.W.3d 127, 134 n. 5 (Tex.App.2005) (rejecting contention that preemption \u201cevaporates if the FDA later determines that the PMA approval was wrongly granted\u201d; \u201cWhether St. Jude was in compliance with federal requirements setting the standard of care <em>at the time the alleged tort was committed </em>is the appropriate issue.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also Moore v. Sulzer Orthopedics, Inc., </em>337 F.Supp.2d 1002, 1009-12 (N.D.Ohio 2004) (finding preemption despite device recall); <em>Theofanis, </em>2003 WL 24049229, at *5-6 (same); <em>Blanco, </em>70 Cal.Rptr.3d at 579 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">Third, Plaintiffs\u2019 argument would fail even if the recall somehow invalidated the PMA. Plaintiffs correctly note that the federal interest preemption is designed to protect is the PMA process. (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 17.) But the assertion that this interest would \u201cno longer exist\u201d if a PMA were invalidated is wrong \u2014 preemption necessarily looks <em>backward </em>(to the time of PMA) rather than <em>forward. Riegel </em>illustrates this point. There, the PMA process had concluded long before the plaintiffs commenced their lawsuit. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court recognized that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims threatened to interfere with the PMA process because allowing them to proceed would, in essence, result in <em>retroactive </em>second-guessing of the FDA\u2019s decision-making. This logic would apply with equal force if a PMA were invalidated or withdrawn \u2014 because, as in <em>Riegel, </em>a jury confronting such a situation would be required to retroactively question the FDA\u2019s initial decision to approve the medical device at issue. Doing so would interfere with the PMA process <em>ipso facto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">II. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are all preempted</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-8\">Plaintiffs next argue that they avoid preemption because they have asserted \u201cparallel\u201d claims \u2014 that is, claims that are not \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d federal requirements. The Court cannot agree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1196-9\">As noted above, there are 21 claims asserted in the Complaint. Plaintiffs have not addressed these claims individually but have instead loosely grouped them into categories, and Medtronic appears to agree that those categories include all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Accordingly, the Court will address each category in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1157\">*1157</page-number>A. Manufacturing-defect claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 manufacturing-defect claims are based on a simple assertion: \u201cMed-tronic\u2019s defective welds caused the Sprint Fidelis leads to fracture.\u201d (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 21.) The welds purportedly were \u201cdefective\u201d because \u201cMedtronic used inadequate welding techniques\u201d that did not comply with the FDA\u2019s Current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cCGMPs\u201d) and Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d). <em>(Id. </em>at 21-23 (citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 91).) Plaintiffs further allege that Medtronic\u2019s testing and quality-assurance protocols were inadequate and failed to comply with the CGMPs and QSR. <em>(Id. </em>at 22.) Hence, Plaintiffs claim that they are seeking only to enforce FDA requirements (the CGMPs/QSR) and, as a result, their manufacturing-defect claims are merely \u201cparallel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the CGMPs and QSR, however, does not save these claims from preemption. It is true that the CGMPs and QSR govern \u201cthe methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices intended for human use.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 820.1(a)(1). But they are simply too generic, standing alone, to serve as the basis for Plaintiffs\u2019 manufacturing-defect claims. The CGMPs and QSR require manufacturers to develop <em>their own </em>quality-system controls to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended use, and they are inherently flexible. <em>See </em>FDA Device Advice, Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP)/Quality System (QS) Regulation, available at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ devadvice/32.html# flexibility (last visited January 2, 2009) (\u201cFDA has identified in the QS regulation the essential elements that a quality system shall embody for design, production and distribution, <em>without prescribing specific ways to establish these elements. Because the QS regulation covers a broad spectrum of devices and production processes, it allows some leeway in the details of quality system elements\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). The FDA recognizes that the CGMPs and QSR simply cannot cover, in detail, all of the design, production, and marketing elements for every medical device in existence. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cIt is not practical for a regulation to specify details of quality system elements for such a wide range of products.\u201d). Rather, they are intended to serve only as \u201can umbrella quality system,\u201d providing \u201cgeneral objectives\u201d medical-device manufacturers must seek to achieve. <em>Id. </em>In fact, the CGMPs/QSR provide specific methods to be used for only a small number of medical devices. \u201cIn most cases, <em>it is left to the manufacturer to determine the best methods to obtain quality objectives.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As the FDA stated when it promulgated the CGMP/QSR final rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-8\">Because this regulation must apply to so many different types of devices, the regulation does not prescribe in detail how a manufacturer must produce a specific device. Rather, the regulation provides the framework that all manufacturers must follow by requiring that manufacturers develop and follow procedures and fill in the details that are appropriate to a given device according to the current state-of-the-art manufacturing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>for that specific device. FDA has made changes to the proposed regulation ... to provide manufacturers with ever greater flexibility in achieving the quality requirements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\"><em>Medical Devices; Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Final Rule; Quality System Regulation, </em>61 Fed. Reg. 52,602, 52,603 (Oct. 7, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">The flexibility inherent in the CGMPs and QSR demonstrates why Plaintiffs\u2019 manufacturing-defect claims are not \u201cparallel.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that Medtronic\u2019s welding techniques were \u201cdefective,\u201d but they have not pleaded how that welding technique violated the CGMPs or QSR. This is likely because the CGMPs and QSR do not provide such a f\u00edne level of detail concerning the manufacture of defibrillator leads (or most other medical devices). In the absence of any specific requirement in the CGMPs/QSR that Medtronic weld the Sprint Fidelis leads in a certain fashion, holding Medtronic liable for such a welding \u201cdefect\u201d would impose requirements \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d those under federal law. This is equally true of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that Medtronic used inadequate testing and quality-assurance methods\u2014 Plaintiffs simply have not identified any specific requirements in the CGMPs/QSR that were purportedly violated by Med-tronic. Without any such specified requirement, Plaintiffs necessarily seek to impose requirements that differ from the CGMPs/QSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to allege in detail the federal requirement(s) purportedly violated by Medtronic also raises the specter of <em>Twombly. </em>Plaintiffs cannot simply incant the magic words \u201cMedtronic violated FDA regulations\u201d in order to avoid preemption. <em>See Parker, </em>584 F.Supp.2d at 1301 (conclusory allegation that device \u201cwas sold in direct violation of the Code of Federal Regulations\u201d insufficient under <em>Twombly </em>to save claim from FDCA preemption). Hence, their assertion that the Sprint Fi-delis leads did not comply with the CGMPs/QSR is insufficient, without more, to save their claims. <em>See Heisner, </em>2008 WL 2940811, at *5-6 (claims preempted under FDCA where plaintiff failed to provide factual basis for assertion that defendant failed to comply with FDA regulations); <em>Cottengim v. Mentor Corp., </em>Civ. No. 05-161, 2007 WL 2782885, at *5 (E.D.Ky. Sept. 24, 2007) (rejecting argument that \u201cmere allegations that a manufacturing defect exists is enough to avoid preemption\u201d). Under <em>Twombly, </em>Plaintiffs were required to provide enough factual detail in the Complaint to alert Medtronic of the \u201cgrounds\u201d upon which their manufacturing-defect claim rests. 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65. Merely alleging that Medtronic failed to comply with the CGMPs/QSR by using spot welding is insufficient without some factual detail about <em>why </em>that violates federal standards. <em>Id. </em>Instead, Plaintiffs were required to point to something in the CGMPs/QSR precluding the use of spot welding in order to state a manufacturing-defect claim that is \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1974.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\"><em>Rollins v. St. Jude Medical, </em>583 F.Supp.2d 790 (W.D.La.2008), provides an example of the types of allegations sufficient to survive preemption under <em>Twom-bly. </em>There, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had failed to comply with the device\u2019s PMA specifications requiring the device to be \u201cpackaged with [its] anchor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>vertical position with the bypass tube, neither extending beyond the end of the tube nor inserted deeply within it,\u201d by \u201cincorrectly pack[ing][it] with a .038\u201d guidewire as opposed to the required .035 \u201cguide-wire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800. No similarly detailed allegations appear in the Complaint here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">B. Failure-to-warn claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">In their failure-to-warn claims, Plaintiffs allege that Medtronic \u201cfailed to provide adequate and timely warnings or instructions regarding the Sprint Fidelis [ljeads.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 121.) Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Medtronic failed to warn physicians and patients of the defects in the leads prior to announcing the recall on October 15, 2007. (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 25.) This is a \u201cparallel\u201d claim, Plaintiffs argue, because the FDA \u201cencourages voluntary recalls and unilateral changes to warning labels\u201d and \u201cFDA regulations specifically permit manufacturers to make labeling changes to enhance product safety, without pre-approval from the FDA.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>(citing 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 814.39).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-8\">But Plaintiffs cannot escape that under their theory of liability, Medtronic would have been required to provide warnings, above and beyond those on the Sprint Fidelis leads\u2019 product label \u2014 a label that was specifically approved by the FDA as part of the PMA process. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360c(a)(2)(B). Mandating that a manufacturer provide warnings beyond those on the device label would impose requirements \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d those approved by the FDA, and are thus preempted. <em>See King v. Collagen Corp., </em>983 F.2d 1130, 1136 (1st Cir.1993).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Simply put, Section 360k(a) preempts claims that are, as here, \u201cpremised on a \u2018post-sale duty to warn,\u2019 where the plaintiff alleges the defendant was required to provide additional warnings in light of later-received reports of injury to others caused by the same medical device.\u201d <em>In re Sulzer Hip, </em>455 F.Supp.2d at 717 n. 10 (emphasis omitted). For the same reasons, claims alleging that Medtronic should have recalled the Sprint Fidelis leads sooner than it did are similarly preempted. <em>See, e.g., Cupek v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>405 F.3d 421, 424 (6th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1200-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>Furthermore, Medtronic correctly notes that the FDA regulations cited by Plaintiffs <em>permit </em>a device manufacturer to give certain warnings, but Plaintiffs\u2019 failure-to-warn theory necessarily requires a showing that Medtronic was <em>required </em>to give those warnings. And, Plaintiffs have not identified in the Complaint any federal regulation, rule, or other source of obligation that would <em>require </em>such a warning to be given. In similar circumstances, the Seventh Circuit held that a failure-to-warn claim was preempted because it was not \u201cparallel\u201d to federal requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-3\">[21 C.F.R.] Section 814.39 permits a manufacturer to temporarily amend a warning pending FDA approval of ... proposed changes.... McMullen discusses at length the fact that Medtronic was \u201callowed\u201d and \u201cpermitted\u201d to issue an interim safety alert while awaiting approval of its amended warning. He argues that state common law requiring a post-sale warning merely \u201ccomplements\u201d the federal policy of allowing such warnings, and thus is not preempted. Recall, however, that the MDA\u2019s preemption clause provides that state requirements that are \u201cin addition to\u201d federal requirements are preempted. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a). <em>Where a federal requirement permits a course of conduct and the state makes it obligatory, the state\u2019s requirement is in addition to the federal requirement and thus is preempted. </em>Because \u00a7 814.39 permits, but does not require, a manufacturer to provide interim supplemental warnings pending approval by the FDA, a common-law duty to provide such a warning imposes an additional obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aco\"><em>McMullen v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>421 F.3d 482, 489 (7th Cir.2005) (emphasis added); <em>accord King, </em>983 F.2d at 1139 (Aldrich, J., concurring) (\u201cPlaintiff claims that because [Section 814.39 states] that a manufacturer \u2018may,\u2019 without prior approval, make certain changes that enhance safety, defendant had a duty to make such here. It is sufficient to say that to interpret \u2018may\u2019 as \u2018should\u2019 would unravel the entire garment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">Plaintiffs attempt to remedy this defect by identifying a source for the \u201crequirement\u201d that Medtronic provide post-PMA warnings: \u201cthe FDA approved the Sprint Fidelis Lead PMA Supplements <em>subject to certain express conditions.\u201d </em>(Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 26 n. 13 (emphasis in original) (quoting Compl. \u00b623).) However, Plaintiffs nowhere specified in their brief what those \u201cexpress conditions\u201d were, nor did they make any effort to indicate how those conditions mandated the warnings that Plaintiffs claim Medtronic failed to provide. Shortly before the hearing on Med-tronic\u2019s Motion, however, Plaintiffs finally attempted to supply that information, submitting to the Court the FDA\u2019s letter granting PMA to the Sprint Fidelis leads. Plaintiffs now argue that the \u201cexpress conditions\u201d of pre-market approval required Medtronic to advise the FDA of adverse events in patients using the leads. <em>(See </em>Doc. No. 219, Ex. A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">But the reporting requirements Plaintiffs point to in the approval letter come from 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 803.50 and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 803.53, regulations that were promulgated by the FDA in accordance with the FDCA. Stated differently, the PMA conditions did not impose any <em>new </em>reporting requirements on Medtronic, but simply reiterated Medtronic\u2019s already-existing obligations under federal law. Hence, what Plaintiffs are really alleging is that Med-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>tronic violated the FDCA by failing to inform the FDA in a timely fashion of adverse lead events. Such a claim necessarily fails, because no private right of action exists under the FDCA. <em>See Gile v. Optical Radiation Corp., </em>22 F.3d 540, 544 (3rd Cir.1994) (\u201c[V]iolations of the FDCA do not create private rights of action.\u201d); <em>Parker, </em>584 F.Supp.2d at 1301-02; <em>Alexander v. Smith &amp; Nephew, P.L.C., </em>98 F.Supp.2d 1310, 1321 (N.D.Okla.2000). Plaintiffs cannot make an end run around this rule by recasting violations of the FDCA as violations of state common law. <em>See Parker, </em>584 F.Supp.2d at 1301-02; <em>Lake v. Kardjian, </em>No. 03-1267, \u2014 Misc.3d -, -, 874 N.Y.S.2d 751, 2008 WL 5244823, at *2 (N.Y.Sup.Ct. Dec. 17, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">It might seem inconsistent with <em>Riegel </em>to conclude that a claim alleging a medical-device manufacturer violated the FDCA is preempted. After all, <em>Riegel </em>expressly recognized that \u201cparallel\u201d claims\u2014 that is, claims \u201cpremised on a violation of FDA regulations\u201d \u2014 are not preempted. <em>Id. </em>at 1011. Plaintiffs noted this inconsistency at oral argument, asserting that if they cannot bring state-law claims for violations of the FDCA, then there exist no \u201cparallel\u201d claims that could possibly survive preemption \u2014 in essence, \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d in Section 360k(a) would be rendered meaningless. If Congress had intended that result, Plaintiffs argued, it could have easily said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">But what this argument overlooks is that claims alleging violations of the FDCA are not preempted because they run afoul of <em>Section 860k(a), </em>which is the type of preemption addressed in <em>Riegel. </em>Rather, such claims are <em>impliedly </em>preempted by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 337(a), which states that all proceedings for the enforcement or to restrain violations of the FDCA \u201cshall be by and in the name of the United States.\u201d Hence, \u201cthe FDCA leaves no doubt that it is the Federal Government rather than private litigants [which is] authorized to file suit for noncompliance with the medical device provisions\u201d in the FDCA. <em>Buckman, </em>531 U.S. at 349 n. 4, 121 S.Ct. 1012. As a result, when Sections 337(a) and 360k(a) \u2014 as construed in <em>Buck-man </em>and <em>Riegel, </em>respectively \u2014 are read together, nearly all types of claims concerning FDA-approved medical devices are preempted, including Plaintiffs\u2019 failure-to-warn claims here.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1201-10\">C. Design-defect claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 design-defect claims allege that (1) after the FDA approved the Sprint Fidelis leads\u2019 \u201cnew and improved\u201d design in July 2007, Medtronic should have stopped selling the original, \u201cdefective\u201d version, and (2) Medtronic should have used the \u201cnew and improved\u201d design prior to July 2007. <em>(See </em>Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 26-27.) The Court concludes that neither is a \u201cparallel\u201d claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">As an initial matter, Plaintiffs\u2019 design-defect claims would require a jury to find that the \u201colder\u201d design of the Sprint Fidel-is leads was unsafe. Clearly, such a finding would usurp the FDA\u2019s role in evaluat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>ing the safety and effectiveness of the leads and would interfere with the PMA process. <em>See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>No. 99-CV-649, 2002 WL 34234093, at *6 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2002) (\u201cA finding by a jury in this case that this design was defective would necessarily impose a standard on Defendant different from that imposed by the FDA.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>451 F.3d 104 (2d Cir.1996), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 999, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">But in any event, Plaintiffs have nowhere identified a federal requirement mandating a manufacturer to stop selling a device when an \u201cimproved\u201d version thereof is granted PMA. Plaintiffs have cited no federal regulation or other requirement suggesting that a previously issued PMA is withdrawn or somehow loses its vitality when a device improvement is granted PMA. Nor does such an assertion make intuitive sense. In many situations, devices may be improved not because they are unsafe, but simply because a newer version is better in some fashion \u2014 just as the Sprint Quattro leads purportedly were better than Medtronic\u2019s Transvene Leads. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">Plaintiffs have similarly failed to identify any federal requirement to support their assertion that \u201c[u]pon receiving notice of the defect, Medtronic had a duty to take reasonable steps to improve the safety of the Sprint Fidelis leads.\u201d (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 27.) They <em>do </em>cite in the Complaint a host of regulations concerning Medtronic\u2019s post-sale <em>reporting </em>requirements. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-90, 95-96.) But none of those regulations even remotely suggests an obligation on Medtronic\u2019s part to <em>improve </em>the Sprint Fidelis leads upon learning that patients were experiencing problems. Once again, the best Plaintiffs point to is their allegation that the leads were granted PMA subject to \u201ccertain express conditions.\u201d (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 27 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 23).) Yet, Plaintiffs have pointed to nothing in those conditions requiring Medtronic to improve the leads. Without any specific federal requirement that Medtronic take steps to improve the safety of the leads upon receiving adverse-event reports, Plaintiffs seek to impose conditions on Medtronic \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d those under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">Plaintiffs also argue that their design-defect claims are \u201cparallel\u201d because the leads were \u201cadulterated\u201d under federal law. (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 28.) Such an assertion, however, necessarily rests on Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the leads were negligently manufactured. <em>(See id. </em>(asserting that Medtronic \u201cfailed to meet FDA design control requirements\u201d).) Indeed, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 351(h) states, in pertinent part, that a Class III medical device is adulterated only if \u201cthe methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, its manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with\u201d the CGMPs/QSR. Because Plaintiffs\u2019 manufacturing-defect claims are preempted <em>(see supra </em>at 18-22), this derivative assertion is also preempted. <em>See Gile, </em>22 F.3d at 544 (\u201c[T]o the extent Gile\u2019s adulteration claim is derivative of her other claims for inadequate design, manufacture, and warnings, she cannot overcome a finding of preemption merely by claiming that the product was adulterated.\u201d); <em>Parker, </em>584 F.Supp.2d at 1301 (noting that plaintiffs claims were \u201cnot saved [from preemption] merely by being recast as violations of the federal adulteration and misbranding statutes\u201d).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>Simply put, Plaintiffs have not pointed to any federal requirements \u201cparallel\u201d to those they seek to foist onto Medtronic in their design-defect claims. The claims are preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">D. Negligence <em>per se </em>claims</p>\n<p id=\"A1qc\">Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence <em>per se </em>claims track their manufacturing-defect claims. Indeed, Plaintiffs admit that these claims \u201cincorporate[ ] the factual allegations of the ordinary negligence claims\u201d to allege that Medtronic violated \u201cthe CGMPs and QSRs,\u201d thereby resulting in \u201cdefects\u201d in the leads. (Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 29-30.) The claims, therefore, are preempted for the same reasons that the manufacturing-defect claims are preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">The negligence <em>per se </em>claims are also preempted for another reason. A claim of negligence <em>per se </em>simply adopts the standard of care imposed by a statute or regulation as the standard against which the defendant\u2019s conduct is evaluated. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 286 (1965). Stated differently, negligence is the breach of a legal duty, and under a negligence <em>per se </em>theory, the measure of that legal duty comes from a statute (rather than the common law). For example, assume that a state statute sets a speed limit of 40 miles per hour, and the defendant violates that speed limit and, as a result, crashes into the plaintiffs car. The plaintiff can press a claim for negligence <em>per se, </em>adopting the statutory standard of care (no driving in excess of 40 miles per hour) as the standard to be applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct. <em>See, e.g., Elder v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>341 F.Supp.2d 1095, 1099-1100 (D.Minn.2004) (Kyle, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-8\">With this understanding of the foundations for negligence <em>per se, </em>it becomes clear why it cannot apply here. \u201c[T]he negligence per se doctrine ... is not a magic transforming formula that automatically creates a private right of action for the civil enforcement, in tort law, of every statute.\u201d <em>Talley v. Danek Med., Inc., </em>179 F.3d 154, 158 (4th Cir.1999). In other words, the doctrine simply sets the standard of care \u201cwhere an underlying common law cause of action [already] exists.\u201d <em>Elder, </em>341 F.Supp.2d at 1100. Here, Plaintiffs seek to re-cast their negligence claims as claims for negligence <em>per se, </em>relying on the CGMPs/QSR to provide the requisite standard of care. <em>(See </em>Mem. in Opp\u2019n at 29-30.) But all of Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claims are preempted, as discussed above. Accordingly, the negligence <em>per se </em>claims cannot stand, because there exists no claim onto which the standard of care from the CGMPs/QSR can be grafted.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-9\">E. Breach of warranty</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">Plaintiffs allege that Medtronic breached implied warranties by selling the Sprint Fidelis leads in a defective condition. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 145-46.) They further allege that Medtronic expressly warranted that the leads were safe and effective and that Medtronic breached this express warranty because the leads were unsafe. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 149-52.) The Court concludes that these claims, too, are preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>As for the implied-warranty claims, Plaintiffs ignore that the <em>Riegel </em>plaintiffs alleged a claim for breach of implied warranty and the Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of that claim on preemption grounds. 128 S.Ct. at 1005-06. Such a claim would require a jury to determine that Medtronic impliedly warranted that the Sprint Fidelis leads were safe and effective and that Medtronic breached that implied <em>warranty </em>\u2014 i.e., a jury would have to find that the leads were unsafe in their design or manufacture. Such a determination clearly would interfere with the PMA process. <em>See Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>451 F.3d at 121 (\u201cWe ... conclude that the Riegels\u2019 claim[ ] for ... breach of implied warranty ... would, if successful, impose state requirements that differed from, or added to, the PMA-approved standards for the [device].\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 999, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008); <em>Richman v. W.L. Gore &amp; Assocs., Inc. </em>988 F.Supp. 758, 758 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (\u201c[T]he plaintiffs claim for breach of implied warranty [would] impose safety and effectiveness requirements that are different from, or in addition to, those established under FDA regulations.\u201d); <em>Talbott v. C.R. Bard, Inc., </em>865 F.Supp. 37, 51 (D.Mass.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>63 F.3d 25 (1st Cir.1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">Plaintiffs cite 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 808.1(d)(1) to argue that their implied-warranty claims are not preempted. That regulation states that requirements of \u201cgeneral applicability\u201d \u2014 such as \u201cgeneral electric codes, and the Uniform Commercial Code <em>(warranty of fitness)\u201d </em>\u2014 are not preempted under Section 360k(a). <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). But the <em>Riegel </em>plaintiffs made this same argument, and the Supreme Court rejected it, holding that the regulation \u201cfail[ed] to alter [the Court\u2019s] interpretation\u201d of Section 360k(a). This Court perceives no reason to deviate from that ruling here.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-9\">The Court also believes that the express-warranty claims are preempted for the same reason as the implied-warranty claims.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Such claims are based on an allegation that the leads were represented as safe \u2014 in both the product label and in \u201cpublications, ... the internet, and other communications intended for physicians, medical patients, and the general public\u201d\u2014 but were not. <em>(See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 149-50.) A jury finding in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor on such claims, therefore, would be required to conclude that the Sprint Fidelis leads were unsafe. As the safety and effectiveness of the leads are matters solely for the FDA, and because the FDA determined that the leads were safe and effective when granting PMA, these claims are preempted. <em>See, e.g. Gomez v. St. Jude Med. Daig Div. Inc., </em>442 F.3d 919, 932 (5th Cir.2006) (express-warranty claim preempted under FDCA); <em>Enlow v. St. Jude Med., Inc., </em>210 F.Supp.2d 853, 862 (W.D.Ky.2001) (same); <em>Lake, </em>\u2014 Misc.3d at ---, \u2014 N.Y.S.2d -, 2008 WL 5244823, at *1-2 (same). Simply put, claims such as these, which \u201crequire[ ] a manufacturer\u2019s [device] to be safer, but hence less effective, than the model the FDA has approved,\u201d necessarily \u201cdisrupt[] the federal scheme\u201d and must be preempted. <em>Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-13\">F. The remaining claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-14\">While the parties apparently agree that all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fall into the five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>categories discussed above, that is not entirely clear to the Court. Claims such as loss of consortium (Count 16) and unjust enrichment (Count 20) do not appear to fit neatly into any of the aforementioned categories. Nevertheless, the Court agrees with Medtronic that any claims in the Complaint not addressed above are derivative of Plaintiffs\u2019 other claims and hence cannot stand. <em>See, e.g., Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1006 (affirming dismissal of loss-of-consortium claim on preemption grounds because \u201cit was derivative of the pre-empted claims\u201d); <em>Talbott, </em>865 F.Supp. at 52 (claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress, violation of Massachusetts consumer-protection statute, and fraudulent misrepresentation preempted); <em>see also Pa. Employees Benefit Trust Fund v. Zeneca Inc., </em>499 F.3d 239, 251-52 &amp; n. 12 (3rd Cir.2007) (FDCA preempted derivative claims under state consumer-protection statute and for unjust enrichment predicated on allegedly misleading advertising of prescription drug).</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-4\">The analysis above also requires the dismissal of the claims in the Master Consolidated Complaint for Third-Party Payors. The claims in that Complaint parallel those in the Master Consolidated Complaint for Individuals and seek to recover sums paid by insurance companies (and others) on behalf of individuals who had Sprint Fidel-is leads implanted. In the absence of any viable claim by the individual Plaintiffs, these claims also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">G. The Court will dismiss the Complaints with prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">Having concluded that all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are preempted, the Court must next determine whether to dismiss those claims with or without prejudice. For several reasons, the Court concludes that dismissal with prejudice is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-7\">First, this is not Plaintiffs\u2019 only bite at the pleading apple. The Complaint is, in essence, an Amended Complaint filed in each and every one of the cases in this multidistrict litigation. <em>(See supra </em>at 1154-55.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-8\">Second, Plaintiffs nowhere requested leave to amend the Complaint in the event the Court were to determine that their claims are preempted. The Court need not grant leave to replead <em>sua sponte </em>when Plaintiffs never requested such relief, not even in the alternative. <em>See Confederate Mem\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Hines, </em>995 F.2d 295, 299 (D.C.Cir.1993); <em>Gunderson v. ADM Investor Servs., Inc., </em>Nos. C96-3148, C96-3151, 1997 WL 570453, at * 11 (N.D.Iowa Apr. 17, 1997) (rejecting \u201cthe notion that a party putting forward inadequate pleading must automatically be given leave to amend when the court finds that the opposing party\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion should be granted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-9\">Third, the Complaint was filed after extensive preparation by Plaintiffs\u2019 steering committee, which is made up of more than a dozen experienced products-liability lawyers well versed in <em>Riegel, Buckman, </em>and the nuances of federal preemption, and only <em>after </em>the preemption issue was raised by Medtronic and by the Court. <em>See In re Career Educ. Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 03 C 8884, 2007 WL 1029092, at *10, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23635, at *36 (N.D.Ill. Mar. 29, 2007) (dismissal with prejudice appropriate where there have been \u201cample opportunities to research and plead\u201d sufficient claims). Indeed, the Complaint is suffused with immense detail regarding the Sprint Fidelis leads and sprawls across 59 pages and 252 paragraphs. In the Court\u2019s estimation, if Plaintiffs were aware of sufficient facts in order to avoid preemption, they would have already pleaded them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>Fourth, and finally, the Court does not believe that repleading, even with leave to take limited discovery, would remedy the defects in the Complaint. The theory of Plaintiffs\u2019 case is that Medtronic did not adequately manufacture the Sprint Fidelis leads, not because it failed to comply with the specifications in the leads\u2019 PMA, but rather because the manufacturing methods Medtronic opted to used rendered all of the leads defective. In other words, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are predicated on a defect in the method of manufacture approved by the FDA when it granted the leads PMA. For the reasons set forth above, such claims are by their very nature preempted under Section 360k(a).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">As in <em>Pacelli </em>the Court recognizes that at least some Plaintiffs have suffered injuries from using Sprint Fidelis leads, and the Court is not unsympathetic to their plight. But Plaintiffs assert claims for which the Court simply cannot provide a remedy. Congress has decided to limit medical-device manufacturers\u2019 liability in order to spur innovation, even though individuals are sometimes injured when using medical devices. Plaintiffs\u2019 remedy, therefore, lies with Congress, and not with this Court (or any other court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS ORDERED that Medtronic\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Master Consolidated Complaint for Individuals (Doc. No. 151) and Medtronic\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the Master Consolidated Complaint for Third-Party Payors (Doc. No. 149) are GRANTED. The Master Consolidated Complaint for Individuals (Doc. No. 129) and the Master Consolidated Complaint for Third-Party Payors (Doc. No. 130) are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1189-10\">.

Justice Breyer authored an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. Because no single opinion received the approval of five Justices, the Court\u2019s holding is somewhat unclear. Justice Breyer\u2019s concurrence, however, is of the greatest importance. <em>See Marks v. United States, </em>430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (\u201cWhen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1192-11\">. The FDA, which appeared as <em>amicus curiae </em>in <em>Riegel, </em>agreed with the Supreme Court's decision. <em>See </em>128 S.Ct. at 1009; <em>see also Should FDA Drug &amp; Medical Device Regulation Bar State Liability Claims?: </em>Hearing Before H.

Reg. 52,602, 52,603 (Oct. 7, 1996) (same). Currently, the FDA takes the position that \"PMA approval by the FDA triggers preemption of a wide array of requirements imposed under state tort law.\u201d <em>Horn v.

A simple hypothetical also demonstrates why Plaintiffs\u2019 assumption is faulty. Imagine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1156\">*1156</page-number>that a medical device received PMA and the manufacturer began to market and distribute it. Two months later, the manufacturer discovered that an error occurred on the device's assembly line and all of the devices that had been manufactured and distributed were missing a critical component. A recall of the already manufactured devices would be appropriate, in order to \u201cremov[e][the] violative, distributed products\u201d from the marketplace. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.40(a). Yet, there would be no reason to invalidate the device's PMA \u2014 if the assembly error were corrected, then the device could (and would) be manufactured according to the FDA-approved PMA specifications. In other words, the company could \"take[] action to prevent the problem from happening again.\u201d http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ recalls/learn.html# 1 (last visited January 2, 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1196-11\">. There is no dispute that the PMA imposed federal requirements on the Sprint Fidelis leads. <em>See Riegel, </em>128 S.Ct. at 1007 (\"Pre-market approval ... imposes \u2018requirements' under the MDA as we interpreted it in <em>Lohr.\"). </em>The only issue, therefore, is whether Plaintiffs\u2019 claims would impose requirements on Medtronic that are \"different from, or in addition to\u201d those imposed by the PMA (or other federal law). <em>Id.; </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360k(a). If so, the claims are preempted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">.

Plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory allegation that Med-tronic \"failed to manufacture and inspect the Sprint Fidelis Leads in a manner consistent with, and as prescribed by the FDA-approved specifications for manufacture and inspection of the Sprint Fidelis Leads\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 103) similarly fails to pass muster.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1199-6\">. At oral argument, Plaintiffs asserted for the first time that they could not plead the specifications contained in the leads' PMA because they have not yet conducted discovery. But the Court anticipated this at the outset of the case, and Plaintiffs' counsel represented to the Court at that time that no discovery was necessaiy to resolve the preemption issue. Indeed, at the initial status conference held on May 28, 2008, the Court specifically asked Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel whether discovery was needed before addressing preemption. <em>(See </em>5/28/08 Tr. at 53-54.) Counsel made abundantly clear that \"for purposes of a [Rule] 12(b)(6) motion [on preemption], no discovery is necessary.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 54.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1199-7\">. Plaintiffs claim to have \"broadly allege[d] that Medtronic ... entirely failed to provide any warning\u201d concerning the Sprint Fidelis leads, including failing to provide any product label at all.

In support, they cite paragraph 121 of the Complaint, which alleges that Medtronic \"failed to provide <em>adequate </em>and <em>timely </em>warnings or instructions regarding the Sprint Fidelis Leads and the known defects.\u201d (emphases added). Even under a generous reading, this allegation in no way suggests that Medtronic failed to provide any warning <em>whatsoever. </em>If that is what Plaintiffs intended, they could have easily said so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1199-10\">.Two days before the hearing on Medtronic\u2019s Motion, the Supreme Court decided <em>Altria Group, Inc. v. </em>Good, - U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 538, - L.Ed.2d - (2008). The <em>Altria </em>Court held that claims under the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act were not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. At oral argument, Plaintiffs asserted that, after <em>Altria, </em>their statutory fraud claims are not subject to preemption. But <em>Altria </em>concerned a statute with a much narrower preemption clause than Section 360k(a), as Justice Stevens recognized. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number><em>id. </em>at 549 (distinguishing <em>Riegel </em>because Section 360k(a) is \"much broader than the operative language of the [Cigarette] Labeling Act\u201d). Accordingly, the Court concludes that <em>Altria </em>did little to alter its analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">. Naturally, this begs the question: what types of claims alleging defects in an FDA-approved medical device are <em>not </em>preempted? For one, an adequately pleaded claim that a specific device was not manufactured in accordance with its PMA specifications can survive preemption. <em>See Rollins, </em>583 F.Supp.2d at 799-801. Similarly, if a state were to pass a statute providing a remedy for a violation of the FDCA, a claim under such statute would not be preempted. <em>See Bausch, </em>2008 WL 5157940, at *4. Notably, there is no such statute at issue here \u2014 rather, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based only on \"generalized common law theories\u201d such as strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty.
