We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">1. Did the District Court err in instructing the jury that the internal USCF documents be considered only for the purpose of showing the knowledge of the USCF at the time of the incident?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">2. Did the District Court err in refusing to admit the \u201cGuidelines to Risk Management\u201d as an exhibit?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">3. Did the District Court err in giving a jury instruction which allowed the jury to consider the USCF\u2019s customary practices at other cycling events?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">4. Did the District Court err in refusing to give Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Jury Instruction Number 18?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">5. Did the District Court err in refusing to instruct the jury that Ganz was not negligent?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">6. Did the District Court err in refusing to grant Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">7. Did the cumulative effect of the District Court\u2019s errors deny Ganz a fair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-17\">8. Did the District Court err in giving the \u201cbut for\u201d causation instruction instead of the \u201csubstantial factor\u201d causation instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"b386-18\">On July 16,1988, Adam Ganz (Ganz) was injured during a \u201cwarmup lap\u201d at the Great Western Stage Race when he crashed while attempting to avoid an eleven-year-old child who had entered the race course. The Great Western Stage Race was a \u201ccriterium\u201d race, a circuit race held on a small track entirely closed to traffic. The race was held in Missoula, Montana and was sponsored by the Missoula Downtown Association (MDA) and sanctioned by the United States Cycling Federation (USCF). The MDA is made up of the business, professional, and service community in the downtown Missoula area. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>The USCF is the national organization that governs amateur bicycle racing in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">Pat Simmons, the executive director of the MDA, applied for and was granted a permit by the USCF for the Great Western Stage Race. The permit named Simmons as the individual promoter and MDA as the promoting organization. Simmons was not familiar with or personally involved in the safety precautions for the race. According to the permit, the promoter\u2019s responsibilities included conducting the competition with qualified officials and taking proper safety precautions to protect the personal welfare of both the athletes and the spectators.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">The MDA left the safety precautions to a race subcommittee that actually organized and conducted the race. The subcommittee arranged for a chief referee, arranged for marshals, and determined the site of the race. This subcommittee included Mary Cheryl (Hall) Larango, the bicycle coordinator for the City of Missoula, who was responsible for obtaining barricades, cones, and equipment from the City of Missoula. Mesh fencing was installed at the start/finish line, and barricades were placed at the street corners and alleys on the course. Larango testified that Michael Copeland, the chief referee, and Carl Ammons, the chief judge, were in charge of the setup and safety arrangements for the race. Larango was the supplies coordinator, while Ammons was in charge of the technical aspects of the race. Larango was also responsible for recruiting volunteers who served as marshals at the race.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Ammons testified that although he was the only USCF official who was involved in planning the race, he tried to \u201cstay out of being involved with the race as much as possible.\u201d Instead of riding in this particular race himself, Ammons agreed to be the chief judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">On the morning of the race, the marshals were instructed as to their duties by Copeland, and Larango reiterated these directions to the volunteers. The marshals were stationed throughout the course, and at intersections, to keep the course clear from pedestrians, dogs, and vehicles. Marshals Chris Buzan, Marie Ange Buzan, Trina Polzin and her son were stationed at the corner where the incident occurred. Chris Buzan testified that he thought Larango was in charge of the race and only remembers Larango giving instructions to the marshals. He testified that \u2018We had help with barricades and so on, but there were only so many of us and we did the best we could with what we had.\u201d Chris Buzan and Marie Ange Buzan testified that they never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>left their assigned corners during the event, but that they did not see the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">At trial, Ganz introduced a number of documents prepared by the USCF, or at the direction of the USCF, that set forth various safety guidelines and directions for conducting criterium bicycle races. The court instructed the jury that this evidence could only be considered for \u201cthe purpose of showing the knowledge available to USCF at the time of the incident in question.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The pre-trial order made it clear that the defendants did not allege contributory negligence. The court also ruled, prior to trial, that the theory of assumption of the risk could not be raised. At trial, as a stipulated compromise, the parties agreed that the verdict form would provide that Ganz must only show negligence on the part of any defendant or its representatives. Thus, the jury was only asked to determine whether the MDA, the USCF, or any representative of the MDA or the USCF including marshals, volunteers, or race officials were negligent. The jury returned a verdict that none of the defendants was negligent. Ganz appeals from this verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">1. Did the District Court err in instructing the jury that the internal USCF documents be considered only for the purpose of showing the knowledge of the USCF at the time of the incident?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">At trial, Ganz sought to introduce several internal USCF documents which discussed safety considerations associated with criterium bicycle races. The first document, Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exhibit Number 15, was captioned \u201cElements of a Safety Guideline\u201d and was prepared by a safety consulting firm. The second, Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exhibit Number 16, was titled \u201cUnited States Cycling Federation Cycling Event Standards &amp; Safety Manual\u201d and is similar to Exhibit Number 15. This document is on USCF letterhead and is dated March 31, 1986, and denominated as a draft outline. The final document,. Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exhibit Number 17, is a 138 page document titled \u201cUnited States Cycling Federation Cycling Safety Manual\u201d that was prepared in 1987 but was not adopted by the USCF. The jury was instructed that \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 15,16, and 17 are admitted solely for the purpose of showing the knowledge available to the USCF at the time of the incident in question.\u201d We determine that the jury should not have been limited to considering these exhibits solely for the purpose of showing the knowledge available to the USCF at the time of the incident and, therefore, hold the instruction was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">The exhibits should have been admitted without restriction to potentially contest the argument that safety precautions were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>feasible, and potentially as an admission that the safety precautions at the Missoula race were inadequate. Although these documents were in \u201cdraft\u201d form, they are tantamount to intracorporate communications or interdepartmental memoranda; that is, documents which were never intended for publication. <em>Haines Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Montana Power Co. </em>(1991), 251 Mont. 422, 427, 830 P.2d 1230, 1234 (holding that intracorporate communications concerning matters relevant to the issue should have been admitted as an admission); <em>Cech v. State </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 522, 531, 604 P.2d 97, 101-02 (holding that interdepartmental memorandum stating that the dangerous situation \u201ccould very easily be fixed\u201d was admissible to show the feasibility of installing a guardrail). Ganz argues that these documents should have also been admitted to determine the USCF\u2019s duty. We disagree. The existence of a duty is a legal question for the court, not the jury, to determine. <em>Roy v. Neibauer </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 224, 226, 623 P.2d 555, 556. Breach of that duty is a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">2. Did the District Court err in refusing to admit the \u201cGuidelines to Risk Management\u201d as an exhibit?</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Ganz attempted to offer Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exhibit Number 2, a USCF document titled \u201cUnited States Cycling Federation Guidelines to Risk Management,\u201d through the testimony of Andy Bohlmann. Bohlmann was the Director of Technical Services for the USCF from 1984 to 1990. The document appears to be the culmination of earlier drafts of the safety manual; virtually the same language was before the jury in the draft safety manual, Trial Exhibit Number 17. This document, Trial Exhibit Number 2, was distributed in 1989, a year after the incident in question, by the USCF to its district representatives. Soon after its distribution, the use of the manual was discontinued.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The transcript indicates that Ganz moved to admit the exhibit over the defendants\u2019 objection. The court questioned Ganz\u2019s counsel at length as to the possible theories of admissibility of the exhibit. The court concluded that foundation for the exhibit had not been laid and informed counsel that the right questions had not yet been asked. Ganz\u2019s counsel continued to question the witness and, through further questioning, elicited the substance of the exhibit. The witness testified that the manual was prepared, adopted, and distributed and that shortly thereafter its use was discontinued. After asking the additional questions which, along with Trial Exhibit Number 17, established that safety manuals had been prepared, and later abandoned, Ganz did not again move to admit Trial Exhibit Number 2. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Since the exhibit was not re-offered, the court did not make a final ruling as to its admissibility. Rather, immediately before final jury instructions were given, and just after a discussion was held off the record, the court stated that, \u201cfor record purposes,\u201d Trial Exhibit Number 2 was refused based on \u201cinsufficient foundation.\u201d This ruling was based on the initial offer of the exhibit. Although the substance of the exhibit was elicited through testimony, no subsequent offer of the exhibit was made by counsel. Thus, counsel\u2019s failure to re-offer the exhibit discharges us from further addressing this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">3. Did the District Court err in giving a jury instruction which allowed the jury to consider the USCF\u2019s customary practices at other cycling events?</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Ganz argues that the District Court erred in giving its Jury Instruction Number 3, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">Customary methods of conduct are not controlling on the question of negligence but are merely one of the factors to be considered in determining whether or not ordinary care has been exercised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The court adapted this instruction from the Defendants\u2019 Proposed Jury Instruction Number 10, which provided that \u201cCustomary acts and practices are one of the factors to be considered in determining whether reasonable care has been exercised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">The court refused to give defendants\u2019 instruction, instead, it looked to the source of the defendants\u2019 proposed instruction, <em>McCollum v. D &amp; M Lumber Co. </em>(1971), 156 Mont. 335, 479 P.2d 458, and instructed directly from the language <em>o\u00ed McCollum. </em>This instruction is inapplicable in this situation. Evidence of custom is admissible to show the customary practices of an industry, as a whole, not one particular member of that industry. Here, the only evidence of custom in directing amateur bicycle races is the USCF\u2019s own custom; there are no other non-party members of the same industry. Thus, the only \u201ccustomary\u201d practices that the jury could use to compare the defendants\u2019 conduct in the Missoula race would be with other conduct of the same defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">As the self-described national governing body for the sport of amateur bicycle racing, the USCF is the only entity that directs and controls the sport of amateur cycling in the United States. The USCF elects a board of directors, appoints committees, promulgates the \u201cRule Book,\u201d trains officials, and approves all permits for all sanctioned bicycle races. Evidence of the safety precautions usually undertaken by the USCF at small criterium bicycle races is entirely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>self-serving and is not admissible to show the industry custom \u2014 the USCF is the \u201cindustry.\u201d Thus, we hold that the District Court erred in giving its Jury Instruction Number 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">4. Did the District Court err in refusing to give Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Jury Instruction Number 18?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The evidence established that there was a non-party child who darted onto the race course. Anticipating that the defendants might attempt to blame another person, including the child who entered the race course, Ganz offered Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Jury Instruction Number 18, MPI 2.09, which provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">More than one person may be liable for causing an injury. A defendant may not avoid liability by claiming that some other person, whether or not named as a defendant in this action, helped cause the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Our standard of review for discretionary trial court rulings is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Barthule v. Karman </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 477, 487, 886 P.2d 971, 977. In <em>Barthule, </em>we held that it is not reversible error for a district court to refuse an offered instruction unless the refusal affects the substantial rights of the party who proposed the instruction. <em>Barthule, </em>886 P.2d at 977 (citing <em>Cottrell v. Burlington Northern R.R. Co. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 296, 306, 863 P.2d 381, 387). Here, however, we determine that the District Court\u2019s refusal to give the proposed instruction did affect Ganz\u2019s substantial rights. The jury knew that the child entered the race course. As a result, the jury was presented with the potential fault of a non-party and was not instructed that a defendant may not avoid liability by claiming that some other person helped cause the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Ganz\u2019s proposed instruction was an accurate statement of Montana law, and clearly was applicable in light of the undisputed evidence that the accident occurred when an unnamed child entered the race course. Ganz anticipated that defense counsel might point a finger at the child. In closing argument, that is precisely what occurred. Defense counsel stated \u201cIf, in your view somebody needs to be blamed, there\u2019s a youngster who darted out onto the raceway. We\u2019re not suggesting that, but if you\u2019re the type of person that needs to fix fault someplace, I would suggest that as a possibility.\u201d Had the offered instruction been given, the jury would have known that it was not to consider the negligence of a non-party. <em>Newville v. State, Dep\u2019t of Family Servs. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 237, 255-56, 883 P.2d 793, 804. We hold, therefore, that the District Court erred in failing to give Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Instruction Number 18. In failing to give the proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>instruction, the District Court virtually invited the improper statement made by defense counsel during the closing argument. The court\u2019s refusal to give Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Instruction Number 18, combined with the defense\u2019s closing argument allowed the jury to divert its attention from considering the conduct of the defendants, and invited the jury to entertain the idea that a non-party child may have been at fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">5. Did the District Court err in refusing to instruct the jury that Ganz was not negligent?</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The District Court refused to give Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Instruction Number 12, which, in part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">Adam Ganz was not negligent in the manner in which he was riding before the accident, in the action he took to avoid the spectator or pedestrian, or in any other action he took leading up to the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The pre-trial order made it clear that the defendants did not allege contributory negligence and, prior to trial, the court also ruled that the theory of assumption of the risk could not be raised. In the opening statement, the defendants stated \u201cWe will not present any evidence that Mr. Ganz did anything wrong.\u201d Further, during trial, the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">Before I recess you for the day, I wanted to read you a brief instruction that I just drafted. It relates to the witness that testified regarding reaction times. You are advised that the evidence from a witness that related to the scientific basis for a bike racer\u2019s reaction time is to be used only to weigh the testimony of other witnesses. This evidence is not to be used in any manner to determine if the Plaintiff, Adam Ganz, was negligent in any manner, because any possible negligence on the part of the Plaintiff is not an issue in this lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">The fact that the defendants did not place Ganz\u2019s negligence at issue, and that the court admonished the jury that biker\u2019s reaction times and Ganz\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d negligence were not issues, makes the court\u2019s refusal to give the proposed instruction puzzling. Despite the court\u2019s admonishment and the defendants\u2019 stipulation that Ganz\u2019s negligence was not an issue, the way that the evidence and the testimony unfolded throughout the trial, the issue of bike racer\u2019s (i.e. Ganz\u2019s) reaction times and the question of Ganz\u2019s \u201cpossible negligence\u201d may have been on the minds of the jurors. Although we do not hold the court\u2019s refusal of Plaintiff\u2019s Proposed Instruction Number 12 to be reversible error, the court, on retrial, should avoid the inconsis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>tencies created between the pretrial order (which does not allege any negligence by Ganz) and the court\u2019s admonition to the jury concerning Ganz\u2019s \u201cpossible negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\">Based on our resolution of issues one through five, it is unnecessary for us to address issues six through eight.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-5\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b393-6\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AMX\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on issues two, four and five, specially concur on issue three, and dissent on issue one.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">With regard to issue three, relating to the jury instruction on customary practices, I agree with the result the Court reaches but not with all that is said. First, it is important to note that Ganz made no objection to any of the evidence introduced on the customary practices of the USCF. Thus, that evidence was properly before the jury for its consideration. Under that circumstance, it ordinarily would be appropriate to instruct the jury on that theory of the defense, under our usual rules requiring jury instruction on theories of the case supported by the evidence. <em>See Buhr v. Flathead County </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 223, 235, 886 P.2d 381, 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">However, Ganz argues, the Court determines and I agree, that <em>McCollum, </em>is not authority for the customary practices instruction given here; that case involved the usual situation of industry-wide customary practices used as a factor in determining the negligence of the defendant, a member or constituent part of that industry. The USCF cites to no authority for the proposition that where, as here, the defendant essentially is \u201cthe industry\u2019 at issue, it remains appropriate to instruct on that defendant\u2019s customary practices as the relevant industry practices. This is the basis on which I would reverse the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">I dissent from the Court\u2019s discussion and resolution in issue one that the District Court improperly limited the jurys consideration of \u201cinternal USCF documents.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exhibit No. 15, the \u201cElements of a Safety Guideline,\u201d is \u2014 as its very name reflects \u2014 an outline for a safety guideline; it is not a substantive guideline. Moreover, the exhibit was neither prepared, nor adopted, by the USCF. Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exhibit 16, the so-called manual, is denominated as a draft outline. It is neither a final, nor an adopted, outline. Plaintiff\u2019s Trial Exhibit 17 is another draft manual \u2014 prepared in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>sections by different people and never adopted by USCF. I cannot understand how these latter unadopted draft documents can be relevant \u2014 as the Court states it \u2014 \u201cpotentially as an admission that the safety precautions at the Missoula race were inadequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Nor do the cases cited by the Court support its reversal of the District Court\u2019s limiting instruction relating to these exhibits. The issue in both <em>Haines </em>and <em>Cech </em>related to the admissibility of evidence under the Montana Rules of Evidence rather than whether a court abused its discretion by limiting the purposes for which the jury could consider evidence already admitted. In neither case was the document or material at issue in draft or \u201cnonadopted\u201d form. Finally, we determined that the document in <em>Haines </em>was admissible specifically because it was relevant to MPC\u2019s knowledge about the course of action it chose to follow. Here, the \u201cknowledge\u201d aspect of our conclusion in <em>Haines </em>clearly, and properly, was covered by the District Court\u2019s instruction that the exhibits could be considered for the purpose of showing the USCF\u2019s knowledge at the time of the incident at issue.</p>\n<judges id=\"b394-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in the foregoing.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
