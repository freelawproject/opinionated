We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\">1. Did the District Court err in rejecting the Board\u2019s finding that Shodair had met the Medicaid Inpatient Psychiatric Services manual criteria?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">2. Does substantial evidence support the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that Shodair failed to meet the MIPS manual criteria?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">3. Does compliance with the MIPS manual criteria equate to a \u201csignificant danger\u201d to the patient or others determination under \u00a7 46.12.590(2)(k), ARM (1991), thereby entitling a treatment provider to medicaid reimbursement for a patient\u2019s treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-14\">4. Does substantial evidence support the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that Shodair was not entitled to medicaid reimbursement for D.B.B.\u2019s inpatient psychiatric care because it failed to demonstrate that D.B.B. posed a significant danger to herself, others, or the public safety as required by \u00a7 46.12.590(2)(k), ARM (1991)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\">5. Was D.B.B.\u2019s treatment at Shodair \u201cmedically necessary\u201d under \u00a7 46.12.102(2), ARM (1991)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">Issues three through five are dependent on a determination of error on issue two. Thus, our holding below that substantial evidence supports the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that Shodair failed to meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the MIPS manual criteria is dispositive and we need not address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\n<em>Factual and Procedural Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">D.B.B., a sexually, physically, and emotionally abused eight-year-old girl, was admitted to Shodair on August 8, 1991, for inpatient psychiatric treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. D.B.B. was discharged from Shodair to a foster home on September 19, 1991. Shodair applied to the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services Medicaid Services Division (SRS) seeking medicaid reimbursement for D.B.B.\u2019s treatment. SRS reimbursed Shodair for inpatient treatment provided to D.B.B. from August 8, 1991, through August 23, 1991. It denied reimbursement for the later portion of D.B.B.\u2019s treatment, based on its determination that inpatient services were not medically necessary during that time. This case involves Shodair\u2019s effort to obtain reimbursement from SRS under the state medicaid inpatient psychiatric services program for the later portion of D.B.B.\u2019s inpatient treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(30)(A) (West Supp. 1995), states are required to implement procedures regarding the utilization of, and reimbursement for, services rendered under a state medical assistance plan; the purpose of the procedures is to protect against unnecessary use of services and \u201cassure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care.\u201d One aspect of such a state plan is the creation of \u201ca statewide surveillance and utilization control program\u201d that, among other things, must safeguard against excess medicaid payments. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.3(a) (1994). SRS is the state agency responsible for creating and managing the utilization program to \u201censur[e] that services provided through the medicaid program are ... consistent with both state and federal laws, rules, and regulations establishing the conditions of reimbursement.\u201d Section 46.1.101(2)(c)(iii), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Section 46.12.590(3), ARM (1991), authorizes medicaid reimbursement for hospital inpatient psychiatric care if a person\u2019s psychiatric condition \u201cpose[s] a significant danger to self, others, or the public safety.\u201d Section 46.12.590(2)(k), ARM (1991). The treatment must be provided under the direction of a physician and must be designed to discharge the patient to a less restrictive setting as soon as possible. Section 46.12.590(2)(k), ARM (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">SRS contracted with Mental Health Management of America (MHMA) to develop and implement a utilization management pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>gram to review inpatient psychiatric treatment services provided to medicaid recipients under the age of 21 pursuant to the Montana Medicaid Inpatient Psychiatric Services Under 21 program (MIPS). Pursuant to the contract, MHMA developed a MIPS manual for use by reviewers of medicaid reimbursement claims under the program. The manual, which was distributed to inpatient psychiatric treatment providers, including Shodair, contained criteria relating to reimbursement for hospital inpatient psychiatric treatment. The listed criteria require treatment providers to demonstrate, with regard to a patient\u2019s inpatient psychiatric treatment, that they have: (1) diagnosed the patient as having an Axis I mental disorder delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Third Edition-Revised (DSM-III-R); (2) obtained a DSM-III-R Axis V rating of 50 or less regarding the patient\u2019s functional level; (3) developed a description of the treatment and discharge plan; and (4) identified and documented one of four specific problem areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">In this case, SRS initially denied reimbursement for the later portion of D.B.B.\u2019s inpatient treatment at Shodair. Shodair requested, and received, a \u201cfair hearing\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 46.12.1210(2), ARM (1991), after which the hearing examiner issued extensive findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order denying reimbursement. The hearing examiner determined that Shodair did not meet the MIPS manual criteria relating to reimbursement for hospital inpatient psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Shodair appealed to the Board, which summarily reversed the hearing examiner\u2019s decision. The Board found that, based on the \u201cundisputed facts\u201d of record, Shodair had met the MIPS manual criteria as a matter of law and that satisfying those criteria also satisfied the \u201csignificant danger\u201d requirement contained in \u00a7 46.12.590(2)(k), ARM (1991). As a result, the Board determined that Shodair was entitled to medicaid reimbursement for the later portion of D.B.B.\u2019s inpatient psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">SRS petitioned for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. The District Court concluded that the hearing examiner had impliedly, and correctly, determined that Shodair failed to satisfy one of the MIPS manual criteria relating to reimbursement for hospital inpatient psychiatric treatment. The court also concluded that the Board erred in summarily rejecting the hearing examiner\u2019s findings and in determining that meeting the MIPS criteria was sufficient to establish that a patient poses a \u201csignificant danger\u201d under \u00a7 46.12.590(2)(k), ARM (1991). The District Court reinstated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>hearing examiner\u2019s decision denying medicaid reimbursement for D.B.B.\u2019s treatment at Shodair from August 23 to September 19,1991. Shodair appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">1. Did the District Court err in rejecting the Board\u2019s finding that Shodair had met the Medicaid Inpatient Psychiatric Services manual criteria?</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Shodair contends that the District Court erred in reinstating the hearing examiner\u2019s decision denying Shodair medicaid reimbursement. It argues that the Board correctly rejected the hearing examiner\u2019s findings and conclusions and awarded Shodair reimbursement for D.B.B.\u2019s stay. SRS argues that the Board did not comply with \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA. The District Court determined that the Board violated \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Section 2-4-621(3), MCA, prohibits the Board from rejecting or modifying the hearing examiner\u2019s findings of fact unless it states with particularity that the findings were not based on competent substantial evidence. Nowhere in the Board\u2019s brief order does it reject or modify any of the hearing examiner\u2019s extensive findings, much less state with particularity that the finding or findings were not based on competent substantial evidence. Instead, the Board summarily reversed the hearing examiner\u2019s decision, stating that it \u201cfinds that based on undisputed facts in the record,\u201d Shodair met the MIPS manual criteria as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The purpose of \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, as is the case with many of this Court\u2019s standards of review, is to prevent a reviewing body from substituting its judgment for that of the factfinder. Here, the Board\u2019s order merely substitutes its judgment for that of the hearing examiner with regard to findings of fact; in doing so, the Board violated \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(vi), MCA, authorizes a reviewing court to reverse the Board\u2019s decision if it was \u201carbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion[.]\u201d A rejection of a hearing examiner\u2019s findings in violation of \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, constitutes an abuse of discretion under \u00a7 2-4-704(2)(a)(vi), MCA. <em>Brander v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of Institutions </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 302, 308, 806 P.2d 530, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Thus, we conclude that, in violating \u00a7 2-4-621(3), MCA, the Board abused its discretion. We further conclude, on that basis, that the District Court did not err in reinstating the hearing examiner\u2019s extensive finding of fact for purposes of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>2. Does substantial evidence support the hearing examiner\u2019s finding that Shodair failed to meet the MIPS manual criteria for hospital inpatient psychiatric treatment?</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Shodair and SRS disagree regarding whether satisfying the MIPS manual criteria also suffices to meet the \u201csignificant danger\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46.12.590(2)(k), ARM (1991), and the \u201cmedical necessity\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46.12.102(2), ARM (1991), for medicaid reimbursement as a matter of law. It is undisputed, however, that a provider of inpatient psychiatric services must satisfy the four criteria contained in the MIPS manual to establish entitlement to medicaid reimbursement for an individual\u2019s inpatient psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The parties do not dispute that Shodair established, and the hearing examiner correctly found, that D.B.B.\u2019s condition met three of the four MIPS manual criteria. They disagree on whether Shodair met the fourth criterion of identifying and documenting a listed problem area; specifically, whether Shodair established the problem area entitled \u201cImpaired Safety: Threat to Self or Others.\u201d Under the MIPS manual, the Impaired Safety problem area consists of three components: (1) verbalization or gestures of intent to harm self or others, caused by a mental disorder; (2) threats accompanied by depressed mood, recent loss, recent suicide attempt or gesture, or concomitant substance abuse; and (3) verbalization escalating in intensity, or verbalization of intent accompanied by gesture or plan. Each of the components must be established in order to satisfy the fourth MIPS manual criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">A. Implied Finding</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">This Court has adopted the doctrine of implied findings for purposes of reviewing findings of fact. <em>Interstate Brands Corp. v. Cannon </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 380, 384, 708 P.2d 573, 576. That doctrine provides that where the \u201cfindings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the [determination], are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Interstate </em>Brands, 708 P.2d at 576 (citations omitted). We apply the doctrine only if the implied findings are consistent with express findings. <em>Interstate Brands, </em>708 P.2d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">For the most part, the hearing examiner addressed the components of the Impaired Safety problem area in a systematic manner. With regard to the first component, the hearing examiner expressly found that D.B.B. had verbalized an intent to harm both others and herself and that these threats were probably caused by her mental disorder. Under the second component, relating to the patient\u2019s recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>loss, the hearing examiner found that D.B.B.\u2019s threats were accompanied by \u201cthe recent loss of her family ... loss of self and loss of self-esteem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">The third component is comprised of two alternatives: the patient\u2019s verbalization of intent to harm self or others must be accompanied by gestures or plans <em>or </em>escalating in intensity. The hearing examiner expressly found that the record did not support a finding that D.B.B.\u2019s verbalizations of intent to harm herself or others were accompanied by gestures or plans or a finding that verbalizations of intent to harm herself escalated in intensity. Shodair does not dispute the finding related to verbalizations accompanied by gesture or plan and, for purposes of appeal, has conceded that the record does not support a finding that D.B.B.\u2019s verbalizations of intent to harm herself had escalated in intensity. Thus, the only portion of the third component of the Impaired Safety problem area at issue is whether D.B.B.\u2019s verbalizations of intent to harm others escalated in intensity.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The hearing examiner did not make an express finding regarding the \u201cescalating in intensity\u201d factor. She continued her discussion regarding the third component by finding that D.B.B. had harmed peers, including one incident which could have posed a danger, but that Shodair\u2019s treatment after the incident rendered the event insignificant. She also found that D.B.B. did not have a serious intent to harm and that she was not frequently violent. Shodair does not challenge these express findings. The hearing examiner concluded by finding that \u201c[criterion] (4) of the Department\u2019s criteria for hospital inpatient psychiatric treatment has not been met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The hearing examiner made systematic, express, and undisputed findings that the first two Impaired Safety problem area components had been established and that portions of the third component had not been established. Those express findings, together with her finding that Shodair failed to establish the fourth MIPS manual criterion, permitted the District Court to determine that the hearing examiner had necessarily found that the escalating in intensity portion of the third component had not been established, if such a finding is supported by the evidence. <em>See Interstate Brands, </em>708 P.2d at 576. This is so because the finding that D.B.B.\u2019s verbalizations were not escalating in intensity was necessary for the examiner\u2019s ultimate finding that the MIPS manual criteria were not met. Moreover, the implied finding is entirely consistent with the express findings made by the hearing examiner and with the general finding that Shodair failed to meet the fourth MIPS manual criterion. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>Interstate Brands, </em>708 P.2d at 576. Thus, all that remains is to determine whether the implied finding is supported by substantial credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">B. Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">An implied finding must be not only necessary to the judgment, but also supported by the evidence. <em>Interstate Brands, </em>708 P.2d at 576. When reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact, courts defer to the agency\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(v), MCA; <em>Westmoreland Resources v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 303, 310, 868 P.2d 592, 596. Generally, findings of fact are not clearly erroneous if they are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Westmoreland Resources, </em>868 P.2d at 596. Substantial evidence must be more than a scintilla, but may be less than a preponderance, of evidence. <em>Miller v. Frasure </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 132, 137, 809 P.2d 1257, 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Both Shodair\u2019s records of D.B.B.\u2019s hospitalization and expert testimony at the hearing provide substantial evidence supporting the implied finding that D .B .B ,\u2019s intent to harm others was not escalating in intensity. D.B.B.\u2019s hospitalization records documented that in forty-three days of hospitalization, she was involved in five or six disputes with staff members or peers. These incidents involved yelling obscenities at a staff member, \u201cinvading another peer\u2019s space,\u201d discussion of how she feared she would kill someone if she returned home, and shoving a peer during an activity. The medical records establish that D.B.B.\u2019s physical conflicts were infrequent and that she had not seriously injured an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In addition, Dr. Larry Osborn (Osborn) testified that, based on his review of the medical records, Shodair failed to document that D.B.B. had verbally threatened or promised to hurt someone and did not demonstrate how any of D.B.B.\u2019s verbalizations escalated in intensity. He opined that, although D.B.B.\u2019s recreation often contained some violent aspect, nothing in the record confirmed that she took the initiative or had the means to hurt her peers. He also suggested that the record supported a conclusion that D.B.B. learned not to express her anger in an inappropriate manner, such as hitting an individual, but to redirect her anger in a positive manner by punching pillows or taking \u201ctime out.\u201d In Osborn\u2019s opinion, nothing in D.B.B.\u2019s medical record established that D.B.B. was impulsive, violent, or dangerous to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The record contains substantial credible evidence supporting a finding that Shodair failed to establish that D.B.B.\u2019s verbalizations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of intent to harm others escalated in intensity and, therefore, failed to establish the third Impaired Safety component. Such a finding is consistent with the hearing examiner\u2019s findings \u2014 not disputed here \u2014 that D.B.B. lacked serious intent to harm and was not frequently violent and with her general express finding that Shodair failed to meet the fourth MIPS manual criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Shodair relies on other evidence of record to support its position that D.B.B.\u2019s verbalization of intent to harm others increased in intensity. \u201cWe will not substitute our judgment for that of the [fact finder] even where there is evidence in the record to support contrary findings.\u201d <em>Estate of Alcorn </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 353, 360, 868 P.2d 629, 633. Thus, we decline to review Shodair\u2019s citations to the record and to determine whether that evidence supports the finding Shodair advocates.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We conclude that the District Court did not err in determining that the hearing examiner had impliedly found that Shodair did not establish the \u201cescalating in intensity\u201d component and that the implied finding was supported by substantial credible evidence and was not clearly erroneous. We further conclude that the hearing examiner did not err in determining, on that basis, that Shodair failed to meet the MIPS manual criteria. We hold, therefore, that the District Court did not err in reinstating the hearing examiner\u2019s decision which denied Shodair medicaid reimbursement for the later portion of D.B.B.\u2019s inpatient psychiatric treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b188-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, WEBER and District Judge MIZNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b188-8\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AHl\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">I dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">What is notably absent from the hearing examiner\u2019s decision, the District Court\u2019s decision, or the majority opinion, is any mention of the enabling statute pursuant to which medical services are reimbursed by the Medicaid program. While I do not disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the evidence in this case as applied to the nearly indecipherable MIPS criteria, I do conclude that the Administrative Rule pursuant to which those criteria were developed was neither consistent with nor reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of its enabling statute, and therefore, was ineffective. For these reasons, I would reverse the decision of the District Court and remand to the hearing examiner for consideration of the evidence as applied to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>only true requirement for Medicaid reimbursement which is established by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The enabling statute for the Administrative Rules relied on by the department, the hearing examiner, the District Court and the majority is set forth at \u00a7 53-6-101, MCA, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">(1) There is a Montana medicaid program established for the purpose of providing necessary medical services to eligible persons who have need for medical assistance. The Montana medicaid program is a joint federal-state program administered under this chapter and in accordance with Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396, et seq.), as may be amended. The department of social and rehabilitation services shall administer the Montana medicaid program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">(2) Medical assistance provided by the Montana medicaid program includes the following services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">(\u0430) inpatient hospital services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYD\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">(3) Medical assistance provided by the Montana medicaid program may, as provided by department rule, also include the following services:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfW\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">(k) inpatient psychiatric hospital services for persons under 21 years of age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A51\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-10\">(\u0431) <em>The services provided under this part may be only those that are medically necessary and that are the most efficient and cost-effective.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">In other words, the Department may, by departmental rule, decide whether or not services for inpatient psychiatric care are reimbursed. However, the criteria for reimbursement are established by subparagraph (6) and provide only two requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-13\">(1) that the services be medically necessary, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-14\">(2) that they be the most efficient and cost-effective means of treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">Rule 46.12.590, ARM (1990), upon which the hearing examiner\u2019s decision is based and pursuant to which that decision was affirmed by this Court was enacted pursuant to \u00a7 53-6-101(3)(k), MCA. However, it adds to the statutory criteria an additional requirement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>reimbursement of inpatient psychiatric services. It provides in sub-paragraph (k):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">\u201cHospital inpatient psychiatric care\u201d means hospital based active psychiatric treatment provided under the direction of a physician. <em>The individual\u2019s psychiatric condition must be of such a nature as to pose a significant danger to self, others, or the public safety, or one which has resulted in marked psychosocial dysfunction or grave disability of the individual. </em>The therapeutic intervention or evaluation must be designed to achieve the patient\u2019s discharge from inpatient hospital status to a less restrictive environment at the earliest possible time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The underlined portion of subparagraph (k) adds an additional requirement to the statutory requirements for reimbursement of in-patient psychiatric care. It is, therefore, inconsistent with its enabling statute and is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In <em>Michels v. Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services </em>(1980), 187 Mont. 173, 177-78, 609 P.2d 271, 273, we stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"At8\">Whatever force and effect the regulation has must derive from the statute under which it is enacted, and a regulation in conflict with that statute is without effect. See, 2 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 289, and <em>Bell v. Department of Licensing </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 21, 594 P.2d 331, 36 St. Rep. 880. \u201cIt is axiomatic that a statute cannot be changed by administrative regulation.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Swart v. Casne </em>(1977) 172 Mont. 302, 308, 564 P.2d 983, 986.</p>\n<p id=\"AUq\">Likewise, in <em>Bick v. State, Department of Justice </em>(1986) 224 Mont. 455, 458-59, 730 P.2d 418, 421, we held that:</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">A valid rule must meet both prongs of a two-prong test to determine whether or not it harmonizes with its enabling legislation. It must not engraft additional and contradictory requirements on the statute, and it must not engraft additional non-contradictory requirements on the statute which were not contemplated by the legislature. <em>Bell v. Department of Licensing, </em>supra, 182 Mont. at 23, 594 P.2d at 333. The rule also must be reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute. <em>Board of Barbers of the Department of Professional and Occupational Licensing v. Big Sky College </em>(Mont. 1981), 626 P.2d 1269, 1270, 38 St. Rep. 621, 623.</p>\n<p id=\"AK6\">The requirement by Administrative Rule that an individual\u2019s psychiatric condition pose a significant danger to herself or others before she is entitled to reimbursement for inpatient psychiatric care en-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>grafts an additional requirement on its enabling statute. That additional requirement is, therefore, without effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">There is considerable cause for concern that had the hearing examiner, the District Court, and the majority of this Court not focused completely on the administrative requirement of \u201csignificant danger,\u201d and instead, focused simply on the statutory requirement that hospitalization be \u201cmedically necessary,\u201d the outcome in this case may have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">I note, for example, that the hearing examiner found that, prior to her hospitalization, D.B.B. had digressed into fantasy and was having nightmares; sexually acted out at school' with her friends; was observed on the playground trying to call up the devil; and had been followed in out-patient therapy for the previous two years. As a result of sexual abuse by her uncle and emotional abuse by her father, she was diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Three mental health professionals recommended that she be placed in inpatient treatment. At the time that SRS concluded that hospitalization was no longer medically necessary, D.B.B. was being treated for anger, depression, and oppositional behavior. She had frequent mood swings, decreased self-esteem, felt overwhelmed by her environment, and she felt worthless, helpless, and hopeless. She suffered from flashbacks and disruptive recollections of past events of sexual abuse, she experienced dissociative episodes, outbursts of anger and aggression, marked difficulty concentrating, play themes consisting of violence, avoided dealing with feelings, was unable to express feelings openly, and she was overly anxious.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Those health care providers from Shodair who treated D.B.B. testified, according to the hearings examiner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">[H]ow critical it was that [D.B.B.] have a continuity of care with time for relationships of trust and confidence to develop. Shodair provides it would have been counterproductive to have allowed [D.B.B.] to stay at Shodair only two weeks and then transfer her to a residential treatment facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The hearing examiner also agreed with Shodair that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">[U]nlike MHMA reviewers or Dr. Osborne, the Shodair staff dealt directly with [D.B.B.] and, therefore, knows a good deal more about the child than the MHMA reviewers. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">Finally, the following entries from D.B.B.\u2019s medical records made during the period in question suggest that, at a minimum, continued inpatient treatment was \u201cmedically necessary\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>08/29 During play therapy DBB played with puppets and a baby doll. The puppets tucked the baby in bed, but one puppet made too much noise and woke the baby. The puppet then had to be killed and was buried in the sand and left there. Shodair Exhibit I, entry for 8/29. Cheryl Ronish, DBB\u2019s primary therapist and a master\u2019s degree social worker, testified that: \u201c[A] violent theme ran through all of [DBB\u2019s] play. Often she would be the victim and then she would switch to be the victimizer, people were hurt, usually the puppets or her. ...\u201d Hearing Transcript, p. 309.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">08/31 During activities therapy, DBB continued to exhibit swings in mood. She was having difficulty with her feelings, but was unable to put words to those feelings. DBB needed redirection in all areas and discontinued activities after participating for only a few minutes. Shodair Exhibit J, entry for 8/31. On the same day DBB expressed anger and used foul language with the nursing staff. DBB stated she did not want to go home and stated that she feared she would kill someone if she returned home. DBB told the nursing staff, \u201cI\u2019ve killed people, the police and everyone know what I\u2019ve done.\u201d DBB was given a pillow and allowed to use the quiet room to discharge her anger. She hit the pillow against the wall and was observed kicking the wall and head butting the wall. Dr. Larson, DBB\u2019s child psychiatrist, testified at the hearing that Shodair considered this to be \u201cvery dangerous behavior.\u201d Hearing Transcript, p. 203. DBB was then taken to the punching bag where she \u201cwailed on it.\u201d The child care worker noted that DBB had homicidal fears and appeared to have delusional thinking. Shodair Exhibit G, entry for 8/31.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">09/03 During the evening of 9/3 DBB said she was on suicide precautions for biting herself. She hit a peer, then started talking about \u201cwanting to kill somebody, anybody. I\u2019ve done it and will do it again, my dad even knows.\u201d Shodair Exhibit G, entry for 9/3. 09/06 The weekly treatment plan review for 9/6, which is a part of Shodair Exhibit J, states that DBB was \u201cstill unable to express anger appropriately and has a potential to hurt others.\u201d It also noted that DBB talked \u201ca lot about violence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">09/07 DBB stated that she wanted to be placed on suicide precautions, and would do it by biting and hitting herself. She was talking with her peers about how the Indians had killed the white man in her town. Shodair Exhibit G, entry for 9/7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>09/14 During activities therapy DBB continued to have great variations in mood, and her moods could change within a single activity. There appeared to be no way of predicting when this was going to happen. DBB continued to close herself down when overwhelmed by her feelings, and refused to speak to staff at such times. DBB had particular difficulty while playing miniature golf. She appeared to be very preoccupied and needed constant redirection from staff, which she did not easily accept. At times staff had to physically intervene in order to get DBB back on task, and when DBB was touched she would become very hostile. Shodair Exhibit K, entry for 9/14. [The activities therapist] testified as follows about this incident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">... we were playing miniature golf at Mr. T\u2019s and DBB was having a very difficult time attending to the activity. There was one instance where when I tried to call her back to that activity there was absolutely no response from her, she had her back to me and it was as if she didn\u2019t hear anything I was saying. I called her name four times, she still didn\u2019t respond, I finally had to touch her and then she was very hostile toward me at that point. A lot of just this verbal barrage came at me and this extremely fearful reaction in her entire body posturing that looked as if she could strike out at any minute. She did not reveal anything at that point in time and did not seem able to talk right then but it was on that same day that she spoke about the dad possibly beating the shit out of her if she indeed talked about things that had happened to her. So it looked like this was a time when she is reflecting on a lot of what\u2019s happened to her. Possibly having flashbacks and fortunately is able to begin disclosing some of what\u2019s happening to her. Hearing Transcript, pp. 355-56.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The problem with the result in this case is that none of these facts have been analyzed in terms of whether they made continuing hospitalization \u201cmedically necessary\u201d without the additional requirement of proving medical necessity by establishing significant danger according to the department\u2019s policy guidelines which were at best indecipherable and at worst a classic example of a bureaucratic mind run amok.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Lost in the shuffle of bureaucratic rules and guidelines was the only real consideration which was relevant in this case. That was whether D.B.B.\u2019s continued hospitalization was medically necessary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Her treating physicians said, \u201cYes.\u201d Her records would indicate that it was. Yet that question was never answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">For these reasons, I would reverse and vacate the decision of the hearing examiner based on an incorrect application of the law to the facts in this case and remand for further consideration based on the correct criteria for medicaid reimbursement which is set forth at \u00a7 53-6-101(6), MCA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-5\">JUSTICE HUNT joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b194-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AJRg\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">I have signed the opinion in this case because our analysis and decision is correct <em>on the issues as raised </em>in the administrative proceedings, as reviewed by the District Court and as presented and argued to this Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">That is not to say, however, that I disagree with the substance of Justice Trieweiler\u2019s dissent or with his analysis of ARM 46.12.590 (1990), vis-a-vis \u00a7 53-6-101, MCA, at issue here. Rather, my decision in the instant case is dictated by the oft-repeated principle that we will not address or determine arguments, issues or theories unless first presented in the appropriate lower tribunals and then preserved for decision by this Court on appeal. <em>Farley v.
