We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The following issue is raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Did the District Court err in granting Mid-Century\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The material facts of the case are undisputed. On January 5,1992, Chilberg was a passenger in a car driven by Derek Whittenberg, which was struck by a car driven by defendant Valerie Wynn Rose. Chilberg was injured in the collision. Chilberg alleges that Rose failed to stop at a red light before running into the vehicle Whittenberg was driving. Rose was an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Whittenberg is the stepson of Jay Dean, the insured owner of the car involved in the accident. Dean purchased an auto insurance policy from Mid-Century covering the car in which Chilberg was riding. The policy provided coverage for medical expenses and for bodily injury caused by uninsured motorists. At the time of the accident, Dean had three cars insured through Mid-Century. Each car was covered under a separate policy and each policy provided identical coverages and policy limits. Each of the three policies had limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per incident for uninsured motorist, and $5,000 per person for medical coverage. Dean paid separate premiums for each of the coverages provided in the three policies. Mid-Century paid Chilberg a total of $30,000 under the uninsured motorist and medical coverages provided in the policy insuring the car in which Chilberg was riding.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">On January 31, 1994, Chilberg filed suit against Rose and Mid-Century. Chilberg was unable to serve Rose. In his complaint, Chilberg alleged that while Mid-Century paid him for uninsured motorist and medical coverage available under the policy issued on Dean\u2019s car involved in the accident, it refused to pay him uninsured motorist and medical coverage available under the policies issued on Dean\u2019s other two cars. In its answer, Mid-Century alleged that Chilberg was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the terms of Dean\u2019s other two policies. On May 20,1994, Mid-Century moved for summary judgment. On August 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>1994, the District Court granted Mid-Century\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Chilberg appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Our standard in reviewing a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment is the same as that utilized by the district court; we are guided by Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Minnie v. City of Roundup </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 429, 431, 849 P.2d 212, 214. Thus, we determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Minnie, </em>849 P.2d at 214. In this case, there is no genuine issue of material fact, therefore we need only consider whether the District Court was correct in concluding that Mid-Century was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">For some time, this Court has approved the practice of \u201cstacking\u201d uninsured motorist coverages when the insured has paid separate premiums for the separate uninsured motorist coverages. <em>See Kemp v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(1979), 183 Mont. 526, 601 P.2d 20. In <em>Kemp, </em>we allowed stacking of uninsured motorist coverages under two separate policies. One policy was issued in Vermont and covered two cars, one of which was the car in which plaintiff\u2019s decedent was an \u201coccupant.\u201d The second policy was a New York policy issued to decedent\u2019s parents that covered three cars. There was no question in <em>Kemp </em>as to whether decedent was an \u201cinsured.\u201d Under the Vermont policy, decedent was an \u201cinsured\u201d by virtue of \u201coccupying a motor vehicle owned by the named insured.\u201d And, according to the New York policy, decedent was an \u201cinsured\u201d because decedent was a \u201crelative\u201d of the named insured. As an insured under both policies, she was allowed to stack coverages for each insured vehicle within each policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">In <em>Sayers v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 336, 628 P.2d 659, one insurance policy covered two vehicles. That policy defined \u201cinsured\u201d as the named insured or \u201cany other person while occupying an insured automobile.\u201d This Court determined that Sayers was occupying a car owned by Gary Galetti, within the meaning of the insurance policy, when an uninsured motorist struck the car. Galetti\u2019s policy covered the car involved in the accident and another car owned by Galetti. Once we determined that Sayers was \u201coccupying\u201d the Galetti car, Sayers qualified as an insured under the policy and was, therefore, entitled to stack uninsured motorist coverage from the two Galetti cars. Accordingly, we held that a passenger, as well as an insured who pay premiums, can stack coverage for multiple cars insured under one policy. <em>Sayers, </em>628 P.2d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Mid-Century argues that <em>Sayers </em>is distinguishable because in <em>Sayers </em>Safeco only issued one policy under which both cars were insured. Here, Mid-Century issued three separate policies to Dean and, according to Mid-Century, Chilberg does not qualify as an insured under the two disputed policies because he was not occupying the cars insured under the two disputed policies. We agree. Although this case, like <em>Kemp </em>and <em>Sayers, </em>involves a passenger it presents a different situation from those cases. In both <em>Kemp </em>and <em>Sayers, </em>the plaintiff fit within the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d for each policy that was stacked. Once the injured party qualified as an insured, either as a relative or as an occupant, the injured party could stack the coverage for each vehicle within that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">Here, however, we have three separate vehicles covered by three separate policies. Each policy covers the named insured or \u201cany other person while occupying your insured car.\u201d Mid-Century paid the coverage for the one vehicle Chilberg occupied at the time of the accident. The question then becomes whether or not Chilberg is an insured under the other two policies and, therefore, entitled to stack as we allowed in <em>Kemp </em>and <em>Sayers. </em>The only way Chilberg can be an insured under the other two policies is if he were \u201coccupying\u201d the insured car named under that policy or if he fit within the definition of family member or relative. Obviously, Chilberg can only \u201coccupy\u201d one car at a time. Unlike <em>Kemp, </em>Chilberg is not a relative and cannot qualify as a family member under any of the policies. Unlike <em>Sayers, </em>the policy under which Chilberg qualifies as an insured passenger covers only one vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We note that the other two policies in question could arguably be stacked if the vehicle involved in the accident were acquired during either or both policy periods since both policies define \u201cinsured car\u201d as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">1. The vehicle described in the Declarations of this policy or any private passenger car or utility car with which you replace it. You must advise us within 30 days of any change of private passenger car or utility car. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">2 <em>.Any additional private passenger car or utility car of which you acquire ownership during the policy period. </em>Provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">a. You notify us within 30 days of its acquisition, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">b. As of the date of acquisition, all private passenger and utility cars you own are insured with a member company of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Here, the car involved in the accident was <em>acquired </em>in 1986. Dean purchased the two policies in question on May 6, 1991. Even though the car involved was <em>insured </em>after the other two policies became effective, Dean <em>acquired </em>it years before the effective period of the policies. Thus, it does not qualify as an \u201cinsured car\u201d under the above-quoted policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Recently, we examined several prior decisions in which this Court allowed plaintiffs to stack uninsured motorist coverages. We stated that \u201c [t] he public policy embodied in these decisions is that an insurer may not place in an insurance policy a provision that defeats coverage for which the insurer has received valuable consideration.\u201d <em>Bennett v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 386, 389, 862 P.2d 1146, 1148. However, <em>in Bennett, </em>the plaintiff qualified as an insured under both policies. She was the named insured in one policy and a spouse under the other policy. In addition, <em>Bennett </em>relies upon the reasonable expectations of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The public policy and rationale we restated in <em>Bennett </em>is not furthered by permitting Chilberg to stack the policies in the instant case. Chilberg was a passenger who neither had \u201creasonable expectations\u201d of coverage under the policy nor did he qualify as an insured spouse or family member under more than one policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">This Court also recognizes that underinsurance coverage is not dependent on the insured occupying a covered vehicle, rather, the coverage is personal to the insured. <em>Chaffee v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co. </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 1, 7, 591 P.2d 1102, 1105. In <em>Chaffee, </em>three cars were insured under one policy and we held that plaintiff, as an insured or a family member, was entitled to stack the coverage regardless of occupancy. <em>Chaffee, </em>591 P.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Here, however, the <em>Chaffee </em>holding is inapplicable. The policy at issue states: \u201cInsured person means: (a) You or a family member, (b) Any other person while occupying your insured car.\u201d The <em>Chaffee </em>holding that occupancy is not required applies only to subsection (a) of the policy definition, that is, the insured or a family member. As to passengers, logic dictates that you cannot be a \u201cpassenger\u201d in a car unless you are occupying that car. If the occupancy requirement were deleted as to subsection (b), passengers, then the definition of insured becomes totally open-ended and encompasses not only the insured and his or her family, but also \u201cany other person.\u201d Public policy is not furthered by having insurance policies cover named insureds, their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>families, and \u201cany other person.\u201d Such global coverage would render the definition of insured nonsensical.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In this case, Chilberg does not fit within the definition of insured, either as a named insured, family member, or occupant of a vehicle insured under that policy. Further, the public policy rationale underlying stacking, namely prohibiting insurers from defeating coverage which the insured reasonably expected, is not served by stacking the policies in the instant case. <em>See Kemp, </em>601 P.2d at 24; <em>Chaffee, </em>591 P.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">We hold that the District Court properly determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that Mid-Century was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b443-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and HUNT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
