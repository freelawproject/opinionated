Santos appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">The issues are:</p>\n<p id=\"b152-18\">1. Did the District Court err in finding Santos competent to stand trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b152-19\">2. Did the court err by admitting expert testimony elicited by the prosecution in violation of \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b152-20\">3. Did the court err in refusing to allow the defense to play at trial certain videotapes of Santos?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>4. Was Santos deprived of a constitutional right to an insanity-defense by the court\u2019s refusal to give three jury instructions offered by the defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">On the morning of March 4,1993, the bodies of Walter and Thelma Gebhardt were found in their home just west of Havre, Montana. They had each been hit repeatedly in the head with a blunt object while they slept. They were sixty-one and sixty-seven years old, respectively. A bloodstained claw hammer was found in their living room, and their 1984 El Camino was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Several adult children of the Gebhardts had visited their parents the night before they were killed. Based upon their statements, local law enforcement authorities began looking for Jose Delos Santos, II.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Santos had been staying at the Gebhardts\u2019home for several weeks. He had arrived in Havre by freight train, inadequately dressed for the winter weather, and knocked on the Gebhardts\u2019 door. Although he was a complete stranger to them, the Gebhardts took him into their home. Santos was not at the Gebhardts\u2019 home when their bodies were found, although he had been there the night before.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">On March 5, 1994, Santos was apprehended outside Virgelle, Montana, in the Gebhardts\u2019 El Camino. While he was being booked at the Chouteau County Jail, Santos said that he had changed the license plates on the El Camino and that he had killed the Gebhardts.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Santos subsequently gave a statement describing the murders in detail. He told the officers that he killed Walter Gebhardt because Walter had put him on the spot by asking him to show a picture of his girlfriend to visiting Gebhardt family members. He explained that he killed Walter by hitting him in the head with the claw hammer, and that he then killed Thelma by striking her with the hammer and choking her. He described burning documents which identified the owner of the El Camino and a pair of Walter\u2019s pants in the Gebhardts\u2019 living room fireplace \u201cto destroy the evidence.\u201d He described switching the rear license plate on the El Camino with one from another vehicle before leaving the Gebhardts\u2019 home after the murders. He took with him his high school equivalency certificate, his birth certificate, food, clothing, and a letter from his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Prior to trial, Santos moved to be declared incompetent to stand trial. For purposes of that motion, he was examined by a psychiatrist on behalf of the State and a psychologist on behalf of the defense. After hearing the testimony of both experts and reviewing the written report prepared by the State\u2019s psychiatrist, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>The case was transferred to Cascade County for trial on a defense motion for change of venue. After a week-long trial at which the central issue was Santos\u2019s mental state, a jury found him guilty on all charges. Santos appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Issue 1</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Did the District Court err in finding Santos competent to stand trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The standard for a district court\u2019s decision on whether a criminal defendant is fit to proceed to trial is set forth at \u00a7 46-14-103, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">A person who, as a result of mental disease or defect, is unable to understand the proceedings against the person or to assist in the person\u2019s own defense may not be tried, convicted, or sentenced for the commission of an offense so long as the incapacity endures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgD\">The trial court must determine \u201cwhether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>State v. Austad </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 70, 78, 641 P.2d 1373, 1378, citing <em>Dusky v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 789, 4L.Ed.2d 824, 825. This Court\u2019s standard of review is whether substantial evidence supports the district court\u2019s decision that the defendant was fit to proceed to trial. <em>State v. Statczar </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 446, 456, 743 P.2d 606, 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Santos\u2019s attack on the District Court\u2019s decision is based on the adequacy of the court\u2019s findings rather than on the sufficiency of the evidence. Under the above standard of appellate review, however, we must look to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The State\u2019s expert witness was Dr. William Stratford, a forensic psychiatrist. Before offering his opinion that Santos was competent to stand trial, Dr. Stratford conducted a thorough examination of Santos and submitted a detailed report on his competency. His examination included reviewing the sheriff\u2019s reports, a police report, autopsy reports, witness interviews and statements, Santos\u2019s interview with the arresting officers, and Santos\u2019s Seattle police department rap sheet. He also reviewed Santos\u2019s records from the Seattle Mental Health Institute and a summary of Santos\u2019s contacts with a Seattle drop-in center. Dr. Stratford spoke by phone with Santos\u2019s father. In addition, he conducted interviews with Santos over the course of two days and administered eighteen different tests to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Dr. Stratford reported that Santos was twenty-four years old and had been living as a \u201cstreet person\u201d in Seattle before he came to Montana. Dr. Stratford admitted that, to a lay person, Santos\u2019s record may look bizarre. He stated, however, that the record revealed no clear-cut history of mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Dr. Stratford stated in his report that Santos has some intrusive paranoid ideas but that \u201cit is also likely that much of the time he has learned to bring these issues up for effect knowing that they do influence health care examiners in general,\u201d and \u201c[h] e certainly is not above or incapable of lying about issues such as this and is motivated to go to a hospital and certainly not to a prison or jail.\u201d At the hearing, Dr. Stratford stated, \u201cI think it\u2019s also important to indicate that I think Mr. Santos is capable of emphasizing points like that consciously to attempt to impress someone that he\u2019s very disturbed.\u201d He reported that Santos had obtained elevated results on a test he administered to detect malingering and deception.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Dr. Stratford concluded that Santos suffers from a schizotypal personality disorder as well as being chemically dependent. However, Santos did well on a test to determine his competency to relate to and cooperate with his attorney and to fully understand the nature and quality of the proceedings against him. Dr. Stratford concluded his report to the court by stating that he believed Santos was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Santos\u2019s expert witness, psychologist Fredrick Wise, did not submit a written report to the court. His testimony at the competency hearing conflicted with that of Dr. Stratford in that Dr. Wise found Santos unresponsive and unable to comprehend what was going on. He concluded that Santos suffered from schizophrenia and was not fit to proceed to trial. Santos contends that the court erred in ignoring Dr. Wise\u2019s testimony and in not attempting to reconcile or assess the positions of the two experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The testimony of one witness is sufficient to prove a fact. <em>State v. Radi </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 451, 462, 578 P.2d 1169, 1176. Additionally, the weight and credibility of witnesses are exclusively the province of the trier of fact. In the event of conflicting evidence, it is within the province of the trier of fact to determine which will prevail. <em>State v. Flack </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 181, 189, 860 P.2d 89, 94. In this instance, the trier of fact was the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Santos was able to discuss with Dr. Stratford his complete history, including the homicides. That ability cast doubt on Santos\u2019s claims that he was not able to converse with his counsel, cooperate with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>counsel, respond to his counsel\u2019s questions, or recall facts. Santos was cooperative with Dr. Stratford, providing an array of information, including extensive information about the charged offenses. As the District Court noted at the competency hearing, there was no reason why Santos\u2019s counsel could not also get the same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Dr. Stratford\u2019s expert testimony and report clearly supported a finding that Santos was able to consult with and assist his counsel and that he had a rational as well as a factual understanding of the proceedings against him. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Santos was fit to proceed to trial. We therefore affirm the court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Santos also asserts that the court should have reassessed its competency determination because of evidence presented after the competency hearing. He cites <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 162, 181, 95 S.Ct. 896, 908, 43 L.Ed.2d 103, 119, concerning the court\u2019s continuing obligation to be on guard for changes in a defendant\u2019s competence throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Santos refers to a report by Dr. Jack Hornby, a psychiatrist who prescribed medication for him after the competency hearing. Santos claims Dr. Hornby stated he felt Santos was not competent to stand trial. That comment is not found in the copy of Dr. Hornby\u2019s report provided to this Court. In his report, Dr. Hornby specifically noted that he had \u201cnot been asked to evaluate for competency.\u201d Further, Dr. Hornby\u2019s report was submitted to the court in support of a motion to continue the trial date to allow Santos additional time on his medication, not in connection with a determination of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">At the beginning of trial and at the close of the State\u2019s case, the defense moved to be allowed to have Santos testify in connection with his competency to proceed. In denying these motions, the District Court pointed out that, at the competency hearing several weeks earlier, it had heard a tape-recording of Santos\u2019s interview with Dr. Wise. The court also stated that it had been observing Santos during trial and that the proposed testimony would be self-serving. After reviewing the record, we conclude that no abuse of discretion has been shown in the denial of the motions to put Santos on the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Santos also cites Dr. Wise\u2019s trial testimony that he saw Santos after the medication was prescribed by Dr. Hornby and that although Santos was calmer and easier to keep on track in conversation, his thoughts were still very disordered. Dr. Wise gave examples of statements by Santos which he felt indicated a lack of the requisite mental state to stand trial. However, after reviewing the record, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>that Dr. Wise did not testify to any statements markedly different from those which he had previously reported at the competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">We conclude that Santos did not present additional evidence requiring the court to reverse its earlier decision that Santos was fit to proceed to trial. Accordingly, that claim is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">As a final argument under this issue, Santos points out that Dr. Stratford\u2019s written report did not include a specific finding as to whether Santos was seriously mentally ill, as required under \u00a7 46-14-206(1)(b), MCA. This argument is raised for the first time on appeal. As such, we will not consider it. <em>See State v. Arlington </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 127, 151, 875 P.2d 307, 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Issue 2</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Did the court err in admitting expert testimony elicited by the prosecution in violation of \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Section 46-14-213(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">When a psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist who has examined the defendant testifies concerning the defendant\u2019s mental condition, the psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist may make a statement as to the nature of the examination and the medical or psychological diagnosis of the mental condition of the defendant. The expert may make any explanation reasonably serving to clarify the expert\u2019s examination and diagnosis, and the expert may be cross-examined as to any matter bearing on the expert\u2019s competency or credibility or the validity of the expert\u2019s examination or medical or psychological diagnosis. A psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist may not offer an opinion to the jury on the ultimate issue of whether the defendant did or did not have a particular state of mind that is an element of the offense charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMC\">The mental states which were an element of the offenses charged against Santos are \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cpurposely\u201d as defined at \u00a7 45-2-101(33) and (58), MCA. In particular, \u201cpurposely\u201d is defined under the statute and was defined for the jury in Instruction No. 23 as \u201c[a] person acts purposely with respect to a result ... if it is the person\u2019s conscious object to engage in that conduct or to cause that result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">The first testimony challenged by Santos as violative of \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, occurred on cross-examination of defense witness Dr. Wise. The prosecuting attorney asked Dr. Wise if he recalled Santos\u2019s statements that he had taken the victims\u2019 vehicle, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>attempted to change the license plate and had driven the vehicle out of town. He then asked if Dr. Wise believed that Santos was \u201caware of where he was\u201d and \u201caware of what he was doing\u201d when he engaged in the described behavior. Dr. Wise replied that he assumed Santos did have such an awareness. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlD\">Q. [Mr. Connor, the prosecuting attorney] At least by the defendant\u2019s own words, those acts would certainly demonstrate a purpose of the defendant to carry out specific abilities, would they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAW\">A. [Dr. Wise] I would say that, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">Q. And they at least demonstrate a conscious objective on his part to engage in a particular form of conduct, do they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">Q. And that it was his purpose, by his own description, to cause a particular result; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">A. Based on the interview, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Also, in rebuttal testimony, the prosecution asked its own expert, Dr. Stratford, whether \u201cgoing out of the house, changing the license plates on the car and taking the car to another location\u201d were indications of Santos\u2019s capacity to act purposely or knowingly. Dr. Stratford answered that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">The State defends this line of questioning as not directly relating to Santos\u2019s mental state during the homicides. However, in so arguing, the State overlooks the charge of theft of the El Camino. The elements of that charge were described to the jury in Instruction No. 20 as \u201c[a] person commits the offense of theft if he purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner, and has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property.\u201d Clearly, the above testimony relates directly to whether Santos possessed the requisite mental state of \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cpurposely\u201d as to the theft of the El Camino. We conclude that the above testimony violated the \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, prohibition as to the charge of theft of the El Camino.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Under \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA, this Court may review any error which necessarily affects the judgment. However, \u201c[n]o cause shall be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the appellant unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d Section 46-20-701(1), MCA. The trial transcript before us exceeds 700 pages in length; much of it was conflicting testimony from Drs. Wise and Stratford. Overall, the evidence against Santos was overwhelming. On the record before us, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>erroneous admission of the above brief questions and answers constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Santos also challenges the State\u2019s questions to Dr. Stratford, which again occurred in rebuttal, as set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">Q. [Mr. Connor] Doctor, without giving me specific instances, were the materials you read, in your professional opinion, replete with examples of conduct by the defendant which amounted to conscious deliberate behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">A. [Dr. Stratford] Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">Q. And which amounted to conscious object to carry out particular actions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Santos further challenges Dr. Stratford\u2019s comments on rebuttal concerning assessment of a person\u2019s ability to act knowingly and purposely as grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The basis for these challenges is the 1991 commission comment to \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA. The comment notes that the last sentence of the subsection was added by the 1991 Montana Legislature, and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">[T]he statute contains an additional statement expressly barring an expert opinion before a jury on the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s mental state or mental capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The last portion of this comment, concerning mental capacity, goes beyond the language of the statute. Where a statute is clear on its face, a court is not to go beyond the facial language in interpreting the statute. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Lovell v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 279, 285, 860 P.2d 95, 99. We decline to read into \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, a prohibition on testimony by expert witnesses concerning a criminal defendant\u2019s mental capacity. Questions and expert opinions on a criminal defendant\u2019s mental capacity are not prohibited under the above statute; what the statute prohibits are expert opinions on the ultimate issue of whether the defendant actually possessed the requisite mental state at the time the offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">We believe that this narrow reading of the statute supports the purpose of expert testimony as an aid to the finder of fact, based upon the expert\u2019s particular knowledge or experience, in determining the fact at issue. <em>See </em>Rule 702, M.R.Evid. The Supreme Court of Connecticut faced an analogous issue in <em>State v. Forrest </em>(Conn. 1990), 578 A.2d 1066. In that case, the issue was whether a mental health expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>may give opinion testimony concerning a criminal defendant\u2019s capacity for self-control. Loss of self-control was an element of the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, which was a factual question before the jury. In ruling that the expert could give an opinion on the defendant\u2019s capacity for self-control, the court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">[I]n construing [the statute] narrowly, we have assumed that the legislature enacted the statute to accomplish a reasonable and rational result. A broad construction of the statute, taken to its extreme, would arguably bar experts from fully testifying to their diagnoses of a defendant and to their resulting professional opinions, from which the jury could infer the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of a particular act. Jurors would thus be left without adequate expert assistance in making an informed decision upon the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s mental state, the precise issue expressly reserved to them by [the statute].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><em>Forrest, </em>578 A.2d at 1070 (citations omitted). The above comments by the Connecticut Supreme Court are equally applicable to the question here before us. <em>See also </em>Vitauts M. Gulbis, Annotation, \u201cAdmissibility of expert testimony as to whether accused had specific intent necessary for conviction,\u201d 16 A.L.R.4th 666 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The objection to questions and testimony on behalf of the prosecution concerning Santos\u2019s capacity to form the requisite mental states must further be viewed in the context of prior defense questions. The defense asked its expert Dr. Wise whether Santos had the capacity to understand his actions, to always know what he is doing, to remember what he had done, and to act in an intentional or a conscious manner. As the State points out, the defense thereby opened the door to questions about Santos\u2019s capacity to form the requisite mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">To recapitulate, we hold that the District Court erred in allowing expert testimony in violation of \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, concerning Santos\u2019s state of mind during the charged offense of theft of the Gebhardts\u2019 El Camino. We conclude, however, that such error was harmless. As to the convictions of deliberate homicide, we hold that the court did not err in admitting expert testimony into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Issue 3</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Did the court err in refusing to allow the defense to play at trial certain videotapes of Santos?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">At trial, the defense proposed to play and introduce into evidence two videotapes of interviews of Santos which were made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>defense counsel shortly after his arrest. The defense offered the videotapes as evidence of Santos\u2019s mental state. The State objected on hearsay grounds. The defense then offered to have Santos take the stand for cross-examination. The court refused to admit the proposed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Santos argues that because the videotapes were not offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein, they did not fit the Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid., definition of hearsay \u2014 that is, they were not offered to show that Santos\u2019s statements therein were true, but to show his poor state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Our standard of review on issues of admissibility of evidence is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Oman </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 260, 263, 707 P.2d 1117, 1119. The State points out that, in rejecting the admission of the videotapes, the District Court noted that there were no safeguards to insure their integrity and that they were not staged by Santos. The probative value of the videotapes is suspect considering the circumstances under which they were made, including that Santos was not under oath. Their probative value is further limited in that they at best demonstrate Santos\u2019s mental state several days after the offenses occurred, not at the time of the crimes. Yet further support for the court\u2019s refusal to admit the tapes into evidence is Santos\u2019s failure to comply with the discovery rule requiring disclosure of the tapes to the prosecution prior to trial. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-15-323(6), MCA. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying admission into evidence of the videotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Issue 4</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Was Santos deprived of a constitutional right to an insanity defense by the court\u2019s refusal to give three jury instructions offered by the defense?</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Santos offered three instructions to the jury which would have allowed him to rely upon an insanity defense. All three proposed instructions were refused by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">Montana law allows consideration of a defendant\u2019s mental disease or defect at three stages of a criminal proceeding. First, prior to trial the defendant may be examined to determine whether he is able to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense. Section 46-14-103, MCA. Second, a defendant may introduce evidence of mental disease or defect at trial whenever it is relevant to prove that he did not have a state of mind which is an element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>the offense charged. Section 46-14-102, MCA. Third, a defendant who has been convicted of a crime may claim during sentencing that at the time of the offense he was suffering from mental disease or defect which rendered him \u201cunable to appreciate the criminality of [his] behavior or to conform [his] behavior to the requirements of law.\u201d Section 46-14-311, MCA. Santos exercised all three of these options.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">The constitutionality of the above statutory framework has been repeatedly upheld by this Court. There is no constitutional right to an insanity defense as expressed in the instructions proposed by Santos. <em>See, State v. Cowan </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 510, 861 P.2d 884, cert. denied, _ U.S. _, 114 S.Ct. 1371, 128 L.Ed.2d 48 (1994); <em>State v. Byers </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 17, 861 P.2d 860, cert. denied _ U.S. _, 114 S.Ct. 1380, 128 L.Ed.2d 55 (1994), reversed on other grounds, <em>State v. </em>Egelhoff (1995), [272 Mont. 114] 900 P.2d 260. We hold that the District Court did not err in refusing the three jury instructions offered by Santos concerning a defense of mental disease or defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b162-9\">JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON, WEBER and District Judge WHELAN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b162-10\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AE9\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on issues 1, 3 and 4. I specially concur in that opinion on issue 2, because I agree with the result and much, but not all, of what is said therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Specifically, I agree that questions and answers regarding the defendant\u2019s mental <em>capacity </em>are permissible. I also agree that questions and answers which cross the line from capacity to <em>purpose </em>are impermissible under \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, which prohibits psychiatrists and clinical psychologists from offering an opinion on the ultimate issue of whether the defendant did or did not have the state of mind which is an element of the offense charged. Thus, where the mental state element necessary to prove the charge is \u2014 as it is in the case before us \u2014 \u201cpurposely,\u201d no opinion can be given regarding whether the defendant acted with purpose. Since between three and five questions and answers of record violate the statutory prohibition against testimony on the ultimate issue of the defendant\u2019s mental state, I agree with the Court that those answers were erroneously admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">I also agree that, under \u00a7\u00a7 46-20-104 and 46-20-701, MCA, the admission of this evidence does not affect the judgment in this case. The trial transcript before us exceeds 700 pages in length; much of it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>is conflicting expert testimony from Drs. Wise and Stratford. Overall, the evidence against Santos was overwhelming. Thus, I join in concluding that, on the record before us, the erroneous admission of between three and five brief responses constitutes harmless error, without regard to whether it goes to the theft offense or the deliberate homicide charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">In this latter regard, I disagree with the Court\u2019s tying of the objectionable questions and answers to the vehicle theft, rather than to the homicides. To this extent, I agree with the dissent. This distinction is not raised by the State and, indeed, is superfluous to the Court\u2019s analysis of this issue. Applying the controlling statutes correctly is a straightforward matter here: impermissible questions and answers were erroneously admitted into evidence but, given the overall record before us, the error is not reversible.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">With regard to the dissent, I point out that most of the questions and answers quoted therein relate only to the discussion of the offense \u2014 whether theft or homicide \u2014 to which the questions related. That portion of the dissent does not, and could not correctly, suggest that all of the quoted questions and answers violate the statutory prohibition contained in \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, against an expert opinion on the ultimate issue of whether Santos acted purposely or knowingly. It is clear from reading the transcript segment quoted by the dissent that only the last questions quoted could conceivably violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">I join the Court in affirming on all issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b163-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"Aai\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on issues 1, 3, and 4.1 dissent from the opinion on issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">As heinous as this fact situation is, I am constrained to honor the dictates of the law as set forth in \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, which states in part: \u201cA psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist may not offer an opinion to the jury on the ultimate issue of whether the defendant did or did not have a particular state of mind that is an element of the offense charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">Santos was charged with deliberate homicide and felony theft. Both offenses require proof that he acted \u201cknowingly\u201d and \u201cpurposely.\u201d The legislature has defined \u201cpurposely\u201d as follows: \u201c[a] person acts purposely with respect to a result ... if it is the person\u2019s conscious object to engage in that conduct or to cause that result.\u201d Section 45-2-101(58), MCA. It is thus clear that the Montana legislature has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>specifically stated that a psychiatrist or psychologist may not offer an opinion as to whether a defendant, when committing an act, acted knowingly, purposely or had a conscious object to engage in the conduct in question. There is no question but that in this case the prosecution elicited precisely this type of testimony from Dr. Wise with regard to Santos\u2019 striking of Walter Gebhardt with a hammer and using a rope to stop Thelma Gebhardt from breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The Court quotes two of the questions posed by the prosecutor to Dr. Wise in which the prosecution very pointedly asked whether certain acts \u201cwould demonstrate a purpose of the defendant to carry out specific abilities\u201d and whether those acts would \u201cdemonstrate a conscious objective on his part to engage in a particular form of conduct....\u201d The Court then suggests that these questions related to Santos\u2019 theft of the vehicle rather than the homicides. The Court then concludes that, although the questions violated \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, they were, in light of the overwhelming evidence, harmless error. However, when the questions are put in their full context, it is apparent that they related not only to the theft of the vehicle, but also to the homicides. As can be seen from the following excerpt of the transcript, Dr. Wise was asked to recall some very specific factual statements that Santos had made to Agent Scott in a written statement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">Q Do you recall reading at the end of the statement, and if you have it available and need to refresh your recollection, please do so, but I would recall or direct your attention particularly to pages 33 and 34 of the transcript of the statement that was given by the defendant to Agent Scott.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-6\">A The one I have goes up to 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-7\">Q Well, you may have \u2014 is it single spaced, Doctor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">A Maybe you can direct me to that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-9\">Q I guess I\u2019m talking about it\u2019s on the end, whether it\u2019s on may [sic] page 33 or your page 17 or whatever, where he makes a statement to agent Scott to the effect that he decided to take a particular action, he decided \u2014 he thought about it, <em>he took a particular action by deciding to get the hammer and by going into Walter Gebhardt\u2019s room and hitting him in the head with it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-11\">Q And do you recall reading that portion of the tape where he said that <em>he took the rope from the pulley that was above Thelma Gebhardt\u2019s bed and used it to keep her from breathing </em>earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>AI don\u2019t remember the pulley, but I remember reading the rest of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">Q Do you recall reading the part from that statement where he stated that he decided to take money from Mr. Gebhardt\u2019s wallet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">AYes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">Q Do you recall reading from that statement the portions where he stated that after striking the Gebhardts in the head, he decided to bum stuff in the fireplace and he specifically decided to do that to get rid of evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">A Yeah. I don\u2019t remember the words \u201cspecifically decided.\u201d I do remember that he did that and he said that, told that in the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">Q Do you recall him explaining to deputy, or rather to Agent Scott that the reason he did that was to get rid of evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">AYes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">Q And do you recall him describing how he chose to take the car, to attempt to change the plates on it and to drive it out of town?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">AYes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">Q So at that point in time, at least, the defendant was certainly aware of where he was; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">AYes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">Q He was aware of what he was doing; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">AI would assume that, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">Q <em>And he was aware of who he was doing it to; </em>correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">A Are you talking about after the murder or before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-18\">Q Well, I\u2019m talking about his own statements to the agent about his conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-19\">A Yeah, I would say just from those statements, I would refer that, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-20\">Q At least by the defendant\u2019s own words, <em>those acts would certainly demonstrate a purpose of the defendant to carry out specific abilities, </em>would they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-21\">AI would say that, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-22\">Q <em>And they at least demonstrate a conscious objective on his part to engage in a particular form of conduct, </em>do they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-23\">AYes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-24\">Q <em>And that it was his purpose, by his own description, to cause a particular result; </em>correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-25\">A Based on the interview, yes. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Before asking Dr. Wise whether Santos\u2019 acts demonstrated a \u201cpurpose\u201d and a \u201cconscious objective on his part to engage in a particular form of conduct,\u201d the State prefaced the questions with certain facts \u2014 including the fact that Santos said he decided to get a hammer, that he went into Walter Gebhardt\u2019s room and hit him in the head with the hammer and that he took a rope and used it to keep Thelma Gebhardt from breathing. In addition to the questions already discussed, the State also inquired of Dr. Wise whether these acts indicated that Santos was \u201caware of what he was doing\u201d and was \u201caware of <em>who </em>he was doing it to.\u201d Obviously the prosecutor\u2019s questions related to more than just the theft of the El Camino vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">It is hard to imagine a more blatant violation of the statutory prohibition against having a psychologist express an opinion as to the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time he is alleged to have committed a homicide. Here, the State was allowed to elicit testimony from a psychologist to the effect that Santos acted purposely and had a conscious objective when he hit Walter with the hammer and used a rope to prevent Thelma from breathing.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The State obviously felt it necessary to present expert testimony on the question of the defendant\u2019s state of mind. Although I agree that more general questions as to the defendant\u2019s \u201ccapacity\u201d to have a particular state of mind are legitimate, the questions posed here went well beyond general \u201ccapacity\u201d type questions. They went directly to the ultimate question of whether the defendant had the requisite state of mind at the time the offenses were committed. In light of the bizarre and gruesome behavior of this defendant, I do not see how such an error can be considered harmless. The clear provisions of \u00a7 46-14-213(2), MCA, give me no choice but to dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
