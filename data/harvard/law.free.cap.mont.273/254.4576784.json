The court denied Strickland\u2019s claim on the basis that, at the time of the accident, she was not acting in the course and scope of her employment. Strickland appeals from the judgment which denied her petition. We affirm the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Strickland raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">1. Was there substantial evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Strickland was on a personal errand at the time of her car accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-13\">2. Assuming she was on a personal errand at the time of her accident, did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly conclude that Strickland was not acting in the course and scope of her employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">\n<em>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">On August 21, 1992, Janet Strickland was employed by Joe and Sherry Tackett at the Tacketts\u2019 restaurant, Steaks n\u2019 Stuff, west of Columbia Falls in Flathead County. She arrived at work between 3:00 and 4:00 p.m. At approximately 4:00, Strickland left the restaurant to run an errand.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">Sometime after Strickland left Steaks n\u2019 Stuff, apparently on her return from the nearest convenience store, a car, which was traveling south on Highway 40 at a high rate of speed, struck her vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Strickland suffered serious head injuries as a result of the collision and was comatose for approximately six weeks. At the time of trial, Strickland still experienced significant adverse effects due to the accident, including difficulty remembering events during the period just prior to the accident until approximately eight weeks after the accident, or two weeks after Strickland awoke from the coma.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">On August 24, 1992, three days after the accident, Strickland\u2019s husband, Wayne, filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim for her. In the claim, Wayne stated that Janet had gone on a shopping errand for Steaks n\u2019 Stuff and that the accident occurred during her return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The issues raised by Strickland\u2019s petition and the State Fund\u2019s answer were tried before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on March 2, 1994. Marla Handford was called as a witness by the State Fund. She identified herself as Steaks n\u2019 Stuff\u2019s head cook and Strickland\u2019s supervisor on the afternoon of her accident. Handford testified that during the time prior to Strickland\u2019s departure from work, she had complained of cramps and at least inferred a desire to locate and take an analgesic, such as Midol, that was stronger than aspirin. Additionally, Handford testified that Strickland wanted to purchase a newspaper in order to search for new office space for her husband\u2019s business. Testimony from Tackett and an additional witness corroborated Handford\u2019s version of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Strickland testified that Handford directed her to go to the Trumble Creek Hub in order to purchase a National Inquirer and a National Examiner. In support of Strickland\u2019s version of events, an investigator, Bob Evans, testified that 10 or 11 days after the accident, he examined Strickland\u2019s car and found within it a National Inquirer and a National Examiner. Furthermore, Wayne Strickland testified that on the day of the accident, while at the hospital, he spoke with Joe Tackett, who stated that Handford told him that she felt the accident was her fault because she had sent Strickland to the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Handford unequivocally denied sending Strickland anywhere. She also testified that after Strickland had decided to go to the store for personal reasons, she might have asked her to bring back something for her (Handford) to read. She gave the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">Q: [RESPONDENT\u2019S ATTORNEY] Do you remember whether or not you sent her out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">A. No, I didn\u2019t send her anywhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-10\">Q. You\u2019re certain of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>A. I\u2019m certain of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVR\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">Q. You don\u2019t recall saying, Would you get me something to read?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aum\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcZ\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">A. ... You know, we were friends and we were talking and giggling and laughing. I don\u2019t remember if I \u2014 I said, Well, if you\u2019re going to get something to read, I\u2019ll have something too, you know, pick me up something too.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court found Handford\u2019s version of the events more credible that Strickland\u2019s, in part because of the length of Strickland\u2019s coma and the fragmentary nature of her memory concerning the day of the accident. It also found that Wayne\u2019s testimony was not credible. The court found that Strickland was on a personal errand at the time of the accident. Accordingly, the court concluded that Strickland was not acting within the course and scope of her employment at the time of the accident, and therefore, denied Strickland\u2019s petition for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\n<em>ISSUE 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Was there substantial evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Strickland was on a personal errand at the time of her car accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">We will review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether substantial evidence supports the findings. <em>Wunderlich v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. </em>(1995), [270 Mont. 404], 892 P.2d 563, 564 (citing <em>Smith v. United Parcel Service </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 71, 75, 835 P.2d 717, 720). We stress this standard of review in light of Strickland\u2019s assertion that we have \u201cvacillated\u201d between the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standards in relation to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s findings of fact. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that we have vacillated in this respect, <em>Buckentin v. State Compensation Insurance Fund </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 518, 878 P.2d 262, makes clear that our employment of the clearly erroneous standard in <em>Bogle v. Ownerrent Rent to Own </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 515, 872 P.2d 800, was incorrect. <em>Buckentin, </em>878 P.2d at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Strickland contends that substantial evidence did not support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that she was engaged in a personal errand at the time of her accident. In support of this contention, she cites physical evidence which is inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Handford\u2019s version of events and suggests that Handford\u2019s testimony was too equivocal to directly contradict her own evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The State Fund responds that Handford\u2019s testimony provided substantial evidence in support of the court\u2019s critical finding and that because Handford\u2019s and Strickland\u2019s testimony were contradictory regarding the nature of Strickland\u2019s errand, this Court must defer to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s resolution of that factual issue. The State Fund notes, and we agree, that this Court is not in a position to independently assess either witness credibility or the weight to be given to a witness\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In support of its argument, the State Fund cites <em>Wunderlich, </em>in which we held that substantial evidence consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but may be somewhat less than a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Wunderlich, </em>892 P.2d at 564. By that standard, the State Fund contends that Handford\u2019s testimony satisfied the requirement of substantial evidence. We agree, and further note that \u201c[t]he direct evidence of one witness who is entitled to full credit is sufficient for proof of any fact....\u201d Section 26-1-301, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">For these reasons, and based on the testimony of Marla Handford and our review of the entire record, we conclude there was substantial evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Strickland was engaged in a personal errand at the time of her motor vehicle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">\n<em>ISSUE 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Assuming she was on a personal errand at the time of her accident, did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly conclude that Strickland was not acting in the course and scope of her employment?</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">We review the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Glaude v. State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>(1995), [271 Mont. 136], 894 P.2d 940, 941, 52 St. Rep. 367 (citing <em>Stordalen v. Ricci\u2019s Food Farm </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 256, 258, 862 P.2d 393, 394).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Strickland asserts that even if she was on a personal errand at the time of the accident, she was, nonetheless, acting within the course and scope of her employment. She bases this contention on the \u201cpersonal comfort\u201d and \u201crest break\u201d doctrines described at Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, Vol. 1A \u00a7 21.00, at 5-5, and Vol. 1 \u00a7 15.54, at 4-116.38, 4-116.40, respectively, and our prior decision in <em>Steffes v. 93 Leasing Co. </em>(1978), 177 Mont. 83, 580 P.2d 450. However, whether injuries sustained while traveling to and from work are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>compensable is governed by statute in Montana; <em>see </em>\u00a7 39-71-407, MCA(1987), and <em>State Fund v. James </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 348,849 P.2d 187, and <em>Steffes </em>was decided before the effective date of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Section 39-71-407(3), MCA, provides the only circumstances under which an employee\u2019s travel-related injuries are compensable. That section provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">An employee who suffers an injury... while traveling is not covered by this chapter unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">(a) (i) the employer furnishes the transportation or the employee receives reimbursement from the employer for costs of travel, gas, oil, or lodging as a part of the employee\u2019s benefits or employment agreement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">(ii) the travel is necessitated by and on behalf of the employer as an integral part or condition of the employment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">(b) the travel is required by the employer as part of the employee\u2019s job duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Strickland used her own vehicle to ran the errand. Nothing in the record establishes that Tackett reimbursed Strickland for the costs of running the errand and, as previously discussed, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court specifically found that Strickland\u2019s employer did not require that she make the trip she was on at the time of her injuries. Since we have previously held that that finding was supported by substantial evidence, we conclude that Strickland was not acting within the course and scope of her employment at the time she was injured, and that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, therefore, correctly concluded that her claim is not compensable.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b283-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b283-12\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"Av9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that there was substantial evidence to support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that: \u201cclaimant left work on a personal errand to pinchase a newspaper and possibly an analgesic [Midol].\u201d Despite Marla Handford\u2019s testimony as to the newspaper and Midol, the record shows no physical evidence to support the position that Janet Strickland was on a personal errand. Neither Midol nor a <em>Daily InterLake </em>newspaper was found in Strickland\u2019s car. If, as Handford claimed, Strickland were returning from a personal trip to the store to pinchase these items, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>where were they? Additional evidence refutes the assertion that Strickland was on a personal trip. Strickland had no need for Midol, she did not have her period, she was not premenstrual, and she testified that she does not suffer from menstrual cramps and has never used Midol. Since Strickland subscribed to the <em>Daily InterLake, </em>there was no reason for her to purchase the paper. Although this Court defers to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on questions of witness credibility, the complete lack of physical evidence to support the State Fuad\u2019s position that Strickland was on a personal errand overrides the credibility assigned to Handford by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. I find that substantial evidenc\u00e9 does not support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Strickland was engaged in a personal errand at the time of her accident.</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-4\">JUSTICE HUNT joins in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
