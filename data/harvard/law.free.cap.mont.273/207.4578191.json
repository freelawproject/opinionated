We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Gould\u2019s motion to dismiss based on lack of speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">2. Did the District Court err in concluding that mental incapacity, as defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, includes voluntary intoxication and in denying Gould\u2019s motion to dismiss on that basis?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-16\">3. Did the District Court err in denying Gould\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence on the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">4. Is there sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the offense of sexual intercourse without consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-18\">Disregarding minor discrepancies, the general facts in this case are not disputed. On the evening of February 5, 1992, Janetta Jo Paitra Clark (Clark), Tami Lynn Archer Horvath (Horvath), Russ Moddison (Moddison), Ian \u201cSkip\u201d Johnson (Johnson), Jordan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Mattfeld (Mattfeld) and Gould met at the Black Eagle Country Club, in Black Eagle, Montana. The group drank and socialized at the club for several hours. Clark consumed approximately nine drinks. The group left the club at approximately 1:00 a.m. on the morning of February 6, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">After leaving the club, the group met at the residence of Mattfeld and Johnson. At around 1:45 a.m., Mattfeld and Clark had a drinking contest in which they took turns drinking from a fifth of Jack Daniels. Clark drank approximately one-half of the bottle.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">After the contest, Clark stumbled into Mattfeld\u2019s room. At one point, Clark fell and Mattfeld had to assist her in getting up. Clark collapsed onto Mattfeld\u2019s bed and, soon thereafter, Johnson and Moddison assisted her from Mattfeld\u2019s room to Johnson\u2019s room. They removed Clark\u2019s sweater and jeans, then stepped into the hallway where, together with Gould, they discussed having sex with Clark. Moddison returned to Johnson\u2019s room; Johnson and Gould went to the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Moddison removed Clark\u2019s bra and underwear and had vaginal and anal intercourse with her. Johnson also had vaginal and anal intercourse with Clark. Finally, Gould entered the room and had vaginal intercourse with Clark. A few hours later, Moddison discovered Clark dead on Johnson\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">On April 13, 1993, the State of Montana (State) charged Gould by information with the felony offense of sexual intercourse without consent. Gould\u2019s jury trial began on June 6, 1994, and the jury returned a guilty verdict on June 8, 1994. Additional facts are set forth where necessary to our resolution of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">1. Did the District Court err in denying Gould\u2019s motion to dismiss based on lack of speedy trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to a speedy trial. Gould argues on appeal that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on lack of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">The State contends that Gould waived his right to a speedy trial and, as a result, that we should refuse to reach the merits of his argument. While it is true that Gould waived his right to a speedy trial on two occasions, first on September 14, 1993, and again on December 13,1993, the record indicates that his waivers were limited to specific time periods. Therefore, the waivers did not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>total waiver by Gould of his speedy trial rights and we will address the waivers within our speedy trial analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The United States Supreme Court set forth a four-factor test to be used in determining whether a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has been violated in <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 2192, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, 117; we adopted the <em>Barker </em>test in <em>State ex rel. Briceno v. District Court </em>(1977), 173 Mont. 516, 518, 568 P.2d 162, 163-64. The <em>Barker </em>factors are: (1) length of the delay; (2) reason for the delay; (3) defendant\u2019s assertion of the right; and (4) prejudice to the defendant. <em>State v. Thompson </em>(1993), 263 Mont. 17, 32, 865 P.2d, 1125, 1134 (citation omitted). None of these factors alone is dispositive; rather, they are considered together and balanced in light of the unique circumstances of each case. <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 525, 529, 881 P.2d 629, 632 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>Length of Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The length of the delay is of primary importance. <em>State v. Heffernan </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 67, 70, 809 P.2d 566, 568. Unless the length of the delay is presumptively prejudicial, it is unnecessary to consider the remaining three factors. <em>State v. Weeks </em>(1995), [270 Mont. 63], 891 P.2d 477, 482 (citation omitted). If a delay is presumptively prejudicial, the State has the burden of rebutting the presumption by providing a reasonable explanation for the delay and showing that the defendant was not prejudiced. <em>State v. Curtis </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 288, 299, 787 P.2d 306, 313 (citation omitted). We previously have stated that a delay greater than 200 days usually triggers a full speedy trial analysis. <em>State v. Hembd </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 407, 413, 838 P.2d 412, 416 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Here, the total delay between the filing of the information and the commencement of Gould\u2019s trial was 419 days. Thus, the length of delay is presumptively prejudicial and we analyze the remaining speedy trial factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\n<em>Reason for Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Analysis of the second factor, reason for the <em>delay, </em>requires allocating the delay to the party responsible for causing it. <em>Heffernan, </em>809 P.2d at 568. The overall 419-day delay in this case can be divided into five segments.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">The first segment, of 56 days, began when the State filed the information against Gould on April 13, 1993, and continued until June 8,1993, when Gould successfully moved to continue the trial set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>for June 21, 1993. This segment of the delay is attributable to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">The second segment, of 136 days, began on June 8, 1993, and continued until October 22,1993, when the State successfully moved to continue the trial set for October 25,1993. During this time, Gould successfully moved for three continuances and, in his September 14, 1993, motion, specifically waived his right to a speedy trial until October 11, 1993, when Dr. Donald Reay, an expert witness for the defense, would be available for trial. Additionally, he entered into, and then withdrew from, a plea agreement with the State. Upon withdrawing from the plea agreement, Gould informed the court he would be seeking new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Gould points out that the State amended the information against him during this period by dropping one of the charges. In fact, the State filed the amended information on July 26,1993, subsequent to Gould\u2019s successful motion to continue. Gould argues that we should allocate the time from that date until October 22,1993, to the State. However, the amended information did not impact the trial date set in response to Gould\u2019s July 26, 1993, motion to continue and did not require additional trial preparation by Gould; therefore, the State\u2019s filing of the amended information did not result in any delay. This 136-day segment of delay is attributable to Gould.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The third segment, of 34 days, began on October 22,1993, and continued until November 24, 1993. The State\u2019s October 22, 1993, motion to continue was due to Gould\u2019s failure to obtain counsel after his withdrawal from the plea agreement with the State. On November 18, 1993, upon motion by the State, Gould appeared in court and was ordered to retain counsel or proceed pro se by November 24,1993. While this segment of delay arguably should be attributed to Gould on the basis that his unrepresented status undoubtedly prompted the State\u2019s October 22nd and November 18th motions, we attribute it to the State given the importance of the right to a speedy trial at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The fourth segment, of 106 days, began on November 24,1993, and continued until March 11, 1994. Although ordered to retain counsel or proceed pro se by November 24,1993, Gould did not appear with new counsel until December 13, 1993. Additionally, Gould requested that his trial be set no sooner than March 7,1994, and in this request, he waived his right to a speedy trial for that time period. On March 11,1994, the State successfully moved to continue the trial set for March 21, 1994. This segment of delay is attributable to Gould.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The fifth segment, of 87 days, began with the State\u2019s March 11, 1994, motion to continue the trial date, and concluded when Gould\u2019s trial began on June 6, 1994. During this period, the District Court, on its own initiative, continued the trial and set an omnibus hearing. This segment of delay is attributable to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Gould is responsible for 242 days, while the State is responsible for 177 days, of the 419-day overall delay. The right to a speedy trial was primarily designed to protect defendants from oppressive tactics by the prosecution. <em>Heffernan, </em>809 P.2d at 569; citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S.Ct. at 2191. Gould does not contend, and the record does not reflect, that the State engaged in any deliberate tactics to delay the trial. The delay we attribute to the State was of the type which is inherent in the system and which we categorize as institutional delay. <em>See Hembd, </em>838 P.2d at 416; <em>Heffernan, </em>809 P.2d at 570. Institutional delay weighs less heavily against the State than purposeful delay. <em>Hembd, </em>838 P.2d at 416 (citation omitted). Under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the State has satisfied its burden of providing a reasonable explanation for the 177 days of delay attributed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\n<em>Assertion of the Right</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A motion to dismiss for denial of speedy trial is timely if made prior to the actual commencement of trial. <em>Briceno, </em>568 P.2d at 165; citing <em>State v. Steward </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 385, 543 P.2d 178. Gould moved to dismiss the charges against him on speedy trial grounds on May 2, 1994, approximately one month prior to the scheduled trial date. Thus, Gould satisfied the third <em>Barker </em>factor by timely asserting his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\n<em>Prejudice to the Defendant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The fourth <em>Barker </em>factor is prejudice to the defendant. We assess prejudice by considering the following interests protected by the right to a speedy trial: (1) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration; (2) minimizing the defendant\u2019s anxiety and concern; and (3) limiting the impairment of the defense. <em>Curtis, </em>787 P.2d at 315 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">Gould argues that he clearly has established the pretrial incarceration factor because he was incarcerated on this charge while awaiting trial. Gould\u2019s pretrial incarceration, however, does not weigh in his favor under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>On February 6, 1992, while awaiting sentencing on an unrelated offense, Gould committed the offense at issue in this case. He was sentenced on the unrelated offense to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, with five years suspended, approximately two and one-half weeks later and began serving his sentence at the Montana State Prison. On December 24, 1992, he was transferred to the Billings Pre-Release Center. In April, 1993, while at the Pre-Release Center, Gould was arrested for the offense at issue here. At that time, he obviously had not completed his sentence for the unrelated offense. On May 11,1993, Gould successfully moved the District Court to allow him to remain incarcerated at the Cascade County Jail, rather than being returned to the Montana State Prison, because allowing him to remain in Cascade County would benefit him in preparing his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">It appears that Gould would have remained in the custody of the Montana Department of Corrections and, thus, incarcerated in some manner during the period in question. This Court previously has held that incarceration on a different charge negates any prejudice resulting from incarceration while awaiting trial. <em>Hembd, </em>838 P.2d at 416. Under these circumstances, Gould\u2019s pretrial incarceration was neither oppressive nor prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Gould argues that he suffered overwhelming anxiety and concern because of his lengthy incarceration. In this regard, we note that, as discussed above, Gould would have been in custody in any event; thus, anxiety and concern relating to the length of his incarceration are not specifically related to his incarceration on the offense at issue here. Gould also argues that he suffered from anxiety and concern due to the nature of the charge and the circumstances under which this offense occurred. Specifically, he contends that Clark\u2019s inability to testify caused additional anxiety and concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">A certain amount of anxiety and concern is inherent in being charged with a crime. <em>Thompson, </em>865 P.2d at 1135 (citation omitted). Proving anxiety and concern beyond that which normally accompany being charged with a crime is extremely difficult. <em>See Curtis, </em>787 P.2d at 316. Once accomplished by a defendant, the State faces the nearly impossible task of proving lack of anxiety and concern. <em>Curtis, </em>787 P.2d at 316. Where a defendant puts forth only marginal evidence of anxiety and concern, the State\u2019s burden of proving lack of anxiety lessens considerably. <em>Curtis, </em>787 P.2d at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In support of his claim of overwhelming anxiety and concern, Gould offers nothing more than bare assertions summarizing the circumstances in this case. He fails to present even marginal evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>proving that he suffered anxiety and concern beyond that inherent in being charged with this offense. We conclude that the minimal anxiety and concern Gould established did not exceed that which is inherent in being charged with the offense at issue here and, therefore, this interest does not weigh heavily against the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The most important consideration in analyzing prejudice to a defendant resulting from pretrial delay is whether the delay impaired his defense. <em>Stewart, </em>881 P.2d at 634. Gould argues that his defense was impaired because the time lag of more than two years between the alleged crime and the trial resulted in witnesses\u2019 memories fading.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">It is clear that prejudice exists if defense witnesses are unable to accurately recall events of the distant past. <em>See Heffernan, </em>809 P.2d 570; citing Barker, 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. at 2193. Here, Gould was the only defense witness. His defense at trial was that Clark consented to intercourse with him. He remembered the details with regard to intercourse with Clark and testified that she consented. The record clearly shows that Gould was able to effectively, albeit unsuccessfully, present this defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Gould also argues that his defense was impaired due to the manner in which Moddison\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s charges were handled; Moddison pled guilty to sexual intercourse without consent and the charge against Johnson was dropped. It is unclear how this relates to the pretrial delay in this case. We conclude that Gould\u2019s defense was not impaired by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In summary, although Gould timely asserted his right to a speedy trial, his own actions delayed the trial for 242 days and the delay attributable to the State was institutional. Gould was not prejudiced by the delay. After balancing the four <em>Barker </em>factors, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Gould\u2019s motion to dismiss based on lack of a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">2. Did the District Court err in concluding that mental incapacity, as defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, includes voluntary intoxication and in denying Gould\u2019s motion to dismiss on that basis?</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, Gould moved to dismiss the charge against him as a matter of law. He argued that Clark\u2019s voluntary intoxication precluded the State from establishing that Clark was mentally incapacitated and, therefore, from proving the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent. The District Court concluded that mental incapacity, as defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, is not limited to situations where the victim is involuntarily intoxicated and denied Gould\u2019s motion on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Our standard in reviewing a district court\u2019s conclusion of law is whether the interpretation of the law is correct. <em>State v. Christensen </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 374, 375-76, 877 P.2d 468, 469 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The statutory definition of \u201cwithout consent\u201d insofar as it relates to the offense of sexual intercourse without consent encompasses the situation in which the victim is incapable of consent because she is mentally incapacitated. Section 45-5-501(1)(b)(i), MCA. Pursuant to \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, a person is mentally incapacitated when she is \u201ctemporarily incapable of appreciating or controlling [her] own conduct as a result of the influence of an intoxicating substance.\u201d Gould argues that the Montana legislature intended mental incapacity to have the same meaning under \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, as it has under the New York law from which Montana\u2019s statute was adopted. Under New York Penal Law \u00a7 130.00(6) (1987), mental incapacity means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaJ\">a person is rendered temporarily incapable of appraising or controlling his conduct owing to the influence of a narcotic or intoxicating substance <em>administered to him without his consent, </em>or to any other act committed upon him without his consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1a\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">In interpreting a statute, we look first to the plain meaning of its words. <em>Christensen, </em>877 P.2d at 469 (citation omitted). If the legislative intent can be ascertained from the plain meaning of the words used, no further interpretation is required and we will not resort to legislative history. <em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), [271 Mont. 412], 897 P.2d 1085, 1088 (citation omitted). Where the language is plain, unambiguous, direct, and certain, the statute speaks for itself and there is no need to resort to extrinsic means of interpretation. <em>Christensen, </em>877 P.2d at 469 (citation omitted). In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Section 45-2-101(35), MCA, provides that a person is mentally incapacitated when, due to the influence of an intoxicating substance, she is temporarily incapable of appreciating or controlling her conduct. The statute by its terms does not differentiate between voluntary and involuntary intoxication and is not limited to involuntary intoxication. Section 45-2-101(35), MCA, is clear on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Moreover, while it is undisputed that Montana\u2019s mental incapacity statute was modeled after New York\u2019s, it also is clear that the Montana legislature did not adopt the New York law verbatim. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, <em>with </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.00(6) (1987). The Montana legislature\u2019s deletion of the language from the New York statute which limits mental incapacity to situations where the victim is involuntarily intoxicated created a statute substantially different from that upon which our statute was modeled.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">The District Court properly refused to insert into \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, language from the New York penal statute omitted by the Montana legislature. We conclude that \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, by its terms, does not exclude voluntary intoxication. Therefore, Clark\u2019s voluntary intoxication did not preclude the State from proving the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Gould further argues that there is a double standard in the law because people are responsible for their criminal acts despite their voluntary intoxication pursuant to \u00a7 45-2-203, MCA, while victims may be deemed incapable of consent when they are voluntarily intoxicated. He does not assert, however, that this alleged double standard infringes on any Constitutional right and, absent such a challenge, we must apply the statutes as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We conclude that the District Court did not err in interpreting mental incapacity, as defined in \u00a7 45-2-101(35), MCA, to include voluntary intoxication. Therefore, we hold that the court properly denied Gould\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">3. Did the District Court err in denying Gould\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence on the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In addition to his motion to dismiss as a matter of law based on statutory interpretation, Gould argued that the charge should be dismissed because the State\u2019s evidence of Clark\u2019s mental incapacitation and, therefore, of the \u201cwithout consent\u201d element of the offense, was insufficient to go to the jury. The District Court rejected this argument and refused to dismiss the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-403, MCA, a trial court may direct a verdict of acquittal and dismiss a criminal charge at the close of the State\u2019s case when the evidence is insufficient to support a guilty verdict. Our standard in reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of such a motion is whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Weeks, </em>891 P.2d at 491-92 (citation omitted). Here, we focus only on evidence relating to mental incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The record illustrates that during the evening hours of February 5, 1992, and the early morning of February 6, 1992, Clark drank a substantial amount of alcohol. Dr. John Henneford testified that Clark\u2019s blood alcohol content reached at least .45. Clark\u2019s intoxication was uncontroverted. She ran into things as she attempted to walk, fell and needed assistance in getting up, and had to be assisted to Johnson\u2019s room. Atoxicologist opined that Clark was in the comatose-to-death phase of intoxication and explained that, at the comatose phase, a person becomes unresponsive to conditions around her.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Clark was mentally incapacitated due to intoxication and, thus, incapable of consent when Gould had intercourse with her. We hold that the District Court did not err in denying Gould\u2019s motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">4. Is there sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on the offense of sexual intercourse without consent?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Gould argues on appeal that the evidence established that Clark was dead when he had intercourse with her and, therefore, that there was insufficient evidence upon which the jury could find the \u201cperson\u201d element of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Our standard in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is whether, after reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Whitcher </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 183, 187, 810 P.2d 751, 753 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Gould testified that, when he entered Johnson\u2019s bedroom, he asked Clark how it was going; she replied \u201call right.\u201d He also testified that, after having intercourse with Clark, he returned to the living room around 2:30 to 2:45 a.m. and watched television. Dr. John Henneford, a pathologist, estimated that Clark died between 3:00 and 5:00 a.m., but opined that she probably died between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m. James Bruckner, the Cascade County Deputy Coroner, also estimated the time of death to be between 4:00 and 4:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence from which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>jury could find that the State had proved the \u201cperson\u201d element of the offense of sexual intercourse without consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we hold that sufficient evidence supported the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b246-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
