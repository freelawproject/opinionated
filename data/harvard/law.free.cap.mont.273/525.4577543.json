We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the Youth Court erred in ordering AZYs placement with his father as a condition of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">AZY is a minor, sixteen years of age. He committed the offense of criminal mischief which, if committed by an adult, is in violation of \u00a7 45-6-101, MCA (1993), and was found to be a delinquent youth within the meaning of \u00a7 41-5-103(7)(a), MCA(1993). The Youth Court placed AZY on probation under the jurisdiction of DFS and released him into the custody of his mother. AZYs mother had been his sole custodian for the previous thirteen years. A subsequent petition was filed alleging AZY violated the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">The Youth Court held a disposition hearing on the petition to revoke and committed AZY to the custody of DFS with placement at Pine Hills School for boys. The court then suspended the commitment to DFS and placed AZY on probation under the supervision of the Youth Court Probation Department with the condition that AZY move to Seattle, Washington, and reside with his father. From this disposition, AZY and his mother appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Did the Youth Court err in ordering the placement of AZY with his father a condition of his probation?</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">AZY and his mother argue that the Youth Court exceeded its authority in placing AZY outside his home. They contend that \u00a7 41-5-523, MCA (1993), limits the Youth Court\u2019s dispositional authority if the court determines that the youth is in need of a placement other than the youth\u2019s own home.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">41-5-523. ... (1) If a youth is found to be a delinquent youth or a youth in need of supervision, the youth court may enter its judgment making any of the following dispositions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">(a) place the youth on probation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">(b) commit the youth to the department if the court determines that the youth is in need of placement in other than the youth\u2019s own home, provided that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">(i) the court shall determine whether continuation in the home would be contrary to the welfare of the youth and whether reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the youth from the youth\u2019s home. The court shall include a determination in the order committing the youth to the department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">AZY and his mother contend \u00a7 41-5-523(1)(b), MCA (1993), provides DFS with the sole authority to place a youth outside of his own home in all circumstances except when a youth is committed to a mental health facility. See also \u00a7 41-5-523(1)(j), MCA (1993). AZY and his mother argue that the Youth Court improperly removed AZY from his mother\u2019s home and her sole legal custody and placed him in the care of his father, a noncustodial parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">The State agrees that if the Youth Court had committed AZY to DFS, the court could not have ordered specific placement. However, the State argues that the Youth Court placed AZY on probation pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-523(1)(a), -703, MCA (1993), and placed him with his father as a condition of that probation. The State stresses that there are no statutory restrictions to conditions on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">The State references an Arizona case where the court upheld probation that required the youth to spend weekends at a detention center while otherwise on probation and living with his parents. The Arizona court concluded that the youth court\u2019s \u201cability to impose conditions of probation exists even though it is not specifically set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>forth in the statute.\u201d <em>In re the Appeal in Pima County Juvenile Action No. J-20705-3 </em>(Ariz. Ct. App. 1982), 650 P.2d 1278, 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">AZY and his mother dispute that case\u2019s applicability here because Arizona\u2019s statutes provide for a disposition by the court where the youth may be placed with his parents subject to the supervision of the probation officer. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8-241(A)(2)(a) (1994). In that case, the youth remained under the custody of his parents but was under the probation officer\u2019s supervision on weekends. Under Montana law such a disposition is not available and the case cited is inapplicable to the issue presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The State further argues AZY has \u201ca home\u201d with his father. The Youth Court Act does not define \u201ca youth\u2019s own home\u201d as referred to in \u00a7 41-5-523(1)(b), MCA (1993). In Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, home is \u201c[t]hat place in which one in fact resides with the intention of residence ....\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 374 (ab. 5th ed. 1983). An unmarried minor child\u2019s residence is defined in \u00a7 1-1-215(4), MCA (1993), as \u201cthe residence of the parent having legal custody or, if neither parent has legal custody, the residence of the parent with whom he customarily resides ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">DFS\u2019s report to the court noted AZY had not spent any length of time with his father and their contact had been inconsistent. AZY\u2019s father did not have custody of the youth and had not seen him for over a year prior to this action. In addition, we note AZY has been a full-time student in Montana\u2019s schools while residing with his mother. Therefore, we conclude that AZY\u2019s father\u2019s home is not \u201cthe youth\u2019s own home\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 41-5-523(1)(b), MCA (1993). Nevertheless, the State asserts that the Youth Court properly considered AZY\u2019s best interests while maintaining a family environment. In doing so, the State argues the court fulfilled the purposes of the Youth Court Act as stated in \u00a7 41-5-102, MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">The Youth Court concluded it had the authority to place AZY with his father. We review a District Court\u2019s conclusion of law for its correctness. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co., Inc. </em>(1995), [271 Mont. 459], 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The 1987 amendments to the Youth Court Act, \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-101 to -1008, MCA, expanded the role of DFS while it diminished the role of the youth courts. <em>In the Matter of B.L.T. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 468, 471, 853 P.2d 1226, 1228. Prior to those amendments, the youth court had full authority over placement of youths. Section 41-5-523, MCA (1985). The amendments preserved the youth court\u2019s power to sentence the youth but granted to DFS control over the placement of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>youth. <em>In the Matter of the Application of Peterson </em>(1989), 235 Mont. 313, 316, 767 P.2d 319, 321. In <em>Peterson, </em>we upheld that transfer of authority and ruled the legislature had the power to make placement of youths an administrative power. <em>Peterson, </em>767 P.2d at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Section 41-5-523(1)(b), MCA (1993), provides that the youth court shall \u201ccommit the youth to [DFS] if the court determines that the youth is in need of placement in other than the youth\u2019s own home ....\u201d The court stated, in the record, that AZYs mother \u201cdoes not have the parenting skills necessary to keep [AZY at her residence at the present time.\u201d The court then found it was in AZY\u2019s best interest to reside with his father instead of with his mother. Thus, the court determined continuation in the home would be contrary to AZY\u2019s welfare and such a determination requires the court\u2019s committal of AZY to DFS for placement. Section 41-5-523(1)(b)(i), MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In deciding the youth\u2019s placement, DFS must review recommendations made by the youth placement committee. Section 41-5-527(1), MCA (1993). The legislature, in \u00a7 41-5-526(4), MCA (1993), specifically provided that the youth placement committee may recommend to DFS the youth\u2019s placement with his parent or other family member as an alternative to placement in a licensed facility or with a guardian. From this provision, we determine that the legislature intended placement with a noncustodial parent to be no different than any other alternative placement sites outside of the youth\u2019s own home.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">We conclude that the placement of AZY outside of his mother\u2019s home was under the authority of DFS. Therefore, we hold that the Youth Court erred in ordering the placement of AZY with his father as a condition of his probation. It is important to note that the legislature revised the Youth Court Act again in 1995 and amended the language of \u00a7 41-5-523, MCA (1993), though the question of how those revisions would affect the facts of this case is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Because of our holding in this issue, we do not find it necessary to discuss the other issues raised by appellant. We reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b553-9\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"Ale\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">\u201cHome\u201d is a word with innumerable definitions, meaning different things to different people. For example, while the majority correctly quoted Black\u2019s Law Dictionary for its definition of \u201chome\u201d, Black\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>also defines \u201chome\u201d as \u201cthe habitual abode of one\u2019s family.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 374 (6th ed. 1990). The habitual abode of half of A.Z.G.\u2019s family is in Seattle, and that is also his home when he is with his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The facts of this case support a broader definition of \u201chome.\u201d A psychologist\u2019s examination found A.Z.G. to have a \u201cnormal amount of rebelliousness\u201d, with much of his involvement in the legal system stemming from \u201cfamily conflict.\u201d Court reports from A.Z.G.\u2019s therapists at Mountain View School indicate his problems center around the deteriorating relationship with his mother. The two have a history of unproductive conflict, which on at least one occasion resulted in law enforcement being dispatched to the mother\u2019s house. While A.Z.G. undeniably must be held responsible for his own behavior, reports to the court indicate a need for his mother to work on parenting skills and her tendency to be over-controlling. These same reports indicate the mother continually denies any involvement in her son\u2019s difficulties and refuses to recognize any need to change her own behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Meanwhile, A.Z.G.\u2019s father stands ready to take his son home to an environment free from the cycle of conflict that A.Z.G. and his mother apparently cannot escape. The father has a steady job, a stable home, and a warm and respectful relationship with his son. In ordering probation, the Youth Court allowed the <em>family </em>to work on solving A.Z.G.\u2019s difficulties without the drastic step of transferring custody of him to the State. This decision was reasonable, warranted under the specific facts of this case, and certainly did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">I also disagree with the majority\u2019s declaration that \u201cthe legislature intended placement with a non-custodial parent to be no different than any other alternative placement sites outside of the youth\u2019s own home.\u201d I am not persuaded the legislature intended the advantages and disadvantages of parental placement to be weighed equally against the advantages and disadvantages of placement with the State, as represented by an institution or a foster home. Unlike the State, a parent has constitutional rights and responsibilities to a child that have been repeatedly recognized, both by this Court and by the Supreme Court of the United States:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">The Court has frequently emphasized the importance of the family. The rights to conceive and to raise one\u2019s children have been deemed essential, basic civil rights of man, and rights far more precious than property rights. It is cardinal with us that the custody, care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 645, 654, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 558 (citations omitted). When, as here, the rights of a parent are potentially to be weighed against the rights of a third party, \u201cit has long been the law in Montana that the right of the natural parent prevails until a showing of a forfeiture of this right.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Henderson </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 1, 10, 568 P.2d 177, 182 (citations omitted). Despite this settled law, the majority opinion may be interpreted to excuse the State from giving greater deference to a parent than it does to a facility or institution. This case therefore sets a troubling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">A.Z.G.\u2019s mother has made a legitimate attempt to parent her son. Though laudable, her attempt apparently has not been completely successful. It was not an abuse of discretion for the Youth Court to let the father have a try. For this reason, I would affirm the judgment of the Youth Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b555-6\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER concurs in the foregoing dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
