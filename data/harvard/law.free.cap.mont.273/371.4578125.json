(collectively, the Sportsmen) appeal from a Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, order granting the Montana Department Of State Lands\u2019 (DSL), Montana Board Of Land Commissioners\u2019, and George Madden\u2019s (Respondents) motion for summary judgment in a Montana Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) action. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Bighorn sheep (bighorn) are native to much of Montana but, with the settlement of the west, they were eliminated from most of their former ranges. In response to their diminished numbers, efforts have been made to reintroduce the bighorn to some of their former ranges. One such area is the Sula State Forest (Sula) and adjacent lands near the East Fork of the Bitterroot River. The presence of the bighorn adds ecological, aesthetic and economic values to the areas and communities adjacent to bighorn ranges. Along with its suitability as bighorn habitat, the Sula has a long history of livestock grazing. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>issue is an alleged conflict between the grazing of domestic sheep and the health and survival of the bighorn on the adjacent range.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Until the beginning of 1991, Ralph Shoberg maintained grazing permits with the DSL on trust lands within the Sula. Shoberg grazed cattle on his permit areas. In January 1991, Shoberg transferred his permits to George R. Madden (Madden). Madden subsequently changed from grazing cattle to grazing domestic sheep. A public controversy arose regarding Madden\u2019s grazing of domestic sheep upon trust lands because of the potential adverse affects on the bighorn. Evidence in the record suggests that mixing domestic sheep and bighorn can decimate the bighorn population through the spread of pneumonia and/or other diseases to the bighorn. On October 31, 1991, under the threat of a lawsuit, the DSL agreed to prepare an environmental review of the permits pursuant to MEPA. Prior to 1991, the DSL had not prepared an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS) on Madden\u2019s cattle grazing permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The DSL issued an EA on July 17, 1992 which included six alternatives. Appellants, private parties and state entities, submitted comments to the DSL about the EA. On September 30,1992, the DSL issued a revised EA. On December 30, 1992, DSL commissioner Dennis Casey issued a decision notice which ended the EA process and allowed Madden\u2019s grazing leases to remain in effect until 1999, the leases\u2019 existing renewal date. With the intent to reduce the threat of transferring disease from the domestic sheep to the bighorn, the decision notice required certain measures, such as sheep dogs and grazing dates. Because Casey approved the revised EA, MEPA requirements were satisfied and no EIS was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">On May 12, 1993, the Sportsmen filed the instant action in the District Court. On August 20, 1993, Respondents moved to dismiss the Sportsmen\u2019s claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On November 23,1993, the District Court stated that it intended to treat this motion as a Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., motion for summary judgment. On August 10,1994, the District Court granted Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all counts. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The Sportsmen present three issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">1. Did the District Court err in holding that the DSL complied with MEPA?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>2. Does the DSL have a fiduciary duty towards Montana\u2019s wildlife which, under the facts of the instant case, requires the protection of the bighorn by implementing license conditions to protect the bighorn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">3. Did the District Court improperly refuse to consider affidavits, exhibits, and depositions submitted by the Sportsmen in support of their claims that the DSL unlawfully and arbitrarily violated MEPA and its trust duties toward wildlife?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">We review summary judgment orders de novo. <em>Spain-Morrow Ranch Inc. v. West </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 441, 444, 872 P.2d 330, 331-32.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">Summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The initial burden is on the moving party to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact; and once met, the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion to establish otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\"><em>Spain-Morrow Ranch, </em>872 P.2d at 331-32 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">We review MEPA decisions to determine \u201cwhether the record establishes that the agency acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unlawfully.\u201d <em>North Fork Preservation Assoc. v. Dept. of State Lands </em>(1989), 238 Mont. 451, 458-59, 778 P.2d 862, 867. In <em>North Fork </em>we divided our review into two parts: Whether the agency acted unlawfully, and whether the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>North Fork, </em>778 P.2d at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">To evaluate the lawfulness of the DSL\u2019s actions, we look to the laws and regulations governing the DSL\u2019s MEPA review process. <em>North Fork, </em>778 P.2d at 867. We therefore review \u00a7\u00a7 75-1-101 et seq., MCA, and \u00a7\u00a7 26.2.641 et seq., ARM. Because MEPAis modeled after the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), when interpreting MEPA, we find federal case law persuasive. <em>Kadillak v. Anaconda Co. </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 127, 137, 602 P.2d 147, 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">NEPA requires that an agency take a \u201chard look\u201d at the environmental impacts of a given project or proposal. <em>See Kleppe v. Sierra Club </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 390, 410, n.21, 96 S.Ct. 2718, 2730, 49 L.Ed.2d 576, 590. NEPAis essentially procedural; it does not demand that an agency make particular substantive decisions. <em>Stryker\u2019s Bay Neighborhood Council v. Karlen </em>(1980), 444 U.S. 223, 227-28, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>S.Ct. 497, 499-500, 62 L.Ed.2d 433, 437. MEPA requires that an agency take procedural steps to review \u201cprojects, programs, legislation, and other major actions of state government significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\u201d in order to make informed decisions. Section 75-1-201(1)(b)(iii), MCA; <em>See </em>\u00a7 26.2.643, ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Both parties ask us to determine whether an environmental review document is necessary for the renewal or assignment of a grazing lease. Pursuant to \u00a7 77-6-205(1), MCA, a grazing lease holder:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">who has paid all rentals due the state or who has voluntarily terminated a lease under 77-6-116 is entitled to have the lease renewed for a period not to exceed the maximum lease period provided in 77-6-109 at any time within 30 days prior to its expiration or within 30 days following voluntary termination if no other applications for lease of the land have been received 30 days prior to the expiration of the lease or within 30 days following voluntary termination. The renewal must be at the full market rental rate established by the board [, taking into account recommendations of the state land board advisory council,] for the renewal period and subject to any other conditions at the time of the renewal imposed by law as terms of the lease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Section 77-6-208, MCA, provides for assignment of leases to state lands. The DSL rules regarding the general requirements of the environmental review process state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-7\">(5) The agency is not required to prepare an EA or an EIS for the following categories of action:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZm\">....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">(e) ministerial actions: actions in which the agency exercises no discretion, but rather acts upon a given state of facts in a prescribed manner ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Section 26.2.643(5), ARM. The Sportsmen correctly argue that the renewal and assignment of a lease, permit, license, etc., pursuant to \u00a7 26.2.642(1), ARM, involves state action. Generally, state action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment requires MEPA analysis. <em>See </em>\u00a7 75-1-201(1)(b)(iii), MCA. However, where a license renewal or assignment merely maintains the status quo we conclude that the renewal or assignment of a grazing lease pursuant to \u00a7 77-6-205(1), MCA, is a ministerial action that requires no environmental analysis. <em>See NRDC v. Berklund </em>(D.C. Cir. 1979), 609 F.2d 553, 558. Absent a change in use or condition which significantly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>affects the quality of the human environment, the renewal or assignment of a grazing lease or permit is generally a ministerial act and does not trigger MEPA analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">However, if a changed use or condition under a state lease or permit significantly affects the quality of the human environment, then the state\u2019s allowing that change in use or change in condition is a major state action pursuant to MEPA, triggering the MEPA review process. The United States Supreme Court has observed that \u201cmajor federal actions\u201d include the \u201cexpansion or revision of ongoing programs.\u201d <em>Andrus v. Sierra Club </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 347, 363 n.21, 99 S.Ct. 2335, 2344, 60 L.Ed.2d 943, 955; <em>citing </em>S. Rep. No. 91-296, p.20 (1969). \u201c[I]f an ongoing project undergoes changes which themselves amount to \u2018major Federal actions,\u2019the operating agency must prepare an EIS.\u201d <em>Upper Snake River Chapter of Trout Unlimited v. Hodel </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 921 F.2d 232, 234.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The DSL correctly argues that if an agency does not have an affirmative statutory duty to act, the failure to act does not trigger NEPA. <em>Defenders of Wildlife v. Andrus </em>(D.C. Cir. 1980), 627 F.2d 1238, 1248-50. However, if an agency\u2019s duty to avoid environmental harm is mandatory, then the agency\u2019s inaction constitutes an action for NEPA purposes. <em>See Sierra Club v. Hodel </em>(10th Cir. 1988), 848 F.2d 1068, 1090-91. Based on the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 77-6-201(2), -206 and -210, MCA, the DSL has the duty to manage agricultural, grazing, and other surface leased land to protect the best interests of the state, under the multiple use concept, which necessarily includes considering consequences to wildlife and the environment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 77-1-203, MCA. When the DSL is made aware of changes in the existing conditions or uses relating to an operation under a lease or permit, and those changes have the potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment, then the DSL must, pursuant to MEPA, evaluate those changes for significant impacts. In the instant case substantial questions remain as to what impact grazing domestic sheep will have on the bighorn population.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">The plaintiff need not show that significant effects <em>will in fact occur, </em>but if the plaintiff raises substantial questions whether a project may have a significant effect, an EIS <em>must </em>be prepared.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APU\"><em>LaFlamme v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission </em>(9th Cir. 1988), 852 F.2d 389, 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">Particularly in light of MEPA\u2019s statutory goal of promoting efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment, \u00a7 75-1-102, MCA, and the conflicting evidence in the record, the DSL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>failed to sufficiently explain and substantiate its December 30, 1992 decision to allow Madden to continue grazing sheep adjacent to the bighorn range without proceeding with an EIS. Further, it failed to sufficiently evaluate the significance of the impacts that domestic sheep would cause to the bighorn. Both the revised EA and the DSL\u2019s brief to this Court concede that the revised EA did not address the significance of impacts. An EIS must be prepared for state actions that significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Section 75-1-201(1)(b)(iii), MCA. \u201cIn order to implement [MEPA], the agency <em>shall determine the significance of impacts </em>associated with a proposed action.\u201d Section 26.2.644(1), ARM. The Sportsmen correctly point out that the DSL did not complete MEPA\u2019s mandatory \u201csignificant impacts\u201d analysis. Because the DSL did not in the first instance adequately determine and consider the significance of the impacts associated with grazing domestic sheep on lands adjacent to bighorn, the DSL acted arbitrarily and capriciously and unlawfully when it concluded that changes to Madden\u2019s grazing plan reduced the probable significant impact to the bighorn.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The District Court was incorrect in agreeing with the DSL that it was not required to engage in a significant impacts analysis on the theory that it was doing a voluntary as opposed to a mandatory EA. Based on our above holding, full compliance with MEPA is mandated in this case. Furthermore, we find no provisions in MEPA, the administrative rules, or case law providing for partial compliance with the law when compliance with the law is purportedly voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">We do not here decide whether grazing domestic sheep adjacent to the Sula bighorn range is appropriate or not, but rather, whether the DSL\u2019s environmental review was sufficient. In the instant case, given the potential adverse impact on the bighorn, the change from grazing cattle to grazing sheep altered the existing permit to such an extent that allowing the change constituted a major state action. Thus, MEPA was triggered by DSL\u2019s awareness of the change from grazing cattle to grazing sheep adjacent to bighorn range. <em>See Andrus, </em>442 U.S. at 363 n.21, 99 S.Ct. at 2344 n.21. Since the DSL failed to engage in a significant impacts analysis, the matter must be remanded for preparation of an EIS. <em>See Sierra Club v. U.S. Forest Service </em>(9th Cir. 1988), 843 F.2d 1190. In <em>Sierra Club, </em>the Forest Service decided not to prepare an EIS with regard to certain timber sales. The plaintiffs challenged that decision because the environmental assessment did not adequately discuss the relevant criteria in the federal regulations. The Ninth Circuit held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>standard for determining \u201cif an action will significantly affect the quality of the human environment is whether the plaintiff has alleged facts which, if true, show that the ... [action (or inaction)] may significantly degrade some human environmental factor.\u201d <em>Sierra Club, </em>843 F.2d at 1193; <em>quoting Foundation for North Am. Wild Sheep v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agriculture </em>(9th Cir. 1982), 681 F.2d 1172, 1177-78. \u201cA determination that significant effects on the human environment will in fact occur is not essential. ... If substantial questions are raised whether a project may have a significant effect upon the environment, an EIS must be prepared.\u201d <em>Id.; quoting Foundation, </em>681 F.2d at 1178. The <em>Sierra Club </em>court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">Because substantial questions have been raised concerning the potential adverse effects of harvesting these timber sales, an EIS should have been prepared.... The Forest Service\u2019s decision not to do so was unreasonable.... It failed to account for factors necessary to determine whether significant impacts would occur. Therefore its decision was not \u201cfully informed and well-considered.\u201d <em>[Friends of] Endangered Species [v. Jantzen], </em>[(9th Cir. 1985)] 760 F.2d [976], 986 (quoting <em>Vermont Yankee, [Nuclear Power v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. </em>(U.S. Dist. 1978)], 435 U.S. [519], at 558, 98 S.Ct. [1197], 1219). [Other citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><em>Sierra Club, </em>843 F.2d at 1195. Although the standard is now arbitrary and capricious rather than \u201creasonable,\u201d the Ninth Circuit\u2019s remedy of remanding for an EIS is still appropriate. The DSL\u2019s own records evidence the potential harm in changing from cattle to sheep in this particular area. Based on this record of conflicting evidence, substantial questions remain and the DSL must comply with the requirements of MEPA and complete an EIS. It must look further at the grazing license and grazing practices to determine the significance of allowing a change from grazing cattle to grazing sheep. Implicit in the requirement that an agency take a hard look at the environmental consequences of its actions is the obligation to make an adequate compilation of relevant information, to analyze it reasonably and, perhaps most importantly, not to ignore \u201cpertinent data.\u201d <em>See Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Engineers </em>(2nd Cir. 1982), 701 F.2d 1011, 1029. The DSL did not follow MEPA\u2019s implicit mandate that it take a hard look by completing a significant impacts analysis: The District Court therefore erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>It is particularly important that the DSL establish a full and complete record on review. The United States Supreme Court has addressed an agency\u2019s failure to create an adequate record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">If the record before the agency does not support the agency action, if the agency has not considered all relevant factors, or if the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Florida Power and Light Co. v. Lorion </em>(1985), 470 U.S. 729, 744, 105 S.Ct. 1598, 1607, 84 L.Ed.2d 643, 656. Along these lines, the <em>Hodel </em>court concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">[w]ithout an administrative record, courts are left to rationalize the agency\u2019s decision \u2014 a form of review which abandons standards in favor of predilections. \u201cThis kind of speculation regarding the basis for an agency\u2019s decision not to prepare an EIS is precisely what NEPA was intended to prevent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-7\"><em>Hodel, </em>848 F.2d at 1093; <em>quoting LaFlamme v. F.E.R.C. </em>(9th Cir. 1988), 842 F.2d 1063, 1070. Due to the lack of a proper significant impacts analysis, the record does not uphold the DSL\u2019s decision. The record essentially consists only of the revised EA and Decision Notice. This put the District Court in the untenable position of basing its review on a meager administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Madden suggests that if we adopt the Sportsmen\u2019s argument we will be imposing a requirement that a full EIS be completed \u201con every renewal and assignment of every license and lease of state land.\u201d We are not here imposing such a requirement with regard to lease renewals or assignments. Under the facts of this case, it is not the lease renewal or assignment that triggers MEPA analysis. Rather, it is the DLS\u2019s awareness of Madden\u2019s change of use from grazing cattle to grazing sheep adjacent to bighorn range in the face of evidence that such a change in use may adversely affect the bighorn. An EIS is required only when there is a substantial question as to whether the change of use may have a significant effect upon the human environment. We conclude that once the DSL became aware of this change in use, the DSL\u2019s allowing the change of use constituted a major governmental action and its duty to fully comply with MEPA was triggered. In the instant case, the DSL failed to satisfy its MEPA duties when it rendered a decision without adequately considering the significant impacts of its actions in accordance with \u00a7 75-1-201, MCA. MEPA does not require that agency actions not impact the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>human environment. MEPA <em>does </em>require that agencies assess their actions so as to make an informed decision. A corollary to an informed decision is public education and input.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Even after fully complying with MEPA procedure, an agency may determine that an action will result in significant impacts and then, nonetheless, approve the action under MEPA. The agency, however, is then accountable for its decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">An \u201cagency must supply a convincing statement of reasons why potential effects are insignificant.\u201d <em>The Steamboaters v. F.E.R.C. </em>[9th Cir. 1985], 759 F.2d [1382,] 1393. While it is true that mitigation measures can justify an agency\u2019s conclusions that a project\u2019s impact is not significant, an agency must explain exactly how the measures will mitigate the project\u2019s impact. <em>Id. </em>at 1394; <em>Jones v. Gordon, </em>[(9th Cir. 1986)], 792 F.2d [821], 829.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-6\"><em>LaFlamme, </em>852 F.2d at 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In the instant case, the DSL did not engage in \u201csignificance of impacts\u201d analysis. Accordingly it was unable to take the requisite hard look and it is impossible for this Court or the District Court to determine whether the adverse impacts have been compensated for or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Finally, the goal of maximizing income derived from school trust lands does not exempt the DSL or any agency from complying with applicable environmental laws. The DSL strenuously argues that its ability to modify the leases<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at issue is limited by its state land trust duty to maximize the income derived from trust lands. In addition, the Seeley Lake and Brady School Districts and the Montana Stockgrowers, Woolgrowers, and Bitterroot Stockgrowers Associations, filing as <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of the DSL, conclude that the state\u2019s trust obligation to secure the greatest dollar value for school trust lands is predominant. School trust lands need not be used exclusively for grazing or agriculture. <em>See </em>Title 77, Chapter 1, Part 4, \u00a7 77-6-209, and Title 77, Chapter 6, MCA. For instance, the Sportsmen suggest that there is precedent for the DSL and the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks to agree to a plan whereby a portion of Sula bighorn hunting permit fees could go to the school trust. This would generate funds for the school trust and, assuming such hunting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>is ecologically sound, protect the bighorn herd. Finally, we note that neither the DSL nor the <em>amicus curiae </em>suggest why or how domestic sheep grazing generates more money for the school trust than cattle grazing. The Sportsmen and the record (sparse as it is) suggest that alternative uses to grazing may increase the value earned for the trust. Income is \u201ca\u201d consideration \u2014 not \u201cthe\u201d consideration regarding school trust lands: Maximizing income is not paramount to the exclusion of wildlife or environmental considerations in the MEPA context. Sections 75-1-102, -103, and -105, MCA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\">[i]t is the continuing responsibility of the state of Montana to use all practicable means consistent with other essential considerations of state policy to improve and coordinate state plans, functions, programs, and resources to the end that the state may: (a) fulfill the responsibilities of each generation <em>as trustee of the environment </em>for succeeding generations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Section 75-1-103(2), MCA (emphasis added). The DSL, and not this Court, is in the best position to consider alternatives as part of its MEPA analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">MEPA requires that an agency be informed when it balances preservation against utilization of our natural resources and trust lands. The DSL may not, as here, reach a decision without first engaging in the requisite significant impacts analysis. The record in its present form, convinces us that the DSL by not first conducting an appropriate analysis under MEPA, arbitrarily, capriciously and unlawfully allowed Madden to change use from grazing cattle to grazing sheep adjacent to bighorn range. Therefore, we conclude that the DSL must complete an EIS to comprehensively review the environmental impacts resulting from this change of use adjacent to bighorn range.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Because of our holding in this issue, we need not consider issues two and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">Reversed and remanded to the District Court for an order requiring preparation of an EIS.</p>\n<judges id=\"b408-9\">JUSTICES HUNT, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\">. The real issue here is not whether the DSL can modify a lease but rather can the DSL, without conducting a significant impacts analysis, allow a lessee to unilaterally change the use from cattle to sheep adjacent to bighorn range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"Aaj\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AzK\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">I must respectfully dissent from most of the Corut\u2019s opinion and from the result it reaches. My main problems with the opinion are its overbreadth and its lack of clarity concerning which MEPA statutes or regulations the Court determines DSL actually violated here. If the Court made even a passing analysis of Montana law in resolving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>this case in favor of appellants, I undoubtedly would join in the opinion; I cannot do so as the opinion is written.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">I agree that the standard of review of the MEPA decision at issue in this case is the \u201cunlawful or arbitrary and capricious\u201d standard set forth in <em>North Fork. </em>Unfortunately, the Court does not clearly apply that standard in resolving this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">I also agree that, in <em>Kadillak, </em>we stated that it was appropriate to look to federal interpretations of NEPAin interpreting MEPA. However, nothing in <em>Kadillak </em>or any other source authorizes this Court to dispense altogether with applying Montana law and merely apply broad statements from selected federal cases to the factual scenario before us without any discussion of how and why those statements are applicable here. The result of this approach by the Court is a lack of analysis regarding which particular provisions of MEPA and the controlling regulations have been violated and a total lack of guidance to state agencies attempting to comply with the critically important MEPA and to state courts attempting to ensure such compliance. I cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The lack of specificity in the opinion makes it difficult to craft an appropriate dissent. Thus, I offer only the following concerns and questions about the authorities on which the Court relies in resolving this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The Court\u2019s primary thesis about MEPA appears early in \u2014 and permeates \u2014 its opinion. According to the Court, the guiding premise of MEPA is that \u201c[generally, state action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment requires MEPA analysis.\u201d Section 75-1-201(1)(b)(iii), MCA, is cited for this proposition. The problem with the Court\u2019s approach is that \u201cgeneralizing\u201d about this pivotal statute is both misleading and erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The statute actually says that, \u201cto the fullest extent possible!,] ... all agencies of the state ... shall include in every recommendation or report on proposals for projects, legislation, and other major actions of state government significantly affecting the quality of the human environment\u201d a detailed statement regarding environmental impacts and effects. Section 75-1-201(1)(b)(iii), MCA. The Court does not analyze the meaning of \u201cto the fullest extent possible.\u201d More importantly, nowhere does the Court establish that any \u201crecommendation or report on a proposal\u201d for a major action of state government is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Most important of all, the Court never bothers to apply the definition of \u201caction,\u201d vis-a-vis \u00a7 75-1-201(1)(b)(iii), MCA, which is found in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\u00a7 26.2.642(1), ARM, to DSL\u2019s \u201callowing\u201d of a change of use after a grazing permit is in place and the change of use has occurred. An \u201caction,\u201d insofar as it is relevant here, is \u201ca project or activity involving the issuance of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use or permission to act\u201d by the agency. Section 26.2.642(1), ARM. As the Court concedes, no activity involving the issuance of a lease is at issue here. Thus, this straightforward definition simply does not support the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cif a changed use or condition ... significantly affects the quality of the human environment, then the state\u2019s allowing that change in use or change in condition is a major state action pursuant to MEPA, triggering the MEPAreview process.\u201d Nor does the Court provide any other support \u2014 under MEPA or otherwise \u2014 for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Instead, the Court cites to one United States Supreme Court case and one Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals case which it apparently believes support its conclusion. Neither case does so even through the broad language quoted, much less through an actual application of those cases to the facts presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">It is true that in <em>Andrus v. Sierra Club </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 347, 99 S.Ct. 2335, 60 L.Ed.2d 943, the United States Supreme Court observed that major federal actions include the \u201cexpansion or revision of ongoing programs;\u201d it did so in the context of resolving the issue of whether appropriation requests constitute \u201cproposals for major federal actions\u201d under NEPA. It concluded that appropriation requests were requests to fund action already proposed, rather than proposals for major government actions to be taken in the future. <em>Sierra Club, </em>442 U.S. at 361-63, 99 S.Ct. at 2343. <em>Sierra Club </em>has no direct applicability here; it leaves unanswered, as does this Court, the specific question of what constitutes an expansion or revision of an ongoing program. <em>Sierra Club </em>does point out, however, that the \u201cproposal\u201d language in NEPA \u2014 like that in MEPA \u2014 is intended to have some meaning, a meaning never addressed by this Court in the present case. Indeed, this Court\u2019s purpose in quoting from <em>Sierra Club </em>\u2014 other than to insert broad and inapposite language \u2014 remains a mystery.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Similarly, the Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Upper Snake River Chapter of Trout Unlimited v. Hodel </em>(9th Cir. 1990), 921 F.2d 232, is misplaced. While that opinion does state that \u201cif an ongoing project undergoes changes which themselves amount to \u2018major Federal actions,\u2019 the operating agency must prepare an EIS,\u201d the Ninth Circuit was referring to the definition of \u201cmajor Federal action\u201d contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>NEPA. Whatever the definition under NEPA, the case before us is governed initially by the specific definition of \u201caction\u201d contained in \u00a7 26.2.642, ARM. Even accepting the Ninth Circuit\u2019s broad language, however, this Court does not apply the quoted language to the facts before us. It does not specify <em>how, </em>in this case, a change in an ongoing project exists, much less how such a change amounts to state action as \u201caction\u201d is defined in \u00a7 26.2.642(1), ARM, or to \u201cmajor\u201d state actions as the term is used in \u00a7 75-1-201(1)(b)(iii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Moreover, I note that in <em>Upper Snake River, </em>the Ninth Circuit concluded, applying the NEPA definitions, that the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s reduction of the flow of water from the Palisades Dam on the South Fork of the Snake River in Idaho was <em>not </em>a major federal action. <em>Upper Snake River, </em>921 F.2d at 234. It reached that conclusion in advance of any consideration of whether the action at issue had a significant effect on the environment and, indeed, declined to reach the \u201csignificant effect\u201d issue \u201cbecause the reduction does not constitute a \u2018major Federal action\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Upper Snake River, </em>921 F.2d at 234. Thus, to the extent <em>Upper Snake River </em>has any application here, it clarifies that a court must <em>first </em>determine whether the action at issue comes within the controlling definitions of \u201cmajor action;\u201d only when that question is answered in the affirmative may the court proceed to questions involving the significance of any impacts or effects from the action at issue. In the case before us, the Court essentially turns the questions around and becomes mired in the \u201csignificance\u201d questions prior to having applied the controlling definitions to determine whether the \u201caction\u201d at issue triggers MEPA analysis at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Finally, with regard to <em>Upper Snake River, </em>I reiterate that the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Bureau of Reclamation\u2019s substantial reduction in water flow from the Palisades Dam did not constitute a major federal action under NEPA. How, then, even assuming identical controlling definitions, can DSL\u2019s \u201cnonaction\u201d in this case constitute a major action of state government? The Court does not explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Court notes its agreement with DSL\u2019s argument that, if an agency does not have an affirmative duty to act, the failure to act does not trigger NEPA or, presumably, MEPA. It then quotes from <em>Sierra Club v. Hodel </em>(10th Cir. 1988), 848 F.2d 1068, for the proposition that \u201cif an agency\u2019s duty to avoid environmental harm is mandatory, then the agency\u2019s inaction constitutes an action for NEPA purposes.\u201d The Court does not explain how the case relates to the situation before us <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>and it is my view that the case is, like those referenced above, inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">In <em>Sierra Club, </em>the agency\u2019s mandatory environmental duty did not spring from NEPA itself. There, the Tenth Circuit determined that the Secretary\u2019s nondegradation duty toward wilderness study areas was mandatory under the Federal Land Policy Management Act of 1976. <em>Sierra Club, </em>848 F.2d at 1075. In addition, the court determined that, even if the Secretary\u2019s activity amounted to \u201cnonaction\u201d under the language of NEPA \u00a7 102(2)(c), requiring an EIS in advance of \u201cmajor Federal actions,\u201d a Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulation specifically made the Secretary\u2019s failure to act a \u201cmajor federal action\u201d for NEPA purposes. <em>Sierra Club, </em>848 F.2d at 1091.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">No regulation corresponding to the CEQ regulation at issue in <em>Sierra Club </em>\u2014 which made the \u201cnonaction\u201d a major federal action triggering NEPA \u2014 is involved in this case. Thus, I cannot see how <em>Sierra Club </em>has any application here or how it supports in any way the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[w]hen the DSL is made aware of changes in the existing conditions or uses relating to a lease or permit, and those changes have the potential to significantly affect the quality of the human environment, then the DSL must, pursuant to MEPA, evaluate those changes for significant impacts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Under the Court\u2019s decision in this case, what are state agencies or district courts to make of the clear thrust of the regulations implementing MEPA which focus on MEPA being triggered for \u201cproposed actions\u201d? \"What, for example, is the meaning of \u00a7 26.2.641, ARM, captioned <em>Policy Statement Concerning MEPA Rules, </em>which states that in order to fulfill the statutorily-stated purpose of MEPA, agencies must conform to the rules at \u00a7\u00a7 26.2.642 et seq., ARM, \u201cprior to reaching a final decision on <em>proposed actions </em>covered by MEPA\u201d? Or the definition of an EA at \u00a7 26.2.642(9), ARM, as an analysis of a <em>\u201cproposed </em>action to determine whether an EIS is required\u201d or to serve one of the other purposes described in \u00a7 26.2.643(2), ARM? Or the general requirements of the environmental review process set forth in \u00a7 26.2.643, ARM, which repeatedly specify \u201cproposed action\u201d? Or, critically, the requirement in \u00a7 26.2.644, ARM, setting forth the criteria to be used in determining \u201cthe significance of impacts associated with a <em>proposed </em>action.\u201d How and when does a nonaction or a nondecision after a change of use in a state grazing permit come within the \u201cproposed action\u201d language which permeates the controlling regulations and the legislative policy statement in \u00a7 75-1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>201(1)(b)(iii), MCA? The Court never explains, and I submit that the Court\u2019s decision today provides state agencies with no basis for evaluating when, under MEPA and the controlling regulations, MEPA will be triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Finally, I feel compelled to comment on the ease with which the Court concludes not only that MEPA was triggered, but also that an EIS must be prepared. Again, the Court relies for its conclusion on broad statements from United States Courts of Appeal decisions holding that an EIS is required whenever a person alleges facts which, if true, show that the action/inaction \u201cmay\u201d significantly degrade some human environmental factor. Again, no Montana statutes or regulations are cited or applied. Specifically, for example, the Court does not explain how the cases upon which it relies square with the clear language in \u00a7 75-1-201, MCA, that a detailed environmental statement is required for proposals for major state actions <em>\u201csignificantly affecting </em>the quality of the human environment.\u201d Nor does it address in any way the criteria set forth in \u00a7 26.2.643, ARM, for when a state agency must prepare an EIS, in particular the mandate that an EIS is required when \u201cthe proposed action is a major action of state government <em>significantly affecting </em>the quality of the human environment.\u201d Section 26.2.643(1)(b), ARM. How does the \u201csignificantly affecting\u201d language in the Montana statute and regulation support the Court\u2019s conclusion that an EIS is required whenever an action (or, according to the Court, inaction) <em>may </em>significantly affect the environment? Are state agencies to totally disregard MEPA statutes and regulations hereafter? The Court does not explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">I close by restating here what I stated at the outset: the troubling aspects of the Court\u2019s opinion in this case are its lack of analysis of Montana statutes and regulations and the resulting lack of guidance for all concerned in these important matters involving our cherished environment. If a case <em>can </em>be made under MEPA for the Court\u2019s decision here, the Court has not made it. For that reason, I cannot join in the Court\u2019s opinion. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b413-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in the foregoing dissent of JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
