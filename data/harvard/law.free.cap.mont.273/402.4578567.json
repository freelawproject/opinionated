The District Court for the First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Judicial District, Lewis and Clark County, granted summary judgment in favor of Dagel. Farmers appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Did the District Court err in determining that Dagel was not required to exhaust the policy limits for uninsured motorist coverage of the insurance policy on the vehicle she was operating prior to making a claim for benefits under her own policy\u2019s uninsured motorist provision?</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Background Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">On January 18,1990, Dagel was involved in a two-vehicle accident in Helena, Montana. The car Dagel was driving was struck from behind by another vehicle after Dagel stopped to allow a pedestrian to cross the street. It was later determined that the vehicle that struck Dagel and the vehicle\u2019s driver were uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Northern Ford, the owner of the car driven by Dagel, was covered by an insurance policy issued by Employer\u2019s Mutual Companies (Mutual). This policy included uninsured motorist coverage with a policy limit of $50,000. Dagel asserted a claim against Mutual under the uninsured motorist provision of Mutual\u2019s policy. Eventually, a settlement was negotiated between Dagel and Mutual in the amount of $30,000; $20,000 less than the available policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">At the time of the accident, Dagel had a motor vehicle insurance policy with Farmers. The policy included uninsured motorist coverage, with a policy limit of $100,000. Dagel asserted a claim against Farmers, seeking the benefits of the uninsured motorist provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">On February 18, 1994, Farmers filed a motion seeking summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. Farmers contended that because Dagel settled for less than the limits for uninsured motorist coverage on the policy issued by Mutual, Dagel could not recover under the uninsured motorist provision of the policy issued by Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Farmers cited the following language from the uninsured motorist portion of Farmers\u2019 policy to support its claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">We will pay under this coverage only after the limits of liability under any applicable bodily injury liability bonds or policies have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amj\">Farmers contended that this language prohibited payment of benefits to Dagel under the uninsured motorist provision of the policy issued to Dagel by Farmers because Dagel did not \u201cexhaust\u201d the limits of the uninsured motorist coverage of the Mutual policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>On March 1, 1994, Dagel filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on the issue of Farmers\u2019 liability under its policy. Oral arguments were heard on June 24, 1994. On September 9, 1994, the District Court issued its Order on Motions for Summary Judgment denying Farmers\u2019 motion and granting Dagel\u2019s cross-motion on the issue of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Farmers subsequently filed a Motion for Clarification regarding the computation of damages and the District Court issued its Order on Motion for Clarification on December 8, 1994. Farmers appeals both orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Our standard in reviewing a grant of summary judgment is the same as that initially utilized by the district court. <em>Youngblood v. American States Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 391, 394, 866 P.2d 203, 204 (citing <em>McCracken v. City of Chinook </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 21, 24, 788 P.2d 892, 894). Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>Youngblood, </em>866 P.2d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">In Montana, the interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 354, 356, 849 P.2d 190, 192 (citing <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Waller </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 328, 331, 828 P.2d 1384, 1386). We review district court conclusions of law to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Nimmick v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 315, 318, 891 P.2d 1154, 1156 (citing <em>Steer, Inc. v. Department of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Did the District Court err in determining that Dagel was not required to exhaust the policy limits for uninsured motorist coverage of the insurance policy on the vehicle she was operating prior to making a claim for benefits under her own policy\u2019s uninsured motorist provision?</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Montana\u2019s uninsured motorist statute, \u00a7 33-23-201, MCA, bases payment of uninsured motorist benefits on two conditions: (1) the claimant is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of the uninsured vehicle; and (2) the driver of the vehicle is uninsured. <em>Hubbel v. Western Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 21, 23, 706 P.2d 111, 112 (citing <em>Oleson v. Farmers Insurance Group </em>(1980), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>185 Mont. 164, 166, 605 P.2d 166, 167). The language \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d means that the insured must have a cause of action against the tort-feasor and must be able to establish fault and the existence of damages. <em>State Farm v. Estate of Braun </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 125, 128, 793 P.2d 253, 254. The basic purpose of the uninsured motorist statute is to provide protection for the automobile insurance policyholder against the risk of inadequate compensation for injuries or death caused by the negligence of financially irresponsible motorists. <em>Hubbel, </em>706 P.2d at 113 <em>(citing Sullivan v. Doe </em>(1972), 159 Mont. 50, 60, 495 P.2d 193, 198). We have previously stated that this Court does not support provisions placed on uninsured motorist coverage which restrict or thwart available liability coverage that the insured would be entitled to in an accident. <em>Guiberson v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 279, 289, 704 P.2d 68, 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Farmers admits that if Dagel had exhausted coverage on the Mutual policy, there would be no question that the uninsured motorist coverage provided by the Farmers\u2019 policy would be available to Dagel. Farmers contends that the uninsured motorist coverage under Farmers\u2019 policy was unavailable to Dagel because Dagel settled with Mutual for an amount less than the available liability limits under Mutual\u2019s policy. Dagel did not \u201cexhaust\u201d Mutual\u2019s policy limits as required by Farmers\u2019 policy. We do not address Farmers\u2019 contention that Mutual\u2019s policy is \u201cprimary\u201d and Farmers\u2019 policy is \u201cexcess,\u201d as we find the interpretation of the exhaustion clause to be the dispositive issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Dagel contends that the exhaustion clause in Farmers\u2019 policy is unenforceable here because of the language of the clause itself. The clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">We will pay under this coverage only after the limits of liability under <em>any applicable bodily injury liability bonds or policies </em>have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Dagel argues that the only possible claim she could have made against a bodily injury liability policy would have been against one held by the driver of the other vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">We find Dagel\u2019s argument persuasive. In this case there was no other bodily injury liability policy in effect that applied to Dagel\u2019s injuries because the driver of the other vehicle was uninsured. In interpreting insurance contracts, the words of the policy are to be understood in their usual meaning; common sense controls. <em>Duensing v. Traveler\u2019s Companies </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 376, 381, 849 P.2d 203, 206 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>(citing <em>James v. Prudential Ins. Co. </em>(1957), 131 Mont. 473, 477, 312 P.2d 125, 127).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">The Farmers\u2019 policy defines an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as one which is \u201cnot insured by a bodily injury liability bond or policy at the time of the accident.\u201d Accordingly, under Farmers\u2019 own definition, since the vehicle that injured Dagel was uninsured, there was no bodily injury liability bond or policy applicable to Dagel\u2019s injuries at the time of the accident. Exclusions and words of limitation in a policy must be strictly construed against the insurer. <em>Leibrand v. Nat. Farmers Union </em>(1995), [272 Mont. 1], 898 P.2d 1220, 1223, (citing <em>Bauer Ranch, Inc. v. Mountain West Farm Bureau </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 153, 156, 695 P.2d 1307, 1309).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the District Court correctly determined that the exhaustion clause in the Farmers\u2019 policy was inapplicable in the present case and that Dagel is entitled to recover under the uninsured motorist provision of the Farmers\u2019 policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Since neither party argued either for or against the District Court\u2019s determination of the portion of damages to be allocated to Farmers, we have not and will not address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
