Because Lyons\u2019 motion did not assert a defect in the collateral review process itself, but rather directly attacked his conviction and sentence, it did not constitute a true Rule 60(b) motion under our decision in <em>United States v. Winestock, </em>340 F.3d 200, 207 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 995, 124 S.Ct. 496, 157 L.Ed.2d 395 (2003). To appeal an order denying a Rule 60(b) motion in a habeas action, Lyons must establish entitlement to a certificate of appealability. <em>See Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 368 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Lyons has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-12\">To the extent Lyons\u2019 notice of appeal and informal brief could be construed as a motion for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we deny such authorization. <em>Winestock, </em>340 F.3d at 208. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
