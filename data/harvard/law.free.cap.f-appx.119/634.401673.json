He asserts that Lieutenant Thomas used excessive force against him by pushing him into a filing cabinet, resulting in a bruise on his thigh, which did not require medical treatment, although he was given ibuprofen. Valentine has not established that he suffered an injury that was more than de minimis. <em>See Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992); <em>Gomez v. Chandler, </em>163 F.3d 921, 924 (5th Cir.1999). The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this claim. <em>See Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Valentine does not argue on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his claims against the defendants not physically present for the assault or in refusing to consider his state law claims of assault. These claims area therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). The judgment of the district court is thus AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b660-7\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
