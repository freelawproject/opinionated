The district court ordered that the sentence run consecutive to an anticipated but not yet imposed sentence for revocation of supervised release. Rodriguez argues that the district court lacked authority to order a consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Although the Government argues that the case is moot because the revocation sentence was ordered to run consecutive to the sentence challenged here, we are not convinced that we cannot even theoretically grant relief. <em>See Vieux Carre Property Owners v. Brown, </em>948 F.2d 1436, 1446 (5th Cir.1991). We ordinarily review a district court\u2019s decision to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Lynch, </em>378 F.3d 445, 447 (5th Cir.2004). Because Rodriguez did not object to the consecutive sentence in the district court, however, we review for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1994)(en banc). Under our precedent, which Rodriguez acknowledges, the district court\u2019s consecutive sentence did not constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
