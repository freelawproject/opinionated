Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2003); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii). We will uphold the finding that an alien is not eligible for asylum if that finding is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). The substantial evidence standard requires that the IJ\u2019s decision be based on the record evidence and that the decision be substantially reasonable. <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996). Under this standard, the IJ\u2019s determination will be affirmed unless the \u201cevidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Chamorro asserted in his application and in hearing testimony that since 1994 he and his family had been threatened, both with death and other harm, by Sandinista party officials. Starting in 1980 when he was 16 years old, Fredy Chamorro worked for the Sandinista party in various capacities until 1994. In 1994, certain Sandinista officials allegedly began threatening to kill or harm Fredy unless he lent his expertise in videotaping and other skills to help the party with various political intrigues. Aside from these threats, Fredy has not alleged that any harm has been done to him or his family. The IJ determined that Chamorro had established neither \u201cpast persecution\u201d nor a \u201cwell-founded fear of future persecution,\u201d because the threats, standing alone, did not amount to persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">After reviewing the record and the briefs, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the record evidence does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See Carbajal-Gonzalez, </em>78 F.3d at 197. The unfulfilled threats by themselves were insufficient to establish persecution. <em>See, e.g., Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Fesseha v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2003); <em>him v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000). The evidence submitted was also insufficient to support the granting of relief under the CAT. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906-907 (5th Cir.2002). By failing to brief any argument concerning the denial of withholding of removal, Chamorro has abandoned any claim regarding that denial. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
