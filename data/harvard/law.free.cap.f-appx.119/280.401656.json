USPS, </em>No. CH-0752020701-I-1, 2004 WL 601696 (M.S.P.B. Mar.18, 2004). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-19\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b306-20\">Daniels was employed by the USPS as a letter carrier. In 1997, he injured his right knee at work and received benefits from the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d). He returned to USPS employment in May 1999, in a limited duty position with carrier duties and clerk craft duties. In August 2000, he accepted a schedule award and thereafter, in June 2001, Daniels ceased receiving compensation from OWCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-21\">In November 2001, the USPS sought to reassign Daniels to a modified position consisting of only clerk craft duties. The agency offered Daniels this new position in a letter dated November 13, 2001. Daniels refused to even read this letter. He complained that the modified position had not been certified by the OWCP as within his physical limitations. USPS then sought an OWCP ruling on the suitability of the modified position. OWCP refused to make any ruling on suitability, stating that, because Daniels was no longer in receipt of compensation, it was OWCP policy not to make suitability determinations in such circumstances. (Resp\u2019t App. at 41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b306-22\">After OWCP\u2019s refusal to rule on the suitability of the modified position, the USPS again offered Daniels the modified position on December 5, 2001. The USPS advised Daniels that, if he did not accept the modified position, he could either take annual leave or leave without pay, but he could no longer continue his prior assignment. Daniels elected to take leave without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>In the meantime, Daniels filed a notice of recurrence with the OWCP on November 16, 2001, claiming that he had to seek treatment for his left knee. OWCP denied his claim for compensation, finding that there was no evidence either of a recurrent disability or of any causal relationship between Daniels\u2019 claimed disability and the prior injury to his right knee. This OWCP determination was made on March 18, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The USPS then issued a letter on March 26, 2002, instructing Daniels \u201cto immediately report to work, accepting the job offer that was presented ... in November 2001, or provide ... acceptable medical documentation\u201d to substantiate his absence. (Resp\u2019t App. at 34 (emphasis omitted).) The USPS further warned that failure to comply would result in Daniels being charged as being absent without official leave (\u201cAWOL\u201d) and action would be taken to remove him from the USPS. Daniels failed to respond to this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The agency thereafter, on May 28, 2002, proposed Daniels\u2019 removal on a charge of being AWOL. Daniels did not make any written reply to the proposed removal but met with the deciding official, where he stated his continued refusal to accept the modified position until his claims had been adjudicated by the OWCP. The deciding official found that Daniels had no pending claims before OWCP, that he was AWOL, and that his removal promoted the efficiency of the service. The removal therefore became effective on July 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Daniels appealed his removal to the Board. The administrative judge found that Daniels had been AWOL; that his removal promoted the efficiency of the service; and that the penalty was reasonable. The administrative judge also dismissed Daniels\u2019 claim that he was not obliged to accept the modified position until a OWCP suitability determination had been made, finding that the agency had no obligation to clear the assignment of new duties with OWCP after Daniels accepted the schedule award. (Resp\u2019t App. at 9.) The administrative judge therefore upheld the removal. The full Board affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Daniels petitions for review in this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The Board\u2019s decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Carreon v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>321 F.3d 1128, 1130 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">The core of Daniels\u2019 argument is that the agency never secured an OWCP ruling on the suitability of the modified position, and that he could not be compelled to accept the modified position without such a ruling. In effect, Daniels is arguing that he was separated because of compensable injury and that he is being deprived of his restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8151.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">We held in <em>New v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1259, 1265 (Fed.Cir.1998), that \u201cwhen an agency removes an employee who has a compensable injury solely for refusal to return to work in the absence of a suitability determination by the OWCP, a sufficient nexus exists between the compensable injury\u201d to give the employee restoration rights. However, \u201c[s]uch nexus ... depends upon the employee\u2019s continuing compensable injury at the time of ... removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once the employee ceases receiving compensation, OWCP no longer has any role to play. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Thereafter, for an employee to prove that he was discharged because of compensable injury, the employee must establish the unsuitability of the offered position through medical evidence. <em>See Walley v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>279 F.3d 1010, 1018-20 (Fed.Cir.2002) (employee bears burden of proving that absence was due to compensable injury). Daniels has not presented any evidence that the position was unsuitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Daniels argues that there were a number of procedural defects in his removal. We conclude that none of his contentions has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Daniels contends that the decision on proposed removal erroneously stated that: \u201cAccording to the Office of Workers Compensation the job offer presented to you was within your restrictions.\u201d (Resp\u2019t App. at 22.) Any error by the agency in making the quoted statement is irrelevant. As explained above, because Daniels was no longer receiving compensation, there was no need for any OWCP suitability determination to effect his removal. Rather, as the Board found, the agency needed only show that Daniels was absent as charged and that the decision to deny leave was appropriate. (Resp\u2019t App. at 8.) The Board found both elements proved, and its finding is supported by substantial evidence. There is no basis to disturb the Board\u2019s decision in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Daniels also contends that the Board found two different dates for his alleged absence. He points out that the administrative judge found \u201cthe agency charged [Daniels] with AWOL for each day he was absent from April 7, 2002 to the date of the proposal notice, May 28, 2002,\u201d but then concluded that \u201cthe agency appropriately charged him with AWOL from April 7 to June 28, 2002.\u201d (Resp\u2019t App. at 8-9.) Though the seeming confusion in the Board\u2019s findings is regrettable, it is also irrelevant. Daniels cannot point to a different result whether his AWOL period ended on May 28 or June 28. The Board found that the removal was reasonable compared to other employees who were removed for being AWOL for two weeks, nineteen days, or twenty days. The Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Lastly, Daniels argues that the agency\u2019s refusal to allow him to continue his old assignment after December 5, 2001, constituted a constructive suspension that would have permitted him to appeal to the Board. This argument has no significance since no such appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
