INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) over the petition insofar as it concerns petitioners\u2019 claims for withholding of removal and relief under CAT. <em>Id. </em>at 816. \u201cWhere, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision while adding its own reasons, we review both decisions.\u201d <em>Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.2000). We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 816, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s finding that Wahyuni did not establish that she and her family were more likely than <em>not to suffer </em>persecution upon their return to Indonesia. <em>See Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001). The three isolated incidents that occurred against Wahyuni and her family during a one week period in March 1995, although unfortunate, are not so overwhelming as to compel a finding of past persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that minor abuse during four to six hour detention did not compel finding of past persecution). Moreover, the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the incidents were isolated criminal misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Wahyuni\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 966 (9th Cir.2002) (requiring that petitioner establish that he is in danger of torture \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity\u201d) (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), petitioners\u2019 motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, as of the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b113-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
