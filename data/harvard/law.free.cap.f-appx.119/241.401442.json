R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1.9(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Andrew Sean Leahy, a state prisoner at the Sterling Correctional Facility in Sterling, Colorado, filed a \u00a7 1983 action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on December 11, 2003, alleging Dr. McCallon of the Buena Vista Correctional Facility violated his Eighth Amendment rights by acting with deliberate indifference toward his medical needs while he was in Dr. McCallon\u2019s care in September, 2001. On February 24, 2004, the magistrate judge, to whom the matter had been referred, ordered Leahy to file an amended complaint in order to (1) clearly and concisely set forth his claims and (2) demonstrate he exhausted his administrative remedies for each claim asserted. On March 25, 2004, Leahy filed his amended complaint. On April 16, 2004, the district court dismissed Leahy\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Specifically, the court concluded Leahy waited more than two years before filing a grievance against Dr. McCallon, well beyond the thirty days allotted for filing a grievance with corrections officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Leahy then filed a notice of appeal from the decision dismissing his complaint and an application to take his appeal in forma pauperis. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915; Fed. R.App. P. 24. On July 6, 2004, the district court certified the appeal was not taken in good faith because Leahy had \u201cnot shown the existence of a reasoned, non-frivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d (R. Doc. 16.) Therefore, it denied the application to proceed in forma pauperis. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3) (\u201cAn appeal may not be taken in forma pauperis if the trial court certifies in writing that it is not taken in good faith.\u201d). Leahy renews his application for leave to proceed in forma pauperis in this court and also seeks appointment of counsel. Reviewing de novo a district court\u2019s finding of failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), <em>Jernigan, v. Stuchell, </em>304 F.3d 1030, 1032 (10th Cir.2002), and exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">Having reviewed Leahy\u2019s opening brief, we, like the district court, cannot discern a reasoned, non-frivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues he raises on appeal. We are at a loss as to why we should excuse Leahy\u2019s complete lack of diligence in filing a grievance against Dr. McCallon (or any other corrections official) given his allegation he suffered a serious injury requiring surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the district court dismissing Leahy\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>plaint. We DENY Leahy\u2019s application to proceed in forma pauperis and motion for appointment of counsel. Leahy is ordered to pay the full appellate filing fee within twenty (20) days of this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders; nevertheless, an order may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-17\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (civil rights action against state actor).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
