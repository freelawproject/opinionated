Our jurisdiction over this appeal is pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the reasons stated below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In January 2001, the Defense Logistics Agency posted a job announcement for a GS-13 Supervisory General Engineer. The then-holder of the position, Frank Sullivan, interviewed three applicants who had been determined to be qualified for the job: Parks, a 40-year-old female civil engineer; Rob Montefour, a 34-year-old male electrical engineer; and George Kruger, a 52-year-old male architect. After interviewing the candidates, Sullivan found that Parks had the most management training, that all three were relatively equal in experience, but that Montefour\u2019s leadership and management skills were superior. Sullivan determined that Montefour and Parks were very close, which led to the decision \u201cboil[ing] into personality and the ability to deal with a staff to get the job done.\u201d App. at 377. Because of this, Sullivan determined that Montefour had the best mix of professional qualifications and management skills (despite Parks\u2019 greater management training) and thus promoted Montefour.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Parks then filed suit claiming that the hiring of Montefour over her was based on sex and/or age discrimination. Specifically, Parks contended that Sullivan\u2019s reliance on \u201cpersonality\u201d was a code word for age or sex discrimination and that she is in all measures objectively more qualified due to longer tenure and more management training. Rumsfeld moved for summary judgment, and the district court granted the motion. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Mercy Catholic Med. Ctr. v. Thompson, </em>380 F.3d 142, 151 (3d Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Big Apple BMW, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., </em>974 F.2d 1358, 1363 (3d Cir.1992). If the movant can show that there is no issue as to any material fact, the non-movant must \u201cset forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\"><em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), sets forth the burden-shifting framework for Title VII and ADEA claims. First, the plaintiff must develop a prima facie case. <em>Shaner v. Synthes, </em>204 F.3d 494, 500 (3d Cir.2000). Second, if the plaintiff proffers such a case, the burden shifts to the defendant to \u201c \u2018articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u2019 \u201d for the employment decision in question. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802). Third, upon the showing of a nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff must show the offered reason was a pretext for discrimination. <em>Id. </em>The parties assumed that Parks could make out a prima facie case, and that the contention that \u201cpersonality\u201d was the determining factor is a nondiscriminatory reason for the hiring. This case, therefore, turns on the third stage\u2014 pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">This Court has recognized two ways in which a plaintiff can prove pretext. First, the plaintiff can present evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u201ccasts sufficient doubt upon each of the legitimate reasons proffered by the defendant so that a factfinder could reasonably conclude that each reason was a fabrication.\u201d <em>Fuentes v. Perskie, </em>32 F.3d 759, 762 (3d Cir.1994). Second, and alternatively, the plaintiff can provide evidence that \u201callows the factfinder to infer that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Under the first prong \u2014 creating sufficient doubt as to the proffered rationale\u2014 this Court has explained that it is not enough to show that the employment decision was incorrect because the intelligence of the employer is not the issue. <em>Keller v. Orix Credit Alliance, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1101, 1108 (3d Cir.1997) (en banc). \u201cRather, the nonmoving plaintiff must demonstrate such weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons for its actions that a reasonable fact-finder could rationally find them unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1108-09. \u201cIn simpler terms, [the plaintiff] must show, not merely that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was wrong, but that it was so plainly wrong that it cannot have been the employer\u2019s real reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109. This is a stringent standard for plaintiffs because \u201c \u2018federal courts are not arbitral boards ruling on the strength of [the employment decision]. The question is not whether the employer made the best, or even a sound, business decision; it is whether the real reason is [discrimination].\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Carson v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>82 F.3d 157, 159 (7th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The bulk of Parks\u2019 argument revolves around her contention that she is a superi- or candidate because of her supervisory training. In particular, Parks seizes on a statement made by Sullivan that Parks was \u201cfirst in the management category\u201d and the proposition that because this was a management position, it is inconceivable that Sullivan could have chosen someone else over her absent age or sex discrimination. Such reasoning is not, however, persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">As an initial matter, Parks takes Sullivan\u2019s statement for more than it is worth because, on the record before the Court, Sullivan viewed Parks as having better management training but viewed Montefour as having better management skills. Montefour was also viewed as superior in other categories. There is certainly enough evidence to support Parks\u2019 contention that she is more qualified. Although Parks may be more qualified, her qualifications are not so much greater than Montefour\u2019s that the proffered reason \u201cwas so plainly wrong that it cannot have been the employer\u2019s real reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1109. Thus, Parks could not survive the first prong of <em>Fuentes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Under the second prong of the <em>Fuentes </em>test, Parks can survive summary judgment if she brings forth evidence that \u201c \u2018allows the fact finder to infer that discrimination was more likely than not a motivating or determinative cause of the adverse employment action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1111 (quoting <em>Fuentes, </em>32 F.3d at 762). Thus, Parks must point to evidence \u201cthat proves age [or sex] discrimination in the same way that critical facts are generally proved \u2014 based solely on the natural probative force of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Parks contends that Sullivan\u2019s use of \u201cpersonality\u201d supports an inference that discrimination was the motivating factor. Parks also notes that there is a dearth of women in commensurate positions and that Sullivan and Montefour were \u201cvery friendly.\u201d First, the lack of women in a given position does not create an inference that Parks was not hired because of sex discrimination. Parks did not introduce any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>evidence showing that any woman had previously applied for such a position, and in the absence of this or similar information, no inference can be drawn from the lack of women in these positions. Second, as the district court noted, friendship or cronyism is not a basis for relief under the ADEA or Title VII. <em>See, e.g., Platner v. Cash &amp; Thomas Contractors, Inc., </em>908 F.2d 902, 905 (11th Cir.1990). There is simply not enough evidence provided by Parks that raises the natural inference of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We will therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
