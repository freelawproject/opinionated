We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and conclude that Jackson\u2019s motion was properly recharacterized as one arising under \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 430, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Jackson has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-13\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\"> It is well established that a motion brought pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a) is limited to the correction of an illegal sentence. <em>Hill v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 424, 430, 82 S.Ct. 468, 7 L.Ed.2d 417 (1962). A sentence is illegal if the punishment meted out was in excess of that prescribed by the relevant statutes, multiple terms were imposed for the same offense, or the terms of the sentence itself were legally or constitutionally invalid in any other respect. We have interpreted <em>Hill\u2019s </em>third basis for a Rule 35(a) motion, sentences that are legally or constitutionally invalid in any other respect, to implicate only sentences that are \"ambiguous or internally contradictory.\" <em>United States v. Pavlico, </em>961 F.2d 440, 443 (4th Cir.1992). Jackson\u2019s allegations do not meet any of these requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
