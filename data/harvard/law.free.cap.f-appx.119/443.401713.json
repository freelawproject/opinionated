We conclude we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Ali\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the denial of Ali\u2019s asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of her request for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v.

Based on our review of the record, we find Ali failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">Accordingly, we deny Ali\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-14\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\"> Ali does not challenge the denial of withholding under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
