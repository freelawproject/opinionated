Garcia Medina, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 summary affirmance of an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioner failed to establish sufficient individualized harm or risk of future harm to be eligible for asylum based on past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir.1998) (recognizing that \u201c[m]ere generalized lawlessness and violence\u201d without a particularized risk to the petitioner is generally insufficient to support a claim of asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The record shows that petitioner suffered no harm in Mexico. No evidence was presented that anyone in Mexico targeted petitioner for harm or mistreatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Because petitioner failed to establish eligibility for asylum, he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), and <em>Salvador-Calleros v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 959 (9th Cir.2004), petitioner\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was granted, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, as of the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b199-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
