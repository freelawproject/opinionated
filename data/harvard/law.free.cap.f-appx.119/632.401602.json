The district court determined Trevino failed to establish his underlying deportation proceeding was fundamentally unfair and therefore denied Trevino\u2019s collateral challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-22\">A due process challenge to deportation proceedings providing the basis for a 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 conviction is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g. United States v. Hernandez-Avalos, </em>251 F.3d 505, 507 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 935, 122 S.Ct. 305, 151 L.Ed.2d 226 (2001). An alien seeking to collaterally challenge an order of deportation in an 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 prosecution must establish: (1) the proceeding was \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d; (2) the proceeding \u201ceffectively eliminated\u201d his right to challenge the proceeding by means of judicial review; and (3) \u201cprocedural deficiencies\u201d actually prejudiced him. <em>United States v. Mendoza-Mata, </em>322 F.3d 829, 832 (5th Cir.2003) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Trevino contends: he was denied the opportunity to present his claims for discretionary relief in the deportation proceedings; and the deportation order had an impermissible retroactive effect on his decision to plead guilty to the crime for which he was deported. Trevino requested types of discretionary relief for which he was not eligible; he did not request, and the court did not suggest, access to any other relief. While Trevino may have been eligible to seek other forms of discretionary relief, a court\u2019s failure to inform an alien of types of discretionary relief for which he is eligible does not violate due process. <em>See United, States v. Lopez-Ortiz, </em>313 F.3d 225, 230-31 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1135, 123 S.Ct. 922, 154 L.Ed.2d 827 (2003). Nor did the Immigration Judge\u2019s failure to consider Trevino\u2019s eligibility for discretionary relief unfairly affect Trevino\u2019s prior understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Trevino also raises two foreclosed issues to preserve them for Supreme Court review. First, he contends 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional. He acknowledges this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he relies upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1202, 121 S.Ct. 1214, 149 L.Ed.2d 126 (2001). Second, relying on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Trevino contends the federal Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional. As Trevino acknowledges, this argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464 (5th Cir.2004), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. 14 July 2004)(No. 04-5263).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b659-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
