On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court did not exercise discretion in denying a downward departure for overrepresentation of criminal history. Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the district judge recognized that he had the authority to depart, properly based his decision on the facts of the case, and made a discretionary decision based on those facts. Having found no other nonfrivolous issues after reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b872-16\">. The Honorable Robert W.
