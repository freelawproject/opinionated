Abe appeals the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Abe contends that he is entitled to statutory tolling while his state habeas petitions were under review because he had one day remaining on his Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) limitations period when he filed his first state petition. We disagree. Abe\u2019s conviction became final on November 23, 1998. His one-year statute of limitations began to run the next day. <em>See Patterson v. Stewart, </em>251 F.3d 1243, 1245-46 (9th Cir.2001) (explaining that time limits under AEDPA are calculated in accordance with the provisions of Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(a)). Accordingly, Abe\u2019s AEDPA statute of limitations expired on November 23, 1999. <em>See id. </em>at 1246. While there is some confusion as to the date on which Abe\u2019s first state petition was filed, it was not before November 24, 1999. Because this date is after Abe\u2019s AEDPA statute of limitations expired, Abe is not entitled to tolling for the time his state petition was under review, <em>see Jiminez v. Rice, </em>276 F.3d 478, 482 (9th Cir.2001), and his petition is untimely.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Abe also contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling, but has not alleged extraordinary circumstances beyond his control that prevented him from filing a timely petition. <em>See Frye v. Hickman, </em>273 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1055, 122 S.Ct. 1913, 152 L.Ed.2d 823 (2002). Therefore, equitable tolling is not warranted. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-9\">. By letter dated September 16, 2004, Abe asks this court to consider <em>Isley v. Arizona Dep\u2019t. of Corrections, </em>383 F.3d 1054 (9th Cir.2004). <em>Isley </em>does not affect the outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
