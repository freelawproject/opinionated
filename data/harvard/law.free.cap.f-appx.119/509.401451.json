The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-16\">The district court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice is not appealable. <em>See Domino Sugar Corp. v. Sugar Workers Local Union 392, </em>10 F.3d 1064, 1066-67 (4th Cir.1993). A dismissal without prejudice is a final order only if no amendment could cure the defects in the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1067. In ascertaining whether a dismissal without prejudice is reviewable in this court, we must determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff could save his action by merely amending his complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Johnson can cure the defect in his complaint by filing an amended complaint that does not incorporate multiple unrelated claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-17\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-18\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
