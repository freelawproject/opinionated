We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">As an initial matter, we note that the district court certified one issue on appeal: whether Endsley\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated by the introduction against him at trial of accomplice Theresa Ward\u2019s out-of-court statements. The scope of review in habeas cases under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act is limited to those issues specified in the Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). <em>Nardi v. Stewart, </em>354 F.3d 1134, 1137 (9th Cir.2004). However, we may expand the issues certified for appeal where the petitioner\u2019s assertion of a claim makes a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1138. Endsley has not made such a showing. Thus, to the extent that Endsley raises issues that fall outside the scope of the COA, we will not consider them here. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); 9th Cir. R. 22-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">The California Court of Appeal determined on direct appeal that the circumstances surrounding Ward\u2019s statements provided the particularized guarantees of trustworthiness necessary to satisfy the Confrontation Clause\u2019s \u201cresidual trustworthiness test.\u201d <em>See Lilly v. Virginia, </em>527 U.S. 116, 138, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999). Upon review of the record, we conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s resolution of this case was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see also United States v. Boone, </em>229 F.3d 1231, 1234 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the admission of a statement against penal interest made by an accomplice to a close friend in a private setting under circumstances suggesting \u201cresidual trustworthiness\u201d did not violate the Confrontation Clause). Subsequent to Endsley\u2019s conviction becoming final, the Supreme Court held in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), that the Sixth Amendment demands nothing less than \u201cunavailability [of the declarant] and a pri- or opportunity for cross-examination\u201d before testimonial hearsay statements may be admitted against a defendant in a criminal trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1374. Even assuming that <em>Crawford </em>applies retroactively, it does not affect the outcome here because the statements at issue were not testimonial. <em>See Leavitt v. Arave, </em>383 F.3d 809, 830 n. 22 (9th Cir.2004). Accordingly, the district court properly denied this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b83-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
