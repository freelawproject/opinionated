We dismiss Oming\u2019s petition because we do not have jurisdiction to consider the issue he has raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-16\">On March 13, 2002, Oming was served with a notice to appear, charging that he was subject to removal for having remained in the United States longer than authorized. Oming conceded removability and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Oming\u2019s application for asylum because Oming failed to establish that he filed the application within one year of arriving in the United States and failed to establish that he qualified for an exception to the one-year filing requirement. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (D). The IJ also denied Oming\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture because Oming failed to establish past perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>cution and failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured in Uganda. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision using the AWO procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Oming asserts that the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum application was based on alternative renewable and non-reviewable grounds \u2014 specifically, the merits of his asylum claim and the timeliness of his application, respectively. Oming argues that we should remand to the BIA because use of the AWO procedure provided no guidance as to whether the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on a reviewable or non-reviewable basis. Contrary to Oming\u2019s assertion, the administrative record clearly shows that the IJ denied Oming asylum solely based on the untimeliness of his apphcation.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">We agree with Respondent that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision to employ the AWO procedure in Oming\u2019s case. In <em>Ngure v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 975, 983 (8th Cir.2004), <em>reh\u2019g and reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>No. 02-3879 (8th Cir. Sept. 1, 2004), we held that \u201cthe BIA\u2019s decision whether to employ the AWO procedure in a particular case is committed to agency discretion and not subject to judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss Oming\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-11\">. In his petition for review, Oming refers to withholding of removal and the Convention Against Torture only three times. Two of the references simply indicate the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of those applications and are found in sections entitled \"Case Summary and Request for Oral Argument\u201d and \"Statement of Case.\u201d The third reference is found in a section entitled \"Jurisdiction.\u201d To the extent Oming attempts to challenge the denial of his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture, we hold that Oming has waived those issues on review. See <em>Chay-Velasquez v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 751, 756 (8th Cir.2004) (holding that petitioner waived claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture because there was no meaningful argument on the claim in his opening brief).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b57-6\">. Pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1 (e)(4)(i), the BIA member assigned to a case is required to employ the AWO procedure if the member determines that the result reached by the IJ was correct, that any errors by the IJ were harmless or nonmaterial, and that either \u2018\u2018[t]he issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing Board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel factual situation!)]\u201d or \"[t]he factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
