The record reveals, however, that the immigration judge denied asylum relief on the grounds that (1) Aboozar failed to file her application within one year of the date of her arrival in the United States, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) (2000), and (2) Aboozar failed to establish any \u201cchanged\u201d or \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances that would excuse her late filing, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) (2000). We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review these determinations pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Zaidi v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 678, 680-81 (7th Cir.2004) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Aboozar\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">While we lack jurisdiction to consider the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Aboozar\u2019s asylum claim, we retain jurisdiction to consider the denial of her request for withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a) (2004). \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that [s]he faces a clear probability of persecution because of h[er] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that Aboozar has failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-15\">Finally, Aboozar challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that she failed to qualify for cancellation of removal because she did not establish that her removal would result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d to her parents, who are lawful permanent residents of the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1) (West Supp.2004). Because the immigration judge\u2019s hardship determination is discretionary in nature, we lack jurisdiction to consider this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00a9 (2000); <em>Mendez-Moranchel v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 176, 179 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we deny Aboozar\u2019s petition for review.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>quately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b551-12\"> We find that Aboozar's claim that former counsel rendered ineffective assistance is waived on the ground that she failed to present this claim before the Board. <em>See Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir.1990) (\"[A]n alien who has failed to raise claims during an appeal to the [Board] has waived his right to raise those claims before a federal court on appeal of the [Board]\u2019s decision.\u201d). Additionally, Aboozar attempts to raise a claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We find that this claim is also waived as she failed to seek such relief before the immigration judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
