Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision, our review is of the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Zhang v. Dept. of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing the denial of an application for asylum, federal courts defer to the immigration court\u2019s factual findings as long as they are supported by \u2018substantial evidence.\u2019 Under this standard, we will not disturb a factual finding if it is supported by \u2018reasonable, substantial, and probative\u2019 evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)). This standard is highly deferential. <em>See Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Based on a thorough review of the record, we see no basis upon which to reverse the IJ\u2019s conclusion that petitioners have failed to meet their burden of showing either \u201cpast persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">We have considered all of petitioners\u2019 claims and found them to be without merit. We hereby DENY the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
