Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). A motion to reconsider asserts the Board made an error in its earlier decision. The motion must \u201cstate the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Such motions are especially disfavored \u201cin a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Moutche contends his former counsel told him he did not have to attend his removal hearing. However, Moutche has failed to submit any evidence establishing this fact. We accordingly cannot find that the Board abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">We therefore deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
