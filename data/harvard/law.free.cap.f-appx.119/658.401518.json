Berger received a mandatory minimum prison term of five years. He now argues that his guilty plea was involuntary and unknowing for two reasons: (1) at rearraignment, the district court failed to inform him about a possible increase to his base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2), a warning allegedly required by <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>- U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004); and (2) he was not clearly or adequately informed that he was facing a five-year mandatory minimum prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-22\">The Government contends that Berger\u2019s only timely notices of appeal were inadequate to preserve a challenge to his conviction because they designated only the sentence and Berger\u2019s \u201cMotion to Demand Specific Performance.\u201d Although Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) requires an appellant to \u201cdesignate [in his notice of appeal] the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed,\u201d this court has \u201cconsistently given a liberal interpretation to this requirement.\u201d <em>United States v. Knowles, </em>29 F.3d 947, 949 (5th Cir.1994). Both of Berger\u2019s timely notices of appeal were adequate to \u201cexhibit an intent to appeal\u201d the validity of his guilty plea. <em>See id. </em>at 950.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-23\">The Government also argues that, as part of his plea agreement, Berger validly waived his right to appeal. A defendant may waive his right to appeal as part of a valid plea agreement if the waiver is knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). Berger does not explicitly challenge the validity of the waiver provision itself, but such a provision will be enforced only \u201c[s]o long as [the] plea [itself] is informed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>voluntary.\u201d <em>See United States v. Dees, </em>125 F.3d 261, 269 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Wenger, </em>58 F.3d 280, 282 (7th Cir.1995). Accordingly, we first address Berger\u2019s substantive challenge to the validity of his guilty plea in order to reach the threshold issue of whether the waiver provision was enforceable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>328 F.3d 787, 789-90 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Berger\u2019s challenges to the validity of his plea are unavailing. First, contrary to Berger\u2019s contention, <em>Blakely </em>did not require his indictment to charge or the district court to warn him that he faced an offense-level increase under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465 (5th Cir.2004) (holding that <em>Blakely </em>does not apply to the federal guidelines), <em>cert. granted, judgment vacated by, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1003, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014\u2014, 2005 WL 124197 (2005). Second, Berger\u2019s signed plea agreement and rearraignment transcript reflect that Berger was adequately and clearly informed that he faced a mandatory minimum prison term of five years. <em>See Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242-44, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>234 F.3d 252, 255 (5th Cir.2000); Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Because Berger\u2019s guilty-plea was voluntarily and knowingly entered, his waiver of his right to appeal was enforceable. Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b685-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
