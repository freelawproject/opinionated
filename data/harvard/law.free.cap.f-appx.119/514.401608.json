We conclude we lack jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). Kefle next contends the Board erred when it denied her withholding of removal claim. We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude Kefle did not exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to this claim because she did not properly present it in her appeal to the Board. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-14\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
