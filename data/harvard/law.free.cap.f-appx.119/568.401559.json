We dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R. Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). \u201cA final decision generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945) (internal quotation marks omitted). District court orders remanding to the bankruptcy court for further consideration generally are not final orders. <em>See Legal Representative for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>Future Claimants v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. (In re The Wallace &amp; Gale Co.), </em>72 F.3d 21, 24 (4th Cir.1995); <em>Capitol Credit Plan of Tenn., Inc. v. Shaffer, </em>912 F.2d 749, 750 (4th Cir.1990) (holding that district court order remanding for the bankruptcy court to address two arguments not previously addressed by the bankruptcy court was not a final decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is not an appealable order, and we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We grant Taylor\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
