Flynn\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint is unintelligible\u2014 it alludes to an incident in which a judge allegedly \u201cthreatened the jury with armed violence\u201d and generally charges the defendants with \u201cpromoting social pathology.\u201d The district court could not discern any claim for relief and therefore dismissed the action. Flynn\u2019s brief on appeal is equally impenetrable. It does little to add context that might help us to understand Flynn\u2019s various claims, and instead offers Flynn\u2019s assessment that the \u201cDistrict Court is used as a dummy put forward to act for the United States Constitution while ostensibly acting for the interest of the defendants.\u201d We therefore see no basis for upsetting the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a); <em>United States ex rel. Garst v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., </em>328 F.3d 374, 378 (7th Cir.2003) (parties must \u201cmake their pleadings straightforward, so that judges and adverse parties need not try to fish a gold coin from a bucket of mud\u201d); <em>Davis v. Ruby Foods, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 818, 820 (7th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe dismissal of a complaint on the ground that it is unintelligible is unexceptional.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
