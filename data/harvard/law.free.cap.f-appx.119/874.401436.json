Torres challenges the constitutionality of the traffic stop and the subsequent inventory search of the rental car he was driving. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-17\">Torres first argues that Officer Edward Perez lacked \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d for the traffic stop. The requirement of reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop is satisfied when there are \u201cspecific, articulable facts which, together with objective and reasonable inferences, form the basis for suspecting that the particular person detained is engaged in criminal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Garciar-Camacho, </em>53 F.3d 244, 246 (9th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>United States v. Twilley, </em>222 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000). An officer\u2019s inferences can be informed by his or her training and experience, but must \u201cbe grounded in objective facts and be capable of rational explanation.\u201d <em>United States v. Colin, </em>314 F.3d 439, 442 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-18\">With this standard in mind, we address the particular law that was the justification for the traffic stop. Arizona Revised Statute section 28-730(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-19\">The driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent and shall have due regard for the speed of the vehicles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>on, the traffic on and the condition of the highway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Officer Perez stopped Torres because he was following behind another car at a distance of five to fifteen feet, at the speed of fifty-five miles per hour. Based on some six years of experience, Officer Perez believed that this distance was too close for safety. Officer Perez testified at trial that, in his mind, a car is following too closely if \u201cit would not have enough time to stop without hitting the other vehicle or running off the roadway.\u201d We conclude that Officer Perez\u2019s belief was \u201cobjectively grounded\u201d in a valid interpretation of Arizona traffic law and based on his direct observation \u2014 the distance he observed between the two cars traveling at high speed. That Officer Perez could not recite the exact language of the statute is of no consequence, because his testimony fairly and with common sense described the scope of this not unusual traffic law. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>213 F.3d 1216, 1220 (9th Cir.2000). Nor does it matter that at the time of the stop the weather was clear, or that there was little other traffic; the Arizona statute delineates those elements as considerations, not requirements, for the finding of a violation, and the proximity of Torres\u2019s ear to the one he was following created a reasonable suspicion of violation even in the best of weather. We hold that Officer Perez had reasonable suspicion to stop Torres.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Torres also challenges Officer Perez\u2019s subsequent inventory search of the rental car.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After stopping Torres for the traffic violation, Officer Perez learned that Torres was driving without a driver\u2019s license and was not an authorized driver under the rental car agreement. Because Torres could not legally drive the car, Officer Perez followed a correct and routine procedure to seize the vehicle in order to return it to the rental agency. In such a situation, an inventory search \u201cto protect against any danger to [the officer] or others that may have been posed by the property,\u201d is properly undertaken by the officer. <em>See United States v. Mancera-Londono, </em>912 F.2d 373, 376 (9th Cir.1990); <em>cf. Colorado v. Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 372-73, 107 S.Ct. 738, 93 L.Ed.2d 739 (1987); <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 369, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b901-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-6\">. We may assume, without deciding, that Torres has Fourth Amendment standing, or a legitimate expectation of privacy, from which to challenge the inventory search. For the inventory search, as explained above, did not offend the Fourth Amendment, assuming that Torres could pose this challenge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
