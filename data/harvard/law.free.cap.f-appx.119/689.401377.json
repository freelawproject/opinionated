The IJ determined that Tshilumba\u2019s story was implausible and that her demeanor was not that of a woman who had gone through the \u201chorrendous problems\u201d about which she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-16\">Generally, we review the decision of the BIA and will only consider the underlying decision of the IJ if it influenced the BIA\u2019s determination. <em>Ontunez-Tursios v. Ashcroft, </em>303 F.3d 341, 348 (5th Cir.2002). When, as in this case, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without a written opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">The IJ has the duty to make credibility determinations of witnesses. <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). When an .IJ\u2019s credibility determination is based on \u201ca reasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence,\u201d it will be upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 79. Moreover, \u201ca credibility determination may not be overturned unless the record compels it.\u201d <em>Lopez De Jesus v. INS, </em>312 F.3d 155, 161 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-18\">In addition to arguing the merits of her claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT, Tshilumba, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>challenges the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, arguing that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s mindsets about her credibility were predetermined and that the IJ\u2019s determination that her testimony was incredible was based on facts that were not important to her asylum claim. Liberally construed, her brief challenges several of the findings on which the IJ based his credibility determination. However, Tshilumba\u2019s challenges concerning these findings lack merit. The IJ gave cogent reasons for finding that Tshilumba was not credible, and his determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>that Tshilumba was not credible is amply supported by the record. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79. Furthermore, the IJ\u2019s reasons were based on facts central to Tshilumba\u2019s claim, such as her lack of knowledge about the political party for which she was allegedly persecuted, the fact that she added her daughter to her passport just before she was arrested, and the unlikelihood that a person thought to be involved in the assassination of the president could leave the country with relative ease. The record does not compel a credibility determination contrary to that of the IJ. <em>See Lopez De Jesus, </em>312 F.3d at 161. Because the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we need not consider the IJ\u2019s alternative holding that Tshilumba\u2019s testimony, if believed, did not demonstrate eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal, although it may have demonstrated eligibility for protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Tshilumba also argues that the IJ erred in personally asking her questions that exceeded the scope of direct or cross examination \u201con areas outside the basis for the asylum claim and outside of any previous testimony.\u201d However, the IJ is entitled to \u201c \u2018interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien.\u2019\u201d <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. INS, </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 n. 1 (5th Cir.1986) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b) (recodified as 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(1))). Furthermore, to the extent that Tshilumba is citing in support of her claim the IJ\u2019s questioning concerning where she was imprisoned, whether her daughter cried or made a lot of noise at the airport, and the whereabouts of her husband, such questions are not outside the realm of an asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Accordingly, Tshilumba\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order is DENIED. The respondent\u2019s motion for summary affirmance in lieu of a response brief or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a response brief if this court denies the motion, is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
