We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">Between March 15, 2001 and July 13, 2001, Gilchrist engaged in a series of violent offenses in the District of Maryland and elsewhere. Gilchrist\u2019s involvement in these offenses was established through eyewitness and victim testimony, results of forensic examinations, including fingerprint and DNA comparisons, documents, and other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">On March 15, 2001, Gilchrist, acting alone, masked and armed with a gun, entered a Columbia Bank branch located in Greenbelt, Maryland. Before Gilchrist entered the bank, the branch manager saw Gilchrist outside the bank without a mask. In the hallway outside the bank\u2019s lobby, Gilchrist, wearing a mask, encountered a customer who had already left the bank and demanded at gunpoint that the customer return to the bank and get on the floor. Gilchrist then demanded money by pointing the gun at tellers and customers. Gilchrist forcibly took federally insured United States currency. As he left the bank, Gilchrist stated, \u201cHave a Merry Christmas.\u201d Gilchrist was then observed by the branch manager and others fleeing across the parking lot and entering a black Jeep Cherokee.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">In a photographic lineup, the Columbia Bank branch manager identified Gilchrist as the person she saw outside the bank on the date of the robbery. Bank surveillance photographs depicted the robber as short and stocky, which matched Gilchrist\u2019s physical build.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">On April 25, 2001, Gilchrist robbed another bank, this time a Bank of America branch in Mitchellville, Maryland. Gilchrist, masked and armed with a gun, entered the bank and demanded money by pointing the gun at tellers and customers. Gilchrist forcibly took federally insured United States currency. As he left the bank, Gilchrist was heard saying, \u201cHave a blessed day\u201d and \u201cHave a Merry Christmas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">Gilchrist was observed fleeing from the bank and running behind a shopping center located adjacent to the bank parking lot. A construction worker at the rear of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>the shopping center observed the robber fleeing and observed him get entangled in some bushes. A black nylon skull cap and a twenty-dollar bill were recovered in that same area of the bushes. A DNA comparison was done and Gilchrist was determined to be the major contributor of the DNA found on the skull cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Gilchrist\u2019s next heist occurred on June 15, 2001 at a Sun Trust Bank branch in Landover Hills, Maryland. Gilchrist and a taller, thinner African-American man were observed by Matilda Burgos, a bank customer, in the bank\u2019s parking lot. Burgos made eye contact with Gilchrist and watched Gilchrist and his accomplice walk to the bank door, where she observed one of the men pulling out a gun before entering the bank. As described by witnesses and depicted in the bank surveillance photographs, both robbers displayed guns and wore bandannas covering their faces. They demanded and received United States currency. One of the robbers grabbed the keys to a customer\u2019s minivan. Both robbers fled in the stolen minivan, which was later recovered a short distance from the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">On July 13, 2002, Gilchrist and a taller, thinner African-American man approached Raymond Redden at 1441 McCormick Drive in Landover, Maryland and demanded his vehicle. Unbeknownst to Gilchrist and his accomplice, Redden was a Prince George\u2019s County police officer, recently assigned to the narcotics unit, and the vehicle was his undercover police vehicle. After Redden relinquished his keys by putting them on the front seat, Gilchrist told Redden to get on the ground because he was going to \u201ccap him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Gilchrist and Officer Redden then struggled for the gun. In the midst of the struggle, Gilchrist discharged his weapon but was unable to fire it again because Redden had his hand over the slide portion of the gun, thereby jamming the casing inside. During this struggle, Gilchrist instructed his accomplice to kill Redden. The accomplice tried to come closer to the two men, but was unable to get a clear shot. Gilchrist and his accomplice fled the scene in Redden\u2019s unmarked police vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">A high-speed chase ensued. A short time later, Gilchrist and his accomplice abandoned the unmarked police vehicle and escaped on foot. However, the police were able to recover Officer Redden\u2019s vehicle. Fingerprints recovered on the driver\u2019s side exterior of the vehicle were identified as belonging to Gilchrist. During a search of the vehicle, a pager not belonging to Redden was recovered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">A photographic lineup was shown to Officer Redden, who identified Gilchrist as the shorter of the two carj ackers and the one who tried to shoot him. Redden was also shown another photographic lineup and identified another photograph as depicting the tall, thin man who was Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice in the carjacking.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">Less than two hours after the carjacking of Officer Redden, Gwendolyn Day was walking from a Seven-Eleven convenience store to a Chevy Chase Bank branch in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Arlington, Virginia to join her sister who was inside the bank. As she crossed the parking lot, Day observed two men, one short and stocky, the other tall and thin, running toward the front of the bank. Nothing was covering their faces.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Moments later, when Day was inside the bank, the same short, stocky man, whom she identified in court as Gilchrist, and his tall, thin accomplice entered the bank. Both were wearing bandanna masks and carrying guns. Gilchrist demanded money by pointing the gun at tellers and customers, adding that he would \u201cexecute them\u201d if they did not follow his orders. Gilchrist and his accomplice forcibly took federally insured United States currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">While fleeing from the scene of the bank robbery in his Jeep Cherokee, Gilchrist failed to yield the right of way and nearly collided with another car. The other driver became angry and followed Gilchrist, who sped away. After obtaining the Cherokee\u2019s license-plate number, the driver who was following Gilchrist returned to the Chevy Chase Bank branch and provided the information to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Later, Gilchrist abandoned his Jeep Cherokee at a government office building in Washington, D.C. The vehicle was found on July 17, 2001 and, inside the vehicle, the police recovered dye-stained money, a bullet, and a bullet casing. On July 19, 2001, Gilchrist was apprehended, following a vehicular chase with a Washington, D.C. police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">On July 26, 2002, a grand jury sitting in the District of Maryland returned a superseding indictment charging Gilchrist with four counts of armed bank robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), one count of carjacking, id \u00a7 2119, one count of conspiracy to engage in a bank robbery and a carjacking, id \u00a7 371, five counts of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, id \u00a7 924(c), and one count of possessing a firearm after having a felony conviction, <em>id </em>\u00a7 922(g). On January 7, 2003, the case went to trial. After eight days of trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Gilchrist guilty of all of the counts except one of the armed bank robbery counts and one of the \u00a7 924(c) counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 25, 2003, the district court sentenced Gilchrist to 112 years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered restitution in the amount of $54,595. Gilchrist noted a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">Gilchrist contends that he was improperly denied access to evidence favorable to his defense in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). More specifically, he contends he was entitled to know the name of the individual that Officer Redden identified in the photographic lineup as Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice in the carjacking. With this information, Gilchrist posits, he would have been able to impeach Redden\u2019s testimony by demonstrating that the person Redden identified in the photograph as Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice did not, in fact, participate in the carjacking or any of the bank robberies, thereby undermining the government\u2019s theory of the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In <em>Brady, </em>the Supreme Court held that the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose favorable evidence to an accused \u201cviolates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. In order to establish that the government\u2019s failure to turn over evidence constitutes a <em>Brady </em>violation, the defendant must demonstrate: (1) that the undisclosed evidence was favorable, either because it was exculpatory or impeaching; (2) that the prosecution had the materials and failed to disclose them, either willfully or inadvertently; and (8) that the evidence was material to the defense. <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 280-81, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). Evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d for purposes of the <em>Brady </em>inquiry \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). A \u201c \u2018reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, although \u201cthe term <em>\u2018Brady </em>violation\u2019 is sometimes used to refer to any breach of the broad obligation to disclose exculpatory [or impeachment] evidence\u2014 that is, to any suppression of so-called \u2018Brady material\u2019 \u2014 ... strictly speaking, there is never a real \u2018Brady violation\u2019 unless the nondisclosure was so serious that there is a reasonable probability that the suppressed evidence would have produced a different verdict.\u201d <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 281, 119 S.Ct. 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In denying Gilchrist\u2019s request for the government to disclose the name of the person that Officer Redden identified in the photographic lineup as Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice in the carjacking, the district court engaged in a lengthy colloquy with counsel. During this colloquy, the court observed that, because the government had doubts concerning the accuracy of Redden\u2019s identification of Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice in the carjacking, the government was not contending that the person Redden identified in the photographic lineup participated in any of the crimes alleged in the indictment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court also observed that, in view of the strong physical evidence linking Gilchrist to the carjacking, Gilchrist did not seriously take issue with Redden\u2019s identification of Gilchrist as a participant in the carjacking. In light of these two observations, the court viewed Gilchrist\u2019s request as one that sought evidence to prove a fact the government did not dispute, namely, the man Redden identified in the photographic lineup as Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice was not the same individual who participated in the carjacking or any of the bank robberies. Put simply, the essence of the court\u2019s ruling was that Gilchrist\u2019s request did not seek impeaching or exculpatory evidence because (1) the name of the accomplice was irrelevant to any issue in the case and (2) there were other persuasive ways to prove the inaccuracy of Redden\u2019s identification without disclosure of the name of the accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In our view, Gilchrist\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claim founders for the simple reason that the identification evidence he sought was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>material. Given the certainty of Officer Redden\u2019s identification of Gilchrist, the presence of Gilchrist\u2019s fingerprint on the outside of Redden\u2019s vehicle in the area where the struggle occurred, the subsequent discovery of Smith\u2019s pager in Redden\u2019s vehicle, her identification of Gilchrist as the person who stole her pager, and the fact that the government was not contending that the person Redden identified in the photographic lineup participated in any of the crimes alleged in the indictment, it simply cannot be said that disclosure of the identity of the accomplice in the carjacking would have produced a different result at the trial. Accordingly, there was no <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In a related argument, Gilchrist contends that the district court should have conducted an <em>in camera </em>review of the evidence concerning Officer Redden\u2019s identification of Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice in the carjacking. According to Gilchrist, such a review was necessary because the court was obligated to determine whether the government possessed information concerning the accuracy of Redden\u2019s identification of Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">On occasion, the government may possess potential <em>Brady </em>material that it deems privileged or that is otherwise confidential. If the accused does not specifically request that it be produced, this material is treated much like everything else in the government\u2019s file, <em>ie., </em>\u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s decision on disclosure is final.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 59, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987). If, however, the defendant is able to identify the requested confidential material with some degree of specificity, he may then attempt to convince the district court that it is subject to disclosure. <em>Id. </em>at 58 n. 15, 107 S.Ct. 989 (requiring the accused to \u201cat least make some plausible showing\u201d of how the evidence would be \u201cboth material and favorable to his defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Once the defendant has made a plausible showing that the evidence would be both material and favorable, the district court must review the evidence <em>in camera </em>to ascertain its true nature and determine whether it must be disclosed. <em>Id. </em>at 58-60, 107 S.Ct. 989. The court conducts its examination in private because the Constitution does not accord a defendant the right of unrestricted access to the government\u2019s files. <em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 107 S.Ct. 989. The court\u2019s ultimate conclusion as to whether the information is subject to disclosure \u2014 whether the evidence is both material and favorable \u2014 may be disturbed on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Trevino, </em>89 F.3d 187, 190 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">In this ease, Gilchrist suggests that he satisfied the \u201cplausible showing\u201d requirement because disclosure of the name of the carjacking accomplice possibly would have led to admissible evidence. However, mere speculation that the information may be helpful is insufficient to justify an <em>in camera </em>review. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>178 F.3d 904, 907-08 (7th Cir.1999). In any event, it is difficult to see how the name of the carjacking accomplice was favorable and/or material because Gilchrist simply did not need the name of the accomplice to impeach Officer Redden\u2019s credibility. Gilchrist could have attacked Redden\u2019s credibility by presenting evidence that the accomplice identified by Redden in the photographic lineup had not been charged with any of the crimes alleged in the indictment. Presentation of such evidence would have been equally, if not more, powerful than any evidence Gilchrist could have marshaled through the disclosure of the name of Gilchrist\u2019s accomplice in the carjacking. Accordingly, Gilchrist\u2019s claim that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>erred by failing to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Gilchrist also contends that the district court erred when it admitted into evidence two in-court identifications of him, one by Matilda Burgos, the other by Gwendolyn Day.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">When considering whether in-court identification evidence is admissible, the district court employs a two-step analysis. The court first determines whether the defendant established that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. <em>United States v. Wilkerson, </em>84 F.3d 692, 695 (4th Cir.1996). Second, if the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, the court must determine whether the identification evidence nevertheless is reliable. <em>Id. </em>In determining the reliability of the identification evidence, the court considers a number of factors, specifically: (1) the witness\u2019s opportunity to see the defendant at the time of the crime; (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness\u2019s description; (4) the witness\u2019s level of certainty; and (5) the time between the crime and the confrontation. <em>Id. </em>These factors are weighed against the \u201ccorrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.\u201d <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Gilchrist contends that the in-court identification of him by Burgos violated his due process rights. Specifically, he alleges that Burgos\u2019s in-court identification was unnecessarily suggestive and unreliable because: (1) during a court recess just prior to her testimony, Burgos arrived in the courtroom, took the stand, saw Gilchrist, and advised counsel she recognized Gilchrist; and (2) Burgos was shown bank surveillance photographs prior to her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">With regard to Gilchrist\u2019s first contention concerning Burgos\u2019s in-court identification of him, we have held that giving a witness an opportunity to observe the defendant in court is not an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure. <em>See United States v. Murray, </em>65 F.3d 1161, 1169 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201c[Although the Government allowed the witnesses to see [the defendant] seated at the defense table pri- or to their testimony, it did not create a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentifieation\u201d because the witnesses \u201cwould have seen [the defendant] at the defense table immediately before testifying.\u201d). Under this court\u2019s holding in <em>Murray, </em>allowing Burgos to see Gilchrist at counsel\u2019s table a few moments before her testimony did not make the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive, as Burgos would have seen Gilchrist in any event a few moments later when she took the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Gilchrist also contends the in-court identification of him by Burgos violated his due process rights because Burgos was shown bank surveillance photographs prior to her testimony. As the argument goes, a due process violation occurred because the government falsely told the district court that Burgos had been shown \u201cno pictures\u201d of Gilchrist when, in fact, she had been shown the bank surveillance photographs depicting Gilchrist wearing a mask. This argument is without merit for the simple reason that the government\u2019s statement was true in the sense that Burgos was not shown any pictures which identified Gilchrist; rather, she only was shown pictures of Gilchrist <em>wearing a mask.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">In any event, Burgos\u2019s identification of Gilchrist was reliable and therefore admissible. An in-court identification is admissible if the witness has independent knowledge which attenuates the inherently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>suggestive environment of a courtroom identification of a single defendant. <em>Murray, </em>65 F.3d at 1169 (identification based upon witness\u2019s \u201cclear recollection of [defendant] during the robbery\u201d); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>732 F.2d 379, 381 (4th Cir.1984) (identification based upon an opportunity to view the defendant at a time other than in the courtroom). Burgos\u2019s trial testimony clearly satisfies that requirement because she had an independent basis for her identification of Gilchrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">As established at trial, on June 15, 2001, after completing her banking business and saying hello to her sister, Burgos left the Sun Trust Bank branch. As she walked toward her vehicle, Burgos observed two men, one covered with a mask and the other wearing a jacket, walking toward her vehicle. Burgos entered her vehicle and locked the door because she was afraid of the men. She only saw the suspect with the mask for a moment. Burgos, however, saw the face of the other suspect, whom she identified in court as Gilchrist. Moreover, she watched the men walk up to the bank door, at which time one of them pulled out a gun and both entered the bank. Burgos observed them for approximately thirty-five seconds. As she was driving away from the bank parking lot, Burgos called the police to report the incident. Burgos was not interviewed during the initial investigation and was first contacted by the FBI in December 2002. Burgos was shown the bank surveillance photographs in which both suspects wore masks and, therefore, as Burgos testified, she could not see their faces or identify them in the photographs. Burgos did testify, however, that the body builds and the clothing worn by the suspects in the bank surveillance photographs matched the builds and clothing of the suspects whom she had seen in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Based upon her opportunity to observe Gilchrist, her level of concentration, and her degree of certainty exhibited during her testimony, Burgos\u2019s in-court identification of Gilchrist was rehable and properly admitted. <em>Cf. Coleman v. Alabama, </em>399 U.S. 1, 5-6, 90 S.Ct. 1999, 26 L.Ed.2d 387 (1970) (affirming admissibility of in-court identification by a witness who had a fleeting but good look at his assailant in the headlights of a passing car, thereby finding an independent basis for the in-court identification).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Gilchrist also argues that the in-court identification of him by Gwendolyn Day, a customer at the Chevy Chase Bank branch in Arlington, Virginia was unreliable. Gilchrist asserts that the in-court identification was inadmissible because: (1) Day had an insufficient opportunity to view Gilchrist at the time of the robbery; (2) she improperly observed the bank surveillance photographs prior to her testimony; and (3) she was tentative in her in-court identification of Gilchrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Day testified that, as she was going to the bank on the day of the robbery, she observed two unmasked men running in her direction from across the street. She noticed that one was thin and the other was heavy-set. Day described the manner in which the heavier person ran. Day entered the bank moments later to join her sister who was inside the bank and almost immediately felt someone behind her. Although he was now masked, Day could see his eyes and recognized him from his physical appearance as the same person she had observed about five seconds earlier running across the street. Day saw the man pull out a silver gun, order everyone on the floor, and threaten to start executing the customers unless he got some money.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">In preparation for her trial testimony, Day reviewed bank surveillance photo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>graphs to identify her location and the location of others in the bank during the robbery. Both robbers were armed and wore bandannas covering their faces in those bank photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">During her trial testimony, Day looked in the direction of Gilchrist, which precipitated the following exchange between the government and Day:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">GOVERNMENT: Why are you looking in that direction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-6\">MS. DAY: Because he \u2014 he looks like the guy I seen coming across the street. Because I looked \u2014 see when I seen him coming across, you know, the bus went by, and I thought they were just running for the bus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">After identifying Gilchrist as the person that she was looking at in the courtroom, Day stated, \u201cHe looks like the guy that came across the street, the one standing there with the gun in his hand [in the bank].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In this case, based on Day\u2019s opportunity to view the robber\u2019s face as he ran across the street, her opportunity to see his eyes moments later inside the bank while he was directing everyone to the floor and threatening to execute the bank customers, the impact such an event had upon her, and the unsolicited nature of her in-court identification of Gilchrist, it is clear that her identification of Gilchrist was based upon her recollection of the bank robbery and not the result of any inherently suggestive atmosphere in the courtroom. Accordingly, the court did not err in admitting the evidence. <em>Cf. United States v. Peoples, </em>748 F.2d 934, 936 (4th Cir.1984) (holding that an identification can be reliable even if it is phrased in uncertain terms).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Gilchrist also raises three additional arguments that he contends should be resolved in his favor. First, he argues that the bank robbery and carjacking counts were improperly joined in the indictment and, therefore, the district court erred when it denied his motion for severance. Second, Gilchrist argues that the court erred when it refused to allow him to introduce evidence concerning a shooting incident that did not involve him, but did involve Officer Redden. Finally, Gilchrist argues that Redden made false statements at trial or, alternatively, that the government knowingly utilized false testimony. We have reviewed all of these arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">. The pager recovered from Officer Redden's vehicle belonged to Syretta Smith, a prostitute whom Gilchrist robbed at gunpoint on or about July 8, 2001. Smith was shown a photographic lineup and identified Gilchrist as the man who robbed her of her money and pager.
