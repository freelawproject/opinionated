We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that even if Gomez Lopez established past persecution, the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution was rebutted by evidence in the record, particularly the State Department country report indicating that the civil war in Guatemala has ended, Gomez Lopez\u2019s acknowledgment of the same, and the fact that Gomez Lopez successfully relocated to another area in Guatemala prior to his coming to the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Gomez Lopez\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary depar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ture period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, as of the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b92-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
