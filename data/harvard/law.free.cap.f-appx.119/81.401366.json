R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b107-27\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-28\">Elmer Tegio Para, a native and citizen of the Philippines, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision, which summarily affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying his applications for asylum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>withholding of removal and for protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Where, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence and will not reverse unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>See Gormley v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Even assuming Para testified credibly, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s decision that Para failed to present sufficient evidence to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Ochave v. INS, </em>254 F.3d 859, 861-62 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Para suffered past persecution as a result of imputed political opinion. Para\u2019s reliance on two pre-election incidents with unidentified members of a suspected anti-Marcos political group as evidence of past persecution is unavailing. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that minor abuse during brief detention did not compel finding of past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Additionally, Para failed to present \u201ccredible, direct, and specific evidence\u201d in the record to support a reasonable fear of future persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016 (9th Cir.2003). Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the Para lacked an objective basis for his fear of persecution. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000). The evidence includes: the fact that Imelda Marcos subsequently won an elected seat in the legislature; a State Department Asylum Profile that reports that former Marcos supporters have returned to the Philippines \u201cwithout difficulty\u201d and that \u201c[available evidence\u201d does not support claims that former Marcos supporters are threatened because of their support for the Marcos regime; and the absence of any specific and direct evidence to support a fear of future persecution on the basis of imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Para has waived any claim that the IJ erred in denying him withholding of removal, or that the IJ erred in denying him relief under CAT. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Para\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, to the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">Para\u2019s request for sanctions and attorneys\u2019 fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b107-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
