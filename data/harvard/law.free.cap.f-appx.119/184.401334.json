We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review an adverse credibility determination for substantial evidence. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Hovhannisyan admitted that upon arriving in the United States, he told immigration officials that he feared returning to Armenia because people were after him for money and did not mention any of the politically-motivated attacks set forth in his asylum application. While statements given during airport interviews are not always valuable impeachment sources, <em>see Singh v. INS, </em>292 F.3d 1017, 1021-24 (9th Cir.2002), here the statement\u2019s reliability is not in question because Hovhannisyan admitted making it. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-63 (9th Cir.2004). Further, Hovhannisyan\u2019s airport statement does not just lack detail, but contradicts what he later claimed, <em>see id. </em>at 963, and Hovhannisyan provided no corroborating documentation. <em>See Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1044 (upholding adverse credibility determination where petitioner\u2019s credibility was in question and petitioner failed to produce non-duplicative, material, and easily available corroborative evidence from family members in the United States and western Europe). As the evidence does not compel a contrary result, we uphold the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Because Hovhannisyan failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Aschroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">In addition, because Hovhannisyan\u2019s claim for relief under the CAT was based on the same incredible evidence as his asylum application, substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b210-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
