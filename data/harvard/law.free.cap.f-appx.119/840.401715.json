Castro appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of his application for dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>ability insurance benefits and supplemental security income under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 <em>et seq. </em>He argues that the Administrative Law Judge failed to give controlling weight to the opinions of a physical therapist and a treating physician, and improperly discounted his own testimony. Jurisdiction being proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Castro had back surgery in December 2000, for a workplace injury. He did not complain of pain until Disability Determination Services referred him to James Putnam, M.D., for a consultative examination in April 2002. Since the surgery, Castro had not seen a doctor or taken medication for back pain; he stated he relied on ice and aspirin. Dr. Putnam found Castro\u2019s back problems \u201clargely subjective.\u201d Castro had a normal gait, the ability to walk tandem, and normal fine and gross movements in his extremities. He also had normal range of motion and could perform straight-leg raises to 60 degrees without difficulty. Dr. Putnam reported Castro had some discomfort but no spasms, spasticity, or atrophy.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Ten months after Dr. Putnam\u2019s examination, Loren Arp, a physical therapist, evaluated Castro for \u201cphysical capacity\u201d for one hour. Arp stated Castro should not bend, stop, squat, or climb stairs, and could sit for 20 minutes at a time and stand for 10 minutes at a time. Arp believed Castro\u2019s pain interfered with his ability to concentrate, due to tenderness, crepitus, muscle spasms, and severe muscle weakness. Arp concluded Castro was limited to less than sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">At the administrative hearing, Castro presented a letter by Dr. Ridenour, his treating doctor, stating that Castro cooperated with Arp \u201cand this indicates validity of the results.\u201d The letter references the physical capacity evaluation, but Dr. Ridenour did not perform his own examination. He merely adopted Arp\u2019s recommendation of \u201cless than sedentary\u201d work.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">After his back surgery, but before Dr. Putnam\u2019s examination, Castro suffered a fracture and laceration of 'the left-upper eye lid. Treating the injury, the emergency-room doctor noted Castro\u2019s limbs were developed, with normal motor strength. During months of follow-up treatment, Castro never complained .of back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">We uphold the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits if supported by substantial evidence on the whole record. <em>Clark v. Apfel, </em>141 F.3d 1253, 1255 (8th Cir.1998). Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind finds adequate to support a decision, considering both detracting and supporting evidence. <em>Young v. Apfel, </em>221 F.3d 1065, 1068 (8th Cir.2000). This court may not reverse merely because some evidence supports a contrary decision. <em>Baldwin v. Barnhart, </em>349 F.3d 549, 555 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Castro asserts that the ALJ failed to give controlling weight to the opinions of therapist Arp and Dr. Ridenour. A physical therapist is not an \u201cacceptable medical source\u201d whose opinion is entitled to substantial weight. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 404.1513 and 416.913. A therapist\u2019s assessment is \u201cother medical evidence.\u201d 20 C.F.R'. \u00a7 404.1513(d)(1). When assigning weight to \u201cother medical evidence,\u201d the ALJ may consider any inconsistencies with the record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">The ALJ, here, concluded that \u201csignificant weight is not given to the opinion of the physical therapist because it is not supported by and inconsistent with the record as a whole, not because he is not a licensed physician.\u201d Arp claimed Castro had tenderness, crepitus, muscle spasms, and severe muscle weakness, yet Dr. Putnam found no signs of spasms or atrophy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>Arp stated Castro could walk less than one block, but Dr. Putnam observed normal f\u00edne and gross movements and the ability to walk tandem. Castro did not complain of pain or take pain medications, other than ice and aspirin, yet Arp asserted he was in severe pain. The ALJ stated, \u201cThe lack of more potent pain medications tends to show an absence of intolerable, work-precluding pain.\u201d Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s refusal to give Arp\u2019s opinion controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Castro also argues the ALJ erred by not affording Dr. Ridenour\u2019s opinion controlling weight. \u201cA treating physician\u2019s opinion regarding an applicant\u2019s impairment will be granted controlling weight, provided the opinion is well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Singh v. Apfel, </em>222 F.3d 448, 452 (8th Cir.2000), <em>see also Stormo v. Barnhart, </em>377 F.3d 801, 805 (8th Cir.2004). Dr. Ridenour\u2019s opinion merits less weight as it was inconsistent with the record as whole. <em>See id. </em>at 806 (citing <em>Piepgras v. Chater, </em>76 F.3d 233, 236 (8th Cir.1996)). The longer and more frequently a doctor has treated, the greater the weight given. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)(i); <em>see also Shontos v. Barnhart, </em>328 F.3d 418 (8th Cir.2003). Dr. Ridenour performed the lumbar surgery two years earlier, but never saw Castro again. Dr. Ridenour simply summarized the therapist\u2019s conclusions, noting cooperation that indicates validity. Without an independent examination, or an ongoing relationship, Dr. Ridenour\u2019s reference to the therapist\u2019s opinion does not warrant controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The ALJ, instead, afforded more weight to Dr. Putnam\u2019s opinion, which was supported by medical findings and consistent with the record as a whole. Generally, the opinion of a consulting physician does not constitute substantial evidence, but an ALJ may credit a one-time consultant and discount a treating physician\u2019s opinion in two instances: \u201c(1) where [the one-time] medical assessments are supported by better or more thorough medical evidence, or (2) where a treating physician renders inconsistent opinions that undermine the credibility of such opinions.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Barnhart, </em>344 F.3d 809, 813 (8th Cir.2003), <em>see generally Charles v. Barnhart, </em>375 F.3d 777 (8th Cir.2004). Dr. Putnam\u2019s medical opinion was more thoroughly supported by medical findings, as evidenced by Castro\u2019s daily activities \u2014 reading, sketching, performing chores, going to church, visiting friends, and going to the river to tan \u2014 and his lack of treatment and complaints of pain. Dr. Putnam noted some physical limitations (similar to those found by Arp), such as not kneeling or crawling, but found them not disabling due to normal strength, range of motions, and gait. Dr. Putnam did not find that Castro\u2019s limitations were severe, but rather, \u201clargely subjective.\u201d As Dr. Putnam\u2019s opinions are neither vague nor conclusory, and are supported by substantial evidence, his opinion is given greater weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Castro argues next that the ALJ failed to evaluate his credibility in accordance with <em>Polaski v. Heckler, </em>739 F.2d 1320 (8th Cir.1984). <em>Polaski </em>requires an ALJ to consider the claimant\u2019s daily activities; the duration, frequency and intensity of pain; precipitating and aggravating factors; dosage, effectiveness and side effects of medication; and functional restrictions. <em>Id. </em>at 1322. Castro claims the ALJ overemphasized the significance of his daily activities. He quotes <em>Baumgarten v. Chater: </em>\u201cthe ability to do activities such as light housework and visiting with friends provides little or no support for the finding that a claimant can perform full-time competitive work.\u201d 75 F.3d 366 (8th Cir.1996). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>While this is accurate, an ALJ may also determine that subjective pain complaints are not credible in light of objective medical evidence to the contrary. <em>Ramirez v. Barnhart, </em>292 F.3d 576, 581 (8th Cir.2002). Acts inconsistent with an alleged disability reflect negatively on credibility. <em>Johnson v. Apfel, </em>240 F.3d 1145, 1148 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Here, Castro testified he had weakness, constant pain, and muscle spasms interfering with his ability to concentrate. The contrary medical evidence indicates normal motor strength, normal gait, normal range of motions, and capacity to do straight leg raises without much difficulty. The ALJ also found that Castro\u2019s daily activities, particularly reading and sketching, require some level of attention and concentration, and were inconsistent with his alleged disability, diminishing his credibility. Moreover, Castro never complained of severe pain or sought a prescription for relief of muscle spasms or atrophy (testifying in passing that he could not afford any type of medications). In fact, he did not vocalize his pain until DDS referred him to Dr. Putnam. Allegations of disabling pain are discredited where the claimant has received minimum medical treatment, or only occasional pain medications. <em>Kelley v. Callahan, </em>133 F.3d 583, 589 (8th Cir.1998). Finally, the ALJ stated no precipitating event caused a worsening condition. The ALJ noted some limitations, but discounted the severity of pain in light of Castro\u2019s daily activities, his physical capacity, an absence of pain medications and complaints, and lack of factors aggravating his back. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Castro\u2019s testimony is inconsistent with the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<author id=\"b870-6\">SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">I cannot agree that the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and must respectfully dissent. In my opinion, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) improperly failed to give controlling weight to Castro\u2019s treating physician, a neurosurgeon. Instead, the ALJ gave controlling weight to a consulting physician, Dr. Putnam, who examined Castro only once.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">\u201cThe [social security] regulations provide that a treating physician\u2019s opinion ... will be granted \u2018controlling weight,\u2019 provided the opinion is \u2018well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holmstrom v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 715, 720 (8th Cir.2001) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)). Nonetheless, an ALJ may discount the opinion of a treating physician if another opinion is supported by <em>superior </em>medical evidence. <em>Id. </em>Nothing in this record is inconsistent with Dr. Ridenour\u2019s assessment of Castro. While the opinion of a physical therapist is not an \u201cacceptable medical source\u201d afforded substantial weight, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1513, it is properly considered \u201cother medical evidence.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d)(1). As such, Dr. Ridenour\u2019s assessment of Castro is supported by \u201cmedically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">The majority holds that Dr. Ridenour\u2019s assessment lacks authority because he did not have an ongoing relationship with Castro and did not perform an RFC examination independent of therapist Arp. \u201cThe Secretary is encouraged to \u2018give more weight to the opinion of a specialist about medical issues related to his or her area of specialty than to the opinion of a source who is not a specialist.\u2019 \u201d <em>Metz v. Shalala, </em>49 F.3d 374, 377 (8th Cir.1995) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(d)(5)). Dr. Ridenour, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>who performed back surgery on Castro, was intimately aware of Castro\u2019s physical restrictions. The majority fails to recognize that while a neurosurgeon may not be equipped to actually perform an RFC examination, he or she is wholly capable of evaluating the results of a medically acceptable test based on intimate personal knowledge of the patient. Courts are not in the business of telling physicians how to make evaluations if the evaluations are supported by medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">The majority agrees that Arp\u2019s assessment of Castro is inconsistent with the record as a whole, and that Dr. Putnam\u2019s assessment is consistent with the record as a whole. A comparison of Arp\u2019s assessment and Dr. Putnam\u2019s assessment reveals that they are substantially similar. Both agreed that Castro has severe medical problems and limited range of movement. Specifically, both found that Castro was limited to about 30 out of a possible 90 degrees of lumbar flexion, and about 20 out of a possible 30 degrees of lateral flexion; he was limited to about 60 degrees in straight leg raises; and limited in general physical activities. The only difference is that Dr. Putnam\u2019s evaluation opined that Castro\u2019s physical limitations (kneeling, stooping, twisting, bending, sitting, standing, lifting, etc.) were not as pronounced. As such, Arp\u2019s evaluation of Castro is as consistent, or inconsistent, with the record as Dr. Putnam\u2019s evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Here, the ALJ credited Dr. Putnam, a one time consulting physician, over Dr. Ridenour, a treating neurosurgeon with specialized knowledge in the area of backs. \u201cThe opinion of a consulting physician who examines the claimant once ... does not generally constitute substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Singh v. Apfel, </em>222 F.3d 448, 452 (8th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Nevland v. Apfel, </em>204 F.3d 853, 857 (8th Cir.2000)). Dr. Ridenour\u2019s opinion is based on objective measurements substantially similar to those supporting Dr. Putnam\u2019s opinion. Dr. Putnam\u2019s opinion simply is not supported by superior medical evidence. Under these circumstances, the opinion of the specialized treating physician should be given controlling weight.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-17\">. The Honorable Charles R.
