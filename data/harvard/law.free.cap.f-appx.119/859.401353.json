We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. Gonz<em>alez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 998 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-18\">The BIA conducted an individualized analysis and, based on the background information in the record, found that there was a lack of evidence indicating that guerillas continue to attack citizens. The BIA found that the evidence instead showed that much of the violence that persists in Guatemala is either non-political or targeted at high profile activists and former guerillas. <em>Id. </em>at 1000 (quoting <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>123 U.S. 12, 17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002)) (per curiam). Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of asylum based on changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-19\">Because Juarez-Paredez failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 1001 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), petitioner\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b886-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
