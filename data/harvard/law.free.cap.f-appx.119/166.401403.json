We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review the determination that Kandou did not comply with the one-year filing deadline of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001). We also lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that no \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d excused Kandou\u2019s untimely asylum application. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we dismiss Kandou\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-15\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 over the remaining claims. We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s decision to deny withholding of removal, <em>Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 816, and relief under CAT, <em>Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1193 (9th Cir.2003), and de novo due process violation claims, <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">Substantial evidence supports the denial of withholding of removal because Kandou failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she would be subject to persecution if removed to Indonesia. <em>See Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 816-17. The events, including being harassed and having her church stoned and burned, do not compel eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that insults, harassment, death threats and a beating did not compel eligibility for withholding of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">Substantial evidence also supports the denial of relief under the CAT because Kandou failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to Indonesia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">Kandou\u2019s contention that the IJ disregarded supporting documentation is without merit because she did not overcome the presumption that the IJ reviewed all relevant evidence. <em>See Larita-Martinez v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1092, 1095 (9th Cir.2000). Kandou\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedure is foreclosed by <em>Falcon </em>Car<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>riche v.
