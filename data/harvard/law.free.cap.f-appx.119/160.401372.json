R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b187-20\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-21\">Esvin Benito Castillo-Recinos, a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirming without opinion the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order of removal and denial of asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). We deny in part, and dismiss in part, the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-22\">Castillo-Recinos contends that the IJ erred by finding him inadmissible and subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)\u00ae for attempted entry by misrepresentation. Because Castillo-Recinos conceded that he attempted to enter the United States by orally falsely claiming to be a lawful permanent resident, his challenge to the IJ\u2019s removal order lacks merit. <em>See Pichardo v. INS, </em>216 F.3d 1198, 1200 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that \u201cin removal proceedings, the alien has the burden of establishing that he is \u2018clearly and beyond doubt entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible\u2019 \u201d); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C) (stating that \u201ca decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the United States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-23\">The record evidence does not compel a finding that Castillo-Recinos has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>well-founded fear of persecution by the former Guatemalan guerrillas. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 995, 998-99 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s reliance on changed country conditions in Guatemala, and the possibility of internal relocation); <em>Arriaga-Barrientos v. INS, </em>937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that harm by unknown men for unknown reasons did not support a well-founded fear of persecution). By failing to qualify for asylum, Castillo-Recinos necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez, </em>336 F.3d at 1001 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The BIA\u2019s decision to streamline Castillo-Recinos\u2019 appeal did not violate due process. <em>See Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066, 1078-79 (9th Cir.2004). Moreover, we reject Castillo-Recinos\u2019 regulatory challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm his appeal without a separate opinion. <em>See id. </em>at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of voluntary departure. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(f). We reject Castillo-Recinos\u2019 remaining contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">PETITION DENIED in part, and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b187-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
