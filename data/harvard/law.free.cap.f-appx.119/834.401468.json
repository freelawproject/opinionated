Elvin Douglas (Douglas), attorney for Winnebago South, Inc. (Winnebago), now appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> orders (1) denying his motion for payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs from receivership funds, and (2) denying his motion to order Winnebago\u2019s receiver partially to withhold distribution of Winnebago\u2019s assets pending resolution of Douglas\u2019s fees-and-eosts motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">Initially, we agree with appellees that Douglas\u2019s appeal from the order declining to withhold distribution of the sale assets is moot, because the receiver has already distributed the assets (reserving a fund from which Douglas could be partially compensated). <em>See Nebraska v. Cent. Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact Comm\u2019n, </em>187 F.3d 982, 987 (8th Cir.1999); <em>CMM Cable Rep., Inc. v. Ocean Coast Props., Inc., </em>48 F.3d 618, 621 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\">As to the fee issue, the district court held that equity did not favor paying Douglas\u2019s fees or expenses, because the principals of Winnebago had perpetrated a fraud and had engaged in obstructive and unreasonable tactics that delayed the litigation. Appellees note on appeal that the class plaintiffs, without compensating Douglas, are to receive only 44% of their out-of-pocket costs after more than thirty years of litigation. In these circumstances, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to compensate Douglas from receivership funds. <em>See Commodity Futures Trading Comm\u2019n v. Morse, </em>762 F.2d 60, 63 (8th Cir.1985) (standard of review; no abuse of discretion in denying payment of attorney\u2019s fees from receivership estate where funds remaining in estate were not sufficient to pay all claims of defrauded customers).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-13\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
