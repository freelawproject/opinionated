We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-17\">The Johnechecks are owners of forty acres of property in Bay Township who wished to supplement their income by installing and operating two three hundred-foot WTGs on their land. In order to do so, they were required to comply with the Township\u2019s zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-18\">On November 30, 2000, the Johnechecks applied to the Township for a zoning permit to build the two WTGs, but their application was denied by the Zoning Administrator. They appealed to the Township Zoning Board of Appeals, arguing that \u201cwind farming\u201d should be deemed a type of \u201cspecialized farming\u201d under the Agricultural Zoning section of the ordinance. On December 18, 2000, the Board rejected this argument and affirmed the Administrator\u2019s decision, stating that it did \u201cnot interpret wind farming as specialized farming under [section] 8.2(a) of the Zoning Ordinance.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-19\">At the time that the Johnechecks were seeking their permit, the Township was considering an amendment to the ordinance that would have permitted and regulated installation and operation of WTGs. The proposal being considered at that time was ultimately rejected, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>The Johnechecks then sued the Township in federal court for violations of the Michigan and U.S. Constitutions, Michigan\u2019s Township Zoning Act (Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 125.297a), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment (Plaintiffs solely as to the exclusionary zoning claim) and the district court granted summary judgment for Defendant and denied it for Plaintiffs. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">II. <em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">We review the entry of summary judgment de novo. <em>Farhat v. Jopke, </em>370 F.3d 580, 587 (6th Cir.2004). Where there are no material, disputed issues of fact, we determine de novo whether the district court properly applied the substantive law. <em>Id. </em>at 587.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">III. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"A-D\">A. <em>Exclusionary Zoning Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">All Michigan zoning ordinances enjoy the presumption of validity. <em>Bevan v. Brandon Township, </em>438 Mich. 385, 475 N.W.2d 37, 44 (1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, \u201czoning, to be valid, must be reasonable, and its reasonableness must be measured by present conditions.\u201d <em>Kropf v. City of Sterling Heights, </em>391 Mich. 139, 215 N.W.2d 179, 183 (1974). Thus, \u201can ordinance which totally excludes a use recognized by the constitution or other laws of the state[ ] carries a strong taint of unlawful discrimination and a denial of equal protection of the law.\u201d <em>Countrywalk Condominiums, Inc. v. City of Orchard Lake Village, </em>221 Mich.App. 19, 23, 561 N.W.2d 405 (1997). In such cases, the ordinance loses its presumption of validity and the burden falls on the zoning authority to produce evidence that the total exclusion is reasonably related to the health, safety, or general welfare of the community. <em>Id. </em>at 24, 561 N.W.2d 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in concluding that the ordinance does not totally exclude the use of WTGs. We disagree. Plaintiffs have failed to show anything more than the exclusion of a three hundred-foot WTG on property falling in the Agricultural Zoning District. They applied only for such a use under the ordinance. They have not demonstrated that the ordinance would prohibit the use of WTGs (of the three hundred-foot variety or otherwise) in any of the other zoning districts, such as the Commercial District or the Planned Unit Development Zoning District. The ordinance\u2019s presumption of validity therefore controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">The Johnechecks correctly note that under Michigan law, a zoning ordinance in a \u201cpermissive format states the permissive uses under the classification, and necessarily implies the exclusion of any other non-listed use.\u201d <em>Independence Township v. Skibowski, </em>136 Mich.App. 178, 355 N.W.2d 903, 906 (1984). But while Bay Township\u2019s zoning ordinance does operate in a permissive format, its provisions assuredly allow at least some types of wind turbine generators. The ordinance permits accessory structures, such as \u201cdish and other types of antennae, fences and walls, freestanding lighting fixtures, signs, silos and other agricultural structures, and swimming pools,\u201d and such structures are generally permitted for all lots that have an authorized principal use. <em>See </em>JA 91. And while the requirement that accessory structures be \u201ccustomarily incident and subordinate to the principal use of the land\u201d might appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>to cut against permitting wind turbine generators, JA 91, small windmills long have been used to supply water to farming operations from wells, and using them to supply electricity to support an allowed principal use is analogous. Indeed, the ordinance cites as examples of accessory structures \u201cdish and other types of antenna[e].\u201d Language that lists satellite dishes as \u201ccustomarily incidental\u201d to principal uses (such as farming) permits windmills generating electricity too. Notably, Randy Frykberg, a witness for the Township, testified that a WTG would qualify as a customary accessory use to a farm. RE 57, Ex. 1, p. 3 (Frykberg Dep. p. 38).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Likewise, Plaintiffs\u2019 statutory exclusionary zoning claim, pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 125.297a, must fail. That statute is violated only if an ordinance has the effect of totally prohibiting the establishment of a land use within a township. <em>Adams Outdoor Advertising, Inc. v. City of Holland, </em>463 Mich. 675, 625 N.W.2d 377, 382 (2001). Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The matter is not quite ended. Even if he cannot prove total exclusion, a plaintiff may still prevail on an exclusionary zoning claim \u201cif he can meet the difficult burden of demonstrating no reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d <em>Landon Holdings, Inc. v. Grattan Township, </em>257 Mich.App. 154, 667 N.W.2d 93, 106 (2003). Plaintiffs cannot meet this standard. Bay Township has a legitimate interest in regulating the location and size of three hundred-foot WTGs within the Township\u2019s Agricultural District.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-15\">B. <em>Takings Clause Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQB\">An unconstitutional taking may occur in two situations: (1) where the regulation does not substantially advance a legitimate state interest, or (2) where the regulation denies an owner economically viable use of his land. <em>K &amp; K Construction, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Resources, </em>456 Mich. 570, 575 N.W.2d 531, 535 (1998). Plaintiffs rely solely on the first of these two theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The Michigan Supreme Court has adopted the rule \u201cthat a broad range of governmental purposes and regulations satisfies\u201d the requirement that a regulation substantially advance a legitimate state interest. <em>Bevan, </em>475 N.W.2d at 44 (citing <em>Nollan v. California Coastal Comm., </em>483 U.S. 825, 834-35, 107 S.Ct. 3141, 97 L.Ed.2d 677 (1987)). The exclusion of three hundred-foot WTGs in Bay Township\u2019s Agricultural District easily meets this test, for the same reasons stated earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-13\">. Section 8.2(a) of the ordinance provides for certain permitted uses in the Agricultural Zoning District, which includes the Johnechecks' land: \u201cFarms for general and specialized farming, including nurseries, and single family farm dwellings, and buildings and other structures essential to farming and farm operations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\">. In their complaint, Plaintiffs invoked both the federal and Michigan state Constitutions in pressing their exclusionary zoning claim. On appeal, however, they rely exclusively on Michigan state precedent to support this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
