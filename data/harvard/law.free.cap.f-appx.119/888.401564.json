We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b915-15\">Because the BIA affirmed without opinion, we review the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u2019s\u201d) decision, as the final agency determination, for substantial evidence. <em>See Narayan v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 1065, 1067 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cUnder this standard, \u2018a petitioner contending that the [IJ]\u2019s findings are erroneous must establish that the evidence not only <em>supports </em>that conclusion, but <em>compels </em>it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-16\">Carreon testified in support <em>of </em>her requests for relief that the New People\u2019s Army (\u201cNPA\u201d), a communist guerilla organization in the Philippines, attempted to recruit her because of her nursing skills. Carreon explained that she had feared the NPA since childhood, when the NPA allegedly stole property from her home and harassed her family. The NPA purportedly continued to target Carreon in high school and in college. Although Carreon has had no contact with the NPA since college, she testified that if she returns to the Philippines, she will be forced to go into hiding because she believes the NPA has blacklisted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">The IJ fully credited Carreon\u2019s testimony but determined that \u201cshe ha[d] not established that she ha[d] suffered persecution in her home country.\u201d In addition, the IJ ruled that Carreon did not have a well-founded fear of future persecution because the evidence indicated both that country conditions had sufficiently changed in the Philippines, such that the NPA is no longer a powerful threat, and Carreon\u2019s family, who along with Carreon had been subject to similar risk by the NPA, remained unharmed in the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-18\">We conclude that there is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>tion that Carreon did not qualify for asylum. First, Carreon did not show how the NPA had persecuted her in the past on account of political opinion. The Supreme Court held in <em>INS v. </em>Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), that a guerrilla organization\u2019s attempt to conscript a Guatemalan native into its military forces did not necessarily constitute persecution on account of political opinion. Here, as in <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>there was no indication that Carreon\u2019s refusal to join the NPA was politically-based or politically-motivated. Moreover, Carreon\u2019s contention in her pro se petition for review that the NPA persecuted her because she supported the Imelda Marcos Party is entirely inconsistent with her sworn testimony and her amended declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Second, Carreon failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution in light of the evidence that her family continues to reside unharmed in the Philippines and the NPA has significantly reduced its presence and influence in the country. The continued presence of family members in the country of origin does not necessarily rebut an applicant\u2019s well-founded fear of future persecution unless there is evidence that the family was \u201csimilarly situated or subject to similar risk.\u201d \u2019 <em>See Rios v. Ashcroft, </em>287 F.3d 895, 902 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 935 (9th Cir.2000)). Here, Carreon explicitly testified that the NPA did not specifically target her, but rather harassed her whole family. In addition, the U.S. State Department\u2019s Human Rights and Labor Report, <em>Philippines: Profile of Asylum, Claims and Country Conditions </em>(Sep.1998), upon which the IJ relied, confirmed that the NPA had a presence in many parts of the Philippines in the 1980s, when Carreon was a child and teenager, but had reportedly shrunk to fewer than 8,000 members by 1997. This evidence confirmed that country conditions have changed so that Carreon\u2019s fear of persecution is no longer reasonable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i)(A). For these reasons, the IJ did not err in denying Carreon asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">Because \u201c \u2018[the] clear probability\u2019 standard ... for withholding of removal is more stringent than the well-founded fear standard governing asylum,\u201d <em>Al-Harbi v. INS, </em>242 F.3d 882, 888-89 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 449-50, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987)), the IJ correctly concluded that Carreon did not qualify for withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b915-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
