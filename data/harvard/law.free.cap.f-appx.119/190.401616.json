RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Plaintiff Cortez Darnell Walters, a pro se state prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(c)(2) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(II) for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, and dismissal without prejudice of his supplemental state law tort claim against defendant Sean Sweeden. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Construing his submissions liberally, Walters contends the district court erred (1) in dismissing his claim for deprivation of property (a $150 check) by Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), which he alleged resulted from its policies and from inadequate training of its mail room employees; (2) in dismissing his claim for being deprived of access to state administrative grievance procedures; (3) in dismissing his claim against defendant Daren Swenson for failure to adequately supervise and train mail room employees, resulting in deprivation of his property rights; (4) in dismissing his claim that Sweeden violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment; (5) in dismissing his claims against Swenson and Steer for failure to discipline and supervise Sweeden to prevent the alleged Eighth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">This court reviews de novo dismissals under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Perkins v. Kansas Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999). Dismissals under \u00a7 1997e(c)(2) are also reviewed de novo. <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">Writ of certiorari</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Although it is unclear what relief Walters seeks from this court in his petition for writ of certiorari, it appears he is asking us to not rule on his pending appeal, but rather send his case directly to the United States Supreme Court. We must deny Walters request for the simple reason that it is the Supreme Court, and not any lower court, that decides whether it will take a case through the granting of a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">Access to state administrative grievance procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">Walters alleges various defendants deprived him of access to state grievance procedures, in violation of the Constitution. Although he references problems with the grievance procedures in his opening brief, it is unclear whether he actually is appealing the dismissal of those claims. Construing his brief liberally, we will consider the claims. \u2018When the claim underlying the administrative grievance involves a constitutional right, the prisoner\u2019s right to petition the government for redress is the right of access to the courts, which is not compromised by the prison\u2019s refusal to entertain his grievance.\u201d <em>Flick v. Alba, </em>932 F.2d 728, 729 (8th Cir.1991). As is evident from the file before us, Walters has not been deprived of access to the courts. Accordingly, any alleged denial of access to state administrative grievance procedures has not resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">CCA policy deprived Walters of $150</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">Walters alleged the CCA policies and procedures for mail handling deprived him of $150. He contends CCA\u2019s policies were deliberately indifferent to the proper handling of letters containing checks sent to prisoners where the return address and check were from the clerk of court rather than from an individual. He argues a check sent in such a manner should have been credited to his account, or at least information regarding the mail should have been logged/recorded before it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>mailed elsewhere, including information regarding where the mail was sent. Walters asserts that as a result of CCA\u2019s mail handling policy, the $150 returned to him by the clerk of court was never credited to his account and was sent elsewhere without any record of where it was sent. He alleges that CCA\u2019s policies and inadequate training and supervision of its personnel deprived him of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The magistrate judge and, in turn, the district court, relied on <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984), and <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), to dismiss this claim. The magistrate judge noted the Supreme Court has \u201cheld that neither negligent nor intentional random or unauthorized deprivations of property under color of state law are actionable where a plaintiff has an adequate state post-deprivation remedy.\u201d Report <em>&amp; </em>Recommendation at 4. The magistrate judge recommended that \u201c[i]n light of the adequate post-deprivation state remedies, Plaintiffs claim for damages based on deprivation of property fails to state a viable claim under Section 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Hudson </em>and <em>Parratt </em>to dismiss Walters\u2019 claims arising out of the CCA mail handling procedures. \u201cBoth <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>deal with random and unauthorized deprivations of property rather than deprivations according to some established state policy, procedure, or custom.\u201d <em>Gillihan v. Shillinger, </em>872 F.2d 935, 939 (10th Cir.1989). In <em>Gillihan, </em>this court concluded where \u201cthe deprivation is not random and unauthorized, but is pursuant to an affirmatively established or de facto policy, procedure, or custom, the state has the power to control the deprivation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, in cases where the property deprivation is not random and unauthorized, \u201cthe availability of an adequate state post-deprivation remedy is irrelevant and does not bar a \u00a7 1983 claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. <em>See also Gonzales v. City of Castle Rock, </em>366 F.3d 1093, 1112 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc) <em>(cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 417, 160 L.Ed.2d 316 (2004)) (stating \u201cwhen the deprivation is caused by established state procedures, the existence of an adequate remedy at state law does not extinguish a procedural due process claim\u201d). Because Walters contends the prison procedures themselves created the risk of his being deprived of property and the ultimate loss of his property, the district court erred in determining his claims were subject to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Eighth Amendment</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Walters also claimed that defendant Sweeden pushed him twice, violating his Eighth Amendment rights. Walters alleged in his complaint that the sole purpose of this application of force was to \u201ccause fright and fear\u201d and was inspired by. Sweeden\u2019s anger related to Walters reporting the names of employees he feared. Although Walters alleged an improper state of mind, he did not allege he suffered any injury as a result of being pushed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Not \u201cevery malevolent touch by a prison guard gives rise to a federal cause of action. ... Not every push or shove, even if it may later seem unnecessary in the peace of a judge\u2019s chambers, violates a prisoner\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cThe Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition ... necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition de minimis uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Walters allegedly was pushed twice and stumbled, although there is no indication that he hit the floor. In <em>DeWalt v. Carter, </em>224 F.3d 607 (7th Cir.2000), the Seventh Circuit considered circumstances similar to this case, although the physical injury there was more substantial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Smith informed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">DeWalt that he was receiving the disciplinary report because he had filed a grievance against Officer Young and because correctional officers \u201cstick together.\u201d As Mr. DeWalt walked away, he told Officer Smith his actions were unprofessional, whereupon Officer Smith jumped up and shoved Mr. DeWalt toward the doorway and into the door frame. Mr. DeWalt suffered bruising on his back where he hit the door frame; the prison medical staff, however, did not note any visible injury and did not order x-rays.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 610-11. The court concluded that \u201cOfficer Smith\u2019s simple act of shoving Mr. DeWalt qualifies as the kind of de minimis use of force that does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">As was the case in <em>DeWalt, </em>Sweeden\u2019s twice pushing Walters constitutes a \u201cde minimis use[ ] of physical force\u201d that \u201cis not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>See Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 10 (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, Sweeden\u2019s alleged actions were not cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">Walters also raises claims against Steer and Swenson for improper supervision of Sweeden, failure to discipline Sweeden, and failure to protect him from Sweeden. However, \u201c[a] supervisor is not liable under \u00a7 1983 unless an \u2018affirmative link\u2019 exists between the constitutional deprivation and ... the supervisor\u2019s personal participation, his [or her] exercise of control or direction, or his [or her] failure to supervise.\u201d <em>Butler v. City of Norman, </em>992 F.2d 1053, 1055 (10th Cir.1993). Because the assault and battery that Walters allegedly suffered does not rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation, Steer and Swenson cannot be held liable under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Walters\u2019 claims related to the alleged deprivation of property without due process as frivolous was erroneous and we REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings with regard to those claims. As regards his other claims, we AFFIRM. Walters\u2019 motion to proceed on appeal without prepayment of fees is GRANTED. Walters is reminded of his obligation to continue making partial payments toward the balance of those fees until they are paid in full. Walters\u2019 motion for a 15-day extension of time to make a partial payment toward fees is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b216-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-10\">. Although Walters mentions the possibility of amending his complaint, he has not suggested either in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation or before this court that such amendment would brelude adding some type of physical injury. Rather, he repeatedly has insisted a physical injury is not necessary to show an Eighth Amendment violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
