The district court sentenced Lachney, <em>inter alia, </em>to concurrent.terms of 115 months of imprisonment on Counts One and Two and to a concurrent term of sixty months of imprisonment on Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">For the first time on appeal, Lachney contends that he was sentenced in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. Lachney relies on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) as support for his position. As Lachney concedes, his argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464, 465-66 (5th Cir.2004), <em>cert. granted, judgment vacated by </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 1003, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2005 WL 124197 (2005); <em>cf. Wicker v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 155, 157-58 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Lachney also contends for the first time on appeal that the district court reversibly erred when it departed upward from offense level seventeen to offense level twenty-three. He asserts that the district court used impermissible factors to justify the upward departure. He asserts in addition that the district court double-counted when it used his prior convictions and the fact that he had relocated and continued committing offenses in other jurisdictions as justification for the upward departure. Lachney does not challenge the upward departure from criminal history category IV to category VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">Because Lachney did not object to the district court\u2019s finding that the appropriate guideline range was 92 to 115 months of imprisonment, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Ravitch, </em>128 F.3d 865, 869 (5th Cir.1997). To demonstrate plain error, Lachney must show clear or obvious error that affects his substantial rights; in such case, we may exercise our discretion to correct a forfeited error that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Ravitch, </em>128 F.3d at 869 (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 730-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) <em>(en banc)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">The record shows, contrary to Lachney\u2019s argument, that the district court did not rely on Lachney\u2019s prior arrests, his lifestyle of drug use, and his lack of education and training as justification for the upward departure. The district court cited Lachney\u2019s prior convictions that did not contribute points toward his criminal history score; Lachney\u2019s failure to adhere to conditions of probation, parole, or supervised release; Lachney\u2019s commission of offenses while on periods of release; Lachney\u2019s propensity toward recidivism; and Lachney\u2019s threat to the safety of the community, all of which are permissible bases for an upward departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2) &amp; comment, (n.2.).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">The record refutes Lachney\u2019s argument that the district court double-counted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>by using his prior convictions and his relocation and continued commission of offenses in other jurisdictions as grounds for the upward departure in his offense level. The district court explained that it was departing beyond criminal history category VI because Lachney committed crimes while on probation, parole, or supervision; his offenses were becoming violent; his record showed that he would continue to commit crimes; and he presented a danger to the community. Furthermore, Lachney has not cited a guideline provision that forbids the alleged double-counting. <em>See United States v. Harrington, </em>82 F.3d 83, 89 n. 6 (5th Cir.1996) (double-counting is not prohibited unless guideline forbids it). Lachney has not shown error, much less plain error. <em>See Ravitch, </em>128 F.3d at 869. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b667-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
