See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); Cir. R. 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b853-14\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b853-15\">Luis Madrid and Juan Silva were convicted after a jury of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and several related charges. We reversed Silva\u2019s conviction after concluding that considerable hearsay evidenee made the verdict unreliable. See <em>United States v. Silva, </em>380 F.3d 1018 (7th Cir.2004). The prosecutor concedes that the same rationale should lead to the same disposition of Madrid\u2019s appeal, and we agree with that assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-18\">Madrid contends that he is entitled to outright acquittal because, with the hearsay disregarded, the evidence would be insufficient. The double jeopardy clause then would foreclose a second trial. See <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978). But the right question is whether the evidence actually admitted, properly or not, allowed a reasonable juror to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Error in admitting evidence is the sort of trial mistake that permits a retrial following reversal. See <em>Lockhart v. Nelson, </em>488 U.S. 33, 40-42, 109 S.Ct. 285, 102 L.Ed.2d 265 (1988). The evidence actually admitted at Madrid\u2019s trial supported a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, so the double jeopardy clause permits a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-19\">If Madrid should again be convicted, the district judge will take account of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, L.Ed.2d - (2005), when imposing sentence. It would be premature for us to say more about sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-23\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
