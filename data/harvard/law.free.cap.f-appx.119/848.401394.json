After carefully reviewing the record, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings that Lee did not prove race discrimination, retaliation, or harassment. <em>See Tadlock v. Powell, </em>291 F.3d 541, 546 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review). We also agree with the court that Lee did not exhaust his administrative remedies on his claim that supervisors discriminated and retaliated against him by accusing him of fraud in a worker\u2019s compensation case. <em>See Burkett v. Glickman, </em>327 F.3d 658, 660 (8th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-17\">. The Honorable James M.
