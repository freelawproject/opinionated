A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find both that his constitutional claims are debatable and that any dispositive procedural rulings by the district court are also debatable or wrong. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Vance has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b570-17\"> Because the district court correctly construed Vance\u2019s motion as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, we consider Vance\u2019s appeal as a civil action. We note that, because a Fed. R.Crim.P. 35 motion is part of the criminal case, Vance\u2019s notice of appeal would be untimely to appeal the denial of a Rule 35 motion under Fed. R.App. P. 4(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
