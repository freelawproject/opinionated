We have jurisdiction under <em>8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because there are material inconsistencies between Hakobyan\u2019s testimony and declaration that go to the heart of his asylum claim, including inconsistencies regarding his encounters with the police and whether his workplace was destroyed by arson. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. Even assuming Hakobyan is credible, substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s determinations that the events Hakobyan describes fail to rise to the level of past persecution and fail to establish an objectively well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-17 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Because Hakobyan fails to demonstrate that he is eligible for asylum, it follows that he does not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Hakobyan\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s streamlining procedure is foreclosed by <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849-52 (9th Cir.2003). His due process contentions regarding his asylum hearing are without merit, and he fails to demonstrate that any alleged due process violation affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 965 (9th Cir.2002) (stating that a due process violation requires a showing of prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b205-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
