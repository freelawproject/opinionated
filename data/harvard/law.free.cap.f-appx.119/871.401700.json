We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(a), <em>Defenders of Wildlife v. Bernal, </em>204 F.3d 920, 929 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Foye\u2019s motion for a new trial based on inconsistencies in the jury\u2019s verdict. Given the jury\u2019s finding that the defendant did not act in a malicious and sadistic manner toward Foye, the district court was bound to disregard as surplusage the jury\u2019s subsequent finding that the defendant caused Foye harm. <em>See Floyd v. Laws, </em>929 F.2d 1390, 1399 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that the trial court must ignore as surplusage subsequent answers given in violation of instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">The remaining issues raised in Foye\u2019s opening brief are waived because they are not supported by specific, cogent argument. <em>See Greenwood v. FAA, </em>28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b898-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
