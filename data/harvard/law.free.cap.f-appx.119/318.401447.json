On appeal, the government argues that the district court erred in departing downward five levels on the ground of extraordinary rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-19\">Under the recently-enacted Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today Act of 2003 (\u201cPROTECT Act\u201d), Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003), a district court\u2019s downward departure is reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Kostakis, </em>364 F.3d 45, 51 (2d Cir.2004). Accordingly, we must ascertain whether the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation is truly extraordinary. However, in the instant case, the district court failed to detail its reasons or factual basis for finding the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation to be extraordinary. As a result, we are unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to determine whether or not the district court erred in downwardly departing. Accordingly, we VACATE the district court\u2019s sentence and REMAND \u201cfor further development of the record so that the district court can make findings of fact as to the existence of [the defendant\u2019s] extraordinary rehabilitation.\u201d <em>United States v. Bryson, </em>163 F.3d 742, 749 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
