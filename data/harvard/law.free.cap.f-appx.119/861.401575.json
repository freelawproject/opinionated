Under <em>Cervantes v. City of San Diego, </em>5 F.3d 1273 (9th Cir.1993), plaintiffs need not literally raise \u201cequitable tolling\u201d in the complaint for the doctrine to apply. Rather, \u201cthe sole issue is whether the complaint, liberally construed in light of our \u2018notice pleading\u2019 system, adequately alleges facts showing the <em>potential </em>applicability of the equitable tolling doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1277 (emphasis in original). Einheber\u2019s allegations in his pro se complaint that he had exhausted all administrative remedies, and that his termination had been reviewed by a hearing officer and the UC Berkeley Chancellor, are sufficient to plead the potential applicability of equitable tolling. The 1991 Rehabilitation Act claim is remanded to the district court to conduct a thorough equitable tolling analysis. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Einheber\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim because the Regents established a defense under <em>Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle, </em>429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977), that the Regents would have taken the \u201csame action,\u201d i.e. terminating Einheber, even in the absence of Einheber\u2019s protected speech criticizing her. The Regents showed that they would have taken the same action by the Chief of Police\u2019s sworn declaration that she fired Einheber solely on the basis of the seriousness of his misconduct and evidence that the Chiefs senior staff unanimously recommended termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment in favor of the Regents on Einheber\u2019s Rehabilitation Act/ ADA claim for failure to reinstate employment in 1996, on the basis of no adverse employment action. The Regents could not be faulted for failing to rehire when the arbitrator never required the Regents, to reinstate Einheber, and Einheber did not reapply. Einheber\u2019s argument that the futile gesture doctrine in <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 365-66, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), is waived because it was never presented before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Einheber\u2019s request for judicial notice is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.
