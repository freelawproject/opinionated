Williams asserted that both Dickerson and Field Officer Jones were aware of such restrictions and also knew that his health summary reflected that he had a prior leg injury and surgery and that a surgical pin and rod remained in place in his knee and thigh. He also suffers from emphysema. Williams appeared to state that, in Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ber 1998, the defendants acceded to the \u201cdemands\u201d of a physician\u2019s assistant that he not be assigned to such work. According to Williams, Dickerson nonetheless returned him to the field work in May 1999, which aggravated the old injury and required him to undergo surgery again in June or July 1999 in order \u201cto avoid an amputation of the entire leg.\u201d He stated that the work had caused the rod and pin to protrude into muscle tissue in his thigh, resulting in severe swelling and an infection. Williams alleged that Dickerson and Jones required him to return to the field work even after the 1999 surgery. Williams argued that these actions violated his Eighth Amendment rights to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">A district court shall dismiss an <em>in for-ma pauperis </em>complaint at any time that the court determines that the complaint is frivolous. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae. We review a dismissal as frivolous for abuse of discretion, <em>Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001), assuming that all of the plaintiffs factual allegations are true. <em>Moore v. Carwell, </em>168 F.3d 234, 236 (5th Cir.1999). A complaint is \u201cfrivolous\u201d if it lacks \u201can arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\u201cA prison official\u2019s \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate violates the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 828, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). A prison official acts with deliberate indifference \u201conly if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Prison work requirements that compel inmates to perform physical labor that is beyond their strength, endanger their lives, or cause undue pain also constitute cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219 (5th Cir.1983). \u201c[T]he constitutionality of a particular working condition must be evaluated in the light of the particular medical conditions of the complaining prisoner.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Cain, </em>864 F.2d 1235, 1246 (5th Cir.1989). Work that is not cruel and unusual <em>per se </em>may violate the Eighth Amendment if prison officials are aware it will significantly aggravate a prisoner\u2019s serious medical condition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">The magistrate judge recommended that Williams\u2019s complaint be dismissed as frivolous, relying largely on \u201cmedical records provided by\u201d Williams. According to the magistrate judge, these records showed that Williams had only a \u201csore\u201d that was \u201ccleaned and dressed\u201d and a \u201ccyst\u201d that tested positive for a staph infection. These determinations suggest a far less serious medical condition and surgical procedure than those alleged by Williams. The record of the instant appeal, however, contains no medical records from the surgery described by Williams. Williams has stated that he cannot afford to pay for his medical records or that such records are missing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">In the absence of such records, we must rely on Williams\u2019s <em>pro se </em>allegations, and we must liberally construe those allegations in his favor. <em>Moore, </em>168 F.3d at 236; <em>Haines v. Kemer, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972). Those allegations were sufficient to state a cognizable Eighth Amendment claim that the defendants knew that forcing Williams to perform field work exceeded his work re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>strictions and would worsen his medical conditions. Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The district court concluded that Williams\u2019s claims with respect to events in 1998 were barred by the applicable two-year Texas limitations statute for personal-injury actions and that allegations of verbal threats or abuse by Jones were not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Williams has effectively abandoned any direct challenge to these conclusions, <em>see Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993), except to the extent that the defendants\u2019 actions in 1998 might relate to their knowledge and intent regarding events in 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b651-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b652-6\">. We can only speculate that the magistrate judge was referring to medical records that might have been submitted by Williams in another civil rights action, Cause No. 3:00-CV-436, which was dismissed for want of prosecution in November 2000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
