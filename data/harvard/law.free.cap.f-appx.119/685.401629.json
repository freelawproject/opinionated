Noor argues that the IJ erred in finding that her testimony was not credible. She argues further that she is entitled to asylum and withholding of removal because she will be subjected to persecution and torture based on her religious beliefs and activities if she is returned to Pakistan.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-24\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms without opinion and essentially adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). The IJ articulated cogent reasons, supported by substantial evidence in the record, for rejecting Noor\u2019s testimony as lacking credibility. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). The record does not compel reversal of the IJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>adverse credibility determination and his concomitant determination that Noor has not carried her burden of proving her entitlement to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the CAT. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 907; <em>Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 666-67 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Because the IJ\u2019s finding that Noor\u2019s testimony was not credible is sufficient grounds for affirming the BIA\u2019s decision, we need not reach the IJ\u2019s alternative ruling. <em>See Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b711-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
