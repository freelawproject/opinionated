Elias-Zaca</em>rias, 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817; see <em>also Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Where an asylum claim is involved, an alien must show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution that is \u201cboth subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>see also Kebede v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 808, 811 (9th Cir.2004). And the claimed perseeution must be on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>Fisher, </em>79 F.3d at 962. The withholding standard is more stringent. <em>Ghaly, </em>58 F.3d at 1428-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Here, the harassing events spelled out in the record are not so compelling as to require a reasonable factfinder to find past or fear of future persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995). Moreover, Hayrapetyan\u2019s choice and ability to continue living alone in Armenia for almost one year after the last incident emphasizes that the harm suffered by her and her family did not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). As Hayrapetyan, her husband and her daughter\u2019s claims did not meet the requirements for eligibility for asylum, they are not entitled to withholding of deportation either. <em>See Ghaly, </em>58 F.3d at 1429; <em>see also de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Nor did the BIA or IJ err when they determined that Hayrapetyan, her husband and her daughter were not entitled to relief under the Convention Against Torture. On the information in this record, we cannot say that Hayrapetyan, her husband and her daughter have demonstrated that it is more likely than not that they would be tortured if returned to Armenia. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(e)(2); <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282-84 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-14\">.
