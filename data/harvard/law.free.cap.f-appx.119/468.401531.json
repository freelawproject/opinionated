The immigration judge (IJ) found Curumi\u2019s testimony incredible and, based upon this finding, denied his claims for asylum, withholding of deportation, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Because we conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, although supported by substantial evidence, is not by itself a sufficient basis for the denial of relief, we grant the petition for review, vacate the order of the BIA, and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-18\">The following are the factual assertions made in Curumi\u2019s asylum application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Curumi is a native of Albania and grew up in the city of Luzii Vogel. His family was classified by the ruling communist regime as \u201ckulak\u201d \u2014 enemies of the government. Curumi was a member of the Democratic Party and was involved in a student group in the Albanian capital of Tirana (approximately 40 miles from Luzii Vogel), where he took correspondence courses. In 1991, he was arrested following a protest in Tirana and was held for 24 hours, during which time he was beaten by the police. Upon his return to Luzii Vogel, he was arrested and held for three days, during which time he was again beaten by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-19\">The Democratic Party came to power in 1992, and Curumi was rewarded for his loyalty with a small store, which he converted into a billiards parlor. As it became clear to Curumi that the new regime was corrupt, he began to speak out against it. As a result, police harassed Curumi\u2019s customers, and he was arrested twice in 1992. He was beaten during both arrests; during the first, his arm was broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-20\">Curumi went to Italy in 1993 and spent a year working there. When his employment contract ended, he returned to Albania and opened another business. Subsequently, Curumi and others began criticizing government-sponsored investment schemes that routinely failed. (Cu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>rumi himself invested and lost the equivalent of U.S. $5,000 in one of the schemes.) In response, police repeatedly harassed Curumi at his business, sometimes threatening to kill him. He was also arrested and jailed overnight in 1995, during which time police labeled him a traitor for opposing the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In 1997, police came to Curumi\u2019s home to arrest him. Finding Curumi absent, they arrested his father instead. Curumi surrendered to the police the next day in exchange for his father\u2019s release. He was held for three days, during which time he was beaten. The ostensible reason for the arrest was the fact that Curumi\u2019s automobile had been found abandoned; however, no charges were filed. Shortly after this incident the Curumi family moved to Durres, Albania, in an effort to escape harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Curumi ultimately became disaffected with the Democratic Party and became loyal to a faction of the party headed by Azem Hajdari. He attended meetings in Kavaje, Albania, where he participated in protests. In July 2000, he was arrested after one such protest and jailed for three days. He was then transferred to a prison in Durres, where he was held for 25 days. During this detention, Curumi was beaten, and he witnessed the torture of other prisoners through extraction of teeth with a rifle barrel and forced sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In August 2000, having been warned by a cousin on the police force that his murder was being planned, Curumi entered the United States on a false passport. Upon arrival in Chicago, Curumi told immigration officials that his passport was false and that he wished to obtain asylum. Thereafter, he formally sought asylum, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2004), withholding of deportation, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (West 1999), and relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (CAT), <em>see </em>United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, <em>adopted </em>Dec. 10, 1984, art. 3, 23 I.L.M. 1027, 1028, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, 114. Following a hearing at which Curumi testified, the IJ denied all relief, concluding that Curumi\u2019s testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">We turn first to the BIA\u2019s determination that Curumi is not entitled to asylum or withholding of deportation. With certain exceptions not relevant here, asylum is available to one who can demonstrate that he is a \u201crefugee,\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1158(b)(1), <em>ie., </em>that he is \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (West 1999). An applicant who demonstrates past persecution is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that he has a weE-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1) (2004). An applicant who cannot demonstrate past persecution can establish a weE-founded fear of persecution by demonstrating that he has a subjectively genuine fear of persecution and that a reasonable person under the circumstances would fear persecution. <em>See Blanco de Belbruno v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 272, 284 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">The standard for demonstrating entitlement to withholding of removal is similar to, but higher than, the standard for asylum. <em>See Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 182 (3d Cir.2003). Success on a withholding of removal claim requires the alien to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted on the basis of \u201crace, rehgion, nationaEty, mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>bership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>see Ambartsoumian v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 85, 88 (3d Cir.2004). As with an asylum claim, a showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that the applicant will be persecuted if returned to his native country. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">We must affirm the decision of the BIA if it is \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). To obtain reversal, Curumi must demonstrate \u201cthat the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84. Credibility determinations of the IJ and BIA are entitled to deference so long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Figeroa v. INS, </em>886 F.2d 76, 78 (4th Cir.1989); <em>see also Mastro v. Apfel, </em>270 F.3d 171, 176 (4th Cir.2001) (stating that substantial evidence \u201cconsists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201c[A] trier of fact who rejects a witness\u2019s positive testimony because in his or her judgment it lacks credibility should offer a specific, cogent reason for ... disbelief.\u201d <em>Figeroa, </em>886 F.2d at 78 (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Perfect consistency is not required of an asylum applicant; the BIA has acknowledged that those who flee persecution may not have precise recall. <em>See, e.g., In re B-, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 66, 70 (BIA 1995) (concluding that applicant\u2019s testimony was not incredible simply because he was unable to recall precise dates).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Curumi maintains that the discrepancies noted by the IJ as supporting her adverse credibility determination are either nonexistent or easily explained. While we agree with Curumi that not all of the cited discrepancies support the adverse credibility determination, ultimately we conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the IJ\u2019s finding that Curumi\u2019s testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The IJ noted inconsistencies in the following areas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-10\"><em>Education: </em>On his asylum application, Curumi indicated that he attended high school from September 1984 until May 1988. In supplemental materials, Curumi indicated that he attended correspondence courses in Tirana, which led to his involvement in the student protest group. The IJ noted that at the hearing, Curumi testified that \u201che attended night school for five years, graduated in 1989, and then studied one-and-a-half years of college-level agricultural studies as a correspondence student.\u201d J.A. 16. The IJ stated that Curumi\u2019s inconsistencies regarding his education \u2014 including his \u201comission\u201d of his correspondence studies from the asylum application \u2014 \u201ccall into question whether he attended college, thereby making his political activity as a university student implausible.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\"><em>Detentions: </em>The IJ generally found that Curumi \u201cwas inconsistent in his recollection of the length, general time of year, and circumstances of his detentions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She noted inconsistencies in the following specific areas: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number><em>1991 arrest in Tirana: </em>Curumi\u2019s asylum application states that he was arrested in February 1991 and detained for 24 hours. During the asylum hearing, however, he testified that the detention lasted only six hours; he further stated that he could not recall when in 1991 the detention occurred. Additionally, Curumi testified that during this detention he observed law enforcement officers torturing other prisoners by removing their teeth with rifle barrels, but his asylum application claimed that he observed this and other forms of torture during a detention in 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-4\"><em>Further police contact in 1991: </em>Although Curumi\u2019s asylum application states that he was arrested in Luzii Vogel almost immediately after the Tirana detention, he testified at the asylum hearing that he had no further contact with the police in 1991. But, he also testified that he was again arrested near \u201cthe end of 1991 or the beginning of 1992\u201d and that during this arrest his arm was broken. <em>Id. </em>at 24. The asylum application does recount that the police broke Curumi\u2019s arm, but identifies the date of the incident as April or May 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\"><em>1992-199S: </em>Curumi\u2019s asylum application states that in July or August 1992 he \u201cwas arrested and imprisoned.... Police wearing black masks beat me with batons and lengths of rubber hose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67. During the hearing, however, Curumi testified that he was called to talk with the chief of police, but not imprisoned, between the breaking of his arm in 1991-92 and when he went to Italy in 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\"><em>Detention after Hajdari meeting: </em>In his asylum application, Curumi stated that he was arrested after a July 2000 meeting of the Hajdari faction. According to the asylum application, Curumi was detained for three days in Kavaje, then transferred to a prison in Durres, where he was detained for 25 days. During the hearing, however, Curumi testified that he was held for 24 hours in Kavaje, then for 27 days in Durres. When questioned about this inconsistency, Curumi asserted that the asylum application was incorrect \u2014 his three-day detention in Kavaje took place in 1992.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The IJ concluded that Curumi\u2019s \u201cinconsistencies and omissions, and his failure to provide a plausible explanation for them, cast doubt on whether he experienced persecution in the form of detention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\"><em>Democratic Party membership: </em>In his asylum application, Curumi stated that he \u201cnever officially renounced\u201d his party membership but that he \u201cgrew disenchanted\u201d with the party and became a part of Hajdari\u2019s faction. <em>Id. </em>at 65. During the asylum hearing, however, Curumi testified that he resigned his membership from the Democratic Party, stopped paying his dues, and turned in his party identification. When questioned about the discrepancy, Curumi said he did not remember his asylum application saying that he never renounced his party membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">We have reviewed the record in its entirety, and in our view the IJ made too much out of some perceived discrepancies. For example, the IJ doubted Curumi\u2019s involvement in the student movement because his asylum application \u201comitted his studies as a correspondence student and was inconsistent with his testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. However, Curumi\u2019s participation in correspondence studies was noted in his supplemental materials, and he provided what appears to be a rational explanation for his failure to list it on the asylum application (i.e., that Albanians do not consider correspondence studies to be \u201cschool\u201d). There was thus no omission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>and the differences between the asylum application and Curumi\u2019s testimony are not as significant as the IJ made them out to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The same view may be taken of Curumi\u2019s inconsistent recollection of his 1991 arrest and detention in Tirana. It appears to be undisputed that Curumi was detained and severely beaten. Nevertheless, the IJ seized on Curumi\u2019s inability to recall the <em>length of </em>his detention. While under some circumstances an inability to recall the particulars of an event may provide a basis for an adverse credibility determination, it is important to bear in mind that Curumi was detained and beaten on numerous occasions for varying lengths of time. The fact that he may have confused the particulars of these traumatic events is not, alone, a death knell for his credibility.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 476 (3d Cir.2003) (\u201cCaution is required [in basing a credibility determination on differences between an asylum application and hearing testimony] because of the numerous factors that might make it difficult for an alien to articulate his/her circumstances with the degree of consistency one might expect from someone who is neither burdened with the language difficulties, nor haunted by the traumatic memories.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Despite these concerns, we nevertheless conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. For example, we cannot accept Curumi\u2019s assertion that the discrepancies concerning police detentions following the detention in Tirana, including the date of his broken arm, are \u201cexceedingly minor inconsistencies\u201d that \u201cdo nothing to detract from [his] credibility.\u201d Opening Br. of Pet\u2019r Nusret Curumi at 27. To the contrary, these inconsistencies may plausibly be viewed as indications of Curumi\u2019s inability to keep his stories straight. The same may be said of Curumi\u2019s vastly different statements regarding his Democratic Party membership, particularly when viewed in light of his failure to offer a cogent explanation for the differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The question remains, however, whether the adverse credibility determination is necessarily fatal to Curumi\u2019s asylum and withholding of deportation claims. We faced a nearly identical situation in <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361 (4th Cir.2004), and answered that question in the negative. We find that <em>Camara </em>is controlling here and that we must remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">In <em>Camara, </em>as here, the IJ denied relief based upon an adverse credibility determination that was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 368-69. While we acknowledged that an adverse credibility determination is often fatal to an asylum claim, <em>see id. </em>at 369, we noted that when \u201cthe applicant can prove actual past persecution, ... a presumption arises that she has the requisite level of fear of persecution, and thus she need not prove the subjective component of \u2018well-founded fear,\u2019 \u201d for which credibility is essential, <em>id. </em>at 369-70. Because Camara had presented independent evidence that established past persecution for her political beliefs, we concluded that remand was necessary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">This independent evidence, taken together, provided strong circumstantial evidence that Camara was imprisoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>for a political expression of opposition to the ruling government. The IJ completely ignored this evidence, instead rejecting Camara\u2019s asylum petition solely on the basis of the adverse credibility determination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">In sum, while we do not disturb the IJ\u2019s factual finding that Camara\u2019s recollections may not have been wholly trustworthy, we nevertheless conclude that the IJ erroneously overlooked Camara\u2019s other evidence in denying her application for asylum and for withholding of removal. Accordingly, we vacate the BIA\u2019s order on these claims ... and remand for further consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 370-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Here, as in <em>Camara, </em>there is substantial independent evidence of past persecution that was not considered by the IJ. The most compelling of this evidence consists of two medical reports indicating that Curumi was beaten by police. Arrest reports corresponding to the dates of the medical reports indicate that Curumi was arrested for engaging in anti-government protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Curumi also presented affidavits from psychologist Karen Hanscom and physician Bruce Slater. Dr. Hanscom diagnosed Curumi as suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the symptoms of which included avoidance of police, fear of being killed, hypervigilance, and problems with concentration and memory. She characterized these symptoms as \u201cconsistent with symptoms seen in other individuals who have experienced physical and emotional torture and trauma.\u201d J.A. 36. Dr. Hanscom further stated that Curumi\u2019s depression and PTSD \u201care the direct result of the trauma and the physical and psychological abuses that Mr. Curumi experienced in Albania. I find the symptoms to be consistent with the history of trauma and torture that he reports.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For his part, Dr. Slater found scars on Curumi\u2019s legs and scalp, the latter of which was \u201cconsistent with blunt trauma.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. Dr. Slater concluded that Curumi showed signs of PTSD \u201cas well as physical evidence of beating with blunt objects, consistent with the history that he has given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Additionally, Curumi presented evidence that pro-democracy activists in Albania regularly suffer persecution. Nicholas Pa\u00f1o, a former history professor who is an expert regarding Albanian politics, stated in an affidavit that \u201cthe events that Nusret Curumi has described ... are consistent with political events and conditions in Albania at the times noted in his statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38. The record also contains a 2001 State Department report on Albania which indicates that local police officers arbitrarily detain individuals and regularly engage in beatings. And, a May 2001 report by Amnesty International indicates that Democratic Party supporters are routinely detained and beaten by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">This documentary evidence, and those portions of Curumi\u2019s testimony that the IJ did not specifically reject, provide substantial support for a finding that Curumi has suffered persecution at the hands of the Albanian government. <em>Cf. Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 370 (concluding that arrest report, party membership card, letter from party leader, arrest warrant, and State Department report \u201cprovided strong circumstantial evidence\u201d supporting claim of past persecution). If accepted, this evidence would support both a claim for asylum and a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>Because, as in <em>Camara, </em>the IJ failed to consider this independent evidence, we vacate the decision of the BIA and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Curumi also sought relief under the CAT. As a signatory to the CAT, the United States has pledged \u201cnot [to] expel, extradite, or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\u201d <em>Lopez-Soto v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 228, 239 (4th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). In order to establish eligibility for relief under the CAT, Curumi must demonstrate that \u201cit is more likely than not\u201d that he would be tortured if returned to Albania. <em>Id. </em>at 239-40 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTorture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... for any reason based on discrimination of any kind ... by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The IJ denied relief under the CAT based solely on \u201cthe reasons cited above in the denial of Asylum,\u201d J.A. 19, <em>i.e., </em>Curumi\u2019s lack of credibility. However, \u201c[b]e-cause there is no subjective component for granting relief under the CAT, [an] adverse credibility determination ... would not necessarily defeat [a] CAT claim.\u201d <em>Camara, </em>378 F.3d at 371. The independent evidence that supports Curumi\u2019s asylum claim likewise supports his claim under the CAT. <em>See id. </em>at 371-72; <em>id. </em>at 372 (noting that IJ violated INS regulations by failing to consider independent evidence demonstrating likelihood of torture); <em>see also Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 184 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201c[W]e hold that the INS may not deny an alien\u2019s CAT claim solely on the basis of its determination that the applicant\u2019s testimony is not credible.\u201d). We therefore vacate the decision of the BIA as to the denial of relief under the CAT and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the order of the BIA and remand for further proceedings. Additionally, as we did in <em>Camara, </em>we recommend assignment to a different immigration judge on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-14\">. At the time of the immigration proceedings, Curumi spoke little or no English. Accordingly, all filings, interviews, and testimony were facilitated by interpreters.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b497-6\">. Curumi attempts to turn the IJ's credibility finding into a legal error (subject to de novo review) by asserting that the IJ applied an incorrect legal standard. The IJ clearly stated the correct standard, however. Therefore, there is no legal error and the only question is whether the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">. The IJ made a point of noting that a doctor told Curumi his arm was \"fractured,\u201d while Curumi stated that it was \"broken.\u201d It is not clear that the IJ relied on this difference in making her credibility determination. To the extent she did so, however, she erred; \"fractured\u201d and \"broken\u201d are synonyms. <em>Compare Random House College Dictionary </em>171 (rev. ed. 1980) (defining \"broken\u201d in part as \"ruptured; torn; <em>fractured\u201d </em>(emphasis added)), <em>with id. </em>at 524 (defining \"fracture\u201d in part as \"the breaking of a bone\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
