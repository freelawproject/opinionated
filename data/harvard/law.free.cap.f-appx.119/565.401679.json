It is well established that a district court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity is an appealable final decision within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment. <em>Renn v. Garrison, </em>100 F.3d 344, 349 (4th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985)). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a defense of qualified immunity de novo. <em>Hodge v. Jones, </em>31 F.3d 157, 163 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Johnson v. Pearson, </em>316 F.Supp.2d 307 (E.D.Va.2004). We deny Johnson\u2019s motions for sanctions and to dismiss the appeal for failure to prosecute. We express no view as to whether Johnson will ultimately be able to establish the objective and subjective elements of his ETS claim. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
