We have jurisdiction pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for substantial evidence a finding of statutory ineligibility for suspension of deportation based on a lack of good moral character. <em>Ramos v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1264, 1266 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-15\">Petitioner was twice convicted of theft under California Penal Code \u00a7 484(a). Petitioner contends that the crimes were part of a single scheme of criminal misconduct and therefore he is not deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(2)(A)(ii) (\u201cAny alien who at any time after admission is convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct, regardless of whether the convictions were in a single trial, is deportable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">The crimes occurred on different dates and in different locations. Petitioner\u2019s evidence of a \u201cplan or program of future action,\u201d offered to show that the crimes were part of a single scheme was based on inconsistent testimony in the record. <em>See Leon-Hernandez v. INS, </em>926 F.2d 902, 904-05 (9th Cir.1991) (explaining that in order to rebut the presumption of separate crimes created by the fact that the crimes were committed on different dates, petitioner must show evidence of a \u201cplan or program of future action.\u201d). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the IJ properly found that Petitioner was deportable by reason of two criminal convictions involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. <em>See id. </em>at 905; <em>United States v. Esparza-Ponce, </em>193 F.3d 1133, 1135-37 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that petty theft is a crime of moral turpitude).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Further, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of suspension of deportation because Petitioner committed two crimes involving moral turpitude and he is therefore not a person of good moral character for purposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(f)(3); <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Petitioner\u2019s regulatory challenge to the BIA\u2019s streamlining of his case is unpersuasive. <em>See Garcia-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 1066, 1078-79 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Petitioner\u2019s due process challenge fails because he did not demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">Petitioner\u2019s motion to remand is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">The Clerk shall amend the docket to indicate that Attorney General John Ashcroft is the proper respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b180-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
