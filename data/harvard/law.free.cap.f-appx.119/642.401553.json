Following a remand by this court pursuant to <em>Thompson v. Montgomery, </em>853 F.2d 287 (5th Cir.1988), the district court determined that Daley had failed to establish that he had filed a timely notice of appeal. The clerk\u2019s office has directed Daley to brief this jurisdictional issue, but he has faded to do so. Daley has effectively abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s determination that his notice of appeal was untimely, <em>see Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987), and this court is without appellate jurisdiction. <em>See Dison v. Whitley, </em>20 F.3d 185, 186 (5th Cir.1994). Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED. Daley\u2019s COA application is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; COA DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b668-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
