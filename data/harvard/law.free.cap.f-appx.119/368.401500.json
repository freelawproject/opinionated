She also asks for review of a subsequent decision of the BIA rejecting her request that the Board reconsider its first decision. Because we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen her case, we will reject the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-26\">Valenzuela entered the United States without inspection in 1991. After marry<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>ing an American citizen, she applied for an adjustment in her status to lawful permanent resident on July 10, 1997. At her Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) interview, Valenzuela was directed to submit documentary evidence in support of her application. She claims that she gave the evidence to her attorney who apparently never forwarded it to the INS. The INS thus denied her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Following the denial of her adjustment application, the INS mailed Valenzuela a Notice to Appear informing her that a hearing would be scheduled for her to show cause as to why she should not be deported. The notice was mailed on March 16, 2001 to an address in Jersey City, New Jersey that Valenzuela had provided to the INS. Valenzuela claims that a fire destroyed her apartment on February 3, 1999, forcing her to move to another location in Jersey City. She therefore did not receive the Notice to Appear. A subsequent Notice of Hearing was mailed on April 4, 2001, which Valenzuela also claims she did not receive. The Notice of Hearing set a hearing date of May 8, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">When Valenzuela did not attend the hearing on May 8, another hearing was scheduled for July 3, 2001 and another Notice of Hearing was mailed to her at the same address. Valenzuela again claims that she did not receive the Notice. When Valenzuela did not attend that hearing, the Immigration Judge (IJ) issued a summary decision, <em>in absentia, </em>ordering that she be deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">On November 2, 2002, Valenzuela moved to reopen her deportation proceedings. The IJ denied her motion on December 24, 2002. Valenzuela then appealed to the BIA, which dismissed her appeal on October 23, 2003. She subsequently filed a new motion asking the BIA to reconsider its decision, but this motion was denied on December 15, 2003. She now asks this Court for review of both decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Both parties agree that we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2) to review the BIA\u2019s October 23, 2003 decision denying Valenzuela\u2019s appeal of her motion to reopen her case. The Government contends that we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s December 15, 2003 decision rejecting Valenzuela\u2019s motion requesting that the BIA reconsider its previous decision because she failed to file a petition for review within thirty days of the BIA\u2019s decision, as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The record in this case shows that Valenzuela filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s October 23, 2003 decision on November 20, 2003. There is no evidence that she filed a separate petition for review of the BIA\u2019s December 15, 2003 decision. Therefore, we agree with the Government that we may review only the BIA\u2019s initial decision rejecting her appeal of the IJ\u2019s motion to reopen her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">Section 240 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a) permits orders of removal to be entered <em>in absentia </em>under certain circumstances. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-13\">Any alien who, after written notice required under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title has been provided to the alien or the alien\u2019s counsel of record, does not attend a proceeding under this section, shall be ordered removed in absentia if the Service establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable (as defined in subsection (e)(2) of this section). The written notice by the Attorney General shall be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>sufficient for purposes of this subparagraph if provided at the most recent address provided under section 1229(a)(1)(F) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(A). An order of removal entered <em>in absentia </em>may be rescinded \u201cupon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Valenzuela argued in her motion to reopen that she did not receive notice of her hearing because her apartment had been destroyed by fire and she had been forced to relocate to a new address. In support of her claim, she submitted a fire incident report prepared by the Jersey City Fire Department. She did not, however, submit an affidavit or any other evidence in which she personally attested to the fact that she had not received notice of the hearing. The IJ denied her motion to reopen, finding that the fire incident report did not clearly establish that Valenzuela\u2019s apartment had been destroyed and that, regardless, Valenzuela had a responsibility to inform the INS of any changes to her address. The BIA subsequently dismissed her appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision, finding that Valenzuela had failed to overcome the presumption of effective service that attaches to the use of regular mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision denying Valenzuela\u2019s motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on the record that was before it, we cannot conclude that the BIA abused its discretion in this case. It is undisputed that the INS attempted to provided notice to Valenzuela on three separate occasions. None of the letters sent to Valenzuela by the INS was returned by the Postal Service as undeliverable. In addition, as the Government notes, the documentary evidence submitted by Valenzuela does not establish that her apartment was destroyed by fire, but only that a fire occurred. Finally, Valenzuela failed to submit an affidavit with her initial motion to reopen attesting to the fact that she did not receive notice from the INS regarding her hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">Valenzuela nonetheless argues that the BIA erred in relying on <em>In re Grijalva, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 27 (1995), for the proposition that \u201cthere is a presumption that the Postal Service properly performs its duties\u201d which can only be overcome with \u201c \u2018substantial and probative evidence.\u2019\u201d (App. 15 <em>(quoting Grijalva, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 37).) In <em>Grijalva, </em>the INS had notified the alien using certified mail. Since that decision was issued, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a) has been amended to permit notice by regular mail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At least two other courts of appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>have held that the use of regular mail necessarily entails a weaker presumption of delivery and therefore the evidentiary requirements of <em>Grijalva </em>should not apply in such cases. <em>See Ghounem v. Ashcroft, </em>878 F.3d 740, 744-45 (8th Cir.2004); <em>Salta v. INS, </em>314 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">While we agree with Valenzuela that the use of regular mail entails a weaker presumption than the use of certified mail, we still find that a presumption of delivery attaches. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in requiring Valenzuela to rebut that presumption through the use of specific evidence such as an affidavit attesting to the fact that she did not receive notice of the hearing. <em>See Salta, </em>314 F.3d at 1079. While an affidavit may not be necessary in all such cases, it was not an abuse of discretion for the BIA to find that Valenzuela failed to rebut the presumption of effective service in light of the inconclusive nature of the other evidence she submitted. We will therefore deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b396-6\">. <em>Doherty </em>was decided before the Immigration and Naturalization Act was amended to include the current language of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5). Given the inherently discretionary nature of any decision regarding a motion to reopen a completed proceeding, we see no reason why the logic of that decision should not apply to this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\">. In conjunction with her motion asking the BIA to reconsider its earlier decision, Valenzuela did submit such an affidavit. As explained above, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision denying that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\">. That section now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">In removal proceedings under section 1229a of this title, written notice (in this section referred to as a \"notice to appear\u201d) shall be given in person to the alien (or, if personal service is not practicable, through service by mail to the alien or to the alien's counsel of record, if any)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1). The BIA has held that personal service is \"not practicable\u201d if the alien is \"not present in immigration court,\u201d <em>Grijalva, </em>21 I &amp; N. Dec. at 35, and the validity of that interpretation is not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
