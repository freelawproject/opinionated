We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal under the screening provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">The district court properly dismissed Harter\u2019s claims against the warden and associate warden in their individual capacities, because Harter failed to allege these defendants \u201cdirected, participated in, or had knowledge of any alleged misconduct on the part of\u2019 the Doe defendants. <em>See Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989). The claims against these defendants in their official capacities were also properly dismissed because Harter made no allegations that the defendants acted pursuant to a policy or custom of constitutional deprivation. <em>See Redman v. County of San Diego, </em>942 F.2d 1435, 1443-44 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-14\">The district court erred, however, in dismissing the action as to the Doe defendants simply because Harter was unaware of their identities at the time he filed the complaint. <em>See Wakefield v. Thompson, </em>177 F.3d 1160, 1163 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cwhere the identity of the alleged defendant! ][is] not [ ] known prior to the filing of a complaint!,] the plaintiff should be given an opportunity through discovery to identify the unknown defendants, unless it is clear that discovery would not uncover the identities, or that the complaint would be dismissed on other grounds\u201d) (quoting <em>Gillespie v. Civiletti, </em>629 F.2d 637, 942 (9th Cir.1980)). In its November 7, 2003 order, the magistrate judge properly concluded that Harter sufficiently alleged that the Doe guards\u2019 actions demonstrated deliberate indifference to his safety. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). However, the district court\u2019s December 18, 2003 dismissing the action failed to acknowledge the Doe guards\u2019 alleged participation in the Eighth Amendment violation. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Wakefield, </em>177 F.3d at 1165-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-15\">Harter\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>prejudice to Harter requesting appointment of counsel in the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part; REMANDED as to the Eighth Amendment claim against Doe defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b123-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
