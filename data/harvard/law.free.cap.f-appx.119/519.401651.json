For the reasons that follow, we remand the petitioner\u2019s case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-32\">Parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s judgment or final order to file a notice of appeal when the United States is a party, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>peal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). The appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Panhorst v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 367, 369-70 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The district court entered its order dismissing Velez\u2019s motion on October 29, 2003. Velez alleges he filed a certificate of appealability in December 2003, as evidenced by a photocopy of the signed return receipt he mailed to the Clerk of Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. In June 2004, Velez contacted the Clerk of Court for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and inquired as to whether it had received his request for a certificate of appealability because he had not received any correspondence from the district court. Finding that the district court\u2019s docket did not reveal that Velez had filed a notice of appeal, the Clerk of Court for the Fourth Circuit directed the district court to process Velez\u2019s request as a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">We now remand the case to the district court for a determination as to whether Velez actually filed a document in the district court within the requisite time period and, if so, the contents of such document. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
