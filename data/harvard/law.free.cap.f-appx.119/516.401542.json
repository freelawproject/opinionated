Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999). A motion to reconsider asserts the Board made an error in its earlier decision. The motion must \u201cstate the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Such motions are especially disfavored \u201cin a deportation proceeding, where, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. 719.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We lack jurisdiction to address Xie\u2019s arguments that she suffered past persecution for refusing to undergo a forced abortion and for resisting a coercive population control program because they were not raised in her motion to reconsider. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir.2004). For the same reason, we lack jurisdiction to review Xie\u2019s argument that she has a well founded fear of being sterilized because she violated an agreement saying she would not have any more children.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">With respect to Xie\u2019s argument that she was forced to abort a pregnancy, we conclude the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Xie\u2019s claim because she did not experience any actual harm. Finally, we conclude the Board did not abuse its discretion when it denied Xie\u2019s argument that she would be forced to have an abortion if she became pregnant again. The purpose of a motion to reconsider is to point out errors of law or fact, but Xie\u2019s argument was a new legal challenge not asserted in her initial appeal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
