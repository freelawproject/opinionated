Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without an opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision is the final agency determination for judicial review. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 831-32 (5th Cir.2003). The IJ concluded that, because Hsu remained in the United States beyond her date of voluntary departure, she was not eligible for the adjustment of status that she sought. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d); <em>see also Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 599-600 (5th Cir.1993) (motion to reopen may be denied \u201cif the movant fails to establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-22\">This court reviews the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, but if the denial rests on the IJ\u2019s finding that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>alien is not eligible for relief, this court reviews for legal error. <em>Ghassan v. INS, </em>972 F.2d 631, 637 (5th Cir.1992). This court defers to a government agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, and the agency\u2019s interpretation must be affirmed unless \u201cit is plainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado-Nunez, </em>295 F.3d 494, 496 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">An alien who remains in the United States beyond the authorized date of voluntary departure is ineligible for certain forms of relief, including adjustment of status, for 10 years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d). It is undisputed that Hsu stayed beyond her departure date. Hsu\u2019s contention that the IJ \u201ccould have\u201d reopened her case and vacated the prior order of voluntary removal does not establish that the IJ abused her discretion by not doing so. Even if the IJ made a purely legal determination based on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229e(d), Hsu does not establish that the IJ\u2019s interpretation of the law was plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b691-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
