(Home Depot). Reed, an African American, alleged Home Depot failed to promote him based on his race.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-25\">Upon de novo review, we agree with the district court that Reed failed to establish a prima facie failure-to-promote case. Among other things, he adduced no evidence that he had registered his interest for the promotions at issue in the computer-based Job Performance Program, as was required to be considered for those promotions. <em>See Younts v. Fremont County, Iowa., </em>370 F.3d 748, 754 (8th Cir.2004) (elements of prima facie case of failure to promote); <em>Wheeler v. Aventis Pharm., </em>360 F.3d 853, 857 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review). Also, we reject Reed\u2019s suggestions on appeal concerning judicial bias. Finally, we decline to consider Reed\u2019s challenge to a magistrate judge\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> denial of leave to amend to add new claims. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
