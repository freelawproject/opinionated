After Ni unsuccessfully petitioned for asylum, the government served Ni with a Notice to Appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) on March 16, 1998. Ni conceded removability before the IJ and indicated that he was seeking asylum and withholding of removal or, in the alternative, voluntary departure. The basis of his asylum claim was his allegation that the Chinese government had forcibly sterilized him. The IJ denied Ni\u2019s claims for relief on September 8, 1998. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on July 16, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">In his petition for review, Ni asserts that the IJ erred in denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence. Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). In doing so, we defer to the IJ\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cUnder this standard, we will not disturb a factual finding if it is supported by \u2018reasonable, substantial, and probative\u2019 evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)). This Court grants \u201cparticular deference\u201d to the credibility findings of the IJ. <em>Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">We find that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>nation. Ni\u2019s testimony before the IJ on the events giving rise to his claim conflicted with his 1993 asylum application on such central details as the length of his detention and the place of his forced sterilization. Cf<em>. Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 75-78 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that IJ could have reasonably found that petitioner\u2019s inability to offer consistent testimony about events forming basis of asylum claim undermined credibility). In light of Ni\u2019s starkly conflicting accounts of the events at the heart of his claim, and notwithstanding the supplemental statement he submitted, his arguments concerning the IJ\u2019s findings regarding minor and incidental details are unavailing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Furthermore, to the extent that Ni seeks relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), we do not consider the claim because he did not raise it before the IJ or BIA. <em>See Cervantes-Ascencio v. United States INS, </em>326 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-8\">. Ni raises other challenges to the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, asserting that the IJ was wrong to find that his testimony concerning the circumstances of his marriage and his lack of vasectomy scars were incredible. Even if we accept Ni\u2019s contention that the IJ\u2019s conclusions regarding these details were in error, the stark contradictions concerning the events at the heart of Ni's claim justify the IJ\u2019s denial of the claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
