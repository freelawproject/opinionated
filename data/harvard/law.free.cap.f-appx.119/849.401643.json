Mr. Matara argues that the IJ abused her discretion by failing to consider all of the evidence that he presented and by distorting his claim. We affirm the order of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-24\">Mr. Matara asserts that he is Kenyan and that he would face persecution for his political opinions if he were to return. The IJ, however, doubted Mr. Matara\u2019s credibility, since Mr. Matara admits to lying to South African authorities about his country of origin in the course of his journey from Kenya to the United States, lacks any identification documents to corroborate his Kenyan citizenship, and gave two conflicting dates on which Kenyan police allegedly arrested and harassed him for his political activities. With such evidence in the record, we cannot conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>that \u201cno reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d that Mr. Matara had \u201cthe requisite fear of persecution\u201d that qualifies him for the refugee status necessary for asylum. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a). Substantial evidence therefore supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Mr. Matara\u2019s application for asylum, and thus that ruling was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Hasalla v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 799, 803 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">To succeed on his application for withholding removal, Mr. Matara must show a clear probability of persecution, which means he must demonstrate that he more likely than not would face persecution if returned to Kenya. <em>See INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 424, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). The same is required for relief sought under Article III of the United Nations Convention Against Torture. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Since it is less difficult for Mr. Matara to prove his eligibility for asylum than to show his entitlement to withholding removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture, <em>see INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430-32, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987), <em>a fortiori </em>substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of Mr. Matara\u2019s application for withholding removal and relief under the Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
