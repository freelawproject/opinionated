Conn pleaded guilty to drug charges and was sentenced to eighty-four months in prison. In this appeal, Conn\u2019s attorney has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the district court should have departed downward from the otherwise applicable Sentencing Guidelines range because Conn\u2019s criminal history score overrepresented his criminal propensities. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b). This argument fails because the district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Parks, </em>364 F.3d 902, 906 (8th Cir.2004). Conn has filed a pro se supplemental brief and his pro se arguments also fail. Having reviewed the <em>Anders </em>brief, Conn\u2019s supplemental brief, and the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues and thus affirm. We grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny Conn\u2019s pro se motion for copies of discovery and grand jury transcripts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
