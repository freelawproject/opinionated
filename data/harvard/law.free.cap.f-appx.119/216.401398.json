EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b242-23\">David William Peer (\u201cDefendant\u201d), a federal prisoner appearing <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence, which was brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). For the reasons stated below, we DENY COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b242-25\">On March 13, 2002, Defendant pled guilty to one count of receipt and distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>tion of child pornography. The district court sentenced Defendant to 51 months in custody, followed by 36 months of supervised release. Defendant apparently did not file a direct appeal. On October 8, 2003, Defendant filed the instant Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In his motion, Defendant alleged ineffective of counsel<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a due process challenge to his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">After ordering briefing from the Government, the district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion. On appeal, Defendant has chosen not to pursue his due process claim, focusing instead on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Defendant argues to this court that his attorney was ineffective for two reasons: (1) failure to challenge a sentencing enhancement on the grounds that Defendant did not have the requisite intent; and (2) failure to challenge the constitutionality of Defendant\u2019s sentence based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1), this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of Defendant\u2019s appeal unless he first obtains a COA. In the instant case, Defendant seeks a COA from this court because the district court denied his request to appeal its decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). To prevail, Defendant must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This is accomplished by establishing that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">We hold that Defendant has failed to meet the <em>Slack </em>standard with regard to any of the issues on appeal. In order to assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Defendant must set forth specific \u201cperformance\u201d errors on the part of trial counsel and demonstrate \u201cprejudice,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, absent those errors, a different outcome would occur. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">At the outset, we note that Defendant\u2019s <em>Strickland </em>claim regarding counsel\u2019s failure to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Blakely-type </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>argument has been waived because it was not raised in the original \u00a7 2255 motion or in a subsequent motion for reconsideration. <em>See In re Walker, </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992). In any event, on the record it does not appear that trial counsel was acting in a constitutionally ineffective manner by failing to make either an <em>Apprendi </em>argument or the equivalent of a <em>Blakely-type </em>argument at sentencing. Accordingly, we will not consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Defendant also claims that counsel failed to challenge a sentencing guideline on the grounds that Defendant did not have the requisite intent. Specifically, Defendant argues that counsel should have objected to the court\u2019s imposition of a four-level enhancement for offenses involving sadistic, masochistic, or violent material because Defendant never intended to receive or distribute these images.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">This claim fails for two reasons: First, Defendant has failed to demonstrate an error that satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis. Counsel raised arguments regarding intent through a motion for downward departure, which the court ultimately denied. Counsel\u2019s failure to raise a duplicative objection to the enhancement does not render his legal assistance to Defendant ineffective. Second, Defendant has failed to show prejudice. Since the district court rejected the motion for downward departure based on lack of intent, there is no reasonable probability that it would have sustained an objection to the sentencing enhancement on exactly the same grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Having carefully considered each of the arguments before the court, we remain unconvinced that reasonable jurists could debate that Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion should have been resolved differently. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. 483-44, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Accordingly, we DENY COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-9\">. Specifically, Defendant asserted three grounds for ineffective assistance of counsel in the proceedings below: (1) counsel\u2019s failure to present certain statutes that would have prevented sentencing enhancements; (2) counsel\u2019s failure to present case law and refer back to expert witness testimony during sentencing; and (3) counsel's failure to explain the nature of the criminal accusation and provide effective advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b243-10\">. In a supplemental filing to this court, Defendant also argues that the government brief in response to his \u00a7 2255 motion was not timely filed and thus should have been struck. (Br. on Appeal at 2-5.) While it is true that the Government\u2019s brief was not filed by the court-imposed deadline, the district court chose to consider the document when ruling on the \u00a7 2255 motion. Seeing no abuse of discretion, we decline to consider the matter further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b243-16\">. Defendant applied for a COA below, but the district court took no action on the application. Under these circumstances, COA is deemed denied. <em>See </em>10th Circuit General Order of October 1, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
