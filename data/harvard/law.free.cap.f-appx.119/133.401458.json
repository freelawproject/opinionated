The facts are known to the parties and need not be recounted here.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Green argues that his conviction must be reversed because the Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) who tried the case improperly vouched for the credibility of government witnesses during closing arguments, while also denigrating Green\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u201cAs a general rule, a prosecutor may not express his opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt or his belief in the credibility of government witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Molina, </em>934 F.2d 1440, 1444 (9th Cir.1991). \u201cWhether the witnesses have testified truthfully ... is entirely for the jury to determine; it is improper to communicate that a credibility determination has been made by the AUSA, law enforcement agents, or the court, or that the government knows whether the witness is being truthful and stands behind the veracity of the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>362 F.3d 1274, 1279 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Here, the AUSA interspersed the following assertions throughout his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u201cI believe [Gloria Green] was credible what she got up there and said.... \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think [Vincent Acosta] was truthful up here on the stand.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201cI don\u2019t believe [Garr\u00f3n Green] was bein\u2019 truthful at all. At all. I found his credibility lacking completely.... I don\u2019t believe he was truthful at all....\u201d \u2018You heard [Officer Deering\u2019s] testimony. He\u2019s gonna risk his job, risk his pension, risk his career for perjury, to come in here and lie? ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">These statements constitute improper vouching because the AUSA \u201cdeliberately introduced into the case his personal opinion of the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Kerr, </em>981 F.2d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir.1992). By so doing, the AUSA usurped the jury\u2019s role of evaluating credibility and \u201cignored his special obligation to avoid improper suggestions and insinuations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">The government seeks to excuse the AUSA\u2019s impermissible statements on the ground that they were \u201cinvited\u201d by the defense\u2019s attempts to impeach the prosecution\u2019s witnesses. We have held, however, that attacks on the credibility of prosecution witnesses are \u201clegitimate tools of advocacy and [do] not, standing alone, justify such a response.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-14\">Although Green failed to object at trial to the AUSA\u2019s vouching, this prosecutorial misconduct rises to the level of plain error. Indeed, vouching is especially problematic in cases-such as this-where the witnesses\u2019 credibility is crucial. <em>See United States v. Necoechea, </em>986 F.2d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also id. </em>at 1278 (in plain error review, the court \u201cbalance[s] the seriousness of the vouching against the ... closeness of the case\u201d). Green was not in physical possession of the rifle or ammunition at the time of his arrest, and the case\u2019s outcome therefore hinged upon whether the jury found the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, or those presented by the defense, to be more credible. The AUSA improperly tipped the scales in favor of the prosecution by repeatedly offering his personal opinion of the witnesses\u2019 credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">Because the prosecutor\u2019s improper vouching necessitates reversal, we need not address the other purported errors raised by Green.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-17\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b159-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">. Green\u2019s Motion for Leave to Expand the Record is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b160-18\">BEA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aee\">Concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-19\">I separately concur to state that I would also reverse on the grounds that the district court: (1) abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>admitting evidence of the domestic dispute which preceded the arrest; (2) committed plain error in admitting the daughter\u2019s written statement; and (3) abused its discretion in admitting the tape recording of the wrife\u2019s 911 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">First, testimony regarding the domestic dispute was more prejudicial that probative and should have been excluded under Fed.R.Evid. 403. In general, courts will allow the prsecution to present evidence of \u201cother acts\u201d where such evidence is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the offense. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Vizcarra-Martinez, </em>66 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Daly, </em>974 F.2d 1215, 1216 (9th Cir.1992) (prosecutor may introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s participation in a \u201cshootout\u201d to prove \u201cpossession\u201d element). Moreover, courts will generally allow a prosecutor latitude to present a \u201ccoherent and comprehensible story\u201d to the jury. <em>See Vizcarra-Martinez, </em>66 F.3d at 1012. Here, however, detailed testimony regarding the domestic dispute was not \u201cnecessary\u201d to present a \u201ccoherent and comprehensible story.\u201d Rather, the domestic dispute had nothing to do with possession of the ammunition, except to explain why the wife hid the five .22 rounds by taping them under a bathroom shelf. Accordingly, the district court abused its discretion in allowing testimony regarding the domestic dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Second, the admission of the daugher\u2019s written statement was plain, unvarnished hearsay. There is note even a colorable exception to the hearsay rule, and if there were, there is no foundational testimony that the daughter was unavailable to testify. Under <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461 (1997), the admission of such statemnt was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Finally, as with the daughter\u2019s written statement, the admission of the tape recording is plain inadmissible hearsay, and the district court\u2019s admission of this evidence was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
