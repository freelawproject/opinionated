He contends the court lacked jurisdiction, and alternatively, challenges his sentence. We conclude the court had jurisdiction to revoke the supervised release and did not err in sentencing. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-18\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b158-19\">Cuevas-Salgado argues the district court lacked jurisdiction to revoke his supervised release imposed by a district court in Texas. We disagree. Jurisdiction over Cuevas-Salgado\u2019s supervised release was properly transferred pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605. <em>See United States v. Ohler, </em>22 F.3d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1994) (noting \u201cstatute gives a court discretion to order a transfer\u201d of jurisdiction over a person on supervised release). We reject Cuevas-Salgado\u2019s contention that transfer of jurisdiction is not proper unless the terms of his original supervised release required or permitted him \u201cto proceed\u201d to Arizona. The plain language of \u00a7 3605 authorized the transfer of jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-20\">Cuevas-Salgado also argues the district court should have departed downward or imposed a concurrent sentence for his violation of supervised release. We lack jurisdiction to consider a district court\u2019s discretionary refusal to depart downward. <em>See United States v. Linn, </em>362 F.3d 1261, 1262 (9th Cir.2004). Cuevas-Salgado seeks to avoid this jurisdictional bar by arguing the district court refused to exercise its discretion based on its misconception of the sentence imposed for Cuevas-Salgado\u2019s prior illegal reentry conviction in Texas. The record does not support that argument. Although the district court did comment that Cuevas-Salgado\u2019s prior state conviction for \u201cdeadly conduct\u201d appeared to be an aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>felony that could have been used to enhance his federal sentence in Texas, the court ultimately acknowledged it did not \u201cknow the circumstances\u201d underlying the state conviction and would sentence Cuevas-Salgado on \u201cjust what [his] record reflects and ... what the law provides.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Finally, Cuevas-Salgado contends the district court failed to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) before imposing a consecutive sentence. We have held that, although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.3(f) mandates a consecutive sentence for revocation of supervised release, district courts must nonetheless consider the statutory factors before \u201cdetermining whether to impose a consecutive rather than a concurrent sentence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Steffen, </em>251 F.3d 1273, 1278 (9th Cir.2001). We conclude the district court complied with \u00a7 3553(a) by considering \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d and by selecting a sentence \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) &amp; (2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b158-15\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
