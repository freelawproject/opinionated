Because Spencer had two prior convictions for violent felonies and one prior conviction for a serious drug offense, he was sentenced to the statutory minimum of fifteen years pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). He now appeals the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, appeals the denial of his motion to suppress, and appeals his sentence. We affirm the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b48-17\">After police executed a search warrant on the Defendant\u2019s apartment in search of drugs, money, firearms, and gang-related information, Spencer filed a motion to suppress all evidence from the search arguing the warrant was constitutionally infirm for lack of probable cause. The district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> recommendation, denied the Defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. Defendant then negotiated a plea agreement with the Government that, <em>inter alia, </em>waived his right to appeal in exchange for the Government\u2019s recommendation of a sentence not exceeding the statutory minimum of fifteen years. Prior to accepting the Defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the district court asked the Defendant several questions to verity that he had entered into the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily, and that he understood the consequences of waiving his rights. Specifically, the district court asked the Defendant if he understood that he would face a minimum fifteen-year sentence as an armed career criminal. The Defendant indicated that he understood and asked to be immediately sentenced. The district court declined and ordered a Pre-Sentence Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-18\">After entering his guilty plea but prior to sentencing, the Defendant filed a <em>pro se </em>motion seeking to withdraw his guilty plea based on ineffective assistance of counsel. The district court appointed new counsel and held an evidentiary hearing to enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>tain the Defendant\u2019s motion. Finding that there was no fair and just reason to allow the Defendant to withdraw his unconditional guilty plea, the district court denied his motion and sentenced the Defendant to fifteen years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">\u201cWhen reviewing a purported waiver, we must confirm that the appeal falls within the scope of the waiver and that both the waiver and plea agreement were entered into knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d <em>United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-90 (8th Cir.2003) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 997, 124 S.Ct. 501, 157 L.Ed.2d 398 (2003). \u201cAssuming that a waiver has been entered into knowingly and voluntarily, we will still refuse to enforce an otherwise valid waiver if to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891. A purported waiver may not be \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d when the waiver itself is tainted by ineffective assistance of counsel, <em>DeRoo v. United States, </em>223 F.3d 919, 924 (8th Cir.2000), and enforcement of a waiver may result in a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d if it prevents a defendant from appealing an illegal sentence, <em>United States v. Michelsen, </em>141 F.3d 867, 872 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">In the Defendant\u2019s plea agreement, he waived his right to pursue his pretrial motion to suppress evidence from the search, his right to appeal his sentence, and his right to post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The Defendant did not waive his right to appeal denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>Andis </em>instructs that we not review the merits of validly waived issues of appeal. 333 F.3d at 892. Consistent with <em>Andis, </em>once we conclude the Defendant\u2019s plea agreement containing the waiver was knowing and voluntary, we will not examine the merits of Defendant\u2019s issue of appeal regarding denial of his motion to suppress. However, for a waiver of the right to appeal a sentence to be valid, the sentence must comply with the terms of the agreement and otherwise be legal in addition to being knowing and voluntary. <em>Id. </em>at 892. Since the Defendant\u2019s plea agreement did not waive his right to directly appeal denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, we face no barrier to addressing the merits of this issue of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">Knowing and Voluntary Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">A decision to enter into a plea agreement cannot be knowing and voluntary when the plea agreement itself is the result of advice that falls below the range of competence for attorneys in criminal cases. <em>DeRoo, </em>223 F.3d at 924 (citations omitted). An \u201cimportant way a district court can help ensure that a plea agreement and corresponding waiver are entered into knowingly and voluntarily is to properly question a defendant about his or her decision to enter that agreement....\u201d <em>Andis, </em>333 F.3d at 890-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">The Defendant claims his appointed counsel failed to adequately explain the consequences of entering the guilty plea. The Defendant argues that, had he known that he faced a minimum fifteen-year sentence under the plea agreement, he would not have pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">Other than vague and unsubstantiated accusations, the Defendant has not produced any evidence showing his counsel was ineffective, that his counsel failed to explain the agreement to him, or that the Defendant did not understand the plea agreement. Even if we were to assume that Defendant\u2019s counsel failed to explain the agreement to the Defendant, this error did not prejudice the Defendant because the district court, prior to accepting the Defendant\u2019s guilty plea, specifically questioned him to ensure he understood the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>agreement and the fifteen-year minimum sentence. Accordingly, we find that the Defendant did not suffer ineffective assistance of counsel and, therefore, entered into the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Denial of Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We hold the Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. Accordingly, we dismiss this issue of the Defendant\u2019s appeal without reaching the underlying merits. <em>Id. </em>at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Illegality of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">A \u201cdefendant has the right to appeal an illegal sentence, even though there exists an otherwise valid waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891-92. \u201c[T]he illegal sentence exception to general enforceability of an appeal waiver is an extremely narrow exception. Any sentence imposed within the statutory range is not subject to appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Defendant argues that his sentence is illegal because one or more of his three prior convictions did not satisfy the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). We disagree. Defendant has a 1968 conviction for Burglary with Intent to Commit Theft, a 1970 conviction for Murder, and a 1999 conviction for Third Degree Possession of Cocaine with Intent to Sell. The first two convictions qualify as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B), and the last conviction qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A). Because the three prior convictions qualify the Defendant for the fifteen-year minimum sentence under \u00a7 924(e), we find that the sentence is within the terms of the plea agreement and is otherwise legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Finding the Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence, we dismiss this issue of the Defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">Withdrawal of Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Lastly, the Defendant argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The Defendant bears the burden of proving an appropriate basis to support a withdrawal of his guilty plea. <em>United States v. </em>Prior, 107 F.3d 654, 657 (8th Cir.1997). \u201cA defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty ... after the court accepts the plea, but before it imposes sentence if ... the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed. R.Crim. P. 11(d)(2). The district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a plea is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Morales, </em>120 F.3d 744, 747 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">According to the Defendant, he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel in the negotiations and entry of his guilty plea, and thus can show a fair and just ground to withdraw his guilty plea. Since we have already held that the Defendant has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, it follows his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot provide a basis of showing a fair and just reason to withdraw his guilty plea. We therefore hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the Defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-13\">The district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-13\">.
