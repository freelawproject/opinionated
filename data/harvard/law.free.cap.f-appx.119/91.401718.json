We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). We review the BIA\u2019s decision that Petitioner has not established eligibility for asylum under the substantial evidence standard, <em>Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1998), and reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion, <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">The record does not compel reversal of the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Abdella failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because Abdella was unable to show that her brother was killed by Tigray officials, or that she herself was targeted for persecution. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1094-95 (9th Cir.2002). Furthermore, political changes in Ethiopia since Abdella left in 1992 suggest that she does not have a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1096 (noting that if no past persecution is established, the IJ and BIA are entitled to rely on all relevant evidence in the record, including a State Department Report). Accordingly, Abdella failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-17\">Abdella is not entitled <em>to </em>relief under the CAT because she did not demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if returned to Ethiopia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b118-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
