On appeal, we liberally construe Mr. Nortonseris pleadings and submissions to this court. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir.1998). In so doing, we do not believe jurists of reason would find debatable the district court\u2019s procedural dismissal of Mr. Nortonsen\u2019s petition, <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 478, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), and we therefore deny COA and Mr. Nortonsen\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis Cifp).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-20\">The issuance of a COA is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. </em>Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). A COA can issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When a district court has dismissed a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a certificate will issue when \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. \u201cThe COA determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>tion under \u00a7 2253(c) requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029. \u201cThis threshold inquiry does not require full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims. In fact, the statute forbids it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While Mr. Nortonsen is not required to prove the merits of his case to obtain a COA, he must demonstrate \u201csomething more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith on his ... part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029 (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Mr. Nortonsen was convicted by an Arizona jury of first-degree escape, aggravated robbery, and aggravated assault. Judgment was entered against him on January 3, 1995, and he was sentenced to forty-two years incarceration. The Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence on October 17, 1996. Mr. Nortonsen did not petition the Arizona Supreme Court for certiorari review, but he did file a petition for post-conviction relief in state court on April 25,1995, while his state appellate action was pending. The petition was denied on the same day. Mr. Nortonsen did not appeal that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Mr. Nortonsen\u2019s instant petition was received in federal court on March 9, 2004. He alleged (1) the Arizona courts lacked jurisdiction over his case, (2) he was subjected to double punishment, (3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel, (4) he was denied pre-sentence credit for his convictions, and (5) he was subjected to \u201cshuttling\u201d in violation of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers and the Uniform Mandatory Disposition Detainers Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied Mr. Nortonsen\u2019s petition on the ground that all his claims were time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">In reaching its decision, the district court noted that under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), a one-year limitation period applies to habeas actions brought by a person in custody pursuant to a state court judgment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (\u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of \u2014 (A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review....\u201d). The court then determined the one-year limitation period on any habeas action brought by Mr. Nortonsen began to run in November 1996. Mr. Nortonsen had a year from November 1996 to file his habeas petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">The district court also rejected any potential argument that the time limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>in \u00a7 2244(d) should be equitably tolled for Mr. Nortonsen. Tolling may occur where a petitioner has diligently pursued his claims and demonstrated that his failure to timely file his habeas action was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his control. <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000). The district court noted Mr. Nortonsen failed to allege he diligently pursued his claims, or that extraordinary circumstances existed preventing the timely filing of his habeas action. Likewise, the court found Mr. Norton\u2019s allegations of ignorance regarding \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s limitation period and his inability to receive legal assistance on his habeas action insufficient to constitute extraordinary circumstances. Hence, the court determined Mr. Nortonseris petition for habeas relief was barred by the one-year limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We have carefully reviewed the district court\u2019s order, the record on appeal, and Mr. Nortonseris submissions. Mr. Nortonsen makes almost no reference to the district court\u2019s procedural ruling against him, nor does he present any argument countering the court\u2019s timeliness ruling. We are not convinced jurists of reason would find debatable the district court\u2019s ultimate ruling that Mr. Nortonseris claims were time barred. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595. The court correctly concluded Mr. Nortonsen had to bring his habeas action within the year following November 1996. Likewise, Mr. Nortonseris allegations of ignorance regarding the limitations period and lack of assistance from counsel are not sufficient to establish extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling. <em>See Marsh, </em>223 F.3d at 1220 (ignorance of law generally does not excuse late filing of <em>pro se </em>prisoner); <em>Swazo v. Wyo. Dep\u2019t of Corrs. State Penitentiary Warden, </em>23 F.3d 332, 333 (10th Cir.1994) (\u201cthere is no constitutional right to counsel beyond the appeal of a criminal conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">We therefore DENY Mr. Nortonseris application for COA and his request to proceed <em>ifp, </em>and we DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-14\"> After examining appellant's brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-6\">. While Mr. Nortonsen framed his entire petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the district court construed his first three claims attacking the validity of his conviction and sentence under \u00a7 2254, and his last two claims attacking the execution of his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 865 (10th Cir.2000) (\u00a7 2254 serves as means to challenge validity of conviction or sentence and \u00a7 2241 serves as means to attack execution of sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\">. We note the district court, in calculating the specific date of the finality of Mr. Nortonsen\u2019s conviction, mistakenly applied Colorado law. This mistake is of no consequence. Under Arizona law, Mr. Nortonsen had thirty days to file a petition for review of the appellate decision affirming his conviction. <em>See </em>Ariz. R.Crim. Pro. 31.19 (\"Within 30 days after the filing of a decision or within 15 days after the clerk has mailed notice of the determination of a motion for reconsideration, any party may file with the clerk of the Court of Appeals a petition for review by the Supreme Court.\u201d). Because of Mr. Nortonsen\u2019s failure to appeal his conviction to the Arizona Supreme Court, it became final on November 16, 1996. Consequently, he had a year from that date to bring his habeas action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
