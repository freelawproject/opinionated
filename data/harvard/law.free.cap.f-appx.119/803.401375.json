The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim, and Powell appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">Powell alleges that five employees of UW-Whitewater \u2014 Howard Ross, the dean of the Department of Social Work; Janet Wright, the chairperson of the department; Charles Zastrow and Karen Kirst-Ashman, two faculty members in the department; and Eugene Fujimoto, the assistant to the chancellor for affirmative action \u2014 conspired to ruin his career by fabricating sexual harassment charges against him. In November 2001, a student complained to Ross, Wright, Zastrow, and Kirst-Ashman that Powell had made \u201cunwelcome sexual advances and comments\u201d to her in his office. These four defendants, allegedly in an effort to \u201cprocurfe] a false complaint of sexual harassment against the plaintiff,\u201d attempted to \u201cin-flam[e] [the student\u2019s] fears and foment[ ] her anxiety\u201d by telling her \u2014 falsely, Powell asserts \u2014 that a number of students, faculty, and staff had also complained that Powell sexually harassed them in the past, and that he had been disciplined for his misbehavior. This led the student to submit a formal complaint to the department dean, who sent it to Fujimoto, in which she stated that she had \u201crecently learned that [she] was the fourth or fifth female student who ha[d] complained to the University about very similar conduct on the part of Professor Powell.\u201d The four members of the department also told Fujimoto directly about Powell\u2019s alleged history of sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">Powell asserts that Fujimoto knew these allegations were baseless, but nonetheless in May 2002 issued a \u201cSexual harassment Complaint Finding\u201d against him and forwarded it to the chancellor of the university. This report concluded that Powell had \u201cengaged in behavior involving inappropriate and offensive comments and evidenced a clear lack of judgment on the part of a member of the faculty.\u201d Fujimoto recommended that the chancellor discipline Powell by placing a \u201cstrong letter of reprimand\u201d in his personnel file; requiring Powell and the social work department to undergo sexual harassment training; mandating that Powell keep his office door open when meeting with students; and warning him that further complaints would result in \u201cmore serious measures.\u201d The chancellor accepted Fujimoto\u2019s findings, formally charged Powell with violating the University Handbook\u2019s sexual harassment provisions, and adopted Fujimoto\u2019s recommendations for disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">In October 2003, Powell filed this suit, alleging that Fujimoto and the other de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>fendants, by accusing him falsely and then punishing him, deprived him of \u201cliberty and property without due process of law\u201d in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He also advanced pendent state law claims of conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional harm, tortious interference with a contractual relationship, and defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Upon the defendants\u2019 motion, the district court dismissed the complaint. The court held that Powell did not state a claim for deprivation of liberty without due process because he did not allege becoming unemployable as a result of the defendants\u2019 actions, nor did he allege losing his tenured faculty position. The court noted that \u201ca loss of pay could be considered a deprivation of <em>property,\u201d </em>but stated that Powell did not allege having any property interest in his job. Because Powell failed to state a due process claim, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">On appeal, Powell reiterates that by censuring him, Fujimoto deprived him of a constitutionally protected property interest in his earnings, his earning capacity, and the attorney\u2019s fees he expended in defending himself, as well as a liberty interest in his reputation. In assessing such procedural due process claims, we follow a two-step approach: first, we must determine whether the plaintiff was deprived of a protected interest; second, we must decide what amount of process was due. <em>Pugel, </em>378 F.3d at 662. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), accepting the plaintiff\u2019s factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. <em>Pugel v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill., </em>378 F.3d 659, 662 (7th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">A. Property Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Powell first claims that the defendants\u2019 actions leading to the chancellor\u2019s formal censure deprived him of a constitutionally protected property interest. Powell locates a property interest in the \u201csubstantial expense in attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d he expended in defending himself against the sexual harassment charges, as well as his \u201clost earnings and earning capacity\u201d because of the stigmatizing nature of the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-10\">A protectable property interest must rest on a legitimate claim of entitlement created by some independent source such as state law. <em>Beischel v. Stone Bank Sch. Dist., </em>362 F.3d 430, 435 (7th Cir.2004). We have held that a tenured professor at a state university has a property interest in his job that cannot be taken away without due process. <em>Levenstein v. Salafsky, </em>164 F.3d 345, 351 (7th Cir.1998). We have also noted that a property interest could potentially be infringed by a reassignment that affects future job opportunities, <em>Bordelon v. Chicago Sch. Reform Bd. of Trs., </em>233 F.3d 524, 531 (7th Cir.2000), or a demotion that involves a reduction in salary, <em>Sonnleitner v. York, </em>304 F.3d 704, 716 (7th Cir.2002). But, we have added, internal discipline without further adverse employment consequences does not implicate a protected property interest. <em>See Fleury v. Clayton, </em>847 F.2d 1229, 1233 (7th Cir.1988) (censure of physician implicates property interest only where state law creates entitlement to \u201cclean\u201d medical license and censure could have legal consequences); <em>Linhart v. Glatfelter, 771 </em>F.2d 1004, 1008-09 (7th Cir.1985). The majority of circuits addressing the question have similarly found that internal disciplinary action alone does not implicate due process. <em>See Kelly v. Borough of Sayreville, </em>107 F.3d 1073, 1077 (3d Cir.1997); <em>Silano v. Sag Harbor Union Free Sch. Dist. Bd. of Edu., </em>42 F.3d 719, 724 (2d Cir.1994); <em>Johnson v. Morris, </em>903 F.2d 996, 999 (4th Cir.1990); <em>Lowe v. Kan. City Bd. of Police Comm\u2019rs, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>841 F.2d 857, 858 (8th Cir.1988). <em>But see Newman v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, </em>884 F.2d 19, 24-25 n. 5 (1st Cir.1989); <em>Little v. City of North Miami, </em>805 F.2d 962, 969 (11th Cir.1986); <em>Smiley v. Alexander, </em>629 F.2d 1018, 1022 n. 4 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Powell failed to state a claim for a deprivation of property in violation of due process, but for a different reason. The district court stated that Powell\u2019s situation \u201ccould be considered a deprivation of <em>property,\u201d </em>but noted that Powell \u201cdoes not allege that he had a property interest in his job.\u201d We disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that because Powell\u2019s complaint failed to allege explicitly a property interest, this aspect of his due process claim warranted no further consideration. Under federal notice pleading, a complaint need not identify legal theories in order to state a claim, and certainly needn\u2019t spell out each technical element of a legal theory it does identify. <em>See Williams v. Seniff, </em>342 F.3d 774, 792 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Head v. Chicago Sch. Reform Bd. of Trs., </em>225 F.3d 794, 801 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Bartholet v. Reishauer AG. (Zurich), </em>953 F.2d 1073, 1078 (7th Cir.1992). Powell\u2019s pleadings were sufficient to put his opponent on notice of his property interest claim. However, he still founders because the facts he alleges do not amount to a deprivation of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Powell claims that he has a property interest in the fees he paid an attorney to defend against the sexual harassment charges. Were he to succeed in his \u00a7 1983 suit on other grounds, of course, Powell would be eligible for a discretionary grant of attorney\u2019s fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b). That is not Powell\u2019s claim, however; rather, he contends that his expense in defending himself actually forms the basis for a procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">We have not previously addressed this issue, but two of our sister circuits have rejected the claims of individuals protesting disciplinary employment actions who asserted a property interest in the expense of defending themselves in administrative proceedings. <em>See Workman v. Jordan, </em>32 F.3d 475, 480 n. 4 (10th Cir.1994) (\u201cThese incidental losses do not give rise to an independent protected property interest.\u201d); <em>Patton v. Holland, </em>No. 95-1699, 1996 WL 7970, at *3, 1996 WL 7970 (4th Cir. Jan. 8, 1996) (unpublished opinion) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201c[Plaintiff] has no property interest in attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d). The District Court for the Southern District of New York reached the same conclusion in a similar situation, reasoning that \u201cit is well established that citizens may be required to bear the costs of defending against lawsuits.\u201d <em>See All Aire Conditioning, Inc. v. City of New York, </em>979 F.Supp. 1010, 1015 (S.D.N.Y.1997). These decisions are consistent with our own observation in dictum, in the context of malicious prosecution and abuse of process, that the expense of defending against a lawsuit is not itself a protectable property interest. <em>See Smart v. Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill., </em>34 F.3d 432, 434 (7th Cir.1994). We therefore join the other courts to address this issue and hold that Powell has no constitutionally protected property interest in the fees he paid an attorney to defend against sexual harassment charges. To conclude otherwise would mean that every individual who seeks, unsuccessfully, to defend himself in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>an administrative proceeding would have a constitutional tort claim to recoup his expenses in federal court. Powell\u2019s counsel\u2019s attempt at argument to limit this avenue of relief to those forced to defend against \u201cegregious\u201d administrative charges places no meaningful stopping point on this far-reaching principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Powell also identifies a property interest in his earnings and earning capacity as a professor. Although his pay has not been docked, he asserts that \u201cit is reasonable to infer\u201d that the sexual harassment censure may in the future cause him to lose \u201cmerit pay, extra class assignments normally to be expected such as summer school, promotion and increased pay, publishing opportunities, paid speaking opportunities, paid sabbaticals, research grants, and the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Neither the Wisconsin Administrative Code nor the UW-Whitewater University Handbook creates an entitlement to a certain earning capacity level for UW faculty members. Furthermore, where a censured employee retains his job and does not suffer any loss of pay or rank, any alleged harm to his stature or earnings prospects is purely speculative. <em>See Lowe, </em>841 F.2d at 858. Powell \u201ccannot complain that he has been made unemployable; he remains employed, and in a job that has considerable tenure rights attached to it.\u201d <em>Hershinow v. Bonamarte, </em>735 F.2d 264, 266 (7th Cir.1984) (holding that a three-day suspension without pay did not infringe police officer\u2019s liberty interest). The cases that Powell cites in support of this claim are inapposite; they stand for the proposition that <em>removal, suspension, or demotion </em>from a tenured position might create indirect economic effects deserving of due process protection. <em>See, e.g., Sonnleitner, </em>304 F.3d at 716; <em>Head, </em>225 F.3d at 803. Yet here Powell was not removed, suspended, or demoted from his faculty position. Therefore, his allegation of \u201creduced earning capacity\u201d does not state a claim under the Due Process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">B. Liberty Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">Powell also renews his claim that Fujimoto deprived him of a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his occupation by harming his reputation and causing him to suffer the above-mentioned pecuniary losses. His reply brief contends that if Powell \u201cever were to lose his current employment it is highly unlikely that he would be able to get a job anywhere else given these allegations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">A plaintiff may state a claim for deprivation of liberty by alleging damage to his reputation so long as he also asserts that the government altered a \u201cright or status\u201d he \u201cpreviously held under state law.\u201d <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>424 U.S. 693, 708, 711, 96 S.Ct. 1155, 47 L.Ed.2d 405 (1976); <em>see also Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 573, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972); <em>Townsend v. Vallas, </em>256 F.3d 661, 669 (7th Cir.2001). This has come to be known as the \u201creputation plus\u201d standard of <em>Paul v. Davis, </em>in which the Supreme Court held that injury to reputation, without more, does not implicate due process. <em>See Paul, </em>424 U.S. at 712, 96 S.Ct. 1155; <em>Trifax Corp. v. District of Columbia, </em>314 F.3d 641, 644 (D.C.Cir.2003). In the context of tenured employment, the Supreme Court has strongly implied that nothing less than termination alters a protected right or status in a way that infringes liberty. <em>See Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 233-34, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991) (\u201cThe facts alleged ... cannot ... state a claim.... The alleged defamation was not uttered incident to the termination of [plaintiffs] employment.\u201d). Several circuits have read that decision narrowly, requiring that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>defamed employee be dismissed before she may state a claim for deprivation of liberty. <em>E.g., Wallin v. Minn. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>153 F.3d 681, 690 n. 9 (8th Cir.1998); <em>Ludwig v. Bd. of Trs. of Ferris State Univ., </em>123 F.3d 404, 410 (6th Cir.1997). This court has taken a slightly relaxed view, requiring government employers to provide procedural protections even when demoting the employee to a position \u201cfar beneath\u201d that which she occupied before. <em>Klug v. Chicago Sch. Reform Bd. of Trs., </em>197 F.3d 853, 859-60 (7th Cir.1999); <em>Lawson v. Sheriff of Tippecanoe County, Ind., </em>725 F.2d 1136, 1139 (7th Cir.1984). Nevertheless, since there is no protected liberty interest in reputation alone, the employment status must be \u201cdistinctly altered or extinguished\u201d to trigger due process protections. <em>Paul, </em>424 U.S. at 711, 96 S.Ct. 1155; <em>Atwell v. Lisle Park Dist., </em>286 F.3d 987, 992-93 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The district court correctly concluded that Powell\u2019s complaint does not state a claim for deprivation of liberty. Powell was not dismissed from his tenured professorship, nor was he transferred nor demoted to an inferior position. Although he asserts in his reply brief that \u201cthere is substantial authority\u201d to support his liberty claim, the cases he cites (as well as the majority of successful occupational liberty claims) all involve discharged employees or those who were not rehired. <em>See Roth, </em>408 U.S. at 566, 92 S.Ct. 2701; <em>Head, </em>225 F.3d at 803; <em>Colaizzi v. Walker, </em>812 F.2d 304, 305 (7th Cir.1987); <em>Munson v. Friske, </em>754 F.2d 683, 687 (7th Cir.1985). Powell has not provided, nor have we found, any authority stating that a formal reprimand alone infringes a liberty interest. This claim, therefore, was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">We do not doubt the serious nature of the charges levied against Powell, nor their potential to make difficult his future interactions with UW-Whitewater personnel. Nevertheless, given the lack of case-law support for Powell\u2019s due process claim, we conclude that the proper forum for challenging these charges was in state, not federal, court. The district court order is MODIFIED to reflect a dismissal consistent with this order, and as modified, is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-6\">. Circuit Rule 36(c) of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit permits the citation of an unpublished disposition if it is believed to have \u201cprecedential value in relation to a material issue in a case and ... there is no published opinion that would serve as well.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
