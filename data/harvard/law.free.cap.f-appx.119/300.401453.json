Inc. (collectively, \u201cUCAR\u201d), filed suit against its previous controlling stockholders, Union Carbide Corp. (\u201cUnion Carbide\u201d) and Mitsubishi Corp. (\u201cMitsubishi\u201d), as well as Mitsubishi International Corp., a Mitsubishi subsidiary; Hiroshi Kawamura, the executive vice president of Mitsubishi, who served as a UCAR director from June 1992 to January 1995; and Robert Kennedy, Union Carbide\u2019s former CEO and present UCAR director. In its complaint, UCAR asserted, pursuant to various provisions of Delaware statutory and common law, that the defendants inflicted substantial harm on UCAR by establishing an illegal stock repurchase plain in 1995. For several years prior to the stock repurchase, until a Department of Justice investigation in 1997 that culminated in UCAR\u2019s 2000 conviction for criminal antitrust violations, UCAR was a participant in a global price-fixing scheme. UCAR\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendants, by executing the stock repurchase plan without informing UCAR\u2019s new controlling stockholders of the price-fixing conspiracy\u2019s existence, or the distorting effect of the conspiracy on UCAR\u2019s stock value, wrongfully obtained $ 750 million from UCAR\u2019s corporate treasury.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. They also sought to disqualify William Blumenthal, UCAR\u2019s attorney (and Union Carbide\u2019s former antitrust advisor), along with his law firm, King &amp; Spaulding. On November 7, 2001, the district court (Daniels, <em>J.) </em>disqualified Blumenthal and his firm. On January 26, 2004, UCAR\u2019s complaint was dismissed, in its entirety, for failure to state a claim. The court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that because UCAR was convicted of criminal antitrust violations for participating in the same price-fixing scheme that formed the basis for its complaint against defendants, plaintiffs claims were barred by the <em>in pari delicto </em>doctrine. UCAR now appeals the district court\u2019s order of dismissal, as well as its decision to disqualify attorney Blumenthal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">In reviewing the dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), we must accept the plaintiffs factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See, e.g., United States v. City of New York, </em>359 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir.2004). \u201cGeneral, conclusory allegations need not be credited, however, when they are belied by more specific allegations of the complaint.\u201d <em>Hirsch v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>72 F.3d 1085, 1092 (2d Cir.1995). In addition to the complaint itself, a court may consider \u201call papers and exhibits appended to the complaint, as well as any matters of which judicial notice may be taken.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">Applying those standards to this case, the district court did not err in dismissing UCAR\u2019s complaint. The <em>in pari delicto </em>defense prohibits suits in which the plaintiff is as or more culpable than the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>dant in the conduct forming the basis for the complaint. <em>See Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. v. Berner, </em>472 U.S. 299, 306-07, 105 S.Ct. 2622, 86 L.Ed.2d 215 (1985). The pleadings, taken together with the facts of which the district court took judicial notice \u2014 including UCAR\u2019s admissions in its plea to criminal antitrust violations \u2014 establish that the defense applies in this case. UCAR seeks to avoid this conclusion by arguing that defendants\u2019 wrongdoing \u2014 the alleged violation of Delaware law regarding dividend and stock purchase payments in excess of surplus\u2014 is distinct from the corporation\u2019s admitted antitrust violations. In fact, the law does not require defendants\u2019 and UCAR\u2019s wrongdoing to be of an identical nature for the <em>in pari delicto </em>defense to apply. <em>See Peltz v. SHB Commodities, Inc., </em>115 F.3d 1082, 1090-91 (2d Cir.1997); <em>cf. Ross v. Bolton, </em>904 F.2d 819, 824 (2d Cir.1990). In this case, it is undisputed that defendants\u2019 violation of Delaware law depends on proof of an antitrust conspiracy, in which UCAR was indisputably complicit. And although we recognized in <em>Kalb, Voorhis &amp; Co. v. American Financial Corp., </em>8 F.3d 130 (2d Cir.1993), that the <em>in pan delicto </em>doctrine does not apply when a plaintiff is forced to act through \u201cdomination and control,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 133, UCAR\u2019s allegations of \u201cdomination and control\u201d are belied by (1) its admission of willful behavior during its plea colloquy in its criminal case; and, most particularly, (2) the fact that UCAR continued to participate in the price-fixing conspiracy long after defendants were no longer its shareholders or directors. Under these circumstances, <em>Kalb </em>does not bar the application of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">UCAR\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s disqualification order is also unavailing, and we reject it for substantially the reasons expressed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We have considered all of UCAR\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
