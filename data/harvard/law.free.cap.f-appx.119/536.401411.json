(Appeal No. 04-7053). Because Garcia\u2019s notice of appeal was received in the district court after the expiration of the appeal period, we remanded the case to the district court for a determination of the timeliness of the filing under Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) (notice considered filed as of the date Appellant delivers it to prison officials for forwarding to the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-20\">On remand, the district court issued an order finding that Garcia\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed. In appeal No. 04-7805, Garcia seeks to appeal from this order. An appellate court cannot disregard a district court\u2019s factual findings absent clear error. We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that Garcia\u2019s notice of appeal was not filed within the appeal period, and therefore affirm this ruling. <em>See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948) (providing standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">We dismiss appeal No. 04-7053 for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed. Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-22\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on April 27, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed on June 12, 2004. Because Garcia failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>this appeal as untimely. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\n<em>No. 01-7053, DISMISSED; No. 01-7805, AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-17\"> Rule 4(c)(1) states that a prisoner's notice of appeal is timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
