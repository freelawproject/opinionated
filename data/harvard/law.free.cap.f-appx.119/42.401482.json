Schaumann argues that they are entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under California Civil Code \u00a7 1717, as the prevailing parties in the underlying suit by Vicki Lynn Honey against Schaumann for breach of the Marital Settlement Agreement. The district court held that the agreement had merged into the subsequent judgment of dissolution of marriage, and granted Schaumann\u2019s motion for summary judgement. The court determined that Schaumann was entitled to costs but denied Schaumann attorneys\u2019 fees because the prior contract no longer existed as a result of the judgment. Thus, in this suit, neither party could have been entitled to fees under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-17\">California Civil Code \u00a7 1717 provides that \u201cthe party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract ... shall be entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in addition to other costs.\u201d However, the statute also provides that a court may \u201cdetermine that there is no party prevailing on the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The California Supreme Court has held that \u201ca party is entitled to attorney fees under section 1717 \u2018even when the party prevails on the grounds the contract is inapplicable, invalid, unenforceable or nonexistent, if the other party would have been entitled to attorney\u2019s fees had it prevailed.\u2019\u201d <em>Hsu v. Abbara, </em>9 Cal.4th 863, 870, 39 Cal.Rptr.2d 824, 891 P.2d 804 (1995)(quoting <em>Bovard v. American Horse Enter., Inc., </em>201 Cal.App.3d 832, 247 Cal.Rptr. 340, 346 (App. 1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">Here, the district court correctly stated that this case does not involve a determination that the Marital Agreement was \u201cinapplicable, invalid, unenforceable or nonexistent\u201d but rather that it had merged into the judgment of dissolution. Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>party could have received fees under the contract because it had merged into the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b69-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
