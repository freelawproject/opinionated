Christensen\u2019s motion constitutes a collateral attack on his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, for which he has not obtained a certificate of appeal-ability. Accordingly, the appeal will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-20\">The facts germane to resolution of this appeal are not in dispute. On January 17, 1996, a federal grand jury issued a second superceding fourteen-count indictment charging in part Christensen with conspiracy to commit offenses against the laws of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, filing of false tax returns, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1), obstruction of internal revenue laws, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a), obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1512(b)(2)(A), 1512(b)(1), mail fraud, in violation of 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and aiding in the preparation of false tax returns, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(2). A jury convicted Christensen of all counts for which he was indicted on April 25,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Government witness Sue Adams, a former employee of Christensen, testified at the trial pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government. During pretrial proceedings, Christensen claimed that Adams had purloined confidential documents from Christensen and/or his companies at the government\u2019s behest and without judicial supervision. Trial counsel for the United States maintained that the documents Adams had furnished to federal prosecutors were obtained on her own initiative. Neither the magistrate judge nor the district court resolved the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct at that time. On October 15, 1997, approximately six months following the jury\u2019s guilty verdict, Christensen filed a motion with the district court that asserted the same allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An <em>ex parte </em>hearing was held with defense counsel on October 27, 1997. The district court ordered the motion stricken and removed from the criminal docket and that the matter raised by the motion be opened as a \u201cmiscellaneous case.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Clerk of Court assigned it a new, \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d case number.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Christensen was sentenced two days later, October 29, 1997. The district court imposed a sentence of 110 months imprisonment, three years supervised release, a $1,100 assessment, a $150,000 fine, and nearly $5.4 million in restitution. He appealed his conviction and sentence, which we affirmed in an unpublished opinion on January 4, 1999. <em>See United States v. Christensen, </em>No. 97-10485, 1999 WL 47391, at *1 (9th Cir. Jan.4, 1999). Christensen\u2019s direct appeal failed to raise any issues involving the alleged prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Christensen subsequently filed a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on February 17, 1999, in which he asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that his conviction was obtained by the use of evidence gained pursuant to unconstitutional searches and seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that the government\u2019s failure to disclose this information violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The basis for this claim was the same as that previously represented to the district court; namely, that witness Sue Adams \u201cpurloined and pilfered documents\u201d belonging to Christensen and/or his companies at the direction of the government and without judicial supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">The district court denied the motion on December 20, 2000, finding that the only evidence relied upon by Christensen was protected by Adams\u2019 attorney-client privilege with Attorney Michael Amador, and that Adams had not waived that privilege. The district court refused to grant Christensen a certificate of appealability. On January 18, 2002, a two-judge panel of this Court likewise declined Christensen\u2019s request for a certificate, and denied \u201c[a]ll outstanding motions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">In March 2003, Christensen filed a request concerning the status of the miscellaneous case. He subsequently filed an additional motion styled \u201cStatus on Motion to Set Hearing Date\u201d seeking a hearing as to the alleged prosecutorial misconduct issue. The district court denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Christensen\u2019s request for status and motion for a hearing, reasoning that (1) this Court\u2019s denial of \u201c[a]ll outstanding motions,\u201d issued in connection with our denial of Christensen\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability on January 18, 2002, operated to deny the October 1997 motion; (2) Christensen waived his prosecutorial misconduct claim to the extent he failed to raise it on direct appeal from his conviction or in his subsequent motion to vacate his sentence; (3) Christensen\u2019s reliance upon the information possessed by Attorney Douglas C. Crawford in support of the prosecutorial misconduct claim was previously asserted in his application for a certificate of appealability, which the district court and this Court denied; and (4) Christensen\u2019s reliance upon the information allegedly disclosed by Adams to Attorney Amador in support of the prosecutorial misconduct claim was previously asserted and rejected by the district court in its ruling on Christensen\u2019s habeas petition. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">We do not have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. Although Christensen presents his motion as a \u201cStatus on Motion to Set Hearing Date,\u201d it is in fact a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Congress has established mandatory, jurisdictional procedures a petitioner must follow in appealing from a district court\u2019s denial of relief under \u00a7 2255. Christensen cannot avoid these jurisdictional limitations by styling his motion under another name. As he has failed to obtain a certificate of appealability from the district court or this Court, the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-9\">Christensen\u2019s motion is undoubtedly the functional equivalent of a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, even if not characterized as such by the district court. Notwithstanding its form, the motion represents a challenge to the validity of his criminal conviction and sentence. For example, in his briefing before this Court, Christensen argues that \u201cthe alleged prosecutorial misconduct resulted in the violation of Appellant Christensen\u2019s constitutional rights under the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments,\u201d but nowhere does he evince an intent to seek civil damages. Rather, in the motion at issue here, Christensen explained that \u201c[tjhis matter must be determined on the merits in order for the Defendant to have a complete understanding of what happened in his case, <em>as well as how he might proceed in a post-conviction remedy for government misconduct.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Indeed, in his briefing before this Court, Christensen relies on case law regarding \u201cevidentiary hearings in 2255 matters\u201d and asserts that the cases are applicable here because the alleged prosecutorial misconduct resulted in claims \u201cwhich are also cognizable under 2255.\u201d Christensen\u2019s Brief makes apparent that he seeks to challenge the validity of his criminal conviction through the vehicle of a hearing on the miscellaneous case. Such a challenge is appropriately considered a motion to vacate sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mathews, </em>833 F.2d 161, 164 (9th Cir.1987) (\u2018Where a defendant seeks to attack the basis for his conviction, the district court may properly construe the defendant\u2019s Rule 35 motion as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d) (emphasis removed); <em>Baker v. United States, </em>932 F.2d 813, 814 (9th Cir.1991) (agreeing with the district court\u2019s construal of a \u2018Petition for a Writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Error Coram Nobis\u2019 as a motion to vacate sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255); <em>cf. Thompson v. Calderon, </em>151 F.3d 918, 921 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc) (\u201cIn most cases when the factual predicate for a Rule 60(b) motion also states a claim for a successive petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b), ... the ... motion should be treated as a successive habeas petition. This is consistent with general habeas corpus jurisprudence, for a Rule 60(b) motion following the entry of a final judgment in a habeas case raises policy concerns similar to those implicated by a second petition ....\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). The district court\u2019s failure to so characterize the motion at issue here does not preclude us from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Because we construe Christensen\u2019s motion as a \u00a7 2255 petition, he must comply with the procedural commands of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). \u201cA petitioner seeking appellate review of a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion must obtain a certificate of appealability from a judge of the district court or the court of appeals.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>157 F.3d 661, 665 (9th Cir.1998) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)); <em>accord </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). He has failed to apply for a certificate of appealability from either this Court or the district court. Such a requirement is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to consider the claims Christensen presents in this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-7\">Finally, even if we elected to treat the instant appeal as a request for a certificate of appealability, <em>see Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), we would deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-10\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b911-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-6\">.
