(\u201cKSR\u201d) in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,237,565 B1 (\u201cthe \u2019565 patent\u201d). On December 12, 2003, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of KSR, after determining that claim 4 of the \u2019565 patent, the sole claim at issue, was invalid by reason of obviousness. <em>Teleflex Inc. v. KSR Int\u2019l Co., </em>298 F.Supp.2d 581 (E.D.Mich.2003). Teleflex now appeals the district court\u2019s decision. For the reasons set forth below, we <em>vacate </em>the grant of summary judgment and <em>remand </em>the case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-24\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b309-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-26\">Claim 4 of the \u2019565 patent relates to an adjustable pedal assembly<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for use with automobiles having engines that are controlled electronically with a device known as an electronic throttle control. As such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the assembly of claim 4 incorporates an electronic pedal position sensor (referred to in claim 4, and throughout this opinion, as an \u201celectronic control\u201d). The electronic control is responsive to the pedal pivot and thereby generates an electrical signal corresponding to the relative position of the gas pedal between the rest and applied positions. Claim 4 specifically provides for an assembly wherein the electronic control is mounted to the support bracket of the assembly. This configuration avoids movement of the electronic control during adjustment of the pedal\u2019s position on the assembly. Claim 4 reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">A vehicle control pedal apparatus (12) comprising:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">a support (18) adapted to be mounted to a vehicle structure (20);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahy\">an adjustable pedal assembly (22) having a pedal arm (14) moveable in force [sic] and aft directions with respect to said support (18);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">a pivot (24) for pivotally supporting said adjustable pedal assembly (22) with respect to said support (18) and defining a pivot axis (26); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">an electronic control (28) attached to said support (18) for controlling a vehicle system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">said apparatus (12) characterized by said electronic control (28) being responsive to said pivot (24) for providing a signal (32) that corresponds to pedal arm position as said pedal arm (14) pivots about said pivot axis (26) between rest and applied positions wherein the position of said pivot (24) remains constant while said pedal arm (14) moves in fore and aft directions with respect to said pivot (24).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">The numbers in claim 4 correspond to the numbers in Figure 2 of the \u2019565 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">The specification of the \u2019565 patent indicates that prior-art pedal assemblies incorporating an electronic control suffered from being too bulky, complex, and expensive to manufacture. <em>See </em>\u2019565 patent, col. 1, 11. 48-53. It was this problem that the \u2019565 patent set out to address. <em>See id. </em>col. 2,11. 2-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">Teleflex sued KSR in the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging that KSR\u2019s adjustable pedal assembly infringed claim 4 of the \u2019565 patent. KSR moved for summary judgment of invalidity of claim 4 based on obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103. The district court granted KSR\u2019s motion after determining that claim 4 was obvious in view of a combination of prior art references. Teleflex timely appealed the district court\u2019s decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Torpharm Inc. v. Ranbaxy Pharms., Inc., </em>336 F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed.Cir.2003). \u201cIn a patent case, as in any other, summary judgment may be granted when there are no disputed issues of material fact, ... or when the non-movant cannot prevail on the evidence submitted when viewed in a light most favorable to it.\u201d <em>Knoll Pharm. Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., </em>367 F.3d 1381, 1383 (Fed.Cir.2004). The movant carries the initial burden of proving that there are no genuine issues of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-24, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). If the movant shows a <em>prima facie </em>case for summary judgment, then the burden of production shifts to the nonmovant to present specific evidence indicating there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). \u201cWhen ruling on a motion for summary judgment, all of the nonmovant\u2019s evidence is to be credited, and all justifiable inferences are to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>drawn in the nonmovant\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Inc. v. Deere &amp; Co., </em>224 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed.Cir.2000). \u201cWhere the evidence is conflicting or credibility determinations are required, the judgment should be vacated rather than reversed, and the case should be remanded for further proceedings.\u201d <em>Jones v. Hardy, </em>727 F.2d 1524, 1531 (Fed.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u201cThe grant of summary judgment of invalidity for obviousness must be done on a claim by claim basis.\u201d <em>Knoll Pharm., </em>367 F.3d at 1383. Because patents are presumed valid, \u201c[t]he accused infringer must prove by clear and convincing evidence that each claim that is challenged cannot reasonably be held to be non-obvious.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Monarch Knitting Mach. Corp. v. Sulzer Morat GmbH, </em>139 F.3d 877, 881 (Fed.Cir.1998). Clear and convincing evidence exists when the movant \u201cplacets] in the mind of the ultimate fact finder an abiding conviction that the truth of its factual contentions are \u2018highly probable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Colorado v. New Mexico, </em>467 U.S. 310, 316, 104 S.Ct. 2433, 81 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">A patent claim is obvious, and thus invalid, when the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art \u201care such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art.\u201d 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103; <em>see also Graham v. John Deere Co., </em>383 U.S. 1, 14, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966); <em>In re Dembiczak, </em>175 F.3d 994, 998 (Fed.Cir.1999). While obviousness is ultimately a legal determination, it is based on several underlying issues of fact, namely: (1) the scope and content of the prior art; (2) the level of skill of a person of ordinary skill in the art; (3) the differences between the claimed invention and the teachings of the prior art; and (4) the extent of any objective indicia of non-obviousness. <em>See Graham, </em>383 U.S. at 17-18, 86 S.Ct. 684. When obviousness is based on the teachings of multiple prior art references, the movant must also establish some \u201csuggestion, teaching, or motivation\u201d that would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the relevant prior art teachings in the manner claimed. <em>See Tec Air, Inc. v. Denso Mfg. Mich. Inc., </em>192 F.3d 1353, 1359-60 (Fed.Cir.1999); <em>Pro-Mold &amp; Tool Co. v. Great Lakes Plastics, Inc., </em>75 F.3d 1568, 1572 (Fed.Cir.1996). The nonmovant may rebut a <em>prima facie </em>showing of obviousness with evidence refuting the movant\u2019s case or with other objective evidence of nonobviousness. <em>See WMS Gaming, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Game Tech., </em>184 F.3d 1339, 1359 (Fed.Cfr.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">\u201cThe reason, suggestion, or motivation to combine [prior art references] may be found explicitly or implicitly: 1) in the prior art references themselves; 2) in the knowledge of those of ordinary skill in the art that certain references, or disclosures in those references, are of special interest or importance in the field; or 3) from the nature of the problem to be solved, \u2018leading inventors to look to references relating to possible solutions to that problem.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ruiz v. A.B. Chance Co., </em>234 F.3d 654, 665 (Fed.Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Pro-Mold, </em>75 F.3d at 1572). \u201cOur case law makes clear that the best defense against the subtle but powerful attraction of a hindsight-based obviousness analysis is rigorous application of the requirement for a showing of the teaching or motivation to combine prior art references.\u201d <em>Dembiczak, </em>175 F.3d at 999; <em>see also Ruiz, </em>234 F.3d at 665 (explaining that the temptation to engage in impermissible hindsight is especially strong with seemingly simple mechanical inventions). This is because \u201c[c]ombining prior art references without evidence of such a suggestion, teaching, or motivation simply takes the inventor\u2019s disclosure as a blueprint for piecing together the prior art to defeat patentability \u2014 the essence of hindsight.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>Dembiczak, </em>175 F.3d at 999. Therefore, we have consistently held that a person of ordinary skill in the art must not only have had some motivation to combine the prior art teachings, but some motivation to combine the prior art teachings in the particular manner claimed. <em>See, e.g., In re Kotzab, </em>217 F.3d 1365, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2000) (\u201cParticular findings must be made as to the reason the skilled artisan, with no knowledge of the claimed invention, would have selected these components for combination <em>in the manner claimed. </em>\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>In re Rouffet, </em>149 F.3d 1350, 1357 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201cIn other words, the examiner must show reasons that the skilled artisan, confronted with the same problems as the inventor and with no knowledge of the claimed invention, would select the elements from the cited prior art references for combination <em>in the manner claimed. </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">On appeal, Teleflex argues that we should vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remand the case because the district court committed multiple errors in its obviousness determination. First, Teleflex urges that the district court erred as a matter of law by combining prior art references based on an incorrect teaching-suggestion-motivation test. Second, it contends that genuine issues of material fact still remain as to whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would have considered it obvious to combine prior art in the manner stated in claim 4. Finally, Teleflex argues that the district court erred by not properly considering the commercial success of Teleflex\u2019s patented assembly and by failing to give adequate deference to the patentability determination of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cPTO\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">KSR responds that the district court did apply the correct teaching-suggestion-motivation test, and that, under that test, the court correctly concluded that no genuine issues of material fact existed so as to prevent the grant of summary judgment. KSR contends that the district court properly discounted the declarations of Teleflex\u2019s experts because their opinions were based on mere legal conclusions. KSR also contends that the district court properly dismissed Teleflex\u2019s evidence of commercial success because Teleflex failed to establish a nexus between commercial success and the claimed invention. Finally, KSR argues that the district court gave proper deference to the PTO.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">We agree with Teleflex that the district court did not apply the correct teaching-suggestion-motivation test. We also agree that, under that test, genuine issues of material fact exist, so as to render summary judgment of obviousness improper. For these reasons, we vacate the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">After comparing the teachings of the prior art with claim 4 of the \u2019565 patent, the district court concluded that, at the time of the invention, all of the limitations of claim 4 existed in the prior art. The court explained that U.S. Patent No. 5,010,782, issued to Asano et al. (\u201cthe Asano patent\u201d), disclosed all of the structural limitations of claim 4 with the exception of the electronic control. <em>Teleflex, </em>298 F.Supp.2d at 592 (\u201cAsano teaches an adjustable pedal assembly pivotally mounted on a support bracket with the pedal moving in a fore and aft directions with respect to the support and the pivot remaining in a constant position during movement of the pedal arm.\u201d). Electronic controls were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>well known in the prior art. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, after finding a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to combine Asano and electronic control references, the district court granted KSR\u2019s motion for summary judgment of invalidity by reason of obviousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The district court based its finding of a suggestion or motivation to combine largely on the nature of the problem to be solved by claim 4 of the \u2019565 patent. <em>Id. </em>at 593-94. The court determined from the patent\u2019s specification that the invention of the \u2019565 patent was intended to \u201csolve the problem of designing a less expensive, less complex and more compact [assembly] design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593. The court then explained that U.S. Patent No. 5,819,593, issued to Rixon et al. (\u201cthe Rixon \u2019593 patent\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> also \u201csuffered from being too complex because the pedal position sensor is located in the pedal housing and its fore and aft movement with the adjustment of the pedal could cause problems with wire failure. Thus, the solution to the problem required an electronic control that does not move with the pedal arm while the pedal arm is being adjusted by the driver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594. The court then concluded that \u201ca person with ordinary skill in the art with full knowledge of Asano and the modular pedal position sensors would be motivated to combine the two references to avoid the problems with Rixon \u2019593.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The district court also found an express teaching to attach the electronic control to the support bracket of a pedal assembly based on the disclosure of U.S. Patent No. 5,063,811, issued to Smith et al. (\u201cthe Smith patent\u201d). The court explained that Smith teaches the use of a \u201crotary potentiometer ... attached to a fixed support member and responsive to the pedal\u2019s pivot shaft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court stated that Smith provided express teachings as to the desirability of attaching the electronic control to a fixed support member in order to avoid the wire failure problems disclosed in the Rixon \u2019593 patent and solved by the \u2019565 patent: \u201c[T]he wiring to the electrical components must be secure from the possibility of chafing which will eventually result in electrical failure. Thus, the pedal assemblies must not precipitate any motion in the connecting wires themselves.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting the Smith patent, col. 1,11. 33-38).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Finally, the district court explained that the prosecution history of the \u2019565 patent bolstered its finding of a suggestion or motivation to combine the Asano and electronic control references. The court explained that the patent examiner initially rejected the \u2019565 patent in view of the teachings of U.S. Patent No. 5,460,061, issued to Redding et al. (\u201cthe Redding patent\u201d), and the Smith patent. The examiner stated that the Redding patent disclosed the assembly structure of claim 4 and that Smith disclosed the electronic control attached to the assembly support structure. The patentee overcame the rejection, the court explained, by adding the limitation requiring the position of the assembly\u2019s pedal pivot to remain constant during adjustment of the assembly. (The position of the pedal pivot of the Redding patent does not remain constant during adjustment of the assembly position.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>However, the Asano patent discloses an assembly where the position of the pivot remains constant during adjustment of the pedal assembly. Therefore, the district court reasoned, had Asano been cited to the patent examiner, the examiner would have rejected claim 4 as obvious in view of the Asano and Smith patents. <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">We agree with Teleflex that the district court\u2019s analysis applied an incomplete teaching-suggestion-motivation test in granting KSR summary judgment. This is because the district court invalidated claim 4 of the \u2019565 patent on obviousness grounds without making \u201cfinding[s] as to the specific understanding or principle within the knowledge of a skilled artisan that would have motivated one with no knowledge of [the] invention to make the combination in the manner claimed.\u201d <em>Kotzab, </em>217 F.3d at 1371. Under our case law, whether based on the nature of the problem to be solved, the express teachings of the prior art, or the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art, the district court was required to make specific findings as to whether there was a suggestion or motivation to combine the teachings of Asano with an electronic control in the particular manner claimed by claim 4 of the \u2019565 patent. <em>See Kotzab, </em>217 F.3d at 1371; <em>Rouffet, </em>149 F.3d at 1357. That is, the district court was required to make specific findings as to a suggestion or motivation to attach an electronic control to the support bracket of the Asano assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The district court correctly noted that the nature of the problem to be solved may, under appropriate circumstances, provide a suggestion or motivation to combine prior art references. However, the test requires that the nature of the problem to be solved be such that it would have led a person of ordinary skill in the art to combine the prior art teachings in the particular manner claimed. <em>See Rouffet, </em>149 F.3d at 1357. We have recognized this situation when two prior art references address the precise problem that the patentee was trying to solve. <em>See Ruiz, </em>357 F.3d at 1276 (\u201cThis record shows that the district court did not use hindsight in its obviousness analysis, but properly found a motivation to combine because the two references address precisely the same problem of underpinning existing structural foundations.\u201d). In this case, the Asano patent does not address the same problem as the \u2019565 patent. The objective of the \u2019565 patent was to design a smaller, less complex, and less expensive electronic pedal assembly. The Asano patent, on the other hand, was directed at solving the \u201cconstant ratio problem.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s reliance on the problems associated with the Rixon \u2019593 patent similarly fails to provide a sufficient motivation to combine. This is because the Rixon \u2019593 patent does not address the problem to be solved by the \u2019595 patent; rather, it suffers from the problem. The court did not explain how suffering from the problem addressed by the \u2019595 patent would have specifically motivated one skilled in the art to attach an electronic control to the support bracket of the Asano assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Neither do we agree with the district court\u2019s reliance on the express teachings of the Smith patent. This is because the statement in the Smith patent that \u201cthe pedal assemblies must not precipitate any motion in the connecting wires,\u201d does not necessarily go to the issue of motivation to attach the electronic control on the support bracket of the pedal assembly. In other words, solving the problem of wire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>chafing is a different task than reducing the complexity and size of pedal assemblies. What is more, the Smith patent does not relate to adjustable pedal assemblies; therefore, it does not address the problem of wire chafing in an adjustable pedal assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Our view of the case is not altered by the \u2019565 patent\u2019s prosecution history. That is because a court\u2019s task is not to speculate as to what an examiner might have done if confronted with a piece of prior art. Rather, a court must make an independent obviousness determination, taking into account the statutory presumption of patent validity. <em>See Torpharm, </em>336 F.3d at 1329-30 (\u201c[WJhere the factual bases of an examiner\u2019s decision to allow a claim have been undermined \u2014 as in other cases where prior art not before the examiner is brought to light during litigation \u2014 a court\u2019s responsibility is not to speculate what a particular examiner would or would not have done in light of the new information, but rather to assess independently the validity of the claim against the prior art under section 102 or section 103. Such determination must take into account the statutory presumption of patent validity.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">We also agree with Teleflex that the presence of genuine issues of material fact rendered summary judgment inappropriate. KSR, in the first instance, failed to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of obviousness. The only declaration offered by KSR \u2014 a declaration by its Vice President of Design Engineering, Larry Willemsen\u2014 did not go to the ultimate issue of motivation to combine prior art, i.e. whether one of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated to attach an electronic control to the support bracket of the assembly disclosed by Asano. Mr. Willemsen did state that an electronic control \u201ccould have been\u201d mounted on the support bracket of a pedal assembly. (Willemsen Decl. at \u00b6 33, 36, 39.) Such testimony is not sufficient to support a finding of obviousness, however. <em>See, e.g., In re Deuel, </em>51 F.3d 1552, 1559 (Fed.Cir.1995) (\u201c \u2018Obvious to try\u2019 has long been held not to constitute obviousness.\u201d). Mr. Willemsen also provided the following as a \u201cspecific motivation to combine\u201d an electronic control with an adjustable pedal assembly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">[A]n increasing number of vehicles sold in the United States came equipped with electronic throttle control systems because such systems offered various operational advantages over cable-actuated throttle control systems.... In order to function in a vehicle whose engine incorporated an electronic throttle control, the adjustable pedal assembly ... would have had to be coupled to an electronic pedal position sensor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANW\">(Willemsen Decl. at \u00b6 34, 37, 39.) This statement may be factually correct. However, the issue is not whether a person of skill in the art had a motivation to combine the electronic control with an adjustable pedal assembly, but whether a person skilled in the art had a motivation to attach the electronic control to the support bracket of the pedal assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">In addition, Teleflex offered two declarants \u2014 Clark J. Radcliffe, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Michigan State University; and Timothy L. Andre-sen, a former engineer at Ford Motor Company and McDonnel-Douglas Corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ration \u2014 in rebuttal of the declaration of Mr. Willemsen. Mr. Radcliffe stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he location of the electronic control\u201d (Radcliffe Decl. at 1115) in claim 4 \u201cwas a simple, elegant, and novel combination of features,\u201d (Radcliffe Decl. at H 16) as opposed to the Rixon \u2019593 patent\u2019s attachment of the electronic control to the assembly housing, which was both electrically and mechanically complex (Radcliffe Decl. at \u00b617). Mr. Andresen also stated that the non-obviousness of claim 4 was reflected in Rixon\u2019s choice to mount the electronic control to the assembly housing instead of the assembly\u2019s support bracket. (Andresen Decl. at 1\u00cd 5.) At the summary judgment stage of a proceeding, it is improper for a district court to make credibility determinations. <em>See, e.g., Jones, </em>727 F.2d at 1531. Therefore, by crediting KSR\u2019s expert declarant and discrediting the two declarants offered by Teleflex, the district court erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In sum,</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">(1) We hold that, in granting summary judgment in favor of KSR, the district court erred as a matter of law by applying an incomplete teaching-suggestion-motivation test to its obviousness determination. The correct standard requires a court to make specific findings showing a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine prior art teachings in the particular manner claimed by the patent at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">(2) Under this standard, we hold that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether a person of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated, at the time the invention was made, to attach an electronic control to the support structure of the pedal assembly disclosed by the Asano patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">(3) We consequently <em>vacate </em>the decision of the district court and <em>remand </em>the case for further proceedings on the issue of obviousness, and, if necessary, proceedings on the issues of infringement and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ALR\">.

As explained by the district court, the Rixon \u2019593 patent teaches the combination of an electronic control with an adjustable pedal assembly. The Rixon '593 patent and claim 4 differ, however, in that the electronic control of Rixon is attached to the pedal housing instead of the support bracket. <em>See Teleflex, </em>298 F.Supp.2d at 594. The electronic control of the Rixon reference consequently moves during adjustment of the pedal assembly. <em>Id. </em>The electronic control of claim 4 does not move during adjustment of the pedal assembly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-6\">. The constant ratio problem refers to the problem of creating an assembly where the force required to depress the pedal remains constant irrespective of the position of the pedal on the assembly. <em>See </em>Asano patent, col. 1,1. 48-col. 2,1. 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b315-7\">. Noting Teleflex\u2019s argument that the district court did not give adequate deference to the PTO, we do not discern anything in the record indicating the district court failed to properly defer to the PTO. Nevertheless, we reiterate that, on remand, the district court must independently assess the evidence and determine whether KSR has provided clear and convincing evidence indicating invalidity of claim 4 by reason of obviousness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
