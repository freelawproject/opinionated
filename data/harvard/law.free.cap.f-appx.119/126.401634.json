Pursuant to his conditional guilty plea, Roddy raises an issue whether the district court improperly denied his motion to suppress evidence, with request for an evidentiary hearing, under <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), thus challenging the sufficiency of the warrant that authorized the police to search his residence. The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-20\">To get a <em>Franks </em>hearing, Roddy had to make a substantial preliminary showing (1) that the affidavit contained intentionally or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>recklessly false statements, <em>United States v. Lefkowitz, </em>618 F.2d 1313, 1317 (9th Cir. 1980), or omissions, <em>United States v. Stanert, </em>762 F.2d 775, 781 (9th Cir.1985), and (2) that without the alleged defects the affidavit would not establish probable cause. <em>Lefkowitz, </em>618 F.2d at 1317. Roddy did not make such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Roddy asserted these alleged defects: (1) that the affidavit contained false statements regarding the warrant affiant Officer Mitsunaga\u2019s \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d and the \u201cconstant surveillance\u201d the police conducted of their confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) during the alleged controlled purchase the Cl made from Roddy; (2) that the affidavit contained unsubstantiated allegations on the Cl\u2019s reliability and on the fact that Roddy was a user and distributor of crystal methamphetamine; (3) that the search results demonstrated that the information given by the Cl as related in the affidavit was false; and (4) that Officer Mitsunaga omitted material facts from the affidavit that would have compromised the Cl\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The first three alleged defects do not satisfy the first prong of the <em>Franks </em>analysis, requiring a showing of intentionally or recklessly false statements or omissions by the affiant. First, the boilerplate language stating that the affidavit was based on the \u201caffiant\u2019s personal knowledge\u201d did not render the affidavit facially false, even though the attachments had information Officer Mitsunaga received secondhand from his colleague, Officer Haanio. The attachments stated that Officer Mitsunaga was relying on facts learned from Officer Haanio, and there was no danger that the reviewing judge would have been misled about the source of Officer Mitsunaga\u2019s information. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>714 F.2d 896, 899 (9th Cir.1983) (officers can rely on information received from colleagues in preparing affidavits if they identify the sources of their information so that the reviewing magistrate can properly evaluate probable cause).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Also, the statement in the affidavit regarding the police officers\u2019 \u201cconstant surveillance\u201d of the Cl during the controlled purchase the Cl made from Roddy\u2019s house was not false even if the officers did not have the Cl within their direct line of sight during the entire transaction. \u201cConstant surveillance\u201d cannot reasonably be interpreted to mean that the Cl was in sight throughout the whole transaction. Rather, the affidavit should be given its ordinary meaning that police surveilled the Cl as he entered and left the Roddy residence and as he traveled to a prearranged location to meet with Officer Haanio. As so understood there was no false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Second, the record does not support Roddy\u2019s contention that the statements in the affidavit regarding the Cl\u2019s veracity and Roddy\u2019s status as a \u201cuser/distributor of crystal methamphetamine\u201d were unsubstantiated. The affidavit alleged that the Cl had provided the police with truthful information about drug activities on at least six prior occasions, and that the Cl\u2019s tips had led to the recovery of crystal methamphetamine on at least three prior occasions. The affidavit also alleged that the information the Cl provided about Roddy\u2019s use and distribution of crystal methamphetamine was corroborated by another Vice officer, Detective Saldua, who had personal knowledge of Roddy\u2019s drug activities, and by anonymous complaints the police received about drug activity at Roddy\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">Third, that the search did not turn up the recorded bills the Cl claimed he gave to Roddy during the controlled purchase transaction does not entitle Roddy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>a <em>Franks </em>hearing. A <em>Franks </em>motion should challenge the veracity of the affiant, not his or her informant. <em>United States v. Kiser, </em>716 F.2d 1268, 1271 (9th Cir.1983). Even if the Cl lied about giving the recorded bills to Roddy, there is no evidence that Officer Mitsunaga knew the Cl was lying when Officer Mitsunaga listed the bills among the items he expected the police to find at Roddy\u2019s home in the warrant application.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Finally, even though Officer Mitsunaga knowingly omitted the Cl\u2019s criminal history from the warrant affidavit, we conclude that this omission does not satisfy the second prong of <em>Franks. </em>None of the Cl\u2019s past offenses are crimes of dishonesty that are relevant to his veracity as an informant. <em>United States v. Reeves, </em>210 F.3d 1041, 1044 (9th Cir.2000). Any doubts the Cl\u2019s criminal history might have raised as to his credibility are outweighed by the fact that the Cl previously had given the police reliable information supporting successful investigations and arrests. <em>Id. </em>at 1045. The probable cause determination was not affected by the omission of the Cl\u2019s criminal history on petty crimes that did not show dishonesty or otherwise bear on the Cl\u2019s reliability as an informant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b153-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
