Mr. Hrbek, an Iowa state prisoner, claims to have been denied due process in a prison disciplinary hearing that resulted in his losing sixteen days of good time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>a penalty later reduced to two days by an Iowa state court. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Mr. Hrbek offers various bases for relief: bias on the part of the administrative law judge (ALJ) at Mr. Hrbek\u2019s prison disciplinary hearing, lack of opportunity at the hearing to present evidence, illegal classification of his disciplinary report as \u201cmajor,\u201d deficient notice of the conduct that violated the Iowa Department of Corrections rules under which he was punished, and lack of any evidentiary support for aspects of the ALJ\u2019s decision. Because the report and recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge Thomas J. Shields, which the district court adopted, ably demonstrates why nearly all of Mr. Hrbek\u2019s arguments lack merit, in this opinion we discuss only one of Mr. Hrbek\u2019s arguments in order to clarify why it also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Mr. Hrbek contends that the ALJ had no evidence to support her decision to discipline Mr. Hrbek for violating Iowa Department of Corrections Rule 14, which prohibits threats and intimidation. Mr. Hrbek\u2019s punishment resulted from a conversation that he had with two correctional officers who had found two pornographic magazines while \u201cshaking down\u201d a cell. Mr. Hrbek told the officers that he owned the magazines, which he had purchased and then rented to other inmates. According to the disciplinary notice written by the correctional officer who reported the incident, Mr. Hrbek predicted that the inmate in whose cell the magazines were found and Mr. Hrbek \u201cwould go around.\u201d This statement substantiates the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Hrbek had threatened to \u201ctake care of the individual who had allowed [the pornographic magazines] to be confiscated\u201d and satisfies the \u201csome evidence\u201d requirement set forth in <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). <em>See Earnest v. Courtney, </em>64 F.3d 365, 367 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b880-16\">. The Honorable James E. Gritzner, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
