EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">Randy C. Kimler (\u201cDefendant\u201d), a federal prisoner appearing <em>pro se </em>and <em>in forma pauperis, </em>seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence, which was brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). For the reasons stated below, we DENY COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-14\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b240-15\">After a jury trial, Defendant was convicted on six counts of receiving, possessing, and distributing child pornography via computer, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252(a)(2) and (a)(4)(B). The district court sentenced Defendant to 87 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. (Id.) On appeal, we affirmed Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>335 F.3d 1132, 1147 (10th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1083, 124 S.Ct. 945, 157 L.Ed.2d 759 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-16\">Approximately five months later, Defendant filed a Motion to Vacate, Set Aside, or Correct Sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 alleging ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Specifically, Defendant cited five grounds for his ineffective assistance of counsel claim: (1) failure to present evidence of Defendant\u2019s employment at trial; (2) failure to present Defendant\u2019s medical records at trial; (2) failure to interview and subpoena alibi witnesses; (3) failure to effectively cross-examine government witnesses and make appropriate objections at trial; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>(4) failure to move for suppression; and (5) failure to allow Defendant to testify on his own behalf at trial. In a supplemental brief, Defendant raised an additional issue as to the sufficiency of proof that the images in question were of real children.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">The district court judge, who had also presided over Defendant\u2019s trial, carefully considered and rejected each of Defendant\u2019s arguments, denying the \u00a7 2255 motion. On appeal, Defendant re-asserts the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and sufficiency of the evidence arguments raised below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, Defendant raises a new argument, challenging the validity of his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1), this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of Defendant\u2019s appeal unless he first obtains a COA. In the instant case, Defendant seeks a COA from this court because the district court denied his request to appeal its decision. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1). To prevail, Defendant must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This is accomplished by establishing that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">We hold that Defendant has failed to meet the <em>Slack </em>standard with regard to any of the issues asserted on appeal. In order to assert an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Defendant must set forth specific \u201cperformance\u201d errors on the part of trial counsel and demonstrate \u201cprejudice,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that, absent those errors, a different outcome would occur. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). With regard to the claims that Defendant\u2019s attorney should have introduced Defendant\u2019s medical and employment records, called additional witnesses, and more effectively cross-examined government witnesses, we agree with the district court that none of the alleged conduct overcomes our presumption that counsel acted within the wide range of reasonable professional judgment. <em>See Strickland, </em>468 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. As to counsel\u2019s alleged failure to allow Defendant to testify, we agree with the district court\u2019s factual finding that there was no reasonable probability that Defendant\u2019s testimony would have changed the result in the case, notwithstanding Defendant\u2019s conclusory assertions to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">As to Defendant\u2019s argument regarding the sufficiency of proof that the pornographic images were of real children, this issue was considered and rejected on direct appeal. <em>See Kimler, </em>335 F.3d at 1140-42. As Defendant has not demonstrated an intervening change of law in our circuit, the issue will not be considered further. <em>See United States v. Prichard, </em>875 F.2d 789, 791 (10th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">Finally, Defendant\u2019s newly-raised challenge to his sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>has been waived because it was not raised in the original \u00a7 2255 motion or in a subsequent motion for reconsideration. <em>See In re Walker, </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992). We decline to consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Having carefully considered each of the arguments before the court, we remain unconvinced that reasonable jurists could debate that Defendant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion should have been resolved differently. <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. 488-44, 120 S.Ct. 1595. Accordingly, we DENY COA and DISMISS the appeal for substantially the reasons stated below.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-11\">. Defendant has not renewed, however, his ineffective assistance of counsel claim insofar as it relates to counsel\u2019s alleged failure to move for suppression (ground # 4, above).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
