The district court held that Farabee\u2019s claim relating to forcible medication was barred by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Farabee has suffered from psychiatric problems since childhood and entered his first psychiatric institute at the age of ten. Over the last fifteen years, Farabee received treatment in more than twenty mental institutions. When Farabee was charged with arson in 1998, a Virginia state court found him not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) and ordered him committed to a state hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">This appeal arises from more recent state criminal charges against Farabee for malicious wounding of hospital staff. Farabee pled guilty to these charges and was sentenced accordingly. Farabee subsequently brought this \u00a7 1983 suit <em>pro se </em>against Dr. Feix and other defendants, seeking damages for his allegedly unlawful incarceration. In his initial complaint, Farabee alleged that having previously been adjudicated NGRI, his incarceration in a prison facility was improper. Farabee later filed a motion for default judgment, in which he alleged that his guilty plea was invalid in part because he was \u201cbeing invohmtarily/foreibly administered (by syringe), anti-psychotic/psychotropic drugs ... by [a psychiatrist at Central State Hospital and] was vulnerable to the drugs impairing [his] ability to follow the proceedings against [him], to testify and be cross-examined, and to communicate effectively with counsel.\u201d J.A. 18. In response to a motion by Dr. Feix to dismiss the complaint, Farabee alleged that Dr. Feix had \u201cpersonally authorized hospital employees ... to forcibly administer high doses of anti-psychotic drugs ... that crippled his ability to assist in his [de]fense, causing him to enter into an unknowing, unintelligent, and incompetent guilty plea.\u201d J.A. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The district court dismissed Farabee\u2019s complaint without prejudice. According to the district court, Farabee claimed that \u201cdefendants were responsible for his alleged unjust confinement in a Virginia Department of Corrections prison, because defendants forcibly medicated him with anti-psychotic drugs and failed to notify [the Dinwiddie County Circuit Court], which resulted in plaintiff entering into a guilty plea that was neither knowingly nor intelligently established.\u201d While recognizing that forcible medication could give rise to a valid, independent \u00a7 1983 claim under some circumstances, the district court ruled that Farabee\u2019s allegations of forcible medication related only to his argument that his conviction was improper. Thus, the essence of Farabee\u2019s claim challenged the fact of his conviction, and under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>the complaint did not state a cognizable \u00a7 1983 claim. Having dismissed the complaint, the district court advised Farabee to file the appropriate habeas forms. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The district court concluded that Farabee\u2019s forcible medication claim necessarily implied the invalidity of his conviction and therefore was not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. \u201cWhen a state prisoner seeks damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487; <em>see also Nelson v. Campbell, </em>541 U.S. 637, 124 S.Ct. 2117, 2122, 158 L.Ed.2d 924 (2004) (stating that a prisoner\u2019s claim challenging the fact of his conviction or the duration of his sentence implicates \u201cthe core of habeas corpus and [is] not cognizable when brought pursuant to \u00a7 1983\u201d). As we stated in <em>Ballenger v. Owens, </em>352 F.3d 842 (4th Cir.2003), \u201c[t]he logical <em>ne</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>cessity </em>that the judgment in the \u00a7 1983 case imply the invalidity of a criminal conviction is at the heart of the <em>Heck </em>requirement for dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Although Farabee styled his complaint under \u00a7 1983, \u201c[w]e have squarely held that a state prisoner\u2019s label for his claim cannot be controlling, even when the prisoner does not request immediate release.\u201d <em>Harvey v. Horan, </em>278 F.3d 370, 378 (4th Cir.2002). Rather, we must determine whether Farabee\u2019s specific allegations imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence. At the outset, we note that Farabee\u2019s complaint makes no mention of forcible medication. Giving Farabee the benefit of allegations made in filings other than his complaint, we agree with the district court that Farabee\u2019s \u201cessential grievance\u201d is that Dr. Feix forcibly administered anti-psychotic drugs that impaired Farabee\u2019s capacity to assist in his own defense and to enter a knowing and intelligent plea. <em>Beaudett v. City of Hampton, </em>775 F.2d 1274, 1278 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Every reference to forcible medication alleges that the result of Dr. Feix\u2019s conduct was Farabee\u2019s entering an invalid guilty plea. In his motion for default judgment, Farabee alleges that he \u201cwas being involuntarily/forcibly administered (by syringe), anti-psychotic/psychotropic drugs\u201d that impaired his <em>\u201cability to follow the proceeding\u2019s [sic] against me, to testify and be cross-examined, and to communicate effectively with counsel. \u201d </em>J.A. 18. In addition, Farabee stated that the drugs administered to him by Dr. Feix \u201cproduced a <em>sufficient effect to render him incomp[e]tent to enter into a guilty plea.\u201d </em>J.A. 18. Farabee further alleged that he <em>\u201cat no time entered into a guilty plea ... knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily, rendering the guilty pleas and convictions ... obtained by the commonwealth invalid, and in no way meeting constitutional standards. \u201d </em>J.A. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Again in his response to Dr. Feix\u2019s motion to dismiss, Farabee alleged that Dr. Feix\u2019s forcible medication rendered him unable to enter a valid guilty plea: \u201cDr. Jeffrey [Feix] personally authorized hospital employee\u2019s [sic] to administer high doses of anti-psychotic drugs and other drugs including a narcotic tranquilizer on the plaintiff, <em>that crippled his ability to assist in his [de]fense, causing him to enter into an unknowing, unintelligent, and incompetent guilty plea. </em>...\u201d J.A. 25. Farabee repeated this allegation, stating that \u201cDr. [Feix] intentionally and maliciously <em>diminished the plaintiff\u2019s mental capacity causing him to incriminate himself, while he was incompetent to plead guilty. </em>\u201d J.A. 25. Nowhere in his filings does Farabee allege that Dr. Feix\u2019s forcible medication caused him any injury other than limiting his capacity to enter a knowing and intelligent plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">We agree with the district court that Farabee discusses forcible medication only in support of his argument that his guilty plea was invalid and his resulting conviction improper. Indeed, it is clear from Farabee\u2019s specific allegations that his \u201cessential grievance\u201d relates to the result of the forcible medication \u2014 his entering an invalid guilty plea \u2014 rather than the forcible medication itself. <em>Beaudett, </em>775 F.2d at 1278.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Success on Farabee\u2019s claim re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>quires a finding that the drugs administered by Dr. Feix caused Farabee to enter an unknowing and involuntary guilty plea. Such a finding necessarily implies the invalidity of Farabee\u2019s conviction, and the district court properly ruled that Farabee\u2019s claim is not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Because Farabee\u2019s allegations of forcible medication related solely to his claim that his guilty plea was invalid, those allegations necessarily imply the invalidity of Farabee\u2019s conviction. The district court properly ruled that Farabee\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint was barred by the rule stated in <em>Heck. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">. Although Farabee's initial complaint seeks $100,000 in damages, that complaint makes no mention <em>of </em>forcible medication at all. Thus, the only reasonable inference is that these damages relate to allegations of misconduct other than forcible medication.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-15\">. The liberal construction rule cannot be employed to read out of Farabee\u2019s allegations the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>essential link between the forcible medication and the subsequent guilty plea. Nor can this rule be used to supply an allegation of injury different from the injury specifically alleged by Farabee. As we have noted, \"[djistrict judges are not mind readers. Even in the case of <em>pro se </em>litigants, they cannot be expected to construct full blown claims from sentence <em>fragmentsBeaudett, </em>775 F.2d at 1278 (construing a \u00a7 1983 claim). Although <em>Gordon v. Leeke, </em>574 F.2d 1147 (4th Cir.1978), requires that district courts not permit \"technical pleading requirements\u201d to defeat the vindication of constitutional rights that the plaintiff alleges were violated, <em>id. </em>at 1151, \"it does not require those courts to conjure up questions never squarely presented to them,\u201d <em>Beaudett, </em>775 F.2d at 1278. We could not supply new allegations of injury in this case without abandoning our proper role in favor of \"the improper role of an advocate seeking out the strongest arguments and most successful strategies\u201d for Farabee. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-22\">. Even if Farabee's claim was cognizable under \u00a7 1983, he failed to allege all the elements of a forcible medication claim. A plaintiff may recover on a forcible medication claim if he proves that \"a properly identified defendant, acting under color of state law, has effectively caused [him] to take anti-psychotic drugs against [his] will,\u201d and that the defendant did not exercise \"professional judgment\u201d in administering the drugs. <em>Johnson v. Silvers, </em>742 F.2d 823, 825 (4th Cir.1984). Farabee nowhere alleges that Dr. Feix failed to exercise professional judgment in his dealings with Farabee. That omission is fatal to any \u00a7 1983 claim that Farabee might have stated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
