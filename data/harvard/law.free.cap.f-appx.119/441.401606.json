Henry\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) suit alleging excessive force during an arrest. Purnell asserted in his motion that he was entitled to qualified immunity. On appeal, Henry alleges that this court lacks jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-15\">In his complaint, Henry asserted that Purnell, mistakenly believing Henry was fleeing from an arrest, shot Henry in the elbow. Purnell\u2019s motion for summary judgment included Purnell\u2019s affidavit, which alleged that when Henry ran away as Purnell was attempting to arrest him, Purnell \u201creached for [his] Taser.\u201d As he ran after Henry, Purnell \u201cbelieved that [he] had unholstered [his] Taser and was holding it in [his] hand.\u201d When he fired and heard the sound of a gunshot, Purnell realized he had grabbed the wrong weapon. Purnell argued that, because he reasonably (but mistakenly) believed that he was acting in accordance with constitutional mandates, he was entitled to qualified immunity. In response, Henry challenged Purnell\u2019s allegations by noting that (1) there is a marked difference between the two weapons carried by Purnell, and (2) Purnell took approximately sixty seconds after shooting Henry to claim that the shooting was accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-16\">The district court denied Purnell\u2019s motion. Although the court determined that an accidental shooting would not give rise to a constitutional claim, the court noted that \u201cMr. Purnell\u2019s assertions, both now and contemporaneously at the time of the incident, that he had drawn the wrong weapon do not establish that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. These assertions necessarily depend upon his credibility and therefore give rise to a genuine dispute of material fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-17\">While interlocutory orders ordinarily are not appealable, orders rejecting a defendant\u2019s claim of qualified immunity are, provided the denial rests on a purely legal determination that the facts establish a violation of clearly established law. <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 316-17, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995); <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). However, \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the extent that the appealing official seeks to argue the insufficiency of the evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact\u2014 for example, that the evidence presented was insufficient to support a conclusion that the official engaged in the particular conduct <em>alleged </em>\u2014 we do not possess jurisdiction ... to consider the claim.\u201d <em>Winfield v. Bass, </em>106 F.3d 525, 529-30 (4th Cir.1997). In other words, if the official argues that the record evidence is insufficient to support the facts as articulated by the district court, the reviewing court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. <em>Gray-Hopkins v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>309 F.3d 224, 229 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">On appeal, Purnell argues that the record does not support the district court\u2019s conclusion that a factual dispute exists regarding his intent, and that he is therefore entitled to qualified immunity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Purnell\u2019s argument, however, is not a legal one, but instead challenges the district court\u2019s factual findings. We therefore lack jurisdiction over and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> Purnell also argues that the district court did not find that such a factual dispute existed. We reject this argument. The district court found that Purnell\u2019s \"assertions [that he inadvertently drew his gun] necessarily depend upon his credibility and therefore give rise to a genuine dispute of material fact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
