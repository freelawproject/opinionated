We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review findings of fact for substantial evidence. <em>See Molina-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Raya-Chavez did not meet his burden of proving that he was not absent from the United States for more than 180 days during the relevant ten-year period. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(2); <em>Vasquez-Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>343 F.3d 961, 963 (9th Cir.2003). The record does not compel a contrary conclusion given that RayaChavez proffered inconsistent testimony regarding his numerous absences from the United States, and specifically faded to submit adequate documentary evidence to account for his presence in the United States between December 1991 and July 1992. <em>Cf. Vera-Villegas v. INS, </em>330 F.3d 1222, 1234 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that inadequate documentary evidence did not bar application for cancellation where oral and written testimony was otherwise sufficient). Raya-Chavez\u2019s contention that the IJ ignored his documentary evidence is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), Raya-Chavez\u2019s motion for stay of removal included a timely request for stay of voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, as of the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b117-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
