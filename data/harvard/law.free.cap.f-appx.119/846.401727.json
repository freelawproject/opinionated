Bening, and Alfred W. and Bernice Harre obtained judgments against attorney Arthur G. Muegler. Bening and the Harres were represented by Thomas G. Berndsen, who filed an attorney\u2019s lien for his contingency fee. Muegler filed for bankruptcy in Arizona and listed the judgments, but the bankruptcy court found the judgments were nondischargeable. In 2002 Muegler represented Hoodco, Inc. in a property insurance lawsuit involving Employers Mutual Casualty Insurance Company. The parties settled for $725,000. Employers Mutual deposited the money in the court\u2019s registry and filed an interpleader action. Muegler, his judgment creditors Bening and the Harres, and Berndsen were listed as interested persons. Muegler claimed his attorney\u2019s fee was exempt from garnishment. Bening, the Harres, and Berndsen asserted they were entitled to Huegler\u2019s fee as his judgment creditors. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> denied Muegler\u2019s claimed garnishment exemption as meritless and concluded that because the judgments against him were greater than Muelger\u2019s share, Muegler was not entitled to any part of the distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Muegler appeals asserting the district court committed error in denying his claimed garnishment exemption. Muegler made the same arguments before the district court in several earlier cases, however, and his claims were rejected. We affirmed. Thus, the district court correctly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel and denied Muegler\u2019s claimed exemptions. Further, as the district court explained, Muegler\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees are not exempt from garnishment under either 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673(a) or Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 525.030.2 because he is an independent contractor. The district court\u2019s decision did not violate any of Muegler\u2019s constitutional rights. Last, the district court properly denied Muegler\u2019s affirmative defense because the district court knew the bankruptcy court determined Muegler\u2019s debt is not dis-chargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Having carefully considered the briefs, the record, and the applicable law, we conclude the district court properly decided this case. Because there is no need for additional explanation, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s memorandum and orders. <em>See </em>8th Cir. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-7\"> The Honorable David C.
