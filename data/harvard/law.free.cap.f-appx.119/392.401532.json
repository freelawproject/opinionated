(\u201cRon-son\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order granting Defendant-Appellees Steel Partners II, L.P., Steel Partners, L.L.C., Warren Lichtenstein, and Jack Howard\u2019s (collectively \u201cSteel Partners\u201d) motion to dismiss and Howard M. Lorber\u2019s separate motion to dismiss Ronson\u2019s complaint as time-barred. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. For the reasons stated by the District Court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-26\">On March 11, 1998, Steel Partners filed a Schedule 13D to report its ownership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>interest in Ronson, but it did not check the box to indicate that it was acting as part of a group in acquiring Ronson stock. Steel Partners has filed several amendments to its Schedule 13D, none of which disclose group membership. It is clear from the record that Ronson suspected Steel Partners\u2019 participation in a group as early as 1999. In a letter from Ronson\u2019s CEO, Louis Y. Aronson, II, to Steel Partners\u2019 CEO, Warren Lichtenstein, Aronson uses phrases such as \u201c[w]hile you may believe that you and your secret investor group are entitled to special treatment and privileges ... you and your group have not demonstrated ... you have boasted to your investor group.... \u201d App. at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">On May 16, 2003, Ronson filed a complaint alleging that Steel Partners\u2019 failure to disclose its group membership violated section 13(d)(3) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78m(d)(3). The district court dismissed the complaint as time-barred because Ronson was on inquiry notice of any alleged group activity since 1999, but it did not file a complaint until May 16, 2003. In doing so, the district court rejected Ronson\u2019s argument that Steel Partners\u2019 subsequent amendments to its Schedule 13D, two of which were filed within a year prior to Ronson\u2019s complaint, constitute new violations and should restart the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Merle v. United States, </em>351 F.3d 92, 94 (3d Cir.2003). A motion to dismiss may be granted only if, accepting all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the plaintiff is not entitled to relief. <em>Oran v. Stafford, </em>226 F.3d 275, 279 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Ronson was on inquiry notice, and the statute of limitations period began to run, when it \u201c \u2018discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the basis for [its] claim\u2019 \u201d against Steel Partners. <em>In re NAHC, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>306 F.3d 1314, 1325 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Gruber v. Price Waterhouse, </em>697 F.Supp. 859, 863 (E.D.Pa.1988)). \u201cWhether the plaintiffs, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have known of the basis for their claims depends on whether they had \u2018sufficient information of possible wrongdoing to place them on \u201cinquiry notice\u201d or to excite \u201cstorm warnings\u201d of culpable activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gruber, </em>697 F.Supp. at 864).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">The basis for Ronson\u2019s claim is Steel Partners\u2019 nondisclosure of group activity, and Ronson had information as early as 1999 to provide a \u201cstorm warning\u201d that the defendants were allegedly acting as a group. Steel Partners, by continuously failing to disclose such group membership, has not committed any new violations. <em>See Green v. Fund Asset Mgmt., L.P., </em>19 F.Supp.2d 227, 233 (D.N.J.1998). Thus, Ronson\u2019s complaint is time-barred under both the Securities and Exchange Act\u2019s one-year limitations period, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r(c), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s two-year limitations period, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Because the District Court correctly granted Steel Partners\u2019 motion and Lorber\u2019s separate motion to dismiss Ronson\u2019s complaint, we will AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
