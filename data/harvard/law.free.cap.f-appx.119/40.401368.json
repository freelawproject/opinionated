R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b67-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-22\">Larry Duane Bauska seeks reversal of his conviction on one count of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, and two counts of making false statements to obtain federal employees\u2019 compensation, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-23\">Bauska challenges the mail fraud count by arguing there was insufficient evidence he utilized the mails. Barbara McDonald, an employee of the Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs, testified the only way Bauska\u2019s Form CA-1082 could have reached the Kentucky processing center was by mail. Bauska\u2019s claim must be rejected because, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Bauska utilized the mails. <em>See United States v. Bishop, </em>959 F.2d 820, 829 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-24\">Bauska\u2019s challenges to the false statement counts are also unavailing. The government introduced sufficient evidence, ranging from the fliers on which Bauska advertised breeding for a fee to an under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>cover agent\u2019s testimony about negotiating a breeding for cash with Bauska, to persuade a rational fact-finder. Sufficient evidence supported his involvement in the type of activity that must be reported on Form CA-1082. Likewise, sufficient evidence, including McDonald\u2019s testimony, established that Bauska\u2019s statements were material.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">That the jury was not instructed on the meaning of the term \u201cbusiness enterprise\u201d did not violate Bauska\u2019s right to have every element of the crime charged proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The ultimate question presented to the jury was whether Bauska made a false statement on Form CA-1082. Business enterprise is simply one term utilized on the form. When that term is read in the context of the form, it is clear that Bauska\u2019s horse breeding activities, which extended to advertising on the Internet and passing out fliers at a horse show, were of the type that should have been reported. The jury instructions were not deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the testimony of Robert Boyle, Bauska\u2019s expert. <em>See United States v. Seschillie, </em>310 F.3d 1208, 1211-12 (9th Cir.2002). Boyle proposed to explain the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) definition of \u201cbusiness enterprise.\u201d In the absence of any evidence Bauska relied on this definition when filling out Form CA-1082, and given that the IRS definition is not dispositive of the meaning of Form CA-1082, the district court was within its discretion to exclude this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Nor did the district court abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct. Any missteps of the prosecution were slight, and were cured by the district court\u2019s jury instruction. <em>See United States v. Marsh, </em>894 F.2d 1035, 1040 (9th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Finally, admission of McDonald\u2019s testimony as lay testimony was not in error. McDonald\u2019s testimony related to daily activities in the course of her employment, rather than the sort of scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge intended to be evaluated under Federal Rules of Evidence 702.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b67-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
