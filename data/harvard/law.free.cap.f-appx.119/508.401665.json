Taylor appeals the district court\u2019s orders granting Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment in Taylor\u2019s action under Title VII and denying his motions for leave to amend his complaint, for reconsideration, and for copy work at government expense. We have reviewed the record and find no abuse of discretion or reversible error. Accordingly, we deny as moot his motions to expedite and for consideration of his expedition motion by a single circuit judge, and we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Taylor v. Potter, </em>No. CA-03-1244-PJM (D. Md. Oct. 9, 2003; Jan. 30, 2004; Aug. 11, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
