See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b556-7\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Jacqueline Ngomnkap Nkabyo Forghab, a native and citizen of Cameroon, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">On appeal, Forghab raises challenges to the immigration judge\u2019s determination that she failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence [s]he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the record and conclude Forghab fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. We also note Forghab did not challenge the immigration judge\u2019s findings that she did not offer credible testimony and failed to provide corroborative evidence. <em>Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see also Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 189 n. 7 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Forghab\u2019s request for withholding of removal. We note Forghab failed to address this issue in the argument section of her brief, and as a result has waived any challenge to the argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>IGEN Int'l. Inc. v. Roche Diagnostics GmbH, </em>335 F.3d 303, 308 (4th Cir.2003). In any event, the standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Forghab fails to show she is eligible for asylum, - she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
