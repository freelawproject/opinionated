Because the transitional rules apply, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-23\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding because Zeidan\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his asylum application regarding the circumstances surrounding his brothers\u2019 deaths and whether his persecutors continued to actively pursue him after 1987. These events go to the heart of his asylum claim. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000) (explaining that inconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony that go to the heart of applicant\u2019s asylum claim justify an adverse credibility finding). Moreover, the BIA properly rejected Zeidan\u2019s explanation that he. did not know the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tents of his asylum application because Zeidan initially testified that he was familiar with the contents of the application. <em>See id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Because Zeidan failed to qualify for asylum, he necessarily failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Because Zeidan failed to show that he is more likely than not to be tortured upon return to Lebanon, the BIA properly rejected his claim under the CAT. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1284 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Pursuant to <em>Elian v. Ashcroft, </em>370 F.3d 897 (9th Cir.2004) (order), petitioner\u2019s voluntary departure period will begin to run upon issuance of this court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b115-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
