Trager, <em>Judge), </em>denying Wilson\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Wilson was convicted, after a jury trial, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Queens County, of robbery in the first degree, and was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of seven and one-half to fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Wilson filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in the District Court seeking habeas relief on, <em>inter alia, </em>the ground that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at his trial. The District Court, adopting the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy, denied Wilson\u2019s petition. On January 22, 2004, we granted a certificate of appealability on Wilson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Familiarity with the facts of this case and its procedural history is assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Wilson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim rests on the following six instances of conduct by his trial counsel: (1) counsel, by presenting Carolyn Younger\u2019s testimony about Wilson\u2019s character, opened the door to the admission of Wilson\u2019s prior arrests and convictions; (2) counsel attacked the quality of the police investigation of the robbery, which, as counsel was warned that it would, opened the door to evidence of an additional identification of Wilson by the complainant on the day of the robbery; (3) counsel declined to have redacted a mugshot of Wilson offered into evidence that showed Wilson with a booking plate hung around his neck; (4) counsel elicited from the complainant that he was reluctant to testify against Wilson because he feared reprisal; (5) counsel placed into evidence an unrelated police report documenting Wilson\u2019s prior arrest for armed offenses; and (6) counsel failed to object to the commencement of deliberations on the eve of Yom Kippur, a Tuesday, when the court reporter would be unavailable for readbacks from late Tuesday afternoon until Thursday morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Although the state argues that defense counsel had strategic reasons for his conduct, \u201cwith the record before us, we are unable to assess with confidence whether strategic considerations accounted for\u201d certain acts or omissions by defense counsel that had the effect of substantially strengthening the state\u2019s otherwise weak case. We therefore remand to the District Court to afford Wilson\u2019s trial counsel the opportunity to explain his actions. <em>See Eze v. Senkowski, </em>321 F.3d 110, 136 (2d Cir.2003) (remanding for a hearing because, \u201c[w]hile it is fundamental that acts and omissions that could be considered sound trial strategy do not rise to the level of deficient performance under <em>Strickland, </em>we cannot presently conclude that [petitioner\u2019s] counsel\u2019s actions were grounded in trial strategy\u201d); <em>Sparman v. Edwards, </em>154 F.3d 51, 52 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam) (\u2018We believe that a district court facing the question of constitutional ineffectiveness of counsel should, except in highly unusual circumstances, offer the assertedly ineffective attorney an opportunity to be heard and to present evidence, in the form of live testimony, affidavits, or briefs.\u201d). Since the District Court concluded that the record suggested a plausible strategy to explain defense counsel\u2019s decisions, it had no reason to solicit his testimony regarding trial tactics. The present record does not permit us to reach the same conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>sion; we find that \u201cthe record fails to suggest any plausible trial strategy\u201d for at least some of the acts or omissions about which Wilson complains. <em>Eze, </em>321 F.3d at 129. Given our concern that a <em>Strickland </em>violation may have occurred in this case, we consider it prudent to proceed by remanding to the District Court so that it can hear from defense counsel. <em>See Jackson v. Leonardo, </em>162 F.3d 81, 86 (2d Cir.1998) (where the circuit court finds a <em>Strickland </em>violation, \u201cthe usual practice should be to remand ... to the district court to permit the attorney in question to testify and explain her actions\u201d). The District Court should determine, in light of counsel\u2019s testimony, whether his acts and omissions were indeed part of a sound trial strategy. <em>See Pavel v. Hollins, </em>261 F.3d 210, 218 (2d Cir.2001) (a strategic decision is a \u201cconscious, reasonably informed decision made by an attorney with an eye to benefitting his client\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">For the reasons stated above, we VACATE the judgment of the District Court denying Wilson\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus and REMAND with instructions to give Wilson\u2019s trial counsel an opportunity to explain his performance. The District Court should thereafter enter a judgment consistent with its findings. If further proceedings arising from Wilson\u2019s habeas petition are required in this Court, the parties shall inform the Clerk of this Court. Jurisdiction will then be automatically restored to this Court without need for a new notice of appeal. <em>See United States v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 22 (2d Cir.1994). After jurisdiction is restored, the Clerk shall calendar the renewed appeal in the manner customary for a new appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
