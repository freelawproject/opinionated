The prosecutor\u2019s remarks in this case did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (citation and quotation omitted), when viewed in the context of the entire trial, <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 11, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Two of the remarks that Oppen complains of do not constitute vouching. First, when the prosecutor conceded that co-defendants Abrahamson and Fulton probably had a reason to lie because of the plea bargain, but urged the jury to examine other evidence indicating these witnesses were telling the truth, the prosecutor did not inject her personal opinion or reference to evidence outside of the record. Thus, this remark did not constitute vouching under <em>Young. </em>470 U.S. at 8, 18-19, 105 S.Ct. 1038. The prosecutor\u2019s second statement \u2014 that sometimes plea bargains happen and the jury should hold the plea bargains against her and her office\u2014 merely explained the role of plea bargains and did not express an opinion about the witnesses\u2019 credibility. Thus, it also did not constitute vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Although the prosecutor\u2019s statement, \u201cI think it was because they were telling the truth,\u201d was improper vouching, this sole isolated remark did not rise to a due process violation. Given defense counsel\u2019s extensive attack on the credibility of all three witnesses who testified against Oppen pursuant to plea bargains, and the jury\u2019s question during deliberations about the plea bargains, which showed they were weighing these witnesses\u2019 credibility, it cannot be said that the Washington State Court of Appeals unreasonably applied Supreme Court law in concluding that the one remark did not prejudice Oppen.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b908-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
