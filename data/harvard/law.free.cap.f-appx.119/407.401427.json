In 1999, a jury sitting in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania returned a verdict against Appellant Berto Ordaz, finding him guilty of two counts of a Superseding Indictment: Count 1 \u2014 conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and Count 47\u2014 use of a telephone on May 23, 1998, in furtherance of a drug offense. For the purposes of establishing Appellant\u2019s offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d), the Court attributed the amount of 56 kilograms of cocaine to Appellant. In addition, the Court determined that Appellant was not entitled to a mitigating factor sentence reduction under the Guidelines for playing a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d role in the conspiracy. The Court sentenced Appellant to a term of 240 months of imprisonment on Count 1 and a consecutive term of 30 months of imprisonment on Count 47, for a total term of imprisonment of 270 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. For the reasons set forth below, we will reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">I. Convictions</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">We turn first to Appellant\u2019s challenge to his convictions. First, Appellant objects to the District Court\u2019s decision to admit into evidence certain testimony about statements which it found to be made by co-conspirators of Appellant \u201cduring the course of and in furtherance of that conspiracy.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E); <em>United States v. McGlory, </em>968 F.2d 309, 333-34 (3d Cir.1992). Appellant insists that this testimony contributed to his conviction on Count 1. We review the District Court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Versaint, </em>849 F.2d 827, 831 (3d Cir.1988); <em>United States v. Tyler, </em>281 F.3d 84, 98 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">We are satisfied that we do not need to address Appellant\u2019s specific objections to any particular co-conspirator statements,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because we conclude that even if the Court\u2019s decision to admit those statements was error, such error was harmless. A harmless error is one that beyond a reasonable doubt did not contribute to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>verdict </em>\u2014 Le., an occurrence that is \u201cunimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed in the record.\u201d <em>Yates v. Evatt, </em>500 U.S. 391, 403, 111 S.Ct. 1884, 114 L.Ed.2d 432 (1991) (citing <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)). To reach this conclusion, we consider other evidence presented in the case in addition to the testimony at issue. <em>United States v. Emanuele, </em>51 F.3d 1123, 1131-32 (3d Cir.1995) (citing <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 118, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977) (Stevens, J. concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">In this case, the record contains overwhelming evidence of Appellant\u2019s participation in the drug conspiracy run by Lazara Ordaz (the \u201cOrdaz Organization\u201d). The government presented comprehensive evidence establishing that the Ordaz Organization conducted drug sales in the vicinity of 8th and Tioga Streets in North Philadelphia from 1993 through October of 1998; that it obtained cocaine from a number of sources, but primarily in Miami, one or more times per month; and that it ultimately sold the cocaine in smaller quantities. The government also presented testimony from witnesses to establish that \u2014 from approximately December of 1993 to January of 1996 \u2014 Appellant was the courier who drove to Miami to obtain the cocaine, and who then brought the cocaine back to the Ordaz Organization for processing and sale. Indeed, the government offered direct eyewitness testimony as to Appellant\u2019s personal delivery of cocaine to Ordaz Organization members. <em>See, e.g., </em>App. at 201-205. We therefore conclude that the total weight of the evidence against Appellant makes any potential error in the admission of the co-conspirator statements at issue harmless, and we will affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Second, Appellant also challenges his conviction on Count 47, arguing there was insufficient evidence to support a jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We review a jury verdict in the light most favorable to the government to determine if \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Dent, </em>149 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.1998). If there was sufficient evidence for any rational jury to find Appellant guilty on Count 47 beyond a reasonable doubt, we must affirm. <em>United States v. Voigt, </em>89 F.3d 1050, 1080 (3d Cir.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1047, 117 S.Ct. 623, 136 L.Ed.2d 546 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">A defendant may violate 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) by making telephone calls to facilitate a conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Theodoropoulos, </em>866 F.2d 587, 594-95 (3d Cir.1989). Count 1 of the Superseding Indictment alleged a conspiracy between the members of the Ordaz Organization to distribute cocaine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Count 47 alleged use of a telephone to facilitate the specific conspiracy alleged in Count 1, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). The telephone call at issue occurred on May 23, 1998, between Appellant and both Pablo Rodriguez and Lazara Ordaz.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In order to convict Appellant on Count 47, the jury must have been able to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the May 28, 1998 telephone call facilitated the specific Ordaz Organization drug distribution conspiracy charged in Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">We conclude that the evidence of the May 28, 1998 telephone call is fundamentally insufficient to establish that Appellant used that specific call to facilitate the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>spiracy charged in Count 1. Appellant was incarcerated at the time of the call and was no longer an active courier in the Ordaz Organization. At no time during the call did any participant explicitly reference the drug distribution activities of the Ordaz Organization. To the contrary, the only explicit references to drugs were part of a discussion regarding the delivery of drugs to Appellant in prison and Appellant\u2019s personal use of drugs while incarcerated. Since an essential element of a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b) is facilitation of the drug conspiracy, the discussion of Appellant\u2019s personal drug use is irrelevant to Count 47. Putting that aside, the jury was left to consider only a highly ambiguous, subsequent portion of the telephone call in which Appellant made the statements \u201cwhen that moved that \u2014 that when Papito tells me that he\u2019s ready, I tell him to get you, Lazara\u201d and \u201cIn case of any moves, you understand?\u201d App. at 94. These statements simply did not include enough information for a rational jury to conclude that Appellant was using the telephone call to facilitate the ongoing distribution of cocaine (as opposed to facilitating delivery of drugs to himself in prison or any other possible non-drug related purpose). Indeed, the government failed to even identify the person referenced as \u201cPapito,\u201d or establish that he/she was in any way connected to activities of the Ordaz Organization. The transcript of the telephone call is bereft of any evidence to support the conclusion that Appellant used that telephone call to facilitate the ongoing distribution of cocaine in Philadelphia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on this record, we believe that any such conclusion could only be mere speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Because we conclude that the evidence presented was fundamentally insufficient for any rational jury to find the essential elements of the crime charged in Count 47 beyond a reasonable doubt, we will reverse Appellant\u2019s conviction on Count 47 and vacate that portion of Appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">II. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">Appellant also challenges his sentence. First, Appellant argues that the District Court erred by not granting him a reduction in his base offense level under the Guidelines. We review the District Court\u2019s factual determination concerning whether Appellant\u2019s role in the conspiracy qualifies him for an offense level reduction under Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 for clear error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>878 F.2d 125, 126-27 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">District Courts have broad discretion in applying Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 to cases involving drug couriers. <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238-42 (3d Cir.1998). A \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction is available for a defendant whose role in the offense makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant. <em>See Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d at 238-39. In <em>United States v. Headley, </em>923 F.2d 1079, 1084 (3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Cir.1991), we noted that a determination as to whether a drug courier such as Appellant is a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d participant under \u00a7 3B1.2 includes consideration of \u201csuch factors as the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise,\u201d and that the defendant\u2019s conduct should be examined in relation to the other participants. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d at 239 (citing <em>United States v. Bierley, </em>922 F.2d 1061, 1065 (3d Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">We are satisfied that the District Court\u2019s finding that Appellant was not entitled to a base offense level reduction for being a \u201cminor\u201d or \u201cminimal\u201d participant in the Ordaz Organization conspiracy was not clearly erroneous. As the District Court noted, Appellant was \u201ca courier again and again and again, to the extent that it might have been weekly.\u201d App. at 362(a). The substantial weight of the evidence established that Appellant\u2019s activities occurred not only frequently but also more often than other players in the conspiracy, and that Appellant knowingly played a crucial role in the conspiracy relative to others (ie., by obtaining the cocaine and transporting it to Philadelphia for packaging and sale). Appellant had a close relationship with the Ordaz Organization leadership and was fully aware of his important role in the organization\u2019s drug distribution business. Accordingly, we believe the District Court\u2019s conclusion that he \u201cwas a major part of this conspiracy, and no way was he considered a minor player\u201d is supported by the substantial weight of the evidence. <em>Id.; accord United States v. Carr, </em>25 F.3d 1194 (3d Cir.1994). The District Court therefore did not commit clear error, and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Second, Appellant challenges the District Court\u2019s attribution of between 50 and 150 kilograms of cocaine to Appellant for purposes of computing his sentence under the Guidelines. We review the District Court\u2019s factual findings regarding the quantity of cocaine for sentencing purposes for clear error. <em>United States v. Yeung, </em>241 F.3d 321, 322 (3d Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Paulino, </em>996 F.2d 1541, 1545 (3d Cir.1993)). The District Court\u2019s determination need only be supported by a preponderance of evidence \u201cwith sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d 188, 203 (3d Cir.1999) <em>(citing US. v. Miele, </em>989 F.2d 659, 663 (3d Cir.1993)). Furthermore, we recognize that \u201ca degree of estimation is sometimes necessary\u201d because the covert nature of the drug trade precludes seizure and precise measurement of the drugs that flow through a drug distribution conspiracy. <em>Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d at 203; <em>Paulino, </em>996 F.2d at 1545. We have previously acknowledged that courts may estimate a drug quantity based on testimony by co-defendants about the weight of drugs transported by couriers, and on other testimony about the average amounts sold per day multiplied by a particular length of time. <em>See Gibbs </em>190 F.3d at 204 (citing <em>United States v. Maggard, </em>156 F.3d 843, 848 (8th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">We are satisfied that the District Court\u2019s determination regarding the quantity of cocaine distributed by the Ordaz Organization during the period of time in which Appellant was a courier is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The weight of the evidence shows that Appellant participated in frequent trips to Miami, and direct witness testimony established the frequency and quantity of drug shipments handled by Appellant and other couriers. This evidence was bolstered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>testimony about the quantity of cocaine actually sold by the Ordaz Organization after it took delivery from its couriers. In addition, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agent Tropea (a federal agent assigned to the long-term investigation of the Ordaz Organization) offered a cocaine quantity estimate based on multiple years of communications intercepts, witness interviews, and historical seizures. <em>See Gibbs, inter alia </em>(affirming a District Court\u2019s finding as to drug quantity where the weight of the evidence was significantly less than in this case). Here, we conclude that the government\u2019s estimate was supported by a substantial amount of evidence bearing significant indicia of reliability to establish its probable accuracy. The District Court therefore did not commit clear error, and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The judgment of the District Court with respect to Count 47 will be reversed. The remainder of that judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">SLOVITER, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part and concurring in part.</p>\n<author id=\"b439-8\">SLOVITER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">I join all of the majority\u2019s opinion except that portion of Section I of the opinion that reverses Berto Ordaz\u2019s conviction on Count 47, which charged use of a communication facility on May 23, 1998, in furtherance of a drug offense. I believe that the evidence adduced at trial adequately supports Ordaz\u2019s conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b); therefore, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to the contrary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-13\">As the majority notes, there was overwhelming evidence that Berto Ordaz was a participant in the drug conspiracy run by his sister, Lazara Ordaz.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He was the courier who drove to Miami to obtain the cocaine which he then delivered to other members of the Ordaz Organization in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was imprisoned in the Philadelphia Detention Center on May 23, 1998, the date of the phone conversation at issue. Ordaz participated in the call, which the United States intercepted by means of a lawful wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">Obviously, once he was incarcerated, he could no longer fulfill his role as courier. However, this does not mean that his overall role or participation in the conspiracy was at an end. Rather, the decisional law is clear that a conspirator\u2019s arrest or incarceration alone does not necessarily signal the end of his participation in a conspiracy or his ability to further the conspiracy\u2019s ends. <em>See United States v. Melton, </em>131 F.3d 1400, 1405 (10th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>542 F.2d 1283, 1301 (7th Cir.1976); <em>United States v. Armocida, </em>515 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>F.2d 29, 47 (3d Cir.1975). Thus, unlike the majority, I find nothing particularly telling in the fact that Ordaz was incarcerated at the time of the conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Further, in reversing Ordaz\u2019s conviction, the majority focuses its attention solely on the May 23, 1998 conversation itself. Admittedly, the conversation was rather cryptic; standing alone, the conversation itself is likely insufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt. On the other hand, we held in <em>United States v. Theodoropoulos, </em>866 F.2d 587, 595 (3d Cir.1989), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by United States v. Price, </em>76 F.3d 526, 528 (3d Cir.1996), that the jury could have construed a somewhat cryptic telephone conversation \u201cas reflecting part of the ongoing relationship [between two members of the drug organization] with respect to the sale of drugs and payment therefor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In resolving a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, this court must consider the record evidence as a whole \u2014 an appellate court faced with an insufficiency of the evidence challenge should not consider a subset of the evidence in isolation and untethered to the remainder of the record. <em>Gov\u2019t of Virgin Islands v. Joseph, </em>770 F.2d 343, 345 (3d Cir.1985); <em>accord United States v. Graves, </em>669 F.2d 964, 970 (5th Cir.1982). I believe the majority does just that.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Notably, the majority correctly finds that the record contains \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence of Ordaz\u2019s participation in the narcotics conspiracy. Due, however, to its erroneous reliance on the fact of Ordaz\u2019s incarceration, and its narrow approach to the evidence, the majority neglects to consider its earlier conclusion with regard to the May 23, 1998 conversation and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">When Ordaz\u2019s conviction is considered in perspective of the entire record and in the light favorable to the United States, it is adequately supported. Although \u2014 as concluded by the majority \u2014 some of the May 23 conversation may have related to Ordaz\u2019s attempts to obtain narcotics for personal use, the transcript, viewed in the United States\u2019 favor and taking all reasonable inferences therefrom, supports a finding that even in jail Ordaz was continuing to assist in the conspiracy. During that conversation, Ordaz asked his sister to provide him with the telephone numbers of certain other members of the organization. The jury may well have been skeptical of Ordaz\u2019s explanation that he sought the phone numbers so that he would have people to talk to during his incarceration in order to stem his boredom. Perhaps most telling is that one of the phone numbers Lazara provided to Ordaz during the call was that of a public payphone located in North Philadelphia \u2014 a payphone that the United States, through other evidence introduced at trial, had shown was virtually monopolized by members of the Ordaz Organization for their illicit trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">During the May 23 call, Ordaz told his sister: \u201cNo, no, when that move, that, that, when Papito tells me that he\u2019s ready, I tell him to get you \u2014 Lazara, what\u2019s you beeper number, man?\u201d App. at 379. Considering the record <em>in toto, </em>especially the evidence respecting Ordaz and Lazara\u2019s relationship and the important role Ordaz played in the narcotics enterprise, the jury could have reasonably understood this talk of a \u201cmove\u201d to have referred to a drug shipment. Moreover, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that Ordaz was ensuring that when \u201cPapito\u201d was ready with a \u201cmove\u201d Ordaz was going to inform his sister and arrange things, thereby furthering the conspiracy. Indeed, later in the conversation, immediately after his sister had provided him with several telephone numbers, including her beeper number and the number of the North Philadelphia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>payphone, Ordaz restated the reason why he had asked her to provide these numbers: \u2018Yeah, in case of any moves, you understand?,\u201d to which his sister immediately responded, \u2018You call me.\u201d App. at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In sum, when the record evidence is viewed as a whole and in the light most favorable to the government, together with all legitimate inferences to be drawn therefrom, a rational trier of fact could have found Ordaz guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Augustin, </em>376 F.3d 135, 138 (3d Cir.2004); <em>Joseph, </em>770 F.2d at 345. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse Ordaz\u2019s conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b435-8\">. Although the Sentencing Guidelines called for a sentence on Count 1 ranging from 262 to 327 months, the Court imposed the lower sentence of 240 months on that count because the jury had not been questioned about the amount of cocaine attributable to Appellant, as the case was tried prior to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\">. We understand Appellant to be challenging the admission of six statements. In each instance, the witness, who was a member of the conspiracy, testified as to what another member told him or her about Appellant\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy. Appellant does not contend that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that the conspiracy existed and that the speaker and hearer were members thereof. Appellant insists, however, that the statements were not shown to have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy. By the time this objection was first raised at trial (App. at 142), three of the now challenged statements had been admitted without such an objection having been made and the remaining three do not add materially to the content of those that went in without objection. We need not rest our holding on this point, however, because the other record evidence clearly establishes Appellant\u2019s role in the conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b436-5\">.

While it is true that during the call Appellant also asked for Lazara Ordaz\u2019s beeper number, and in response Lazara Ordaz provided Appellant with four numbers, including those of her own beeper and cellular phone, the home number of Miguel Morales (an Ordaz Organization conspirator), and the number of a pay phone routinely used by members of the Ordaz Organization, here also there is no evidence to link that exchange to the Ordaz Organization conspiracy alleged in Count 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b437-12\">.
