We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See De Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-18\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Daghbashyan\u2019s motion to reopen because the newly available evidence presented was not material to his claim that the Armenian government persecuted him on account of his religious beliefs. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d). Because the evidence provided no indication that Daghbashyan\u2019s religion was at issue, he failed to establish <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for relief. <em>See Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201ca motion to reopen will not be granted unless the [petitioner] establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of eligibility for the underlying relief sought\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b109-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
