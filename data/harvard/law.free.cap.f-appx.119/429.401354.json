Jarrett subsequently filed a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>for reconsideration of the denial of the motion to suppress. The district court deemed the motion to reconsider to include a motion to withdraw the guilty plea if the motion to suppress was granted; therefore, in granting the motion to suppress, the court granted Jarrett\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On appeal by the Government, we reversed the district court\u2019s order suppressing the evidence and remanded for further proceedings. <em>United States v. Jarrett, </em>338 F.3d 339 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1457, 124 S.Ct. 1457, 158 L.Ed.2d 90 (2004). At sentencing, Jarrett moved to reenter a plea of not guilty. The district court, concluding that this court mandated reinstatement of the guilty plea, denied the motion and sentenced Jarrett to 235 months imprisonment. On appeal, Jarrett argues that the district court erred in (1) reinstating his guilty plea and (2) applying a revised version of the Sentencing Guidelines Manual when he was convicted of offenses committed before and after the effective date of the revised edition. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Jarrett first argues that the district court erred in not allowing him to reenter his plea of not guilty after this court reversed the district court\u2019s order granting his motion to suppress. Specifically, Jarrett maintains that the district court should have deferred to its earlier ruling in withdrawing Jarrett\u2019s guilty plea in light of the fact that this court did not address that issue in its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Clearly, Jarrett\u2019s guilty plea was conditioned on his right to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to suppress. The district court, in granting the motion to suppress on reconsideration, considered the guilty plea inextricably linked to its order granting the motion to suppress, and therefore deemed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea implicit in the motion to reconsider. Because this court reversed the suppression of evidence, the district court reinstated the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u201cFew legal precepts are as firmly established as the doctrine that the mandate of a higher court is \u2018controlling as to matters within its compass.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Sprague v. Ticonic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161, 168, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939)). That is, a district court must abide by the mandate of an appeals court and may not consider questions resolved by that mandate. <em>Id. </em>When a district court engages in further proceedings related to the matter resolved by the appellate court, the district court must follow both the letter and the spirit of the mandate, taking into account the appellate court\u2019s opinion and the circumstances it embraces. <em>Id. </em>at 66-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Although this court\u2019s opinion was silent with respect to the guilty plea, given that the motion to suppress and the guilty plea were inextricably linked and that this court reversed the suppression of the evidence, the district court was following the \u201cletter and spirit of the mandate\u201d in reinstating Jarrett\u2019s guilty plea. At best, Jarrett\u2019s motion to reinstate his plea of not guilty can be construed as a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u201cA defendant has no \u2018absolute right\u2019 to withdraw a guilty plea, and the district court has discretion to decide whether a \u2018fair and just reason\u2019 exists upon which to grant a withdrawal.\u201d <em>United States v. Bowman, </em>348 F.3d 408, 413 (4th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1226, 124 S.Ct. 1523, 158 L.Ed.2d 166 (2004). The district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>81 F.3d 1300, 1305 (4th Cir.1996). Given that Jarrett has proffered no \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for withdrawal, we find no abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tion in the district court\u2019s denial of Jarrett\u2019s motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Jarrett also contends that the district court\u2019s application of a five-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.5(b)(1) (2003) constituted an ex post facto application of the guidelines, in violation of USSG \u00a7 lBl.ll(b)(1). This court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error, and its interpretation of a sentencing guideline de novo. <em>See United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). We find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the enhancement. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 lBl.ll(b)(3) (\u201cIf the defendant is convicted of two offenses, the first committed before and the second after, a revised edition of the Guidelines Manual became effective, the revised edition of the Guidelines Manual is to be applied to both offenses.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Lems, </em>235 F.3d 215, 217-18 (4th Cir.2000) (explicitly rejecting an ex post facto argument when a revised edition of the Guidelines Manual was applied to offenses that predated and postdated the revision).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Jarrett\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
