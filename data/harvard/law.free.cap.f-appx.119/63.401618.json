Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 808, 811 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Melkonian v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 1061, 1064-65 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Fisher v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 955, 960 (9th Cir.1996) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-20\">The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if \u201c \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 815, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cIt can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When an alien seeks to overturn the BIA\u2019s adverse determination, \u201che must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. at 817; see <em>also Ghaly v. INS, 58 F.3d </em>1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">While credibility determinations are judged by the same deferential substantial evidence standard, <em>see Kebede, </em>366 F.3d at 810-11; <em>Gui v. INS, </em>280 F.3d 1217, 1225 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000); <em>de Leon-Barrios v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997), those determinations \u201c \u2018must be supported by a specific, cogent reason.\u2019 \u201d <em>de Leon-Barrios, </em>116 F.3d at 393 (citation omitted); <em>see also Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Where a petitioner\u2019s testimony is unrefuted and credible, an IJ may not require corroboration of claims. <em>Gui, </em>280 F.3d at 1227; <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071-72 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cWhere, as here, a petitioner provides some corroborative evidence to strengthen his case, his failure to produce still more supporting evidence should not be held against him.\u201d <em>Gui </em>280 F.3d at 1227. Moreover, this court has found State Department Reports \u201cto be irrelevant in cases where individuals have experienced actual persecution by the government.\u201d <em>Shah, </em>220 F.3d at 1069. <em>But see Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that when an IJ has reasons to doubt credibility and \u201can applicant inexplicably fails to present easily available, material, non-duplicative, corroborating evidence to support his asylum claim,\u201d the failure to produce this corroboration can be fatal).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Here, the IJ\u2019s primary reason for the adverse credibility determination was Wala\u2019s failure to produce corroborating evidence that the Congress Party did indeed exist in India.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ went on to say that even if the party did exist, there was no corroboration that its members have been abused by the government or the police. Contrary to the IJ\u2019s assertion, however, exhibits admitted at the merits hearing specifically referred to the Congress Party and its conflicts with the BJP political party, whose members Wala claims persecuted him. As a result, we must grant the petition, set aside the adverse credibility finding, and remand for a determination of Wala\u2019s asylum, withholding, and Convention Against Torture claims. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355-56, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Arulampalam v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 679, 689 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Petition GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b90-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b90-21\">.
