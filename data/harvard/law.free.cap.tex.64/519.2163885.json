Railway company \u2014 Regulations.\u2014A railway company has the right to require persons hauling freight from its depot to receive the same on the platform from its servants and not to enter the warehouse for the purpose of checking off the freight; and also to require that persons doing business .with the company shall transact the same over the counter, and not enter behind it. Such regulations are reasonable.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b543-13\"><em>2. </em>Damages. \u2014 It is no ground for damages against the company that a dray-man was discharged by his employer, because an agent of the company informed the employer that the drayman would not be allowed to violate proper regulations of the company.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b543-15\">8. Agents. \u2014 It is the duty of agents of a railway company to enforce the regulations of the company, but not to give reasons why such regulations were made; and if, in giving such reasons, they use actionable language, they, and not the company, will be liable.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b543-16\">Appeal from Marion. Tried below before the Hon. W. P. McLean.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-17\">This suit was instituted by appellant to recover damages from a railway company for having caused his discharge from employment by J. M. De Ware, who owned a line of wagons engaged in hauling freight to and from defendant\u2019s depot and warehouse, at Jefferson, and also for defamation of plaintiff\u2019s character by the railway company through its agents. It appeared on the trial that plaintiff had charge of the wagons at a salary of $50 a month, and that it was his business to deliver goods at the depot and take shipping receipts for them, and also to hau.1 goods away. An order was issued by the railway company that only its employees should enter the warehouse; that all business should be transacted over the counter, and not behind it, and that freight should be delivered and received at the platform. The agent of the company told De Ware that plaintiff would not be allowed in the warehouse or behind the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>counter, but gave no reason for it. De Ware was then ignorant of the order of the company and discharged plaintiff, because, as he said, \u201c I had no use for him unless he could go into the warehouse and check out freight, and in the office and settle bills.\u201d Plaintiff then tried to prove what the agent of the company had stated was the reason why the railway company had discharged plaintiff from its employment in 1883, but the court would not admit the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-5\"><em>Geo.

It was their business to enforce the company\u2019s rules, but not to give reasons why they were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">If they used language in reference to the plaintiff which would be actionable, they would be responsible therefor, but not the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The evidence shows that the plaintiff\u2019s employer discharged him because the company would not permit him to enter its warehouses there to check off freight, and to enter behind its counters to transact business; this, if not a sufficient ground, under some circumstances might give an action against his employer, but certainly would not against the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Ho other judgment than that rendered could legally have been given, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">[Opinion delivered October 27, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
