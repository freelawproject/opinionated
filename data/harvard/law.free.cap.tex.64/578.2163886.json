The stipulation for partial indemnity in case of additional policies being taken out in other companies, with the consent of defendant, did not change defendant\u2019s liability to pay the full sum named in the policy.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b602-15\">(4) The mere fact that the sum of the several policies gave the insured full indemnity for the loss furnished no grounds for refusing to pay the several policies.

Tried below before the Hon. W. P. McLean.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b603-12\">The appellee, on April 7, 1885, filed suit in the district court of Marion county, Texas, against appellant, on a fire insurance policy issued by appellant. The petition of appellee alleged in substance: That on the 8th day of October, 1884, it was the owner of certain lots in Jefferson, together with the building thereon situated, and an ice machine with all its attachments and apparatus, situated in the building; that it had on storage a lot of beer in kegs; that the building was worth the sum of $1,500, the beer in kegs was worth the sum of $600, and the ice machine with its attachments was worth the sum of $7,499.25; that on that date the appellee procured insurance with the appellant, and The Fire Association of Philadelphia, and The American Fire Insurance Company, through Beard &amp; Claiborne, the common agents of the three companies; that appellant issued a policy of insurance to appellee on the property as follows: $500 on the building, $1,833 on the engine and boiler, $666.75 on condenser, freezing tank and fixtures, pumps and tools, $200 on their beer in kegs \u2014 making the total insurance of appellant on the property $3,199.75; that the property was insured for the same amounts, and in the same way, in the two policies issued by the other two companies herein referred to; that in all of the policies there was a mistake mutual to both appellant and appellee in the preparation, in this, that it was not the intention of the parties, in. the preparation of the policies, to place separate insurance on the several items of property covered by the policy, but to take in the aggregate the amount of insurance specified in the policy, on the whole of the property, without reference to the separate values of the several parts of the property; that on October 29, 1884, the property covered by the policy of appellant was totally destroyed by fire; that the building at the time of the fire was of the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>of $1,500, and the beer in kegs was of the value of $600, and the ice machine was of the value of $8,997; that the boiler and engine, taken separately, were of the value of $3,000, and the condenser, tank, fixtures and tools were of the value of $4,977.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-4\">Appellee prayed that the policy of insurance sued upon be reformed, so as to express the true contract of the parties, and that appellee have judgment for the full amount of the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-5\">Appellant, in its first amended original answer, filed June 3,1885, set up the following defenses:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-6\"><em>First. </em>General demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-7\"><em>Second. </em>Special exceptions to the sufficiency of the allegations in appellee\u2019s petition, relating to the alleged mistake in the policy of insurance sued upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-8\"><em>Third. </em>General denial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-9\"><em>Fourth. </em>Special denials that there was a mistake in the preparation of the policy, and that appellant intended to insure said property for its full value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-10\"><em>Fifth. </em>Special plea that under the policy the appellant is liable for only three-fourths of the loss, not exceeding the amount of the policy, and that there was additional and concurrent insurance in three other companies, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $6,399.50; that under the policy the appellant is only liable to pay to appellee such proportion of three-fourths of the loss sustained by the plaintiff on the property, as the amount of insurance on the property in the policy of insurance sued upon bears to the whole amount of insurance on said property; and that in no event is appellant liable for an amount exceeding the amount specified in the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-11\"><em>Sixth. </em>Special plea that there was an appraisement and arbitration between appellant and appellee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-12\">The court overruled the appellant\u2019s general demurrer and special exceptions, except the sixth special exception, to which rulings appellant and appellee both excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-13\">The appellee filed a trial amendment, to which appellant filed exceptions, which were by the court sustained, to which ruling of the court appellee excepted and declined to further amend.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b604-14\">The case was, thereupon, on the 11th day of June, 1885, tried before a jury, and there was a verdict and judgment for the appellee for the sum of $2,076.85.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AV9\"><em>Benners </em>&amp;

S., 2971.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The defendant is a foreign corporation, permitted under certain restrictions to do an insurance business in this state. R. S., 2949 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The contract of insurance was consummated here, it was contemplated that it should be executed here, and we are of the opinion that it must be governed by the laws of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The defendant, having elected to do business here under the terms of the statute, must be held to have assented, as to such business, to be governed by the laws of this state, and to have its contracts evidenced by policies here made complete, and here to be enforced, construed as would be a like contract made by a home company. Thwing <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 111 Mass., 93; Heebner <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 10 Gray, 131; Fletcher <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 13 Fed. R., 528; Cox <em>v. </em>United States, 6 Pet., 202; Wood on Fire Insurance, sec. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The language of the statute referred to is clear, and its purpose evidently was to make all policies on real property, in cases of total loss, valued policies, without reference to stipulations contained in them which would give them a different character but for the statute, which becomes a part of every such contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">By force of the statute, when the loss is total, the policy evidences a liquidated demand, against the company issuing it, for its full amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">That insurance may have been subsequently obtained, with the consent of the defendant, in other companies on the same property does not affect the liability of the defendant to pay the full sum named in the policy as the indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">The several policies on the house give full indemnity to the insured if the house was not of value greater than $1,500; but this furnishes no reason for denying to the plaintiff the indemnity contracted for.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">If, in order to induce good faith and care on the part of the insured, and thus give greater security to the insurer, it was thought that the property, to some extent, should be at the risk of the insured, such protection could have been secured to the defendant by its refusal to permit other insurance to be made on the property, as by the terms of the policy it had the power to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">In so far as the policy covered personal property, its provisions as to the share of loss to be suffered by the insured, as to contri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>butions by all companies that issued policies on the same property, and other like things, are to be given full effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The petition alleged that the engine and boiler were of the value of \u00a73,000, and it is claimed that the court erred in not instructing the jury that they could not find them to be of greater value at the time they were destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">It is a sufficient answer to this assignment to say that, if the charge was thought to be defective in this respect, a charge such as was thought proper should have been requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">It however is not denied that there was evidence from which the jury might have found that the engine and boiler were of the value of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The verdict and judgment in this respect was only for $701.56, which is a less sum than the defendant would have been liable for, under the terms of the policy, had the jury found the engine and boiler to be of the value of $3,000; hence no injury could have resulted to the defendant from the supposed defect in the charge of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The policy provided that the loss should be paid within sixty days after proof of loss was furnished; but the court instructed the jury to give interest from the date of the loss, and this they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">The contract of insurance is one from which indemnity against loss is intended to be secured; but the parties to such a contract may by it determine what the indemnity shall be, and, in the absence of some law controlling the matter, effect must be given to their contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">They did contract in such manner that the sum to be paid may be ascertained, and they fixed a time at which it should be paid; and interest, prior to the date when payment of the sum found to be due under the policy, by its terms, should be paid, constitutes no part of the indemnity for which they contracted. Nevins <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 3 Bennett\u2019s Fire Insurance Cases, 383; Swamscot Machine Co. <em>v. </em>Partridge, 3 Fire Insurance Cases, 481; McLaughlin <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 2 Fire Insurance Cases, 19; Delonguemare <em>v. </em>Insurance Co., 1 Fire Insurance Cases, 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">The policy gave insurance of $200 on \u201c their beer in kegs,\u201d and contained a provision that the insurer should not be liable for more than the value of the interest of the insured in the property, and further, that it would not be liable for property \u201c held on storage, unless separately and specifically insured as such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-14\">The policy also contained the usual provision that it should be void \u201c if any person shall, now or hereafter, have any interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>therein, or if the assured shall not be the sole and unconditional owner in fee of said property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The petition alleged that the property destroyed belonged to the plaintiff, and with other defenses the defendant pleaded a general denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">On the trial the defendant proposed to prove that the beer destroyed was not the property of the plaintiff. The evidence was objected to on the ground that there was no pleading to justify the admission of such evidence, and the objection was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">It is a general rule that an insurer desiring to defeat a policy by showing fraud, misrepresentation or other fact existing at the time of its issuance or afterwards, should plead such fact as is relied upon; but no such case is here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">The policy sued on, in terms, only extended or attached to such beer as was owned by the insured, there being no insurance on beer held on storage; and, recognizing that fact, the plaintiff pleaded that the beer and other property destroyed belonged to it, and we are of the opinion that the general denial put that fact in issue, and that the evidence should have been received; for, if the beer did not belong to the plaintiff, the policy did not cover it, however valid the policy may be.</p>\n<p id=\"AY4\">For the errors mentioned the judgment of the court below will will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">[Opinion delivered October 30, 1885.]</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">(Associate Justice Bobertson did not sit in this case.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
