Falvey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-6\">This was a suit brought in the district court of Presidio county, by the appellant, against the appellee on the 28th day of February, 1884, for the purpose of canceling and annulling the appellee\u2019s claim of title to two sections of state school land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-7\">It was alleged in the petition that S. A. Thompson, the defendant below and appellee here, was, at the time he made his application to purchase the land, a deputy surveyor of Presidio county, qualified and acting, and that his application to purchase, and all acts done in pursuance thereof, were illegal and void, and that his claim of title to the land cast a cloud upon the title of the state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b715-8\">The applications to purchase were made under the provisions of an act to amend the caption and sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of an act to provide for the sale of alternate sections of land in organized counties and other works of internal improvement, and set apart for the benefit of the common school fund, and to provide for the investment of the proceeds, and to repeal all laws in conflict therewith.

The authority of these officers to represent the state must be questioned just as would the authority of any attorney assuming to represent a plaintiff in any other action; and this certainly could not be done by a demurrer to a petition which did not allege the power under which the attorney assumed to act in bringing a suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The question depends upon an issue of fact, and not upon an issue of law which it is the office of a demurrer to raise.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">That a defendant may question- the authority of an attorney to represent a plaintiff whom he assumes to represent is true. The proper mode of procedure, if it be desired to question the authority of an attorney assuming to represent a plaintiff, is for the defendant to file some pleading or motion denying his authority, thus raising an issue of fact upon which evidence may be introduced; and to throw the burden of proof from the defendant, it seems his pleading or motion should be sworn to. Turner <em>v. </em>Caruthers, <em>17 </em>Cal., 432; Clark <em>v. </em>Willett, 35 Cal., 534; People <em>v. </em>Mariposa County, 39 Cal., 683; McKiernan <em>v. </em>Patrick, 4 Howard (Miss.), 333; Lynn v. Glidwell, 8 Yerger, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">It is urged that the petition is defective, in that it gives as a reason why the defendant could not purchase school lands from the state, that be was a \u201cdeputy surveyor,\u201d and does not allege that he was a <em>\u201c </em>special deputy surveyor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">The statute seems to give to a person who is styled a \u201c special deputy surveyor \u201d power to perform all official acts which his principal may perform, but does not in terms confer such power on a \u201cdeputy surveyor.\u201d R. S., 3840, 3842, 3843, 3853.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">From this it is argued, that while the relations of a special deputy surveyor to the duties of the surveyor are such as to enable him to exercise an improper influence in the sale-of public school lands, and hence the purchase of such lands by such an officer prohibited, yet that no such prohibition extends to a deputy surveyor, as he is expressly charged with duties which do not give him any control, op right to act, in making sales of such lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">We do not deem it necessary or proper to inquire into the powers of deputy and special deputy surveyors, in order to ascertain whether they are such as to make it proper for the legislature to prohibit each from purchasing public land.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-12\">This was a question for the legislature to determine, and it has declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">\u201c If any person who is an officer or clerk in the general land office, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>or a district surveyor, or deputy district surveyor, or county surveyor or his deputy, shall directly or indirectly be concerned in the purchase of any right, title or interest in any public land, in his own name, or in the name of any other person, ... he shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $500.\u201d P. C., 118.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">If the language used by the legislature was ambiguous, courts might look to the evil intended to be remedied, and to the policy intended to be carried out; but when there is no uncertainty in the language through which the legislature has evidenced its intention, and announced a policy, the courts have no right or power, upon their own notions of public policy, to disregard the clearly expressed will of the law-making department of the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The law expressly forbids \u201ca deputy surveyor\u201d directly or indirectly to purchase any public land.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">What the law forbids cannot be legally done.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Lands, such as the appellee purchased, have been held by this court to be, within the meaning of the statute above quoted, <em>\u201c </em>public lands.\u201d Cotulla <em>v. </em>Laxson, 60 Tex., 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The act directing actions of this character to be brought seems to recognize the application of arts. 118, 119, P. C., to purchases made under the acts of July 8, 1879, and April 6, 1881. General Laws, 1883, p. 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">It is urged in this case, as in others, that the state cannot maintain this action without returning or offering to return such sums of money as may have been paid by the defendant to the state on the purchase of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">. This view' we have held to be erroneous, in the case of The State w. D. H. Snyder, this day decided, and for the reasons given in that case we so hold in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">The court erred in sustaining the demurrers urged in the court below, and the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-12\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">[Opinion delivered December 15, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
