Sossaman <em>v. </em>Powell, 21 Tex., 664; O\u2019Docherty v. McGloin, 25 Tex., 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">At the death of James Cates, the title to the property vested in his wife and child, and was not subject to administration, and the administrator had neither the legal title to the property, nor the right to control it as assets of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Such interest as an administrator has in the property of the estate which he represents is only a qualified interest, commensurate with his duties properly to administer the assets liable to the payment of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Cases in which it has been held that the statute of limitations would run against a minor <em>cestui que </em>trust, in favor of a stranger, are cases in which the legal title to the property was vested in the trustee. Williams <em>v. </em>Otey, 8 Humph., 569; Smilie <em>v. </em>Biffle, 2 Barr, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Ho such case is presented by the record before us, and the case of Lacy <em>v. </em>Williams, 8 Tex., 188, seems conclusive of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">The appellant having acquired title to one-half of the land, through the conveyance made by Mrs. Emeline Cates, the court below correctly entered judgment in favor of the appellee for one-half of the land, with directions that she be placed in possession of the land to hold in common with the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">There was no prayer for partition. There is no error in the judgment of which the appellant can complain, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">[Opinion delivered October 13, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
