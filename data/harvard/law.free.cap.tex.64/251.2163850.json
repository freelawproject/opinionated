That at 3 o\u2019clock A. M. on the morning of that day, plaintiff, S. B. Hamilton, and his wife, Mollie Hamilton, went to the depot to accompany and assist two old and decrepit friends of plaintiff and his wife, to wit, Benjamin Tolson and wife, who had been visiting at their house and who were now about to take defendant\u2019s east-bound train at the depot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\">That while plaintiff\u2019s wife was passing along the platform, assisting Tolson and wife to go from defendant\u2019s waiting-room in the depot and to get aboard the defendant\u2019s east-bound train, the same being the customary way for passengers and their attendants to go for such purpose, of which defendant had notice, and that, being wholly unaware of danger, plaintiff\u2019s wife, without fault or negligence on her part, and by reason of defendant\u2019s wilful and careless disregard of its duty as a common carrier in failing to provide safe and necessary steps and railings about its platforms and approaches thereto, and to provide necessary lights burning about the platform, was then and there precipitated from the platform and thrown violently upon the ground, whereby she was greatly injured, being wounded and cut in so much that she was caused great pain and became sick, lame and sore, in which condition she has since continued by reason of the injuries, and is compelled in consequence of the same to go about on crutches; that she has been permanently injured, and is unable to attend to her household duties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">Plaintiff sued for $25,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\">The defendant answered by general demurrer and special excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>fcion, as follows: For special exception, that it appears from the petition and amendments thereto that plaintiffs were not at the defendant\u2019s depot and platform as passengers, intending to take the train, but were on the platform for the purpose of assisting adult persons in taking passage on the train, and no other business, as alleged in the petition and amendments, and defendant says that it owed plaintiff no special duty with regard to the platform at the time of the alleged injury sustained, and that defendant is not liable in law therefor, and of this prays judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">The court sustained this exception and (the plaintiff declining to amend) dismissed the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b277-5\"><em>Carter &amp; Wynne, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtN\">cited: Pierce on Railroads, pp. 274-5, note 4, p. 276; Wharton on Negligence, 642; Rorer on Railroads, pp. 475, 477, 1130; Lacy\u2019s Railway Digest, p. 736, secs. 10, 13, 17, 20; Gillis <em>v. </em>Penn.

Com. App.</author>\n<p id=\"Abn\">The court erred, we think, in sustaining defendant\u2019s special exception to the plaintiff\u2019s petition. The principle seems to be well settled that a railroad company <em>\u201c </em>is under a special duty to persons who come upon its premises for the purpose of doing business with it as a common carrier. In this case it gives an invitation as well as a license, and does so under the expectation of profit therefrom. It must provide and maintain for them safe approaches to the station and safe platforms.\u201d Pierce on Railroads, 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">The important question in this case is, whether the plaintiff shows, under the facts alleged in his petition, that he and his wife are persons who are to be regarded as being embraced within the above rule. The limitations of the rule as to those who are, and those who are not, comprehended within it, are fully stated in several well-considered cases of high authority, and, without attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>ing a discussion of the subject, we will content ourselves with following what seems to be the rule established by those decisions, - to the effect that the plaintiff is clearly within the protection of the rule. Among those to whom the company is under this obligation are \u201c persons who are on the premises to welcome the coming or speed the parting guest.\u201d See Pierce on Railroads, <em>supra. </em>The plaintiff and his wife occupied that relation, and more; they went to the defendant\u2019s depot as assistants as well as friends, in order to aid two old and decrepit persons whose business there\" was to take the defendant\u2019s train. If the infirmities of passengers to go on the train required the assistance of friends to see them safely on board, servants or friends attending them for that purpose would clearly be in attendance at the depot under an invitation of the company as direct as that given to the passengers themselves, or to hackmen who carry them to and from the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In the case of Tobin v. Portland, S. &amp; P. R. Co., 59 Me., 183, where a hackman who was accustomed to carry passengers to and from a railroad depot was injured by a defect in the platform, he was held entitled to recover upon the ground that he was there by the license and permission of the railroad company, and by the accommodation afforded by him to travelers actually contributed to help the company\u2019s business. 8th vol., Eng. &amp; Amer. R. R. Cases, p. 551. And it seems to have been taken for granted, in the case of Langan v. Iron M. <em>&amp; </em>S. R. R. Co., 72 Mo., 392; 3 Amer. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cases, 357, that where a person was at a station helping off a friend with his trunk, the company was bound to exercise as to him due care. As to parties speeding and welcoming friends at railroad stations, the following cases are compiled in vol. 18, p. 156, Amer. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. R. R. Cases, showing the liability of the company for injuries occasioned to such parties whilst at the station, viz.: Lucas v. New Bedford, etc., R. Co., 6 Gray, 64; Keokuk Packet Co. v. Henry, 50 Ill., 264; Doss v. Missouri, etc., R. R. Co., 59 Mo., 27; Langan v. St. Louis R. R. Co., 3 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. R. R. Cases, 355; McKone v. Michigan Central R. Co., 13 Am. &amp; Eng. R. R. Cases, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">We conclude, therefore, that the judgment ought to be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Bevebsed and eemanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">[Opinion adopted May 29, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
