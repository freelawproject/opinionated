Payment \u2014 Negotiable note. \u2014 A negotiable promissory note given by a debtor does not amount to payment of the debt for which it is given unless the circumstances show that such was the intention of the parties. Hence, a note given by agreement between merchant and merchant, not in payment of a debt, but to evidence a credit in their dealings with each other and as a convenient basis of future credit, will not, when it constitutes an item in a mutual current account between the parties concerning the trade of merchandise between merchant and merchant, be barred by the lapse of four years from its maturity in a suit upon an account (containing that item), for the balance due on the account. The account would not be subject to the statutory bar of four years until that time had elapsed after the cessation of the dealings in which, the parties were interested together. In a suit upon the note alone the four years\u2019 statute would apply from the date of its maturity.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b67-15\">Appeal from Parker.

In the notes to these citations the authorities are fully cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">If, however, this were not true, under the facts of this case, the application of the rules regulating the appropriation of payments would require that the credits to the appellee accruing after the maturity of the note should be applied as they accrued until the sum evidenced by the note was discharged, which would leave the balance due on the account, other than the second item, which covers the same indebtedness as the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">There can be no doubt, under the pleadings and evidence, that the appellants and appellee were merchants within the meaning of article 3205, R. S.; and that the account sued on was a 16 mutual current account concerning the trade of merchandise between merchant and merchant;\u201d hence, the account would not be subject to the statutory bar of four years until that time had elapsed after a cessation of the dealings in which the parties were interested together. R. S., 3205; Gregory <em>v. </em>Beauchamp, 5 Tex. Law Rev., 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Four years had not elapsed after the cessation of business between the parties before this action was brought, and the appellants are entitled to recover the balance actually due on the account sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Interest, however, should be computed with reference to the period at which the several items of indebtedness accrued, and with reference to the time when the various items of credits were received by the appellants, having in view the law regulating interest on open accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">The judgment will be reversed, but will not be here rendered, but will be remanded, that protection, if necessary, may be given to the appellee against the note alleged to have been executed, should it appear that it was transferred to any other person by the appellant under such circumstances as would enable the present holder to enforce the same against the appellee, and that the court below may cause judgment to be entered in accordance with this opinion. It is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">[Opinion delivered April 24, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
