Evidence \u2014 Removal of a depot \u2014 Damages.\u2014 In a suit against a railroad company, claiming damages for the depreciation in value of plaintiff\u2019s hotel property, caused by the removal of the depot, <em>held:</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b631-12\">(1) That the same evidence is admissible to show injury and its extent, whether it arises from a breach of contract or a tort.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b631-13\">(2) That any proof showing that by the act of another anything necessary to the advantageous use of property has been unlawfully withdrawn, tends to show depreciation in its value. When permanent injury to the use of real property is shown to have resulted from the unlawful act of another, it is proper for the owner to show the depreciation in the rental value, diminution of the business to which the property is adapted, or diminution in other like things resulting from the unlawful act, for these things give value to property. See cases cited in opinion.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b631-14\">(8) That the plaintiff was entitled only to recover the decrease in the value of his property resulting solely from the removal of the depot.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b631-15\">(4) That if the plaintiff built, relying on acts done, and on the faith of the acts and declarations of the railroad company and its agents, it was not important whether the plaintiff bought the lots on which he built at the time the defendant contracted to establish and maintain its depot at the place named, or subsequently. That the maps made and exhibited by the company were standing declarations of its intention to do what it had contracted to do.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b631-16\">Appeal from Navarro.

The passenger depot was erected on the west side of the road and the freight depot on the east side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-4\">At this time the appellee was engaged in the hotel business in Corsicana, and occupied a house on the public square about one-half mile from the point where the depot was established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-5\">After the road was in operation, and after appellant had established and erected its depot, appellee purchased from appellant certain lots near the depot on which he erected a hotel building, and subsequently removed there and has done business there ever since. The lots were sold by the local agent of the company, who told appellee, at the time, that the depot was permanent and would never be moved, and appellee claimed that it was on the faith of this representation that he purchased. Appellant had at that time placed on record a map of the six hundred and forty acre survey referred to in the contract made with the citizens of Corsicana, which map showed the erection of the depot at the point agreed on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-7\">The depots, both freight and passenger, remained where first built until some time during the year 1881, when the Texas <em>&amp; </em>St. Louis Railway Company constructed its road into Corsicana, intersecting appellant\u2019s road at a point two blocks south of its depot. Soon afterwards a house was erected by the two companies at this intersection for a union depot, and appellant\u2019s offices were removed there, and its passenger business has since that time been done there.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-8\">On November 28, 1882, appellee brought this suit, alleging the execution by defendant of the instruments hereinbefore set out, and the removal of the depot, and that thereby he had been damaged. $5,000, and obtained a verdict for that amount.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b633-9\"><em>Frost, Barry &amp; Lee, </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_O\">on the measure of damages, cited: De la Zerda <em>v. </em>Korn, 25 Tex.

G-. Yeal, agent of the company in locating depot, testified: Lots contiguous to the depot are more valuable than others as hotels, restaurants, saloons, etc., and a change of the depot necessarily depreciates the property in value. The lots purchased by plaintiff were the best hotel lots on the map (railroad map); the passenger .depot was established immediately in front of the hotel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u201c Molloy testifies that he bought the lots as hotel lots, and erected the building entirely for hotel purposes, and it could not be changed to any other business without great change in the building, involving great outlay, and if changed into stores there would be no demand for them, owing to the fact that there is no travel or business on said street; that his hotel is not accessible to nor can it be seen from the present depot. That before removal he received $125 per month and board for four, worth $100, saloon worth $70, and two extra rooms at $25 each; total, $345. That immediately after the removal, his rent fell to $100 per month and board for two at $50, saloon at $30, and rooms at $40; total, $230; while at the time of trial it had fallen to $75 per month, saloon $8, $20 for the two rooms; total, $103. That he was damaged by the removal thirty-three and one-third per cent, of the value of the property. That his property was worth $15,000, and since the removal is worth $10,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u201c A. Beaton and Jas. Kerr testified that they dealt in city property a great deal; did not own hotels or know much about keeping one, but from their judgment in real estate the property had depreciated thirty-three and one-third per cent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">\u201c R. 0. Beale testified that as long as the depot was unchanged the Molloy House was the best paying property in the city; that though other good hotels were in the city, the Molloy House, from its peculiar location immediately in front of the depot, had the \u2018bulge\u2019 on the trade, and got nearly all the transient trade, which is always cash. That he boarded there awhile and had a good idea of the business. That now all the transient trade was cut off and the hotel was out of the line of travel and trade, by reason of the removal three blocks off. That, the Molloy building is only fit for a hotel and built for that purpose. It would involve a large outlay - to make it into anything else, and then the rents would be too low to pay investment. That he was well acquainted with real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>values in Corsicana before and since removal. That the value of all property on Collin street has been affected by the removal of depot; that he would fix the depreciation of plaintiff\u2019s <em>property at fifty per cent\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The action of the court referred to in third assignment is thus fairly stated in brief of counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcpL\">\u201c Plaintiff was permitted to introduce testimony as to his loss of custom, the depreciation of his rents, etc., over the objections of defendant, to which exceptions were saved. After the evidence was closed, all this testimony being before the jury, plaintiff\u2019s counsel arose and stated to the court that they relied solely on the question of depreciation in the value of the property. and did not claim anything for loss of custom or for the subscription paid. Defendant objected to the withdrawal of the issues \u2014 loss of custom, etc.\u2014 because it gave the plaintiff the advantage of getting his testimony before the jury to influence them, and then, in order to cure the error in the supreme court, withdrawing the issue under which said testimony had been introduced, thus making a different record on appeal. The court overruled the objection, and allowed plaintiff to withdraw the issues, to which defendant excepted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201c Defendant then moved the court to strike out all the testimony on the questions of loss of custom, depreciation in rents, etc. The court refused the motion, and defendant again excepted. Defendant next asked the court to charge the jury that they should not consider any evidence in the case as to loss of custom, depreciation in rents or payment of his subscription to defendant by plaintiff, but only the single question of the depreciation in the value of the property <em>itself, </em>resulting from the removal of the depot. The court refused the charge, and defendant again excepted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">The court charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">\u201c The only issues of fact for you to determine are as to whether or not the property specified in plaintiff\u2019s petition has been depreciated in value by reason of the removal of the passenger depot as specified and alleged in said petition, and, if so, the amount of such depreciation; and in determining the question of depreciation you <em>will </em>consider from the evidence only such depreciation, if any, which was caused by the removal of said passenger depot, and from no other cause. In considering said question, you are instructed that you can take into consideration <em>the evidence </em>as to <em>loss </em>in rents or <em>loss </em>in custom, if any, after said removal, only for the purpose of estimating the value of the property before and after said removal, and for no other purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">\u201c If, therefore, you believe from the evidence that there was de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>preciafcion in the value of said property caused by said removal, you should find for plaintiff and against defendant for the amount of the same, and the measure of damages is the difference between the value of the property before and after the removal, and caused by the same, to be estimated by you from the evidence under the instructions herein given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">\u201c If, however, you believe from the evidence that said property has not decreased in value; or if it has, such decrease was not caused by the removal of said depot, but by some other cause, such as the general depreciation in values in Corsicana, or the erection of other and more commodious hotels, or any other cause other than the removal of said depot, you will find for defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">From the statement thus made it clearly appears that the court below was of the opinion, and ruled, that the evidence referred to in the first, second and third assignments of error was admissible to prove the depreciation in the value of the property, and we see no reason to doubt the correctness of this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">It matters not, in so far as the rules of evidence are concerned, whether the depreciation in the value of property results from the violation of a contract which is but the evidence of a right and its extent, or from the violation of a right existing without contract by an act which in law is termed a tort. The same evidence is admissible in the one case as in the other to show the injury and its extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">The value of property is largely affected by the use to which it is appropriate, and to which it is applied, and proof which shows that by the act of another anything necessary to its advantageous use has been unlawfully withdrawn, tends to show that its value is depreciated in the hands of its owner or of any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">When a permanent injury to the use of real property is shown to have resulted from the unlawful act of another, it is proper for the owner to show the depreciation in the rental value, diminution of the business to which the property is adapted, or diminution in other like things resulting from the unlawful act; for all these things but tend to show the depreciation in the value of the thing itself, which must depend on those things that alone give value to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The rule of evidence applicable to this class of cases is illustrated by many adjudicated cases.

St., 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">What has already been said is applicable to the fourth, fifth and sixth assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The seventh assignment is: \u201cThe court erred in refusing special charge Ho. 1, asked by the defendant, to the effect that, in estimating the damage, that produced by other causes than the removal, as by the erection of other hotels, building of the Harrow Guage depot, etc., should not be considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">We are of the opinion that the appellant had the full benefit of the charge referred to in this assignment by the charge given by the court and quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The charge given must have been understood to inform the jury that they could not find in favor of the plaintiff for any decrease in the value of his property not solely the result -of the removal of the depot. This was all the defendant was entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">The charge given may be construed to mean that, if the property had been diminished in value by the removal of the depot, yet, if it -had also been diminished in value by some other cause, then the plaintiff was not entitled to recover on account of the illegal act. If so construed, the defendant cannot complain of the charge. We think it unlikely, however, that the jury were in any way misled by the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">We do not understand that the plaintiff sets up or relies upon an estoppel <em>in pais; </em>but understand that he bases his right to recover on the violation of a contract supported by valuable consideration, to which he was in effect a party, which made it the duty of the defendant to construct and maintain its depot at a certain place.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-12\">But if his case depended on acts done, on the faith of the acts and declarations of the defendant and its agents, of whose authority to act no question can fairly arise, then we do not see that it was important whether the plaintiff bought the lots on which he built at the time the defendant contracted to establish and maintain its depot at the place named, or subsequently; for that contract, and the maps made and exhibited, were standing and continuing declarations of the intention of the defendant to do what it had contracted to do. Therefore the court did not err in refusing the fourth charge asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">We are of the opinion that the third paragraph of the charge given did not assume that any fact existed about which there could be any controversy under the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">If the court, however, had assumed that, by the terms of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>tract, defendant was bound to establish and maintain a passenger depot at the place named in the contract, and that the depot had been so established and subsequently removed, there would have been no error in this, for the uncontroverted evidence showed these facts to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The verdict of the jury does not appear to be in any respect contrary to the evidence, nor does it appear to be excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The judgment <em>of the </em>court <em>below </em>will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">[Opinion delivered November 17, 1885.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
