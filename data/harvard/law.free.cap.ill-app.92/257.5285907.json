Negligence\u2014 When Not Contributory, as a Conclusion of Law.\u2014 The face that a girl, twelve years of age, at the time of an injury by reason of a defective sidewalk, was walking backward, talking to other children in company with her, does not of itself establish negligence on her part as a conclusion of law.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-10\" pgmap=\"281\">2. Same\u2014A Question for the Determination of the Jury.\u2014The question as to whether a girl twelve years of age, on her way to school, in company with other children, who walked backward for a few steps while talking to her playmates, and was injured by falling into a hole in the sidewalk, was guilty of negligence, is one for the determination of the jury under all the circumstances of the case.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b281-11\" pgmap=\"281\">3.

An excavation was made in the ground where the boards were taken up, and the hole thus made was left uncovered and unguarded. Appellee, a child of about twelve years, while on her way to school, fell into this hole and was severely injured. At the time she fell she was talking with four other girls, her companions, and she was in front of the other four- and was walking backwards. The hole was eighteen inches in width and from twelve to eighteen inches deep. Appellee testified that she was not aware that there was this defect in the walk. Two of the girls who were with her testified, that they did not see the hole until appellee had fallen into it.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282\">There was evidence tending to show that the injury resulted in a permanent curvature of the spine, making appellee humpbacked, or as it is termed by one of the medical witnesses,\u2018\u2018 pigeon breasted.\u201d The deformity is known as Pott\u2019s disease and is permanent.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\" pgmap=\"282\">The jury found the issues for appellee and assessed her damages at $5,000.

The only basis of the contention that it does is the fact that appellee when injured was walking backward, talking to other children who accompanied her. The question then is, does the fact that appellee was walking backward when injured of itself establish negligence as a conclusion of law. We are of opinion that it does not, and that the question was a question of fact properly submitted to -the jury. In determining if a certain course of conduct constitutes negligence on the part of a child, the child\u2019s age, together with all surrounding circumstances, are to be considered by the jury. City v. Keefe, 114 Ill. 222; I. C. R. R. Co. v. Slater, 129 III. 99.</p> <p id=\"b283-4\" pgmap=\"283\">This child was at the time of the injury about twelve years of age. We are not prepared to hold that her conduct in walking backward for a few steps while talking to her playmates was so clearly negligent that all reasonable minds would agree in so pronouncing it. Instances are not wanting where it has been held that adults who had failed to keep their eyes upon the pathway they were following might yet be found to have been in the exercise of- ordinary care. City v. McLean, 133 Ill. 153; City v. Babcock, 143 Ill. 358; Pullman Co. v. Connell, 74 Ill. App. 447.</p> <p id=\"b283-5\" pgmap=\"283\">In City v. Babcock, supra, the court said :</p> <blockquote id=\"b283-6\" pgmap=\"283\">\u201c A pedestrian upon such sidewalk may ordinarily assume that the sidewalk is in a reasonably safe condition for travel. To hold that such person is absolutely bound to keep his or her eyes constantly fixed on the sidewalk in a search for possible holes or other defects, would be to establish a manifestly unreasonable and wholly impracticable rule.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b283-7\" pgmap=\"283\">We hold that it was for the jury to determine under the evidence in this case whether in view of her age and other surrounding circumstances, the conduct of appellee was negligent, and we can not say that the finding of the jury in this behalf is manifestly against the weight-of the evidence. Mo other question is raised by counsel for appellant.</p> <p id=\"b283-8\" pgmap=\"283\">The judgment is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
