Tate, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 53a-70 (a) (1), sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72 (a) (1) (A), kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2), assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61 (a) (1) and threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (l).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the trial court gave an improper instruction to the jury on the thoroughness of the police investigation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. Several years ago, the victim worked as a confidential informant for the New Britain police department. While in this capacity, the victim purchased drugs from the defendant at 60 Sexton Street in Hartford. The victim\u2019s assistance led to the eventual arrest and conviction of the defendant for drug possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">On May 1, 1998, at approximately, 9 p.m., a man, identified by the victim to be the defendant, forcibly entered the victim\u2019s apartment and stated to the victim, \u201cDo you remember me from Sexton Street?\u201d The defendant choked the victim, threatened to kill her if she screamed, forcibly fondled her breasts and vaginal area, and attempted to sodomize her. The victim escaped and fled to the apartment of a neighbor. A police investigation ensued, which led to the arrest of the defendant on June 3, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The trial began on May 11, 1999, and lasted three days. Before the jury began its deliberation, the court gave various instructions, one of which was the following: \u201cYou\u2019ve heard questioning regarding the thoroughness of the police investigation in this case. This question might be a matter of opinion, but the state has put its evidence before you, and the defense is entitled to make an investigation and put its evidence before you also. And, of course, not only the state but also the defense has put on evidence in behalf of the defendant. I tell you that the issue before you is not the thoroughness of the investigation of the responding police officer; the issue you have to determine is whether the state, in light of all the evidence before you, has proved the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as I have recited that to you. That is the sole issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">After the jury left the courtroom, the defendant objected to the jury instructions on the ground that the \u201ccharge on thoroughness in the investigation\u201d was the \u201clast thing that the jury hear[d] before they [went] into deliberation [and] might effect them in terms of objectively looking\u2014I mean, I think that they can surmise that.\u201d In response to the defendant\u2019s objection, the court offered to reinstruct the jury that \u201cthe general instructions given are given in no certain order, and there should be no more weight given to any one because of the order that they are presented.\u201d The defendant replied, \u201cThat would be great.\u201d The court then asked the defendant whether the additional instruction would satisfy his objection, to which the defendant answered, \u201cYes, Your Honor, certainly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The court reconvened the jury and gave the curative instruction that \u201cthe order in which the general instructions are given and the order in which I went through the crime, the specific crimes and the elements, have no bearing on the importance of those instructions or of the crimes or the elements thereof. Just because I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>did something first or second or eighth or tenth or last does not mean that it has any more, and should have no more, influence upon you.\u201d The defendant did not voice any further objections. The defendant was convicted on May 13, 1999. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The defendant contends that the jury instruction regarding the police investigation deprived him of a fair trial by undermining the presumption of innocence and diluting the state\u2019s burden of proof in violation of the state and federal constitutions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">The defendant first claims that his objection to the jury instruction was preserved at trial and also claims that to the extent that it was not so preserved, review is appropriate under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). An objection or claim of error must be distinctly and properly raised at trial or it will be precluded from appellate review unless it meets the requirements of <em>Golding. </em>Id., 239-40. \u201cIn order properly to preserve for appeal a claimed error in the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, a party must take an exception when the charge is given that distinctly states the objection and the grounds therefor.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 657, 443 A.2d 906 (1982). \u201cA defendant must avail himself of the opportunity to make an objection and if he \u2018does not avail himself of the opportunity, he must be holden to a waiver of the objection.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 66, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuller, </em>34 Conn. 280, 295 (1867).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Here, the defendant failed to make at trial the objections that are presently pending before this court. At trial, the defendant objected solely to the jury instructions on the ground that a prejudicial effect may result from the court\u2019s delivery of the instruction about the thoroughness of the police investigation toward the end of the charge. After the court gave a curative jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>instruction, stating that the order in which the instructions were given were irrelevant to their weight, the defendant did not further object. As the defendant failed to raise his current objections before the trial court and stated that his one objection had been satisfied, the defendant failed to preserve any objection for appeal. See <em>Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Larsen, </em>232 Conn. 480, 525-26, 656 A.2d 1009 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">As a general rule, this court refuses to hear unpre-served claims. Under <em>Golding, </em>however, \u201ca defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. The defendant cannot meet prong three of the <em>Golding </em>test and, thus, his claim must fail.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Under prong three of <em>Golding, </em>a challenged jury instruction constitutes a clear constitutional violation that clearly deprives a defendant of a fair trial if it is found reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instruction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>248 Conn. 132, 171, 728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120 S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999); <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>227 Conn. 32, 65, 630 A.2d 990 (1993). To determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the court\u2019s instruction, \u201c[t]he test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Prioleau, </em>235 Conn. 274, 284, 664 A.2d 743 (1995). The challenged instruction must be analyzed for its probable effect on the jury \u201cin the context of the entire charge and the entire trial, rather than as individual sentences or phrases viewed in isolation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 66. In evaluating a jury instruction under prong three of <em>Golding, </em>\u201c[w]e will not sever one part of the instruction and analyze it separately from the whole.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 409, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The defendant contends that the jury instruction concerning the police investigation diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof and thereby misled the jury into believing that the state\u2019s burden of proof was less than beyond a reasonable doubt. A thorough review of the transcripts and the juiy instruction in its entirety, however, reveals that there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled by the challenged jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Repeatedly, throughout the lengthy and detailed jury instructions, the court, in clear and legally correct terms, definitively instructed the jury that the burden rests solely on the state to prove the accused guilty of the charges, and that the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until the state proves the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Directly after the challenged instruction, the court stated, \u201cIf I had made reference to the position of the state or the accused more of one than the other, it\u2019s not my intention to convey to you directly or indirectly how the court feels or what should be the outcome of this case. You may be assured that I have no preference or inclination one way or the other.\u201d In fact, almost immediately following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>the challenged statement, the court again reminded the jury that \u201cit\u2019s the sworn duty of the courts and jurors to safeguard the rights of persons charged with crime by respecting the presumption of innocence, which the law imputes to every person so charged, and by making the state meet its burden of proving the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Furthermore, with regard to deference to the police, prior to the challenged instruction, the court declared to the jury that \u201cthe testimony of a police officer is entitled to no special or exclusive sanctity merely because it comes from a police officer. . . . In the case of police officers, you should not believe them merely because they are police officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">After considering the challenged instruction in the context of the jury charge as a whole, we hold that there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled into believing that the state\u2019s burden of proof was anything less than beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 66. When reading the challenged instruction in light of the court\u2019s repeated and accurate explanations of the state\u2019s burden of proof and the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence, it is clear that the court adequately apprised the jury of the state\u2019s burden of proof and the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 409 (holding in part that jury not misled by challenged portion of instructions when other sections accurately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>explained state\u2019s burden of proof). The court\u2019s numerous and accurate instructions about the state\u2019s burden of proof certainly \u201celiminated any reasonable likelihood of juror misunderstanding as to the state\u2019s burden and the proof necessary for a conviction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Schiappa, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Because a reading of the jury instructions in their entirety reveals that there is no reasonable possibility that the jury was misled, the defendant has failed to establish that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial pursuant to prong three of <em>Golding. </em>Therefore, the defendant cannot meet all four conditions set forth in <em>Golding </em>and cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The defendant also asks that this court exercise its supervisory authority to discontinue the use of the challenged jury instruction. \u201cOur supervisory powers are not a last bastion of hope for every untenable appeal. They are an <em>extraordinary </em>remedy to be invoked only when circumstances are such that the issue at hand, while not rising to the level of a constitutional violation, is nonetheless of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>56 Conn. App. 794, 804 n.7, 746 A.2d 210, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 904, 753 A.2d 938 (2000), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>243 Conn. 796, 815, 709 A.2d 522 (1998). As the situation here fails to rise to the extraordinary status previously described, we do not consider this to be an appropriate case in which to exercise our supervisory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Furthermore, not only do the circumstances in the present situation fall short of warranting such an extraordinary remedy, but our Supreme Court in <em>Slate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 335-36, 363 A.2d 72 (1975), upheld similar language in a challenged jury instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although <em>Williams </em>was decided before <em>Golding, </em>in evaluating the challenged jury instruction, the court in <em>Williams </em>utilized a line of inquiry that substantially parallels an analysis under prong three of <em>Golding. </em>In <em>Williams, </em>the court evaluated the challenged jury instruction by reading the charge as a whole to determine whether the instruction in its entirety gave the jury a \u201cclear understanding of the issues involved and a proper guidance in determining those issues.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Supreme Court found that such language is not of the kind that would render a jury unable to decide questions of fact and that the jury instruction was not \u201cimproper under the circumstances.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In the alternative, the defendant requests that a new trial be ordered under the plain error doctrine should this court decline to find that a clear constitutional violation exists. Where a claim is asserted but \u201cthereafter receives only cursory attention in the brief without substantive discussion or citation of authorities, it is deemed to be abandoned.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sewell, 38 </em>Conn. App. 20, 29, 658 A.2d 598, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 918, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>661 A.2d 98 (1995). Beyond requesting that a new trial be ordered, the defendant neglects to discuss his claim under the plain error doctrine. Accordingly, we deny the defendant\u2019s request for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-40 (b) and (g), the defendant also was convicted of being a persistent serious felony offender.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\"> The defendant in his brief focuses primarily on prong three of <em>Golding-, </em>thus, we, too, will analyze the defendant\u2019s claim under prong three.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-7\"> To support Ms proposition that the state\u2019s burden of proof was diluted, the defendant cites <em>State </em>v. <em>Pharr, </em>44 Conn. App. 561, 691 A.2d 1081 (1997). <em>Pharr </em>does not pertain to the present situation. In <em>Pharr, </em>the trial court unambiguously endorsed the police testimony by stating, \u201c \u2018Now tMs officer comes here and testifies in good faith what happened, I\u2019ll take it anytime over what a report says. I don\u2019t even know what report you have or who the author is.\u2019 \u201d Id., 566. Here, we have no inflammatory statement of any kind. Therefore, <em>Pharr </em>is distingmshable from the present situation. Additionally, unlike the situation in <em>Pharr, </em>the court here, on the defendant\u2019s objection, offered to give a curative jury instruction that addressed the objection and satisfied the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"> The defendant in <em>Williams </em>objected to the following jury instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201c \u2018Now, you have heard in the course of arguments discussion as to whether the police conducted a thorough search. You have also heard some discussion about the competency of the police in this arrest. Now, ladies and gentlemen, this question might be a matter of opinion, but the State has put its evidence before you, and the defense was entitled to make an investigation and put its evidence before you also, and, of course, not only the State but also the defense has put on evidence on behalf of the defendant. I say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that the issue before you is not the thoroughness of the investigation or the competence of the police. The issue you have to determine is whether the State in the light of all of the evidence before you has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty on one or both counts with which he is charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 169 Conn. 335-36 n.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> The court in <em>Williams </em>was confronted with the similar issue of whether the challenged jury instruction endorsed the police investigation and weighed in favor of the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
