The sole issue on appeal is whether the plaintiff was a resident in the home of the defendant\u2019s insured at the time of her motor vehicle accident. Two of the three arbitrators concluded that the plaintiffs mere physical presence in her father\u2019s home did not establish residency and, therefore, she was not covered under the underinsured motorist provisions of her father\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Our examination of the record and briefs persuades us that the judgment of the trial court confirming the arbitration award should be affirmed. The issue presented was resolved properly by the court\u2019s thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision. See <em>Lucas v. General Accident Ins. Co. of America, </em>46 Conn. Sup. 502, 759 A.2d 156 (1998). Because that memorandum of decision fully addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt it as a proper statement of the facts and the applicable law on those issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>East </em>v. <em>Labbe, </em>54 Conn. App. 479, 480, 735 A.2d 370 (1999), aff'd, 252 Conn. 359, 746 A.2d 751 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
