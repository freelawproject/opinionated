(firm), a de facto party in this case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) reducing the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded to the firm from $30,000 to $20,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The firm claims that the board improperly substituted its judgment for that of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) in setting the attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On September 27,1993, the plaintiff, James Day, retained the firm to represent him in the prosecution of a workers\u2019 compensation action. The plaintiff agreed to pay the firm attorney\u2019s fees of 20 percent of his gross recovery, subject to the commissioner\u2019s approval.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The firm represented the plaintiff for almost two years. During that time, the firm obtained documents from the plaintiff\u2019s physician, attended numerous informal conferences and four formal eviden-tiary hearings, and participated in the deposition of four medical witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">On March 7, 1995, following the conclusion of the evidence in the formal proceedings, the plaintiff discharged the firm as counsel and retained attorney Kenneth Bartlett in its place. On September 21, 1995, the plaintiff agreed to a lump sum settlement in the amount of $100,000. Formal hearings were subsequently held to determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees owed to the firm and to Bartlett.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On February 2, 1996, the commissioner awarded the firm $30,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the board from the commissioner\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. The board reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision and reduced the award of attorney\u2019s fees from $30,000 to $20,000. The board held that (1) the $30,000 award was contrary to the workers\u2019 compensation fee guidelines (fee guidelines) promulgated by the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>(11) (C), and (2) the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fee agreement entitled the firm to only $20,000. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The firm first claims that the board improperly reduced its award of attorney\u2019s fees from $30,000 to $20,000 because such a determination is within the sole discretion of the commissioner pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-327 (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">\u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. ... It is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>239 Conn. 19, 24-25, 682 A.2d 99 (1996); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). Where ... [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., </em>252 Conn. 596, 603-604, 748 A.2d 278 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">The firm argues that the commissioner\u2019s authority with respect to attorney\u2019s fees derives from \u00a7 31-327 (b), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ll fees of attorneys . . . shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree with the board\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>that \u00a7 31-327 (b) only \u201cgives the [commissioner] the power to examine all attorney\u2019s fee agreements to ensure that they are consistent with the fee guidelines . . . General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (11) (A) empowers the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission to \u201c[establish standards in consultation with the advisory board for approving all fees for services rendered ... by attorneys . . . .\u201d Subsection (11) (C) directs the chairman to \u201c[i]ssue, not later than October 1, 1993, and publish annually thereafter, guidelines for the maximum fees payable by a claimant for any legal services rendered by an attorney . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-280 (b) (11) (C). In compliance with that statutory provision, the chairman issued the following relevant guideline: \u201c4. Settlement or stipulation. An attorney may charge no more than 20% of the total of the settlement or stipulation, less medical bills that are paid by the claimant.\u201d Accordingly, because the plaintiff settled this case for $100,000, the only discretion the commissioner had was to award attorney\u2019s fees in an amount not in excess of $20,000, or 20 percent of the plaintiffs gross recovery award.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The firm next argues that in reducing the attorney\u2019s fees award the board improperly substituted its factual findings for that of the commissioner. Specifically, it argues that the board was limited to hearing the \u201cappeal on the record\u201d and could not retry the facts. This claim is without merit. While the board generally is bound by the factual findings of the commissioner, the commissioner\u2019s conclusions will not stand if predicated on a misapplication of the law. <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 449, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989). Here, the board reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision because the commissioner failed to follow the fee guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>lines, not because it made findings of fact that were different from the commissioner\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The firm next contends that the commissioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees award did in fact follow the fee guidelines. The firm claims that it is the board that did not follow the guidelines because the board failed to consider the plaintiffs $33,340 in outstanding medical bills when it determined the amount of attorney\u2019s fees. To support its claim, the firm points out that \u00a7 4 of the fee guidelines mandates that only medical bills \u201cpaid by the claimant\u201d be deducted before determining the percentage due as attorney\u2019s fees. The commissioner \u201cnoted that the respondent-employer paid the outstanding medical bills and not the claimant in accordance with the terms of the stipulation.\u201d Thus, the firm argues that the commissioner correctly reasoned that because the employer, not the plaintiff, paid the outstanding medical bills in accordance with the terms of the stipulation, the deduction mandated by \u00a7 4 of the fee guidelines did not apply. The board disagreed, however, ruling that the commissioner improperly included the \u201cvalue of the medical bills paid <em>on the claimant\u2019s behalf,\u201d </em>in arriving at an award of $30,000. (Emphasis added.) We agree with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">We interpret the regulations of an administrative body pursuant to the principles of statutory construction. <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>218 Conn. 821, 829 n.9, 591 A.2d 421 (1991). We see no reason not to apply those principles here where the chairperson of the workers\u2019 compensation commission, pursuant to statutory authority, is authorized to promulgate regulations<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and guidelines.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cWhen interpreting a regulation, we must use common sense. <em>Citerella </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number><em>United Illuminating Co., </em>158 Conn. 600, 609, 266 A.2d 382 (1969). \u2018Courts must assume that a reasonable and rational result was intended and construe the regulation accordingly.\u2019 Id. When confronted with two possible interpretations, courts will adopt the interpretation that makes the regulations effective and workable, and not the one that leads to unreasonable results. <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>212 Conn. 727, 737-38, 563 A.2d 1347 (1989). \u2018The unreasonableness of the result obtained by the acceptance of one possible alternative interpretation of [a regulation] is a reason for rejecting that interpretation in favor of another which would provide a result that is reasonable.\u2019 <em>Maciejewski </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>194 Conn. 139, 151-52, 480 A.2d 519 (1984).\u201d <em>Fullerton </em>v. <em>Dept. of Revenue Services, </em>245 Conn. 601, 612, 714 A.2d 1203 (1998). We, therefore, presume that a reasonable and rational result was intended by the chairman in adopting the fee guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">If we were to adopt the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4 of the fee guidelines, it could lead to irrational and unreasonable results. For example, suppose that a claimant with $50,000 in medical bills settles his case for $150,000. If the employer pays the medical bills and pays the claimant $100,000, under a 20 percent contingent fee agreement, the claimant would owe attorney\u2019s fees on a percentage of $150,000 because he could not deduct the medical bills before computing the fee. If the claimant settles the same case for $150,000, but elects to pay the $50,000 in medical bills himself, the claimant would owe attorney\u2019s fees on a percentage of only $100,000 because the claimant could deduct the medical bills that he had paid before determining the amount of attorney\u2019s fees. If we assume that the commissioner approves the 20 percent contingent fee, in the first case the fee would be $30,000 and, in the second case, it would be $20,000. It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>reasonable or sensible for the legal fees on an identical settlement to vary depending on whether the claimant or the employer pays the medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">The board\u2019s interpretation requiring that the value of the medical bills paid on behalf of the claimant be deducted before determining the percentage of legal fees owed is sensible and reasonable. In the previous example, the fee would be the same in each case. Each claimant would pay 20 percent of $100,000 without regard to who actually issued the check that paid the claimant\u2019s medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In the alternative, the firm claims that \u00a7 5 of the fee guidelines allowed the commissioner to consider the amount of time that the firm spent on the plaintiffs case, and, as a result, the commissioner was within the fee guidelines in awarding attorney\u2019s fees of $30,000. Section five<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> does not apply here because this case involves a settlement agreement. Section five would apply to an award that was rendered after a contested or formal hearing. Pursuant to \u00a7 4 of the fee guidelines, the firm is entitled to a maximum fee of 20 percent of the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-9\"> We originally dismissed this appeal, holding that the firm was not a party to the workers\u2019 compensation proceedings and, therefore, was limited to filing a writ of error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Salmon, </em>250 Conn. 147, 735 A.2d <em>333 </em>(1999). Our Supreme Court, however, reversed our judgment and concluded that because the underlying compensation claim had been settled, leaving only the matter of attorney\u2019s fees unresolved, the firm was a de facto party that was entitled to appeal. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Middletown, </em>245 Conn. 437, 441-42, 716 A.2d 47 (1998). The Supreme Court then remanded the case to this court for a hearing on the merits.
