We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim was born on March 4,1987. The defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>dant was the boyfriend of the victim\u2019s mother. In 1989, the defendant lived with the mother and continued to live with the family for six years. The mother had one child with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">When the victim was five years old, the defendant began sexually abusing her. Between 1993 and 1995, the defendant on several occasions had the victim perform oral sex on him. On one occasion in 1994, the defendant attempted to have sexual intercourse with the victim, but was unsuccessful. During these incidents, the mother was not home.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The victim initially did not report these activities to anyone.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In August, 1996, however, the victim told her mother about the defendant\u2019s conduct. At this time, the defendant was not residing with the mother and the victim. The mother then contacted the police. Lieutenant Kathleen Wilson of the Waterbury police department interviewed the victim, who disclosed the details of the defendant\u2019s conduct, including that the defendant had a mole on his penis. Photographs submitted at trial confirmed this distinguishing mark as did the testimony of the victim, the victim\u2019s mother and the defendant. Moreover, the mother, <em>as well as the defendant, </em>testified that there was no innocent way that the victim could inadvertently have observed the defendant. In October, 1996, the police arrested and charged the defendant with risk of injury to a child, sexual assault in the first degree and attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">On or about June, 1997, the victim\u2019s family moved to New Hampshire. At this time, the victim recanted her allegations to her mother. The mother took the victim to see Sidney Horowitz, a psychologist. During her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>meeting with Horowitz, the victim again recanted her allegations against the defendant. At trial, the victim testified that she had recanted because she had felt bad for her half-brother, who was the defendant\u2019s son.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">In 1997, the victim told a friend, Y, about the defendant\u2019s conduct. The victim then informed her mother that her original allegations against the defendant were true. Y testified as a constancy of accusation witness regarding the victim\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">On July 7 and 8, 1998, the court granted motions by the defendant for judgment of acquittal of one count of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree and one count of risk of injury to a child. On July 10, 1998, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the remaining five counts. On September 11,1998, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment, suspended after fifteen years, and twenty-five years probation. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as they become relevant in the context of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">The defendant claims first that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence Y\u2019s testimony under the constancy of accusation doctrine because the victim\u2019s statements to her were made \u201clong\u201d after the defendant was arrested and charged. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">\u201c[A] trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>241 Conn. 784, 789, 699 A.2d 91 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">The constancy of accusation doctrine was an extension of the fresh complaint rule. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>supra, 237 Conn. 297. The fresh complaint rule, adopted in <em>State </em>v. <em>De Wolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 100 (1830), stated that \u201con an indictment for rape . . . such evidence is received to [show] constancy in the declarations of the witness. If a female testifies, that such an outrage has been committed on her person, an [inquiry] is, at once, suggested, why it was not communicated to her female friends.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153 (1876), expanded the rule to allow the state to introduce testimony concerning the details of the complaint. \u201cWhy has the rule been adopted that in prosecutions for rape . . . the public prosecutor may show that the woman on whom the assault was made complained of it to her friends? It is simply because such a course would be natural if the crime had been committed, but very unnatural if it had not been.\u201d Id., 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Before modifying the constancy of accusation doctrine in <em>Troupe, </em>the court allowed \u201cthe state to introduce the fact . . . and . . . details of the complaint once the victim [had] testified regarding the alleged sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom a complaint had been made.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 297. In <em>Troupe, </em>our Supreme Court concluded that \u201ca person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator .... Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes.\u201d Id., 304. Furthermore, \u201c[b]efore the evidence may be admitted . . . the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the identity of the person ... to whom the incident was reported.\u201d Id., 304-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">In the present case, Y\u2019s testimony concerning the victim\u2019s statements to her is not inadmissible on the ground that the statements were made a long time after the victim first complained about the assault. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[a] delayed report . . . was not subject to exclusion on the ground that it had not been made at a \u2018natural\u2019 time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>219 Conn. 283, 291, 592 A.2d 943 (1991). Moreover, \u201c[wjhatever delay took place between the time of the attack and the time the victim first told witnesses of it does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, but merely presents a question of fact for the trier as to the weight to be given it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 529, 442 A.2d 927 (1982). The delay, therefore, in the victim\u2019s statements to Y does not make Y\u2019s testimony inadmissible, but rather, is a factor to be considered by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The defendant also claims that the constancy of accusation doctrine is inapplicable to a victim\u2019s statements to a witness made after a victim\u2019s recantation because the statements are not made in the \u201cnatural\u201d course. Our Supreme Court has stated that prior court decisions \u201cdid not condition the admission of constancy evidence upon a court\u2019s finding that the victim\u2019s statements had been made at a \u2018natural\u2019 time.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Parris, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 289. Furthermore, \u201cthe term \u2018natural\u2019 as employed in our prior caselaw was not connected to any preliminary issue of admissibility for the trial court\u2019s resolution.\u201d Id., 290. Rather, \u201c[t]hat term merely represents the phenomenon of human behavioral expectations that lends corroborative force, on one hand, to a sexual assault victim\u2019s report, of the fact of the incident and its details to another, and lends impeaching force, on the other hand, to the victim\u2019s failure to make such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>a report or include particular details in the report made.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Accordingly, we follow the Supreme Court\u2019s assertions in <em>Parris </em>that the admission of constancy of accusation evidence is not conditioned on the victim\u2019s statements to the witness being made at a \u201cnatural\u201d time. The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The defendant next argues that the victim\u2019s recantation caused a break in the chain of constant accusation, thereby rendering her subsequent corroborative statements inadmissible as a matter of law. Because the defendant did not properly preserve this claim at trial, we decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">After other constancy witnesses had testified and recantation evidence had been admitted, the defendant objected to the admission of Y\u2019s constancy testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant objected on the ground that Y\u2019s testimony was unreliable, irrelevant and should not exceed the scope of <em>Troupe. </em>The defendant further objected that Y\u2019s testimony was immaterial, unnecessary to remove juror bias and impermissible because Y was a child. On appeal, the defendant now raises for the first time the claim that the victim\u2019s recantation \u201cbroke\u201d the chain of constant accusation, rendering Y\u2019s testimony inadmissible as constancy evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201cOur review of evidentiary rulings made by the trial court is limited to the specific legal ground raised in the objection. . . . To permit a party to raise a different ground on appeal than was raised during trial would amount to \u2018trial by ambuscade,\u2019 unfair both to the trial court and to the opposing party.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Remington Investments, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Properties, Inc., </em>49 Conn. App. 789, 801-802, 716 A.2d 141 (1998). \u201cWe have consistently refused to consider evidentiary rulings not properly preserved. Where the issue raised for the first time on appeal is a matter of state evidentiary law, rather than of constitutional significance, this court will deny the defendant appellate review.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>46 Conn. App. 600, 609, 700 A.2d 91, cert. denied, 243 Conn. 935, 702 A.2d 642 (1997). Because the defendant\u2019s evidentiary claim was raised for the first time on appeal, we decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly admitted certain constancy of accusation evidence by Y that exceeded the scope of testimony permitted under <em>Troupe. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The following additional facts are necessary to the determination of this issue. Prior to Y\u2019s testimony, the court properly charged the jury concerning the constancy of accusation doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The state then called Y, a twelve year old girl, to testify as a constancy of accusation witness. During direct examination, Y testified as to how she knew the victim and how the victim had told her that the victim had been sexually assaulted. More specifically, Y testified that \u201c[s]he told me she had been molested\u201d by \u201cher stepfather\u201d and \u201c[s]he said that she had to touch him, and ... he touched her.\u201d Y also stated that the victim was nervous and crying when she told Y about the assault. The state proceeded to ask if Y said anything to the victim about \u201ctelling the truth to grownups,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Y initially answered, \u201cYeah,\u201d but then stated that she did not understand the question. The state further asked if Y had told the victim what \u201cshe should do about telling the police,\u201d but Y could not remember.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The defendant first claims that Y\u2019s testimony about the victim\u2019s demeanor when she recounted the assault to Y should not have been admitted because of its prejudicial quality. The defendant failed to object properly to this testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u201cThis court is not bound to consider claims of law not made at the trial. . . . [T]o preserve an evidentiary ruling for review, trial counsel must object properly.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>249 Conn. 423, 427, 735 A.2d 778 (1999). \u201cOur rules of practice make it clear that when an objection to evidence is made, a succinct statement of the grounds forming the basis for the objection must be made in such form as counsel desires it to be preserved and included in the record. ... In objecting to evidence, counsel must properly articulate the basis of the objection so as to apprise the trial court of the precise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>nature of the objection and its real purpose, in order to form an adequate basis for a reviewable ruling.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 427-28. \u201cWe consistently have stated that we will not consider evidentiary rulings where counsel did not properly preserve a claim of error by objection.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Remington Investments, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Properties, Inc., </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 800. Because the defendant failed to preserve his claim properly by articulating the basis for his objection to this evidentiary ruling, we decline to review this claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly admitted Y\u2019s testimony concerning \u201ctelling the truth\u201d to adults is also unavailing. The transcript clearly reveals that although Y initially answered affirmatively to the state\u2019s question whether Y had told the victim about \u201ctelling the truth\u201d to adults, when the next question was asked, Y answered that she was confused about the state\u2019s prior question. Accordingly, Y\u2019s testimony did not reveal anything about encouraging the victim to tell the truth to adults. The admission of this evidence, therefore, does not violate the rule set forth in <em>Troupe. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that by admitting Y\u2019s constancy of accusation testimony, the trial court violated the defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the federal constitution and under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Although the defendant failed to raise this claim at trial, he now seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Under <em>Golding, </em>a defendant \u201ccan prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 239-40. Further, \u201c[i]n the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d Id., 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Under the first prong of <em>Golding, </em>the record before us is adequate for review. The defendant, however, has failed to meet the second prong of <em>Golding </em>because his claim is not one of constitutional magnitude. In Connecticut, it is well established that the constancy of accusation doctrine does not violate a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 293; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lindstrom, </em>46 Conn. App. 810, 816, 702 A.2d 410 (\u201c[o]ur Supreme Court has held that the constancy of accusation doctrine does not violate the right to confrontation\u201d), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 947, 704 A.2d 802 (1997). Our Supreme Court in <em>Troupe </em>explained that a \u201cfundamental tenet of confrontation clause jurisprudence . . . [is] that the clause is not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">In the present case, the defendant \u201chas put a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional evidentiary ruling.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 46, 540 A.2d 42 (1988). Accordingly, because the defendant\u2019s claim is not one of constitutional magnitude, we decline to afford review under <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\"><em>A </em>plain error review of the record is equally unavailing. The record reveals that the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine Y regarding her testimony, but declined. Moreover, the court properly charged the jury on the use and purpose of constancy of accusation evidence, and three times stressed that Y\u2019s testimony was only to be used for corroborative purposes. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the admission of Y\u2019s constancy testimony did not affect the fairness, integrity or public confidence in judicial proceedings. The admission of Y\u2019s testimony, therefore, does not constitute plain error. We therefore reject the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person . . .

I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s material. . . . What I\u2019m saying is, it is immaterial because it is not proving anything. The only thing that a constancy witness should be allowed to prove under the constancy case is to remove this bias jurors have regarding the lack of a fresh report.
