Dwyer, Sr., appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>53a-134 (a) (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He claims that (1) the state\u2019s attorney engaged in prosecutorial misconduct that deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial and (2) the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding intent. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The following facts are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. On March 21, 1995, the defendant entered a Glastonbury convenience store, wearing a disguise and displaying a firearm. He announced to the employee on duty that he was conducting a \u201cstickup\u201d and requested all the money from the cash register.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The employee refused to cooperate and instead telephoned the Glastonbury police department. The defendant then drove away at a normal rate of speed in a vehicle that had a bag partially obscuring the rear license plate. The defendant was apprehended a short while later by Glastonbury police officers and charged with attempt to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">At the time of the incident, the defendant was a Hartford police officer who was not assigned to active duty because he was receiving his full salary as a result of a workers\u2019 compensation claim. While he was a member of the police department, he received special training in crime prevention and advised merchants about security measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">For several years prior to the robbery incident, the defendant had been treated for depression and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>stance abuse problems. During the months immediately preceding the robbery attempt, the defendant went through a divorce and was experiencing financial problems. On the night of the incident, the defendant consumed several alcoholic beverages and had taken three prescription medications: Fiorinal with codeine, Xanax and Wellbutrin.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">At trial, the defendant asserted that he was not responsible for the attempted robbery because his intoxication, which resulted from the combination of alcohol and medication, prevented him from forming the specific intent required to commit that crime. On the basis of its verdict, the jury did not find that the defendant was unable to form the requisite intent. Additional facts will be discussed where relevant to the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The defendant first claims that the state\u2019s attorney committed prosecutorial misconduct during her cross-examination of his expert witness and during the state\u2019s closing argument, thereby effectively depriving him of his right to a fair trial under article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 9,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the constitution of Connecticut, and the fifth<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and fourteenth<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> amendments to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. At trial, the defendant presented the testimony of an expert witness, Austin McCawley, his treating psychiatrist, to establish that at the time of the robbery attempt, the defendant was unable to form the requisite intent because he was under stress, had taken prescribed medications and had consumed alcoholic beverages. McCawley testified that he believed that the defendant did not have control over his conduct at the time of the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">During cross-examination, the state\u2019s attorney inquired as to whether McCawley was aware of a report prepared during the defendant\u2019s treatment at the Institute of Living in Hartford (institute) and that the defendant had stated to the institute staff that he had had a blackout, which he saw as protection from criminal liability. McCawley responded that he was not aware that the defendant had made that statement. The state\u2019s attorney also asked whether McCawley was aware that the defendant had described himself to the institute staff as someone who was able to deceive people. McCawley responded that \u201c[h]e may have done that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The defendant did not object to either of those questions and answers, and he focused on the report during his redirect examination of McCawley. During closing argument, the state\u2019s attorney referred to McCawley\u2019s testimony, stating that McCawley had not known that the defendant had told staff at the institute that because of his claimed blackout, he had \u201cthis liability thing covered\u201d and that he was \u201cable to deceive anyone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Because the defendant did not raise the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct at trial, he can obtain review on appeal only under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or the plain error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cWhen the verdict in a criminal case is challenged on the basis of allegedly prejudicial remarks made by the prosecutor, the defendant bears the burden of proving such prejudice within the context of the trial as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Shanks, </em>34 Conn. App. 103, 109, 640 A.2d 155, cert. denied, 229 Conn. 921, 642 A.2d 1216 (1994). \u201cIt is well established that [w]e will not afford <em>Golding </em>review to [unpreserved] claims of prosecutorial misconduct where the record does not disclose a pattern of misconduct pervasive throughout the trial or conduct that was so blatantly egregious that it infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>58 Conn. App. 65, 69, 751 A.2d 843 (2000); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>235 Conn. 748, 769, 670 A.2d 276 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>231 Conn. 235, 246, 645 A.2d 999 (1994). After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s questions to McCawley and her comments during closing argument did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to deny the defendant his rights to a fair trial. Accordingly, his claim fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>58 Conn. App. 603, 620-21, 755 A.2d 279 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Because this claim, however, involves an evidentiary matter; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>27 Conn. App. 520, 529, 608 A.2d 696 (1992); we note that \u201cthe admissibility of evidence is a matter of state law and unless there is a resultant denial of fundamental fairness or the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>of a specific constitutional right, no constitutional issue is involved.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>225 Conn. 650, 657, 626 A.2d 287 (1993). \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence .... The determination of the relevancy and remoteness of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>56 Conn. App. 182, 188, 742 A.2d 387 (1999), cert. denied, 252 Conn. 927, 746 A.2d 791 (2000). The court also has \u201cbroad discretion in determining the scope of cross-examination\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 431, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993); and questions \u201cdesigned to rebut, impeach, modify, or explain direct testimony [are] within the scope of the direct examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.). Id., 432. A prosecutor, however, may not appeal to the emotions, passions or prejudices of jurors, and should not inject extraneous matters into a case that divert the jury from its duty to decide the case solely on the evidence presented. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>41 Conn. App. 180, 187, 674 A.2d 1372, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 925, 677 A.2d 950 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The defendant requests us to conclude that the questions posed to McCawley by the state\u2019s attorney and her reference in closing argument to his answers constituted a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct warranting reversal of the judgment of conviction. The questions by the state\u2019s attorney, however, were proper to verify the basis for McCawley\u2019s opinion and to test his knowledge regarding the defendant. They were not designed to distract the jury or to appeal to its emotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">During the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s cross-examination of McCawley, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: \u201c[A]re you aware, sir, that when the defendant spoke with the medical personnel in the [institute] ... he told them that he saw his blackout as some protection from liability?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u201c[Witness]: I don\u2019t recall him saying that.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Okay. You\u2019re not aware of that?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u201c[Witness]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u201c[Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: And are you aware of the fact that when he spoke with them . . . that he described himself as someone who was able to deceive anybody?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">\u201c[Witness]: He may have done that, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">The defendant did not object to this line of questioning. In fact, the defendant asked about the report during his direct examination of McCawley and farther inquired about it on redirect. \u201c[A] party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the same subject. . . . The party who initiates discussion on the issue is said to have opened the door to rebuttal by the opposing party.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>56 Conn. App. 592, 621, 744 A.2d 931, cert. denied, 252 Conn. 949, 748 A.2d 298 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-12\">The questions posed by the state\u2019s attorney during cross-examination of McCawley were proper because they were responsive to McCawley\u2019s direct testimony. The defendant introduced the issue of his mental state, and he presented expert testimony from McCawley that he was unable to form the requisite intent to commit the crime charged. To respond to that testimony, the state properly was allowed to question the basis for McCawley\u2019s conclusion and to test his knowledge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Accordingly, we are persuaded that the state\u2019s attorney did not commit misconduct and that the court did not clearly abuse its discretion in permitting McCawley\u2019s testimony. Additionally, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s remarks during closing argument regarding that evidence were reasonable in light of the evidence and, therefore, were not improper.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Prior to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, the court asked both counsel whether they had anything they wanted to bring to the court\u2019s attention. The defendant\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cNo.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant made a tactical choice to decline to request curative instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">On the basis of our review of the questions by the state\u2019s attorney during cross-examination of McCawley and her comments during closing argument, we conclude that the defendant can not establish that there was a violation of his constitutional rights to a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. Henry, supra, 27 Conn. App. 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The defendant also cannot prevail under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201c[R]eview under the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations where the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Niemeyer, </em>55 Conn. App. 447, 457-58, 740 A.2d 416, cert. granted on other grounds, 252 Conn. 916, 917, 744 A.2d 437, 747 A.2d 517 (1999). Additionally, the claimed error must be both clear and harmful enough such that a failure to remedy the error would result in manifest injustice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 469, 522 A.2d 249 (1987). The defendant\u2019s claim does not meet that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury regarding intent. The defendant claims that the instruction was inadequate because the court explained that the jury must find that he was so intoxicated that he could not form either the specific intent or general intent associated with the crime before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>it could consider the negating effect of intoxication. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">The defendant did not raise this claim to the trial court and therefore, as in part I of this opinion, he may seek review only under the Golding<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or plain error doctrines.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because the record is adequate for review and the alleged violation is of constitutional magnitude involving the defendant\u2019s right to due process, we must determine whether the defendant has met his burden of establishing, pursuant to the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">In reviewing a constitutionally based challenge to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury, we must determine \u201cwhether the charge, read in its entirety, fairly presents the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. . . . [W]e must consider the jury charge as a whole to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the instruction misled the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>253 Conn. 195, 206, 749 A.2d 1192 (2000). \u201cTo pass constitutional muster, jury instructions must be correct in law, adapted to the issues in the case and sufficient to guide the jury in arriving at a verdict. . . . The test that we apply to any part of a charge is whether the charge as a whole presents the case to a jury in such a manner that no injustice is perpetrated.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walsh, 52 </em>Conn. App. 708, 721, 728 A.2d 15, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 911, 733 A.2d 233 (1999). \u201c[R]eversal [is required] only if, in the context of the whole instruction, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>ted.) <em>State </em>v. Sanders, 54 Conn. App. 732, 740, 738 A.2d 674, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 913, 739 A.2d 1250 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">According to the defendant, the court failed to instruct the jury properly on the issue of intent, which is an essential element of the crime of attempt to commit robbery,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> thereby violating his constitutional rights to due process. A proper charge as to this element would instruct the jury that if it found that the defendant was too intoxicated to form the specific intent to commit the crime, then the fact that he was intoxicated could be used to negate that element, but that no matter how intoxicated the defendant was, intoxication could not be used to negate the element of general intent. The defendant claims that the court\u2019s instruction impermis-sibly informed the jury that it must find that he was so intoxicated that he could not form either the specific intent or general intent associated with the crime before it could consider the negating effect of intoxication.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>When the court completed its charge to the jury, the defendant did not except to the court\u2019s language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>regarding specific and general intent. The jury began its deliberations the next day. Shortly thereafter, the court received a note from the jury regarding the definitions of diminished capacity, intent, intoxication and voluntary. The court then issued a supplementary charge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The defendant did not object to this supple<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>mental charge or to a third supplemental charge delivered later that day. Nevertheless, the defendant now points to isolated portions of the jury charges in support of his claim that he was deprived of his constitutional rights to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Our review of the charge as a whole, however, reveals that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled as to the state\u2019s burden of proof on the element of specific intent and the relationship of intoxication to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>that burden. At the beginning of its instruction, the court reminded the jury that the defendant is presumed to be innocent, that the burden is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the crime of attempted robbery and that the defendant is not required to prove his innocence. The court then instructed the jury on the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, explaining that the defendant can establish this defense by a mere preponderance of the evidence. The court thereafter instructed the jury as to intent, reiterating that it is the state\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the requisite intent at the time of the crime. The court then discussed the subject of intoxication, reminding the jury that the defendant asserted that he was too intoxicated to have formed the specific intent elements of the crime. Finally, the court instructed the jury as to the elements of the crime of attempt to commit robbery in the first degree, explaining that the crime requires that, at the time of the incident, the defendant acted intentionally and with the required specific intent to commit the crime of robbery and that he specifically intended to deprive another of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Although a few statements in the jury charge, in isolation, may have been incorrect, jury instructions \u201care not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . [A]n error in the [charge] requires reversal only if, in the context of the whole instruction, there is a reasonable possibility that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 740. The jury charge, as a whole, reveals that the court properly instructed the jury that intoxication could be considered in determining whether the state had established the requisite intent. The court explained the statutory definition of intoxication contained in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7 and clearly explained the role of intoxication evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>negating the element of intent required for conviction of a specific intent crime. The court also instructed the jury that the defendant did not have to prove he was too intoxicated to form the necessary intent, but rather that the state retained the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the issue of intent as well as all of the other elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The charge, read in its entirety, clearly demonstrates that the court unequivocally stated that the state has the burden of proving that the defendant had the specific intent to commit robbery in the first degree and that if the jury found that the defendant was intoxicated at the time of the commission of the crime, it then could determine that his voluntary intoxication negated that intent. Moreover, the court instructed the jury that if it determined that the defendant was too intoxicated to have formed the specific intent required to commit the crime of attempted robbery, it must acquit him of that charge. Accordingly, the court did not inform the juiy, as the defendant asserts, that it must find that the defendant was too intoxicated to have formed the general and specific intent elements of the crime before it could consider the effect of the intoxication upon intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Not fewer than seventeen times in its initial instruction and not fewer than eight times in its supplemental instruction did the court properly instruct the jury as to the state\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the required specific intent to commit the crime of attempt to commit robbery. The court, therefore, adequately informed the jury that the state had the burden of proving that the defendant possessed the requisite intent. The jury was repeatedly instructed on the requirements of finding specific intent as an element of the crime and that the state had the burden of proving that element beyond a reasonable doubt. We are persuaded that the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>instructions, when considered in the context of the entire charge, neither created an unlawful threshold for the jury\u2019s consideration of intoxication nor weakened the state\u2019s burden of proof as to specific intent. The jury, therefore, could not reasonably have been misled as to either the state\u2019s burden of proof on the element of intent or the effect of the defendant\u2019s evidence of intoxication in determining whether the state proved the requisite intent beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We are persuaded, on the basis of our review of the court\u2019s charge in its entirety, that the jury instructions as to intent were proper. Accordingly, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that a violation of his constitutional rights clearly occurred and clearly deprived him of a fair trial. His claim, therefore, fails to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>Further, the defendant\u2019s claim fails to meet the stringent criteria of the plain error doctrine.

The crime of robbery in the first degree, as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), consists of larceny committed by the use or threat of the use of force, with the specific intent to deprive another of property. The statute defining the effect of intoxication on the finding of guilt, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7, provides that intoxication may negate an element of the crime charged. Voluntary intoxication, however, may negate specific intent, but not general intent. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shine, </em>193 Conn. 632, 638, 479 A.2d 218 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b240-8\"> The court instructed the jury in relevant part as follows: \u201c[I]t now becomes my duty ... to instruct you concerning the law which you are to apply ....</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">* sK</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">\u201c[T]he defendant is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b240-11\">\u201cThe burden to prove the defendant guilty of a crime with which he is charged is upon the state.

As applied here, it means that if you find that the defendant was so intoxicated that he was not mentally able to form the intent required for the commission of the crime, then the intent elements of 1he crime would not be proven and you would be required to acquit the defendant of that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">\u201cThis does not mean, however, that the defendant [must prove] that he was too intoxicated to form the intent required as an element of the crime.
