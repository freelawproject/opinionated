On appeal, the defendant has, essentially, attacked the factual findings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion when it found that the victim\u2019s capacity or competency to testify was \u201cminimally credible\u201d and denied the defendant\u2019s post-trial motion for psychological testing of the victim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 241-45, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 563-65, 560 A.2d 426 (1989). Additionally, the court\u2019s conclusion that the victim was competent to testify is supported by the evidence, and the court\u2019s related underlying factual findings are not clearly erroneous. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hydock, </em>51 Conn. App. 753, 764, 725 A.2d 379, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 921, 733 A.2d 846 (1999). We therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion and that its decision conforms to the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
