On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) excluded evidence concerning the motive of the victim\u2019s mother to implicate him in the victim\u2019s death, (2) failed to instruct the jury not to discuss the case at the end of the first day of trial, which violated his constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury, and (3) improperly instructed the jury as to reasonable doubt. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Georgia Graham, the victim\u2019s mother, and the defendant met at an office building in downtown Hartford, where they worked as security personnel. Although the defendant and Graham had an unstable relationship, they cohabited in a one bedroom apartment along with the victim, Daquan Roberts, Graham\u2019s fifteen month old son. During the course of the adults\u2019 relationship, individuals who knew the victim noticed a marked change in his behavior when he was in the presence of the defendant. At such times, the victim was timid, withdrawn and afraid of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s attitude toward the victim ranged from indifference to dislike. When Graham was no longer able to avail herself of professional child care, the defendant sometimes took care of the victim while Graham worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Prior to his death, the victim was in good health. On December 8, 1996, between 8 a.m. and 8:30 a.m., the defendant drove Graham to her place of employment. According to Graham, there was nothing wrong with the victim when she went to work. During the morning, Graham and the defendant spoke by telephone several times concerning the victim. At approximately 11:15 a.m., the defendant telephoned Graham, stating that there was something wrong with the victim and that he did not know what was the matter. The defendant then drove the victim to Graham\u2019s place of employment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>and from there all three proceeded to the Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center (medical center) in Hartford. They were involved in a motor vehicle accident en route.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">When he arrived at the medical center, the victim was in critical condition because he was not breathing and had little heart activity. The victim died when resuscitation efforts failed. An autopsy revealed bruises on the victim\u2019s right cheek, left leg and chest, which an associate medical examiner from the office of the chief medical examiner determined occurred shortly before the victim\u2019s death. The injuries were inconsistent with an automobile accident, a twelve inch fall into a bathtub, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or bumping into a fire door, which were explanations offered by the defendant. The victim also suffered significant internal injuries, namely, multiple fresh cranial hemorrhages, a broken rib and a lacerated liver that caused three quarters of his blood to enter his abdominal cavity. According to the associate medical examiner, the victim\u2019s liver was lacerated by blunt trauma that occurred within an hour of death and was the cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">After the victim died, the defendant was taken to the police station, where he gave a statement and repeatedly denied injuring the victim. The police inspected the apartment where the defendant and victim were alone prior to the victim\u2019s death. They found vomit and feces on the victim\u2019s clothes, a bedspread and the floor. The victim\u2019s blood was found on the bathroom door. When he was informed of the autopsy results, the defendant insisted that the doctors were wrong, a position he maintained throughout trial. The defendant was arrested on December 12, 1996, and the court, after a hearing in February, 1997, found probable cause. Subsequent to trial, the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly excluded evidence concerning Graham\u2019s motive to implicate him in the victim\u2019s death. The defendant claims that the evidence was admissible under three exceptions to the hearsay rule, i.e., (a) present state of mind, (b) state of mind to prove future conduct and (3) the residual exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this claim. Graham was called as a witness by the state and testified that the defendant had told her that he wondered what it would be like if the victim were not around anymore. During the defendant\u2019s case, counsel attempted to present evidence to demonstrate that Graham\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s statement was a recent fabrication. Defense counsel theorized that Graham did not tell authorities of the defendant\u2019s statement about the victim at the time of his death because the statement was never made. Defense counsel intended to call Rosemarie Hill, a woman who worked with both Graham and the defendant, to offer testimony to support the defense theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Hill was called to testify in an offer of proof that she and Graham had a conversation in January, 1997, concerning the defendant\u2019s infidelity to Graham.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Graham was upset and reported to Hill \u201cthat she [Graham] told him [the defendant] if he ever messed around on her that he would pay for it for the rest of his life.\u201d The victim was never mentioned during the conversation between Hill and Graham. Defense counsel sought to have Hill\u2019s testimony admitted under one of the three exceptions to the hearsay rule for the purpose of impeaching Graham\u2019s credibility by showing that her testimony on direct examination was a recent fabrica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>tion because she did not testify about the defendant\u2019s statement during the probable cause hearing in February, 1997.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to defense counsel, Hill\u2019s testimony was to offered to show Graham\u2019s state of mind at the time of the victim\u2019s death, which caused her to fabricate the defendant\u2019s statement when she testified at trial. Following the offer of proof, the court sustained the state\u2019s objection to Hill\u2019s proffered testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">We review the court\u2019s preclusion of the proffered evidence by an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Ormsby </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>54 Conn. App. 98, 101, 734 A.2d 575, cert. granted on other grounds, 250 Conn. 926, 738 A.2d 658 (1999). \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate procedure in the review of evidential rulings, whether resulting in the admission or exclusion of evidence, that an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him. <em>Casalo </em>v. <em>Claro, </em>147 Conn. 625, 630, 165 A.2d 153 (1960); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kwaak, </em>21 Conn. App. 138, 150-51, 572 A.2d 1015, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 811, 576 A.2d 540 (1990).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Suckley, </em>26 Conn. App. 65, 73, 597 A.2d 1285, cert. denied, 221 Conn. 901, 600 A.2d 1028 (1991). The court\u2019s rulings \u201cwill be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. \u201d (Internal quo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>tation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>40 Conn. App. 318, 324, 671 A.2d 371 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u201cBecause the admission of such evidence involves judicial discretion, [o]ur review is limited to whether [the] ruling exceeded the latitude accorded to the exercise of [such] discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>198 Conn. 147, 158, 502 A.2d 874 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382 (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>205 Conn. 279, 288, 533 A.2d 553 (1987). \u201cWe will reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling only if it could not reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u201cHearsay is an out-of-court statement offered into evidence to establish the truth of the matters contained therein. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>223 Conn. 207, 232, 613 A.2d 224 (1992). As a general rule, hearsay evidence is not admissible unless it falls under one of several well established exceptions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 664, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992). If such evidence is offered to establish the truth of statements contained therein, the burden is on the proponent of the evidence, upon timely objection, to establish that the evidence is admissible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>New England Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty Corp., </em>238 Conn. 745, 753, 680 A.2d 301 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The defendant argues that he proffered Hill\u2019s testimony to demonstrate Graham\u2019s state of mind in January, 1997, with respect to her feelings about his infidelity to her and that the evidence therefore was not hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter contained therein. We disagree. Hill\u2019s proffered testimony was not simple hearsay; it was double hearsay. Hill testified: \u201cShe said that <em>she told him </em>if he ever messed around on her that he would pay for it for the rest of his life.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>believes that Hill\u2019s testimony is reliable because she was a friend of both Graham and the defendant. Hill had known Graham for only four months at the time of their conversation. Such testimony does not carry the hallmark of reliability our rules of evidence require.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u201cThe reason for the general rule which excludes hearsay evidence unless it comes within one of the recognized exceptions is basically that the sanction of an oath and the test of cross-examination are absent; and the exceptions to the rule have been fashioned where the statements are made under conditions judged to render them equal in reliability and trustworthiness to those which are made under the sanctions described.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>177 Conn. 391, 396, 418 A.2d 46 (1979); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 389-94, 528 A.2d 794 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 630-31, 431 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S. Ct. 320, 66 L. Ed. 2d 148 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u201c \u2018[T]he risk of fabrication and distortion is significantly increased when a witness purports merely to repeat another\u2019s out-of-court declaration. It is always easier to say that X said something than to report personal observations of the event. Even if X did in fact tell the witness something, it would not be unusual for the person asserting to have overheard the out-of-court declaration to inject, intentionally or otherwise, additional or different statements into the conversation. Unfortunately, these fabricated or distorted statements will often be highly damaging admissions or confessions not easily discounted by the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>16 Conn. App. 390, 399, 547 A.2d 916, cert. denied, 210 Conn. 802, 553 A.2d 616 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">The defendant also claims that the court\u2019s failure to admit Hill\u2019s testimony violated his sixth amendment right to present a defense. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201c[E]very evidentiary ruling which denies a defendant a line of inquiry to which he thinks he is entitled is not constitutional error. . . . The defendant\u2019s rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to present a defense do not give him the right to have admitted any evidence he chooses. ... In the exercise of his rights, the defendant, as well as the state, must comply with the established rules of evidence and procedure. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Boles, </em>223 Conn. 535, 550, 613 A.2d 770 (1992). Excluding certain evidence does not vitiate the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>35 Conn. App. 51, 57, 644 A.2d 923 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u201c[A hearsay challenge] is a claim of an erroneous evidentiary ruling and as such does not implicate the constitution. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>52 Conn. App. 708, 720, 728 A.2d 15, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 911, 733 A.2d 233 (1999).\u201d <em>In re Brandon W., </em>56 Conn. App. 418, 424, 747 A.2d 526 (2000). \u201cIn nonconstitutional claims, the [party challenging the ruling] has the burden of demonstrating the harmfulness of the claimed error. ... He [or she] must show that it is more probable than not that the claimed error affected the verdict.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Here, the defendant has failed to explain how he was prejudiced by excluding Hill\u2019s testimony. The defendant does not deny that he was taking care of the victim during the morning of December 8, 1996, that he telephoned Graham to say that something was wrong with the victim, and that he drove the victim and Graham to the medical center. The defendant also has not challenged the associate medical examiner\u2019s testimony that the victim died as the result of blunt trauma to his liver, an injury that occurred within an hour of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The defendant claims that he was not able to demonstrate Graham\u2019s bias, motive or interest in testifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>falsely and relies primarily on <em>State </em>v. <em>Colton, </em>227 Conn. 231, 249, 630 A.2d 577 (1993), on appeal after remand, 234 Conn. 683, 663 A.2d 339 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1140, 116 S. Ct. 972, 133 L. Ed. 2d 892 (1996). We are mindful that, in his brief, the defendant states that his defense was that he was not responsible for inflicting <em>all </em>of the victim\u2019s injuries. We see no relationship between that theory of defense and Graham\u2019s state of mind concerning the defendant\u2019s lack of fidelity to her. As noted, the associate medical examiner testified that the victim\u2019s death was caused by blunt trauma to his liver that occurred shortly before his death. There was no serious question about the defendant\u2019s being the only person with the victim during the morning of December 8, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Furthermore, the facts of this case are distinguishable from <em>Colton, </em>in which the state\u2019s entire case rested on the testimony of one witness who came forward one year after the victim\u2019s murder, claiming that she saw the defendant commit the crime. Prior to the witness\u2019 identification, the defendant was not a suspect in the case. The defendant sought to impeach the witness\u2019 testimony by showing that she had come forward only to obtain the reward money that was offered shortly before she identified herself. Id., 234. The witness, who at the time of the murder was a known drug user and prostitute, testified that she did not immediately come forward with information about the crime because she did not want to be viewed as a \u201csnitch\u201d on the street and thereby hamper her ability to obtain drugs. Id., 237. She came forward later because she needed to unburden herself of the emotional anguish she was suffering from not having revealed what she knew about the murder. She denied any interest in the reward. Id., 240. She also testified that at the time of trial, she was no longer addicted to drugs or involved in prostitution, and that her financial needs were provided for by her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>former husband or her boyfriend. Id., 241. In other words, she was leading a new life.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">To discredit the witness, the defendant in <em>Colton </em>offered various information, including the testimony of two witnesses that during 1990, including the time of the defendant\u2019s second trial, the witness continued to engage in illegal drug use, which she funded through prostitution. Id., 243-44. The trial court did not allow the evidence, ruling that it was collateral, cumulative and irrelevant. Id., 242-44. Our Supreme Court reversed the judgment of conviction because the case turned on the credibility of this sole witness. The court held that \u201cthe exclusion of extrinsic evidence ... so significantly bore on the motive, bias and interest of [the witness] that the exclusion infringed on the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights.\u201d Id., 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The state\u2019s case here did not hinge solely on Graham\u2019s testimony. There was evidence from the associate medical examiner and others from which the jury could infer that the defendant was responsible for the victim\u2019s death. The defendant thus has not shown that it is more probable than not that the court\u2019s ruling affected the jury\u2019s verdict. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Nguyen, </em>52 Conn. App. 85, 93, 726 A.2d 119 (1999), aff'd, 253 Conn. 639, 756 A.2d 833 (2000). The court therefore properly exercised its discretion in excluding Hill\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court violated his constitutional right<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to a fair and impartial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>jury, and violated Practice Book \u00a7 42-14<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by failing to tell the jurors at the end of the first day of evidence not to discuss the case. The defendant did not preserve this claim at trial and seeks review under the plain error doctrine pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-5<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or, in the alternative, under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the court\u2019s failure to tell the jury at the end of the first day of evidence not to discuss the case does not constitute plain error and fails to meet the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>the defendant cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The following facts are relevant to this claim. Evidence began, on December 1, 1997. At various times that day, prior to excusing the jury, the court told the jury \u201cnot to discuss the case\u201d outside the courtroom. When the jury was excused for the luncheon recess, the court told the jury, \u201cDo not discuss the case among yourselves or with anyone else.\u201d When the jury was excused at the end of the day, the court stated: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we\u2019re going to suspend now for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>day. The balance of the testimony to be offered by Ms. Graham will be done in the morning, and then the state will call further witnesses, which may well take the full day.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\u201cThere may be some expression of this case by journalists or some other person in the media. You must avoid it and not read it, and <em>not listen to anybody\u2019s comments that might come either through that source or through any o ther source as I indicated to you before this trial started,</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>before the evidence staited, so that\u2019s most important. This may well continue through the trial or it may be on and off and not on a daily basis, but there may well be reportings of this case, so please be very mindful of that and not be exposed to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u201cSo, when you come in in the morning, which will be the same\u2014approximately the same time as today, go up to the fourth floor, and I will expect that we will\u2014unless something unforeseen happens\u2014that we will be proceeding at 10 a.m. so that prior to 10 a.m. you\u2019ll be brought down here, if all is well at that time. If not, we\u2019ll approximate some other time, but I don\u2019t expect any other time than 10 a.m. for starting tomorrow. So, you\u2019re excused for the night. We\u2019ll see you all in the morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u201cAdjourn court, sheriff.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">When construing our rules of practice, we are guided by the well known principles of statutory construction. \u201cThe rules of statutory construction apply with equal force to Practice Book rules. <em>Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Trantolo, </em>192 Conn. 15, 22, 470 A.2d 228 (1984). Where the meaning of a statute [or rule] is plain and unambiguous, the enactment speaks for itself and there is no occasion to construe it. Its unequivocal meaning is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>subject to modification by way of construction. . . . Id.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pitchell </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>247 Conn. 422, 432, 722 A.2d 797 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 42-14 simply requires the judicial authority to tell \u201cthe jurors not to read, listen to or view news reports of the case or to discuss with each other or with any person not a member of the jury the cause under consideration\u201d until the jury retires to deliberate. Section 42-14 does not say when the court is to admonish the jury nor how many times the jury is to be told not to pay attention to news reports or discuss the case with anyone until deliberations begin. We have reviewed the transcript of the first day of trial and determined that the court did everything required under our rules of practice with respect to admonishing the jury. The defendant has not pointed to any statute or case law to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u201cPlain error is reserved for instances where the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>214 Conn. 118, 120-21, 570 A.2d 1123 (1990). Our Supreme Court has stated that a trial court\u2019s failure to follow the mandatory provisions of a statute prescribing trial procedures or to follow a procedural rule constitutes plain error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 171 n.10, 571 A.2d 79 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pina, </em>185 Conn. 473, 482, 440 A.2d 962 (1981).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robins, </em>34 Conn. App. 694, 706, 643 A.2d 881 (1994), aff'd, 233 Conn. 527, 660 A.2d 738 (1995).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The third prong of <em>Golding </em>requires that a constitutional violation must clearly exist before a defendant can prevail on an unpre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>served claim of constitutional error. The defendant has not demonstrated that the court failed to follow the mandate of Practice Book \u00a7 42-14 and, thus, there is no plain error or constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the court improperly diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof when it instructed the jury that \u201ca reasonable doubt is a doubt for which a valid reason can be assigned\u201d and that it \u201cis a doubt which you can in your own mind give a reasonable\u2014give a reason for conscientiously.\u201d The defendant failed to submit a request to charge and failed to take an exception to the charge that was given. He therefore seeks review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. The defendant concedes that our Supreme Court has upheld similar language. He therefore is unable to show that he was clearly deprived of a constitutional right.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b30-7\"> The defendant offered the testimony of Rosemarie Hill, a coworker of the defendant and Graham, to show that Graham had motive, bias or interest in falsely implicating him in the victim\u2019s death. The defendant sought to have Hill testify that Graham had told her of the defendant\u2019s infidelity and that Graham had warned him that \u201che would pay for it for the rest of his life. \u201d Because we conclude that Hill\u2019s proffered testimony was not admissible on the ground that it was double hearsay, as we discuss in this opinion, we need not address the defendant\u2019s specific claims. The proffered testimony was not admissible, however, under any of the hearsay exceptions offered by the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\"><em>Present state of mind: </em>\u201cAn out-of-court statement is not hearsay, however, if it is offered to illustrate circumstantially the declarant\u2019s then present state of mind, rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blades, </em>225 Conn. 609, 632, 626 A.2d 273 (1993). The defendant wanted to use Graham\u2019s statement, allegedly made in January, 1997, to establish a motive on her part to implicate him in the victim\u2019s death. Hill\u2019s proffered testimony, however, was double hearsay and, thus, inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\"><em>State of mind to prove future conduct: </em>\u201cThe hearsay statements of an <em>unavailable </em>declarant, made in good faith and not for a self-serving purpose, that express his or her present intentions to [do something] in the immediate future are admissible and allow the trier of fact reasonably to infer that the declarant\u2019s expressed intention was carried out.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 592, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987). \u201cFurther, this court has acknowledged the Supreme Court\u2019s rule requiring the declarant to be unavailable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jurgensen, </em>42 Conn. App. 751, 757, 681 A.2d 981, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 931, 683 A.2d 398 (1996).\u201d <em>Ormsby </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>54 Conn. App. 98, 108, 734 A.2d 575, cert. granted on other grounds, 250 Conn. 926, 738 A.2d 658 (1999). Here, Graham was available to testify, and the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\"><em>Residual exception: </em>\u201cIt is well established that all hearsay exceptions are rooted in the notion that they contain a sufficient guarantee of trustworthiness to serve as a sufficient surrogate for cross-examination of testimony in court. <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>[410 U.S. 284, 298-99, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stange, </em>[212 Conn. 612, 625, 563 A.2d 681 (1989)]. The \u2018residual,\u2019 or \u2018catch-all,\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule allows a trial court to admit hearsay evidence not admissible under any of the estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>lished exceptions if: (1) there is a reasonable necessity for the admission of the statement, and (2) the statement is supported by the equivalent guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness essential to other evidence admitted under the traditional hearsay exceptions. . . . We have stated that the necessity requirement is met when, unless the hearsay statement is admitted, the facts it contains may be lost, either because the declarant is dead or <em>otherwise unavailable, </em>or because the assertion is of such a nature that evidence of the same value cannot be obtained from the same or other sources. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 664-65, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>245 Conn. 779, 805, 717 A.2d 1140 (1998). Here, again, Graham was available to testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\"> The defendant was incarcerated in January, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\"> During cross-examination at trial, defense counsel questioned Graham extensively as to why she did not report the defendant\u2019s statement to (he authorities at the time of the victim\u2019s death. Graham testified that at the time of her child\u2019s death she was upset and did not think about or remember the defendant\u2019s words. In response to why she did not testily about the statement during the probable cause hearing, Graham testified that she answered only the specific questions that she was asked. She could not remember when she recalled the defendant\u2019s statement, but did so in response to the authorities\u2019 repeatedly asking her to think of any reason the defendant might have to harm the victim. Graham testified that given the shock of her baby\u2019s death, it took her some time to remember events and their sequence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\"> Our review of the transcript also revealed that the state, in objecting to Hill\u2019s testimony, argued that if the defendant had wanted to impeach Graham he could have done so during cross-examination. Defense counsel countered that such an argument presumed that the defendant knew of Graham\u2019s threat at the time of her cross-examination. Defense counsel\u2019s argument is disingenuous, as Hill\u2019s proffered testimony was to repeat what Graham told the defendant the consequences of his infidelity would be.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b37-11\"> The defendant claims that the court violated his rights pursuant to the fourth, fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 42-14 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe judicial authority shall admonish the jurors not to read, listen to or view news reports of the case or to discuss with each other or with any person not a member of the jury the cause under consideration, except that after the case has been submitted to the jury for deliberation the jurors shall discuss it among themselves in the jury room.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe court shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial or arose subsequent to the trial.
