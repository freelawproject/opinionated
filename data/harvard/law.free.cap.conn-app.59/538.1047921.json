We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The following facts were found by the trial court. The victim was a twelve year old female grade school student in New Haven. On April 15, 1998, the victim and two other girls were on their way to the victim\u2019s locker, which was located in her classroom, when they were followed by the respondent and two other boys. As the victim entered her classroom, the two other girls left, stating that they would be \u201cright back.\u201d At this time, the respondent and the two other boys entered the classroom, closed the door and told the victim that she had to kiss one of the boys, T, or else she could not leave the classroom. The victim resisted, banged on the door and was subsequently let out of the classroom. As she went outside the classroom, T grabbed her hand and attempted to prevent her from telling anyone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She hit T and proceeded down the hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The victim began to run up the stairs located in the hallway when she and the respondent bumped heads, at which time the respondent began hitting her buttocks. After the victim pushed the respondent away, T grabbed her hands and pushed her against the wall. The respondent and T started pulling at her pants. The victim told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>them to stop, but the respondent refused and continued to pull her pants down while she tried to pull them back up. T also touched the victim\u2019s breasts inside her shirt. The victim then began to scream and managed to get away, running down the hall.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">A petition was filed in the Superior Court for juvenile matters alleging that the respondent was a delinquent for having committed sexual assault in the third degree and unlawful restraint in the second degree. On November 10,1998, the court granted the respondent\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to those charges, but allowed the petitioner to proceed on the lesser included offense of sexual assault in the fourth degree. The court found that the respondent had committed sexual assault in the fourth degree and adjudicated him a delinquent. On December 10, 1998, at the dispositional hearing, the respondent was discharged with a warning. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The respondent claims that the court improperly found that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that he had committed sexual assault in the fourth degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-73a. Specifically, he claims that the petitioner had failed to prove that he touched the victim\u2019s intimate parts for the purposes of either sexual gratification or humiliating and degrading the victim. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">\u201cThe standard for reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims is well settled in this state. . . . [0]ur courts apply a two-prong test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>48 Conn. App. 193, 196, 709 A.2d 564, cert. denied, 244 Conn. 931, 711 A.2d 729 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u201c[I]n viewing evidence which could yield contrary inferences, the [trier of fact] is not barred from drawing those inferences consistent with guilt and is not required to draw only those inferences consistent with innocence. The rule is that the [trier of fact\u2019s] function is to draw whatever inferences from evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 132-33, 646 A.2d 169 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Section 53a-73a (a) (2) provides that a person is guilty of sexual assault in the fourth degree when \u201csuch person subjects another person to sexual contact without such other person\u2019s consent . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (3) defines \u201csexual contact\u201d as \u201cany contact with the intimate parts of a person . . . for the purpose of sexual gratification of the actor or for the purpose of degrading or humiliating such person . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (8) defines \u201cintimate parts\u201d as \u201cthe genital area, groin, anus, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">For behavior to constitute a sexual assault in the fourth degree, there must be \u201csexual contact\u201d as defined by statute. In this case, the respondent admitted to \u201csmacking\u201d the victim\u2019s buttocks more than once and this constituted \u201csexual contact\u201d as defined in \u00a7 53a-65 (3). The court, in fact, made a specific finding that the respondent had slapped the victim\u2019s buttocks and concluded that this alone was sufficient to constitute sexual assault in the fourth degree. While the court made no specific finding that the purpose for the respondent\u2019s actions was to humiliate or to degrade the victim, \u201c[w]e give deference to the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom that support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>trial court\u2019s determination of guilt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>52 Conn. App. 802, 806, 729 A.2d 778 (1999). Here, the record shows that the respondent attempted to pull down the victim\u2019s pants and smacked the victim\u2019s buttocks more than once. Furthermore, these acts had been carried out in a school hallway in front of several people. These facts could support a reasonable inference that the respondent actively participated in activities intending to degrade or humiliate the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The respondent\u2019s contention that he did not have sexual contact with the victim because he did not touch the victim\u2019s \u201cintimate parts,\u201d but rather touched the victim\u2019s clothes, is incorrect. To have \u201csexual contact\u201d as defined by the statute it is irrelevant whether the respondent\u2019s contact with the victim was through clothing or with bare skin. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Eric T., </em>8 Conn. App. 607, 613, 513 A.2d 1273 (1986), we rejected a respondent\u2019s claim that there was no sexual contact sufficient to constitute sexual assault in the fourth degree because he had not touched the victim\u2019s bare skin. This court held that \u201cas long as the contact was for the purpose of sexual gratification, whether direct or indirect, whether through clothing or bare skin, it will satisfy the definition of \u2018sexual contact.\u2019 \u201d Id. In this case, the respondent\u2019s sexual contact with the victim was clearly done without the victim\u2019s consent and with the intent to degrade or to humiliate the victim. Given the facts, the respondent\u2019s admitted \u201cslapping\u201d of the victim\u2019s buttocks alone was sufficient evidence to establish sexual assault in the fourth degree pursuant to \u00a7 53a-73a.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-73a (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the fourth when ... (2) such person subjects another person to sexual contact without such other person\u2019s consent</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\"> T was also charged with sexual assault. The cases were tried separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> This ended the respondent\u2019s involvement in the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
