On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his request to poll the jury upon return of the verdict. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. The defendant was arrested on November 29, 1996, and charged with possession of narcotics with intent to sell.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict of guilty. After the foreman announced the jury\u2019s verdict, the defense counsel requested that the jury be polled. The court denied this request, instead instructing the courtroom clerk to read to the jury the verdict as recorded. The jury responded, \u201cYes,\u201d to the question, \u201cSo say you one, so say you all?\u201d which the clerk asked after reading the verdict. Defense counsel then renewed his request that the jurors be polled individually. The court again denied the request, noting that each of the jurors gave assent to the clerk\u2019s question. Later that day, before the jury had been dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>charged, the defense counsel again renewed the request that the jurors be polled individually.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court again denied this request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his repeated requests to have the jury polled. We need look no further than <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>253 Conn. 611, 755 A.2d 180 (2000), which was decided after briefs were filed and oral argument was presented in this case. In short, <em>Pare </em>holds that \u201ca violation of a party\u2019s timely polling request requires automatic reversal of the judgment.\u201d Id., 639. The defendant requested a poll of the jury in this case, and the trial court declined to do so. We follow <em>State </em>v. <em>Pare, </em>supra, 639, and conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to poll requires automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\"> There was also a part B information filed, charging the defendant with previously having been convicted of the crime of possession of narcotics with intent to sell.

It was clear that the jury assented when asked by the clerk, \u2018So say you one, so say you all?\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
