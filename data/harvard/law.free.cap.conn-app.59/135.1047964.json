The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly (1) excluded evidence concerning the defense of necessity, (2) instructed the jury and (3) denied his request for new counsel. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">On the basis of the evidence adduced at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Some time late in 1996, the defendant brought his 1987 Chrysler New Yorker to Milex, an automobile repair shop located in Stratford, for the purpose of an analysis because the vehicle was not running properly and was losing power. After tests were performed, representatives of Milex recommended replacing the head and timing belt, together with other incidental work. The defendant objected and indicated a different procedure would suffice. He agreed to pay Milex $360 for six hours of labor, plus the cost of having one valve machined and the others checked. After the work was completed, on September 18, 1996, the defendant was given a bill in the amount of $561.80, which included a bill in the amount of $155 from the machine shop. The defendant refused to pay, insisting that the bill should be only $360 plus tax. The defendant left and Milex kept the car. Two weeks later Milex notified the defendant it would accept the $360, but the defendant refused. On November 12, 1996, Milex provided the department of motor vehicles with written notice of a bailee\u2019s lien on the defendant\u2019s automobile, and shortly thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>received confirmation of the hen\u2019s registration in the amount of $561.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">At some time on either Saturday, November 23,1996, or Sunday, November 24, 1996, the defendant took his car from Milex\u2019s property. The police were notified and officers spoke with the defendant, who admitted taking the car and driving it approximately twenty miles to his house in Seymour. The officers asked that the defendant either to return the car or to pay the balance claimed and he refused. He was later arrested on a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The defendant first claims that the state failed to prove every essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore, that his conviction cannot stand. Specifically, the defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to show that he took \u201cproperty\u201d from an owner or that his actions constituted a \u201ctheft of services.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [trier of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... On appeal, we do not ask whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that would support a reasonable hypothesis of innocence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>We ask, instead, whether there is a reasonable view of the evidence that supports the [trier of fact\u2019s] verdict of guilty.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kondracki, </em>51 Conn. App. 338, 342, 721 A.2d 567 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u201cWe are guided by the well established principle that \u2018[t]he trier of fact may accept or reject the testimony of any witness.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>38 Conn. App. 731, 744, 663 A.2d 1078 (1995), cert. denied, 237 Conn. 921, 676 A.2d 1376 [cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1044, 117 S. Ct. 617, 136 L. Ed. 2d 541] (1996). It is the trier of fact\u2019s \u2018exclusive province to weigh the conflicting evidence and determine the credibility of the witnesses.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>30 Conn. App. 232, 239, 619 A.2d 1151, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 915, 623 A.2d 1025 (1993). We give deference to the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom that support the trial court\u2019s determination of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>46 Conn. App. 684, 690, 700 A.2d 119 (1997).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kondracki, </em>supra, 51 Conn. App., 342-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">This appeal appears to present an issue of first impression, that is, whether a bailor who takes his own property from the lawful possession of a bailee can be convicted of larceny for depriving the bailee of the value of his services, as secured by a bailee\u2019s lien on the property. We conclude that he may.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">Evidence was presented to the jury that Milex\u2019s lien on the defendant\u2019s vehicle had been registered, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-61 (b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>$561.80 in unpaid repairs. Milex\u2019s continued right of possession of that vehicle became superior to that of the defendant. While the defendant continued to hold legal title to the vehicle, Milex was the \u201cowner\u201d and the defendant was the \u201ctaker,\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (5).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under these facts, it is therefore possible for the defendant to be convicted of larceny for taking property that he owns, and for depriving Milex of its superior right of possession and the amount of its lien interest in the vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">While the amended information; see footnote 2; might have been more artfully drawn, it was sufficient to put the defendant on proper notice of the charge against him. Property as defined in \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (l)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> means among other things personal property, which includes the vehicle in question. The value of the theft, however, is limited by the amount of the bailee\u2019s lien, as secured by the property itself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The crime of theft of services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 (7),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> need not be proven and is not relevant to the state\u2019s charge of larceny under \u00a7 53a-125. We also find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claim that the state failed to prove that he changed the circumstances of the parties or affected Milex\u2019s claims when he took the automobile, or that he attempted to take any underhanded action. The jury had before it sufficient evidence to find beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of larceny in the fourth degree, including the value of Milex\u2019s possessory interest, that is, the value of its lien being in excess of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The defendant next argues that the court improperly excluded evidence regarding the common-law defense of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u201cWhere an offer of proof is made with respect to a defense and it is clear from the offer of proof that the defense is insufficient as a matter of law, the trial court may properly refuse to permit evidence of the defense to be submitted to the jury.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Drummy, 18 Conn. App. 303, 309-10, 557 A.2d 574 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u201cThis court has . . . adopted a definition of the common law defense of necessity that requires a showing by the defendant (a) that there [was] no . . . legal alternative available, (b) that the harm to be prevented [was] imminent, and (c) that a direct causal relationship [may] be reasonably anticipated to exist between defendant\u2019s action and the avoidance of harm.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Anthony, </em>24 Conn. App. 195, 209, 588 A.2d 214, cert. dismissed, 218 Conn. 911, 591 A.2d 813, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 913, 112 S. Ct. 312, 116 L. Ed. 2d 254 (1991); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Drummy, </em>supra, 18 Conn. App. 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the court properly refused to allow the defendant to present evidence concerning the defense of necessity. The defendant could not satisfy the first element of the defense because he had a legal alternative available. In fact, he does not dispute that he could have dissolved Milex\u2019s hen by substituting a bond with surety pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 49-61 (a).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">The defendant claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the crime of larceny in the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>degree by (1) repeatedly referring to \u201cproperty or services\u201d in an interchangeable or synonymous manner and (2) referring to the defendant\u2019s not guilty plea. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of impropriety as to the charge is unpreserved. The defendant neither filed a request to charge nor noted an exception to the court\u2019s instruction in this regard. The defendant has failed to seek review of his unpreserved claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), or under the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. This claim will not be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">The defendant also argues that the court\u2019s instruction referring to his not guilty plea was reversible error. The court instructed the jury: \u201cThe defendant made certain statements to the police .... Any statements of the accused . . . admitted as evidence are to be considered by you in connection with all other evidence in this case. Made, as it was, out of this court, it is not like the sworn testimony offered here before you. It is to be considered by you as a declaration inconsistent with the accused\u2019s plea of not guilty. It may be evidence circumstantial of the truth of the statements made in it. It is for you to determine what weight is given to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">While we do not invite comments on a defendant\u2019s plea during jury instructions, we find this unartfully phrased instruction to be harmless error, if indeed error. The jury could have found the defendant\u2019s statements to be admissions and, in some fashion, inconsistent with the position he took during his trial. Our review of the whole charge, however, leads us to conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by this instruction. \u201cThe test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>v. McNair, 54 Conn. App. 807, 818, 738 A.2d 689, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 913, 739 A.2d 1249 (1999). Considered as a whole, the charge here properly presented the case to the jury so that no injustice resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Lastly, the defendant claims that the court improperly denied his request for new counsel or to proceed pro se. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u201cThe standard when reviewing a denial of a request for alternate counsel ... is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that a factual basis did not exist for granting the request.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Marico, </em>14 Conn. App. 140, 144, 539 A.2d 1033, cert. denied, 208 Conn. 812, 546 A.2d 281 (1988). Practice Book \u00a7 3-10 requires that a court find good cause to grant a motion to withdraw. Our Supreme Court has held that \u201cto work a delay by a last minute discharge of counsel there must exist exceptional circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Robinson, 227 Conn. 711, 726, 631 A.2d 288 (1993). \u201cWe must distinguish between a substantial and timely request for new counsel pursued in good faith, and one made for insufficient cause on the eve or in the middle of trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>202 Conn. 75, 82, 519 A.2d 1194 (1987). We find no exceptional circumstances or good cause here.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u201c[A] trial court has a responsibility to inquire into and to evaluate carefully all substantial complaints concerning court-appointed counsel . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 726. The extent of that inquiry, however, lies within the discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hansen, </em>39 Conn. App. 384, 398-99, 666 A.2d 421, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 928, 667 A.2d 554 (1995). \u201cA trial court does not abuse its discretion by failing to make further inquiry where the defendant has already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>had an adequate opportunity to inform the trial court of his complaints.\u201d Id., 399.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The defendant informed the court that he disagreed with his counsel over trial tactics and strategy, and that he had difficulty communicating with counsel in that regard. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the court, having considered the claims made by the defendant and having found them not to be substantial, properly found that the defendant did not demonstrate good cause. The court did not abuse its discretion in finding the defendant\u2019s claims to be insufficient to justify the appointment of new counsel. Further, the defendant did not assert his right to self-representation in a clear and unequivocal manner, but rather agreed to continue with his court-appointed attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125 (a) provides: \u201cA person is guilty of larceny in the fourth degree when he commits larceny as defined in section 53a-119 and the value of the property or service exceeds five hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 provides in relevant part: \u201cA person commits larceny when, with intent to deprive another of properly or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such property from an owner. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\"> By an amended information, the state charged that \u201cat the Town of Stratford, County of Fairfield, on or about the 25th day of November, 1996, [the defendant] with intent to deprive another of properly or to appropriate the same to himself or a third person, namely, the value of labor, professional services or parts, wrongfully took, obtained or withheld such properly from an owner, and the value of such property exceeded five hundred dollars, in violation of \u00a7 53a-125 . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 49-61 (b) provides: \u201cIf the property is a motor vehicle and if no application that the lien be dissolved upon such substitution of a bond is made within thirty days of the date of the completion of the work upon the property by the bailor for hire, the bailee shall send a written notice to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, stating the engine number and chassis number thereof, the date the motor vehicle was left with him, the date the work was completed, the amount for which a lien is claimed, the registration thereof if any number plates are on the motor vehicle and the name of the owner or person who authorized the work to be done, and shall enclose a fee of five dollars.
