The plaintiff, Sandra <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Dorfman, claims that the trial court improperly confirmed the award because (1) the arbitrator violated the very contractual provision from which he derived his authority, (2) the arbitrator acted outside the scope of his authority by failing to follow a mandatory provision of the contract regarding termination of the construction contract and (3) the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">This case arose out of a dispute between the plaintiff owner and the defendant construction company wherein each alleged breaches of a construction contract. The contract, which contained an arbitration clause, provided for the defendant to perform extensive work at the home of the plaintiff in Washington, Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">It is the appellant\u2019s burden to provide a record that is adequate for review on appeal. <em>Kirei </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>47 Conn. App. 451, 458, 705 A.2d 205 (1998). The court did not file a memorandum of decision or a signed transcript of an oral decision. The plaintiff filed a motion for articulation, which the trial court denied. The plaintiff did not thereafter file a motion for review of the denial of her motion for articulation. Practice Book \u00a7 66-7 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the action of the trial judge as regards . . . articulation . . . may, within ten days of the issuance of notice of the order sought to be reviewed, make a written motion for review to the [appellate] court . . . .\u201d The record here contains the arbitrator\u2019s award and the court\u2019s order that simply confirms the award. Nowhere in this record can we find the basis for the actions of the arbitrator<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> Some record of the actions of the arbitrator would be required for us to consider the plaintiffs claim that the arbitrator acted in manifest disregard of the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
