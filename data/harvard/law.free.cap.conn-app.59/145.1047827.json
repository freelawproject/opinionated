On appeal, the state claims that the trial court in this case improperly ordered that the defendant\u2019s sentence was to run concurrently with a previously imposed criminal contempt sentence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. On November 29, 1995, the court, <em>Espinosa, J., </em>summarily found the defendant, Duane Banks, in criminal contempt of court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on three separate occasions during a hearing on a motion for modification of bail. The court sentenced the defendant to consecutive prison terms of three months on each contempt finding, for a total effective sentence of nine months. The defendant filed a writ of error challenging the court\u2019s three summary judgments of criminal contempt and moved for a stay of sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Our Supreme Court affirmed the first contempt judgment and the resulting three month sentence, and reversed the other two contempt judgments. <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>241 Conn. 569, 698 A.2d 268 (1997) <em>(BanksI).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Prior to the decision in <em>Banks I, </em>the defendant was convicted on the robbery charges, and on November 15, 1996, the court, <em>Spada, J., </em>sentenced the defendant to a total effective sentence of twenty-five years. The court failed, however, to specify whether the sentence was to be concurrent with or consecutive to the contempt sentences previously imposed. On September 19, 1997, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37, the state filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence, seeking clarification on whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>sentences were to be concurrent or consecutive.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>At the hearing, Judge Spada clarified his original sentence, stating: \u201cA sentence of twenty-five years is more than adequate and, therefore, the sentence imposed by [me] . . . is to run concurrent with the sentence imposed by Judge Espinosa of three months.\u201d The court thereafter denied the motion to correct the sentence. The present appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The state claims that the court improperly ordered that the defendant serve his criminal contempt sentence and the sentence on the robbery charges concurrently. It is the state\u2019s position that the trial court did not have the power to impose concurrent sentences for criminal contempt and a subsequent criminal conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The state raises an issue of first impression for this court when it questions whether a court has the authority to order that a criminal sentence run concurrently with a previously imposed criminal contempt sentence that was imposed by a different trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>elude that a trial court may run a criminal sentence concurrently with an earlier criminal contempt sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">A trial court generally is empowered with the discretion to award concurrent or consecutive sentences pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37. \u201cUnder ... \u00a7 53a-37, the trial court is authorized to impose sentences on multiple counts either to run concurrently with each other or to run consecutively to each other. The determination whether to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences is a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>249 Conn. 645, 688, 735 A.2d 267 (1999). General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> however, limits the application of \u00a7 53a-37 to \u201coffenses.\u201d In <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>222 Conn. 591, 598-99, 610 A.2d 1177 (1992) , our Supreme Court stated that criminal contempt is not a criminal offense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>147 Conn. 167, 170, 158 A.2d 166 (1960). Furthermore, \u00a7 53a-37 \u201cis limited by its plain language to those instances in which a court imposes an additional criminal sentence on a defendant already serving a criminal sentence previously imposed by a Connecticut court.\u201d <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>225 Conn. 46, 53, 621 A.2d 1311 (1993) . Criminal contempt, therefore, is not a matter within the scope of \u00a7 53a-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">The failure of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37 to address a court\u2019s authority to impose a criminal sentence concurrent with a criminal contempt sentence does not necessarily deny the court such power. Our Supreme Court \u201clong ago concluded that a criminal contempt proceeding should conform as nearly as possible to proceedings in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, 222 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>599. Moreover, this court has stated that \u201c[t]he inherent right of courts to impose consecutive sentences has long been recognized at common law. . . . Determining whether two sentences will be concurrent or consecutive is part of the judicial function of imposing sentences upon a convict and is a matter for the determination of the court.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 10, 12, 596 A.2d 477 (1991), aff'd, 225 Conn. 46, 621 A.2d 1311 (1993). It would be contrary to common-law principles to conclude that the power to impose a term of imprisonment concurrent with the sentence for criminal contempt is beyond the power of the trial court. See id. \u201cWe do not read statutes to depart from the common law without a clear indication of legislative intent to do so. . . .A statute should not be construed as altering the common law unless the intent to do so is fairly expressed in the statute.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Leydon </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>57 Conn. App. 712, 721, 750 A.2d 1122, cert. granted on other grounds, 254 Conn. 904, 905, 755 A.2d 881, 882 (2000). Absent an affirmative statement to the contrary, the legislature did not intend to change the existing common-law doctrine in enacting \u00a7 53a-37. See id. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court properly imposed a sentence for a criminal offense to be served concurrent with a previously imposed sentence for criminal contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b168-10\"> After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and 53a-8, conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and 53a-48 (a), and robbery in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-136 and 53a-136a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-33a (a) provides: \u201cAny person who violates the dignity and authority of any court, in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice, or any officer of any court who misbehaves in the conduct of his official duties shall be guilty of contempt and shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\"> The stay was granted on January 17, 1996.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b170-8\"> To ensure that the issue regarding the defendant\u2019s sentence would not become moot, the state on July 25, 1997, filed a motion to maintain the stay of the defendant\u2019s contempt sentence. By order dated September 24, 1997, our Supreme Court granted this motion until twenty days after the trial court\u2019s action on the pending motions to correct the illegal sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b170-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-37 provides: \u201cMultiple sentences: Concurrent or consecutive, minimum term.

The court shall state whether the respective maxima and minima shall run concurrently or consecutively with respect to each other, and shall state in conclusion the effective sentence imposed. When a person is sentenced for two or more counts each constituting a separate offense, the court may order that the term of imprisonment for the second and subsequent counts be for a fixed number of years each. The court in such cases shall not set any minimum term of imprisonment except under the first count, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>fixed number of years imposed for the second and subsequent counts shall be added to the maximum term imposed by the court on the first count.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b171-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201cevery person convicted of an <em>offense </em>shall be sentenced in accordance with this title.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
