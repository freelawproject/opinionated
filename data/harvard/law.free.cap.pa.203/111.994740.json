The judgment in the attachment establishes only the existence of the debt due the plaintiff by his immediate debtor. The plaintiff stands in no better position as to the thing attached than does his debtor, and an}' defense good against the latter will prevent a recovery against the garnishee: Farmers\u2019 &amp; Mechanics\u2019 Bank v.

The road was unfinished and the purchaser, who owned a number of bonds, was unwilling to buy more unless assured that the road would be completed.

The money was so used. Neither at the time of-the service of the attachment, nor at any time thereafter, could the contractor have withdrawn this fund. It was pledged for a specific purpose, and the purchaser of the bonds had a vested right as to its appropriation under the agreement. The plaintiff, whose judgment was for a debt contracted before the purchase of the. bonds, stood in the same position as the contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
