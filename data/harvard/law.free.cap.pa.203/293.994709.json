I give and bequeath unto my daughter, Barbara, now the wife of Joseph Summers, the interest at 5 per cent, per year upon the sum of three thousand dollars ; of the said principal sum, I hereby charge and make a lien of one thousand dollars upon the lands and real estate herein devised to my son, Henry Souders ; one thousand dollars upon the lands and real estate herein devised to my son, David Souders, and one thousand dollars upon the lands herein devised to my son, Peter Souders. The interest money being fifty dollars a year to be paid by each of my three sons and their respective heirs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>and assignees of the real estate devised to them, to be paid in half yearly payments of twenty-five dollars each on every first day of April and October, making seventy-five dollars every six months. And the said interest money shall be paid nnto my said daughter, Barbara, into her hands, and for her sole and separate use, and on her separate receipt, or to her\u2019 order in writing, signed by herself, and in the presence of, and signed by one or more respectable witness or witnesses, so that and to the end and intent that the said interest, nor any part thereof, shall in any wise be subject or liable to the debts, power, control or interference of her said husband, or any other husband she may hereafter have or take. And upon the death of my said daughter, Barbara, the said principal sum of three thousand dollars and all interest due thereon shall be paid to her legal issue, and descendants if she leaves any, according to the present intestate laws o\u00a3 this state, as if she were absolutely possessed thereof, and died intestate, single and unmarried, subject nevertheless to the payment of her debts and funeral expenses, if she does not leave of her own bona fide estate sufficient for those purposes, and in case she dies leaving no legal issue or descendants, then the said principal sum and interest due thereon, or sqph part thereof as under the hereinafter provisions may be remaining at her death, shall descend and be paid to, and I give and bequeath the same unto her brothers and sisters in equal shares and parts according to the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, as if it had been a bona fide absolute estate and she had died possessed thereof, intestate and unmarried.

The language is clear and does not admit of any other construction. \u201c Upon the death of my said daughter, Barbara, the said principal sum of the three thousand dollars and all interest due thereon shall be paid to her legal issue, and descendants if she leaves any, according to the present intestate laws of this state, as if she were absolutely possessed thereof, and died intestate, single and unmarried; . . . . and in case she dies leaving no legal issue or descendants, than the said principal sum and interest due thereon, .... shall descend and be paid to, and I give and bequeath the same unto her brothers and sisters in equal shares and parts according to the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, as if it had been a bona fide absolute estate and she had died possessed thereof, intestate and unmarried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The concluding phrase, \u201c as if it had been a bona fide absolute estate, and she had died possessed thereof intestate and unmarried,\u2019.\u2019 does not indicate any intention to limit the devise over to her death without issue while still covert. The devise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>over is to be determined by the fact of death without issue, whether covert or disco\u2019vert, and the other words are a mere description of the mode of distribution, \u201c as if,\u201d etc., to emphasize the direction to distribute according to the intestate laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">There is nothing in the 28th section of the will to interfere with this manifest construction of the 23d section. By the 28th section the testator for purposes of distribution among five other children threw all of his estate into hotchpot except the share previously bequeathed in trust for Barbara. This has no bearing on the quantum of her estate, for it is as consistent with the intent to preserve it for the remainder-men after her death as with any other purpose. The claim of her executor was therefore properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The numerous other questions raised in the court below are not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
