Houser, bearing date January, 1893, and recorded in the office for recording deeds, etc.,, in and for Luzerne county, in deed book No. 316, page 309, etc., by executing and delivering, in lieu and place thereof, a similar deed to the said John B. Houser, but omitting therefrom the words, \u201call that certain surface, messuage, or tenement and tract of land,\u201d as contained in the grant of the said recited deed, and inserting in their stead the words, \u201c all that certain surface or right of soil in and to the following piece, parc'el or tract of land\u201d in the said grant, and also inserting the words \u201c excepting and reserving to the said Charles Baab, his heirs and assigns, all the coal and other minerals under the said described tract of land,\u201d immediately after the grant aforesaid, and also inserting the words, \u201cexcepting and reserving as aforesaid,\u201d after the habendum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-10\">And further, that the said John B.

Clothing it with the equitable doctrine of mistake does not cover and conceal its true character. Stripped of all circuition and- bedizenment, it is simply a claim of right to a conveyance of land; and more than merely that, of right to a reconveyance of a part of the land sold and conveyed by himself, by his own solemn deed, duly executed and delivered, with a full knowledge of all the facts, and of the character and condition of his deed, upon the mere alleged parol agreement of the defendant, that he might reserve the coal in said land, without the addition of a single requisite necessary to take the case out of the operation of the said statute: Chartiers Block Coal Co. v. Mellon, 152 Pa. 286; Fowler v. Fowler, 4 De G. &amp; J. 250; Schotte v. Meredith, 197 Pa. 496.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b502-9\">If there was any mistake at all, it was simply one of law, which presents no ground for relief; certainly not under the circumstances shown by plaintiff himself: Rankin v. Mortimere, 7 Watts, 372; McAninch and Wife v. Laughlin, 13 Pa. 371; Peters v. Florence, 38 Pa. 194; Gross v. Leber, 47 Pa. 520; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Glidden v. Strupler, 52 Pa. 400, 405; Hunt v. Rousmaniere, 1 Peters, 1; Bank of United States v.

Fritz, 7 W. &amp; S. 201; Hunt v. Rousmaniere, 8 Wheaton, 174; Board of Commissioners of Hamilton Co. v. Owens, 37 N. E. Repr. 602.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">Equity will relieve where the deed does not conform to the real agreement: Stafford v. Giles, 135 Pa. 411; Kostenbader v. Peters, 80 Pa. 438; Wright v. Delafield, 23 Barb. (N. Y.) 498; Wanner v. Sisson, 29 N. J.

Liston, 192 Pa. 19; Stafford v. Giles, 135 Pa. 411. It is, however, a power to be exercised with great caution to avoid infringing upon the statute of frauds, and only in very clear cases, especially where parties are witnesses and the decree must rest even partially on their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">In the present case, however, the evidence is ample.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">We have in the first place the insertion of the unusual word \u201c surface \u201d in the grant, and the fact that it was interlined by the scrivener in the presence of the parties at the time of the execution of the deed. This in itself is evidence tending to show that something different from the ordinary conveyance of the whole land was in the contemplation of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-11\">This inference is corroborated by the positive testimony of the complainant and his brother that the bargain was for the land excepting the coal; the testimony of the scrivener that the deed bv his mistake was not written as it should have been on a blank containing a reservation of the coal, and that the word \u201c surface \u201d was interlined with the intention of supplying that omission; and the testimony of the scrivener and another witness, Lazarus, that the defendant on several subsequent occasions admitted that he had not bought the coal. Against this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>there is only the defendant\u2019s testimony that nothing was said about the coal and that the deed expressed the actual transaction. It is a perfectly clear case for reformation of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The decree, however, is somewhat too broad in form. There is no evidence that any minerals were intended to be reserved except the coal, or that there was to be any other variance from an ordinary conveyance of the fee. The new deed, therefore, which the decree directs the plaintiff to make and the defendant to accept, should not be for the surface only but in the ordinary form for the conveyance of the entire fee in the land, with a reservation of the coal in the usual form. The decree moreover should be made with an express saving of all intervening rights. So amended the decree is affirmed, costs to be paid by the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
