If money is demanded, the tenant is entitled to notice.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b174-7\">Where a tenant deducts from an instalment of rent certain expenses which he claims to have been incurred in litigation between himself and his landlord, and sends the balance, which is returned to him, and the landlord enters judgment on an ejectment clause in the lease for nonpayment of rent, the court cannot relieve against the forfeiture enforced by the landlord, since the tenant\u2019s attempt to collect his claim by deducting it from the rent is unwarranted.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b174-8\">Argued May 15, 1901.</otherdate>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"Auf\">Reargued May 12, 1902.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWu\">Appeal, No. 163, Jan.

Pershing a storeroom in Conn ells ville at the annual rental of $420, payable monthly. Trouble arose between the parties in regard to subletting, and the plaintiff instituted proceedings to recover possession of the premises for breach of condition as to subletting. The plaintiff recovered a judgment, but on a certiorari it was reversed. Other facts are stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-11\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order charging rule to set aside execution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b174-12\"><em>Edward </em>Campbell, with him <em>Greenwald &amp; </em>Mayer, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZF\">To relieve against forfeiture is one of the oldest and best established functions of a court of equity: Story on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 1315; Pittsburg, etc., R.

Three monthly instalments of rent were unpaid when judgment was entered, and on the hearing of the rule to open the judgment the only question before the court was whether the defendant had established any equitable ground for relief against the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">Five months before the judgment was entered, the plaintiff had instituted proceedings to recover possession of the premises for breach of a condition as to subletting, but had failed in her action. Before the proceedings were ended, the defendant sent checks for two instalments of rent which became due. These checks were returned with a statement that no rent would be received because of the litigation then pending. Three months\u2019 rent became due after the proceedings ended, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>From this amount the defendant deducted $24:50 for personal expenses incurred by him in attending to the litigation mentioned, and sent the plaintiff a check for the balance, with a statement that it was \u201c in full for three months\u2019 rent.\u201d The check was returned without comment. The same amount in money was afterwards sent by express, and it also was returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Under the circumstances a forfeiture would not be sustained because payment was tendered by check. Checks had been tendered on two prior occasions for monthly instalments, and had been refused, not because the tender was illegal, but for other reasons then stated. If money was demanded, the defendant was entitled to notice. Courts will relieve against forfeiture when the injured party has been misled, or an undue advantage has been taken of his reliance on a waiver of strict performance. But as to the amount to be paid and the duty to pay it, the defendant was not misled. His relation to the plaintiff was hostile, and he had no reason to expect indulgence. The return of the check was notice that his claim for expenses was not allowed. His attempt to collect the claim by deducting it from the rent was unwarranted, and by his persistence in it he placed himself in a position in which the court could give him no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The order discharging the rule is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
