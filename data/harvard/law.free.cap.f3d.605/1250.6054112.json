Because he could no longer work, Shaw submitted a claim to National Union Fire Insurance Company for \u201cpermanent total disability\u201d benefits under an insurance policy issued in Florida the previous year. After National Union denied Shaw\u2019s claim, he sued, and National Union removed the case to federal court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The question before us is whether the policy\u2019s definition of permanent <em>total disability </em>unambiguously made dismemberment, blindness, or paralysis a condition of Shaw\u2019s eligibility for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-14\">The question here turns on the meaning of the word <em>and </em>in two riders to Shaw\u2019s insurance policy, which promised him monthly and lump-sum benefits if he became \u201cpermanently totally disabled.\u201d The riders define that condition in substantively identical ways, and we reproduce the lump-sum rider\u2019s definition in its entirety here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-15\">Permanently Totally Disabled/Permanent Total Disability as used in this rider means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-16\">1. That the Insured has suffered any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-17\">a. loss of both hands or feet; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-18\">b. loss of one hand and one foot; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-19\">c. loss of sight in both eyes; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-20\">d. Hemiplegia;or; or [sic]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-21\">e. Paraplegia; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-22\">f. Quadriplegia</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-23\">\u201cLoss of a hand or foot\u201d means complete severance through or above the wrist or ankle joint. \u201cLoss of sight in both eyes\u201d means total and irrecoverable loss of the entire sight in both eyes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-24\">\u201cHemiplegia\u201d means the complete and irreversible paralysis of the upper and lower Limbs of the same side of the body. \u201cLimb(s)\u201d means entire arm or entire leg. \u201cParaplegia\u201d means the complete and irreversible paralysis of both lower Limbs. \u201cQuadriplegia\u201d means the complete and irreversible paralysis of both upper and both lower Limbs, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1247-25\">2. the Insured is permanently unable to perform the material and substantial duties of any occupation for which he or she is qualified by reason of education, experience or training. However, with respect to an Insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>for whom an occupational definition of Permanently Totally Disabled/Permanent Total Disability is not appropriate, Permanently Totally Disabled/Permanent Total Disability means, as used in this Rider, that the Insured is permanently unable to engage in any of the usual activities of a person of like age and sex whose health is comparable to that of the Insured immediately prior to the accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1248-4\">3. the Insured is under the supervision of a Physician unless the Insured has reached his or her maximum point of recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">The <em>and </em>that matters here is the one between numbered paragraphs 1 and 2. Shaw argues that the riders\u2019 punctuation, spacing, and context support a \u201cdisjunctive\u201d or \u201ccumulative\u201d reading of that <em>and. </em>In other words, Shaw argues that he was entitled to benefits as long as he satisfied the conditions in <em>either </em>paragraph 1 <em>or </em>paragraphs 2 and 3. By contrast, National Union contends that the <em>and </em>must be read \u201cconjunctively\u201d \u2014 in other words, that the policy required Shaw to satisfy the conditions in all three numbered paragraphs. Because Shaw concedes that he suffered none of the injuries listed in paragraph 1, National Union argues that he is ineligible for the policy\u2019s disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">The district court rejected Shaw\u2019s interpretation of the policy language as \u201cstrain[ed]\u201d and granted National Union\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shaw appeals, arguing that the district court should have construed the policy in favor of coverage because it was ambiguous. We review the district court\u2019s summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and interpret the terms of Shaw\u2019s insurance policy according to Florida law. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Steinberg, </em>393 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-11\">\u201cUnder Florida law, insurance contracts are construed according to their plain meaning. Ambiguities are construed against the insurer and in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>Taurus Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>913 So.2d 528, 532 (Fla.2005). But a policy provision is ambiguous only if \u201csusceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, one providing coverage and the [ ]other limiting coverage.\u201d <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Anderson, </em>756 So.2d 29, 34 (Fla.2000). And \u201cin construing insurance policies, courts should read each policy as a whole, endeavoring to give every provision its full meaning and operative effect.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-12\">We initially note that National Union\u2019s interpretation of the policy is a reasonable one. Shaw argues that the riders\u2019 suggestion, in paragraph 2, that \u201can occupational definition\u201d of <em>permanent total disability </em>may not always be \u201cappropriate\u201d implies that paragraph 1 contains its own, stand-alone definition of the term. Accordingly, Shaw contends that having satisfied the conditions of paragraphs 2 and 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>he is eligible for benefits without meeting the stand-alone requirements of paragraph 1. But the plain language of paragraph 2 draws a distinction between \u201can occupational definition\u201d and a \u201cusual activities\u201d definition of <em>permanent total </em>disability\u2014 not a distinction between paragraphs 1 and 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\">Shaw also argues that National Union\u2019s interpretation would conflict with the monthly rider\u2019s provision for the cessation of benefits payments if \u201cthe Insured ceases to be Permanently Totally Disabled.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> According to Shaw, because an insured could never cease to be irrevocably blind, irreversibly paralyzed, or an amputee, reading the conditions in all three numbered paragraphs as joint prerequisites to benefits eligibility would render the cessation provision superfluous. But despite the semantic awkwardness of the phrase \u201ceeas[ing] to be <em>Permanently </em>Totally Disabled\u201d (emphasis added), we find Shaw\u2019s argument on this point unpersuasive. Under National Union\u2019s interpretation of the policy, an insured must satisfy the requirements of all three paragraphs, and although a \u201cpermanently totally disabled\u201d insured could never regrow a lost arm, he could, in theory, regain the ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Our task, then, is to decide whether the <em>and </em>in question, read properly in the context of the policy as a whole, is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. In short, can the <em>and </em>between paragraphs 1 and 2 reasonably be read in a way that allows Shaw to qualify for benefits without being blind, dismembered, or paralyzed?</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">The parties\u2019 dispute here highlights a recurring problem: <em>\u201c[E]very </em>use of \u2018and\u2019 or \u2018or\u2019 as a conjunction involves <em>some </em>risk of ambiguity.\u201d Maurice B. Kirk, <em>Legal Drafting: The Ambiguity of \u201cAnd\u201d and \u201cOr\u201d 2 </em>Tex. Tech. L.Rev. 235, 253 (1971). As we have recognized in our cases, \u201c[i]t is an established principle] that \u2018the word \u201cor\u201d is frequently construed to mean \u201cand,\u201d and <em>vice versa, </em>in order to carry out the evident intent of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Noell v. Am. Design, Inc., </em>764 F.2d 827, 833 (11th Cir.1985) (quoting <em>Dumont v. United States, </em>98 U.S. 142, 143, 25 L.Ed. 65 (1878)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In other words, \u201cthere is more to \u2018and\u2019 than meets the eye.\u201d <em>OfficeMax, Inc. v. United States, </em>428 F.3d 583, 588 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-13\">The problem with <em>and </em>is that \u201cehameleonlike, it takes its color from its surroundings.\u201d <em>Peacock v. Lubbock Compress Co., </em>252 F.2d 892, 893 (5th Cir.1958).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>Specifically, it can be used either \u201cjointly\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>\u201c[both] A and B\u201d) or \u201cseverally\u201d <em>(e.g., </em>\u201cA and B [meaning A or B, or both]\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Kirk, <em>supra, </em>at 238 (citing Reed Dickerson, <em>The Fundamentals of Legal Drafting </em>77 (1965)). For example, when a person speaks broadly of \u201ccharitable and educational institutions,\u201d does she use <em>and </em>jointly (\u201cconjunctively\u201d in National Union\u2019s words) \u2014 to refer to individual institutions that are both charitable and educational\u2014 or severally (\u201cdisjunctively\u201d or \u201ccumulatively\u201d in Shaw\u2019s words) \u2014 to refer to all institutions that are either charitable or educational, but may also be both? <em>See id. </em>at 238-40.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That people sometimes use <em>and </em>to connect mutually exclusive concepts, as in the phrase, \u201cmedical and burial expenses,\u201d <em>of id. </em>at 238, only increases the potential for confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Yet the potential for confusion does not mean that every occurrence of the word <em>and </em>is ambiguous. On the contrary, the context in which the word appears often resolves any superficial uncertainty. In the phrase, \u201cmedical and burial expenses,\u201d for example, <em>and </em>is necessarily used severally: because no single expense can be both \u201cmedical\u201d and \u201cburial,\u201d interpreting <em>and </em>jointly would make no sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">The general rule in this circuit\u2014 and in Florida \u2014 is that \u201cunless the context dictates otherwise, the word \u2018and\u2019 is presumed to be used in its ordinary sense, that is, [jointly].\u201d <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Group v. United States, </em>408 F.3d 1328, 1332 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Crooks v. Harrelson, </em>282 U.S. 55, 58, 51 S.Ct. 49, 75 L.Ed. 156 (1930)); <em>see also Fla. Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Ass\u2019n v. Fla. Div. of Admin. Hearings, </em>686 So.2d 1349, 1355 (Fla.1997) (noting that courts may read <em>and </em>severally \u201cwhere legislative intent mandates it\u201d to avoid \u201cunreasonable, absurd results\u201d). Thus, in cases where we have read <em>and </em>severally, the context fairly could be said to have compelled that result. For instance, in <em>Noell v. American Design, </em>we considered two retirement plans under which an employee forfeited his accrued benefits \u201cif he compete[d] with the Employer ...; if he [was] determined ... to have been guilty of committing theft, fraud or embezzlement ...; <em>and </em>if he [was] determined ... to have disclosed or released to third parties the Employer\u2019s trade secrets.\u201d 764 F.2d at 829 (emphasis added). After considering the circumstances and the plan summaries provided to the employees, we held that the word <em>and </em>had to be read severally to effect the parties\u2019 intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-10\">For the forfeiture clause to have meaning [if <em>and </em>were read jointly], an employee would first have to be guilty of theft, fraud or embezzlement, he would then have to disclose or release to third parties the employer\u2019s trade secrets, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>then he would have to go to work for a competitor. It would be unreasonable to conclude that an employer, who has provided its employees with benefits in excess of those required by law, would place such an onerous burden on itself with respect to the termination of the benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 833. Similarly, in <em>Peacock v. Lubbock Compress Co., </em>252 F.2d at 893, we held that a several reading of the word <em>and </em>in the statutory phrase, \u201cthe ginning and compressing of cotton,\u201d was the only one that made any sense: \u201c[I]t is an acknowledged undisputed fact of the cotton industry that compressing is an operation entirely removed from ginning and that the two are never carried on together. To read [the phrase] literally <em>[i.e., </em>jointly] here is to read it out of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEGp\">We reached the opposite conclusion in <em>American Bankers, </em>408 F.3d 1328. There we interpreted a statute that defined <em>toll telephone service </em>as a service for which the charge \u201cvarie[d] in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252(b)(1). Without evidence supporting a several reading, we read the <em>and </em>jointly: \u201c[T]he provision requires that to come within the definition of \u2018toll telephone service\u2019 the rate must vary by <em>both </em>\u2018distance and elapsed transmission time.\u2019 \u201d 408 F.3d at 1334; <em>accord OfficeMax, </em>428 F.3d 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">In light of these authorities, we agree with National Union that the <em>and </em>in this case must be read jointly: Shaw cannot be \u201cpermanently totally disabled\u201d without suffering one of the injuries listed in paragraph 1. Despite Shaw\u2019s arguments regarding syntax and punctuation, we cannot say the context here \u201cdictates\u201d a several reading of <em>and. Am. Bankers, </em>408 F.3d at 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">We find each of Shaw\u2019s arguments against this conclusion unavailing. First, he argues that the period at the end of paragraph 1 in the lump-sum rider \u201cestablishes the disjunction between Paragraphs 1 and 2.\u201d But paragraph 1 contains a series of sentences separated by periods, and we do not believe that the inclusion of a similar period at the close of the paragraph\u2019s final sentence effects a \u201cdisjunctive\u201d break. In addition, because the final period does not appear in the monthly-benefit rider, Shaw\u2019s reading would have the two riders apply in different contexts. We will not assume from minor inconsistencies in punctuation that the parties intended two materially identical provisions of the same insurance policy to apply at different times.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">Shaw\u2019s second argument is that we implicitly held in <em>American Bankers </em>that the <em>and </em>separating two paragraphs in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4252(b) had a several meaning. The factual premise of this argument is correct, but the inference Shaw draws is not. Section 4252(b) defines <em>toll telephone service </em>as (1) a service for which the charge \u201cvaries in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time of each individual communication ... and\u201d (2) a service with a flat, periodic charge for unlimited calls. Because the <em>and </em>between subsections (1) and (2) connects two mutually exclusive concepts, we had to read it severally. <em>See OfficeMax, </em>428 F.3d at 591. By contrast, where the word has a natural and defensible joint reading \u2014 as in the phrase, \u201cvaries in amount with the distance and elapsed transmission time\u201d \u2014 we read it jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-9\"> Finally, Shaw argues that a joint reading of the <em>and </em>between paragraphs 1 and 2 would render National Union\u2019s policy inconsistent with \u201cstandard\u201d disability-insurance policies. But this is a red herring; the parties to an agreement are bound by the contract into which they enter, not according to the contractual ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>ligations of others. Although Florida law permits us to \u201cconsider established custom and usage in the insurance industry,\u201d <em>Auto-Owners, 756 </em>So.2d at 36, we will not make the parties to one contract abide by the terms of another.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Because Shaw has not suffered the dismemberment, blindness, or paralysis unambiguously required by his disability-insurance policy, we AFFIRM the summary judgment in National Union\u2019s favor.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1247-26\">. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(a), 1441(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">. The monthly-benefit rider's definition <em>o\u00a3 permanent total disability </em>differs from that of the lump-sum rider in three minor ways. First, the monthly rider does not contain the lump-sum rider\u2019s typographical errors (\";or; or\u201d) in paragraph 1(d). Second, the monthly-benefit rider lacks a period at the end of the last sentence in paragraph 1 (following \"Limbs\"). Finally, the monthly rider lacks the additional carriage return before the <em>and </em>separating paragraphs 1 and 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1248-13\">. In addition to the district court in this case, federal district courts in Texas and Wisconsin have concluded that similar definitions of <em>permanent total disability </em>require an insured to satisfy the conditions in all three paragraphs. <em>Tolbert v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>No. 3:08-CV-1112-N (N.D. Tex. June 24, 2009) (unpublished); <em>Nichols v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins.

The text of the relevant provision reads: \"The benefit is payable monthly as long as the Insured remains continuously Permanently Totally Disabled due to that Injury, but ceases on the earliest of: (1) the date the Insured ceases to be Permanently Totally Disabled. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">. Not all observers have celebrated the frequency of this principle's application. <em>See MacDonald, v. Pan Am.

One need only start the day with a breakfast of ham or eggs to be duly impressed by the difference. While \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018or\u2019 are both small words, and are occasionally seen joined with a slash, when they stand alone, they have substantially different meanings with dramatically different effects.

We eschew the parties\u2019 conjunctive-disjunctive dichotomy because of its potential to mislead.

OfficeMax, </em>428 F.3d at 600 (Rogers, J., dissenting) (\"In each sentence the word 'and' has the same <em>conjunctive </em>meaning \u2014 the difference lies in whether the preceding words are distributed over the conjoined elements or not.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1252-14\">.

Here, no evidence suggests that other insurers customarily define <em>permanent total disability </em>in a way that would more \"clearly\u201d effect National Union's interpretation of the policy. On the contrary, if the parties had intended Shaw's reading of the policy, they could have used the broader term <em>total disability. See </em>Fla.
