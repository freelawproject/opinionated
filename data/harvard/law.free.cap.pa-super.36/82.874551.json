S. Dimon,\u201d and indorsed on back thereof as follows: \u201cFor value received this note is assigned to Arlington C. Harvey. Columbus Food Company, D. N. Moore, M\u2019gr., August 27,1906.\u201d November 19, 1906, upon affidavit of defendant setting forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>in substance that the copy of instrument upon which suit was brought contained in plaintiff\u2019s statement was only a portion of the instrument signed by defendant. Rule was granted upon plaintiff to show cause why he should not file in the No. and Term of this action a full, true and correct copy of the original itself of this instrument alleged by the defendant to be only in part quoted in plaintiff\u2019s statement in the prothonotary\u2019s office as oyer of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-5\">November 24, 1906, this rule for oyer was discharged upon plaintiff\u2019s attorney delivering to the prothonotary to be impounded by him the original note \u2014 said prothonotary to retain custody of same until a copy of the original is deposited with prothonotary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-6\">The affidavit of defense filed December 3, 1906, with an amended affidavit filed December 31, 1906, claim to give a correct copy of the instrument executed by J. S. Dimon upon a portion of which as claimed by plaintiff\u2019s statement suit was instituted. This copy shows an order by J. S. Dimon to the Columbus Food Company for a bill of goods appended to which is the note a copy of which is contained in plaintiff\u2019s statement. This signature of J. S. Dimon being after the note which follows immediately after the order of bill of goods and is only signature of defendant to the paper. Following the note is what purports to be an agreement with defendant containing, instruction to said defendant how to sell the goods ordered and how to warrant and guarantee them and authorizing certain specific agreements with purchasers. This last agreement or instructions is signed only by Columbus Food Company, 115 Vine St., Columbus, Ohio, also the words \u201cCountermands not recognized. No agreements recognized unless in writing on this sheet.\u201d Also assignment to plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b125-7\">. The affidavit of defense avers an agreement made with the agent of the company at time he signed the written or printed paper whence he was appointed an agent of the Columbus Food Company, and on same day he and said agent agreed that said Dimon could countermand the order for goods and rescind contract at any time previous to June 1,1906; that said Dimon did on May 1, 1906, write a letter to Columbus Food <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Company rescinding and revoking the agreement, and ordering them not to ship any goods, notwithstanding which Columbus Food Company shipped goods to him which he refused to receive, and so notified company June 7,1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-4\">It was urged by plaintiff\u2019s attorney that this affidavit was not an answer to plaintiff\u2019s suit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-5\">1. Because the paper on which suit was a negotiable note passed, before due, to an innocent holder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\">2. ' That all the instrument alleged to be a portion of the written agreement of the parties by the defendant, taken- together, do not modify or change the legal effect of the paper signed by Dimon; taken as an entirety it remains a negotiable instrument and is not subject to any defense of the character set up in affidavit of defense when passed to an innocent holder for value before maturity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">The whole paper signed by Dimon and also signed by Columbus Food Company, by its agent, must be taken as an agreement between the parties either entire or partial, and in either case the entire paper is to be taken as the foundation of the suit. The defendant alleges that the entire paper does not contain all the agreement between the Columbus Food Company and himself, and that there were other agreements made between himself and the plaintiff company through its agent at the time of signing of this paper and subsequent to signing it, but on same day (and consequently before it was possible for the agent to have delivered it to the principal), which so modified the paper as to allow the defendant to rescind the agreement therein contained, and that he did rescind the said agreement before th\u00e9 time stated in plaintiff\u2019s narr of its transf\u00e9r to the present plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-8\">This affidavit in short alleges that the actual agreement between defendant and the agent of the Columbus Food Company was partly written and printed and partly verbal; and that the entire agreement gave him a right of rescission of contract, which he exercised before any rights under the contract vested in plaintiff.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-9\">These averments entitle the defendant to have the facts passed upon by a jury, especially as there are expressions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the written instrument which passed to plaintiff which might be construed to indicate that the writing did not contain the entire contract between defendant and the Columbus Food Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">It was claimed by attorney for defendant at the time of the argument of this rule, that the order of court as to the custody of the original instrument by the prothonotary' did not. make the paper a part of the files, and therefore his right of oyer was not protected by said order, and asked that the original rule as to oyer should be reinstated. Plaintiff\u2019s attorney stated that if the court was of opinion that defendant was entitled to have a copy of instrument made part of record he would consent that the original now impounded in hands of prothonotary be filed in the case. It is therefore ordered that the original paper impounded in custody of the prothonotary be marked by him filed and made a part of the record in this case. And the rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of sufficient affidavit of defence, is hereby discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court discharging the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense..</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-7\"><em>W.

They are fully set forth in the opinion of the court below, refusing judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. Assuming that that opinion will be brought into the report of the case, we content ourselves with a simple allusion to the main facts, so as to make our opinion intelligible in connection with that of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The use, by the plaintiff in his declaration, of one out of four distinct parts of which the instrument, upon which suit was founded, was finally found to consist, was certainly, to say the least, disingenuous and misleading. It strengthens the suspicion, which a careful reading of the whole instrument arouses, that it was specially designed for such a use.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The instrument, however, remains entire and intact and conveyed to the plaintiff, who alleges that he1 is an innocent holder for value before maturity, full knowledge of all the facts which fixed the liability of the defendant, and of which he could have taken advantage, if the obligation had remained in the hands of the original holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">It is clear that the third part of the paper, variously called <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>a \u201cwarranty\u201d and a \u201cguaranty\u201d on the part of the Columbus Food Co., if the facts therein contemplated had arisen in such a way as to create a liability on its part, would have entitled the defendant to a defense to the payment of the second part of the paper, which is in the shape of a promissory note, as contained in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, at least to the extent which he may have suffered pecuniarily in warranting and guaranteeing the food, ordered in the first part of the paper, to customers, as directed in the said warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The fourth part of the paper is as follows: \u201cNo agreement recognized, unless in writing on this sheet.\u201d This, however, is signed only by \u201cStallsmith, salesman,\u201d and is not signed by the defendant. Unless, therefore, he distinctly assented to it at the time of the execution of the paper, we cannot see that he would be bound thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The defendant does not deny the execution of the agreement upon which the present action is founded. He claims, however, that certain representations were made by the agent who secured his signature which induced the execution of the agreement, and without which he would not have signed it, and that, in pursuance of those representations, he subsequently orally rescinded it. Under all our authorities, evidence is admissible to establish these facts. Among the latter ones are Machin v. Prudential Trust Co., 210 Pa. 253; American Harrow Co. v. Swoope, 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 451; Wheatley v. Niedich, 24 Pa. Superior Ct. 198; Keeler v. DeWitt, 24 Pa. Superior Ct. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Whether or not they shall be established will be a question for the jury. We are clearly of the opinion that, under the allegations of the affidavit of defense, the defendant should have an opportunity to establish them.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">The present holder of the agreement (the plaintiff in this action) took it with full notice of its contents. Independently, therefore, of the provisions of our negotiable instruments Act of May 16,1901, P. L. 194, we are of the opinion that the agreement upon which this suit is founded in its entirety is not a negotiable instrument and under sec. 196 of said act is governed by the rules of the law merchant.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">For the reasons herein stated, we are of opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>plaintiff is in no better situation than would have been the original holder \u2014 the Columbus Food Company \u2014 and, as to the latter, if the defendant clearly established the facts set forth in his affidavit of defense, he would have had a valid defense to the payment of that portion of the agreement which is denominated \u201cthe note.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
