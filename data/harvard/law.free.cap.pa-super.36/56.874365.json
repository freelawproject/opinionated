J., filed the following-opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-4\">This case does not come within the line of cases which have given appellants additional time for the taking of an appeal from a justice of the peace after the expiration of twenty days.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">The undisputed facts in this case are that the defendant appeared at the suit before the justice of the peace, offered'no testimony and, as stated by the defendant in his answer, \u201cthat' after hearing the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the said defendant offering no evidence, and after the hearing of the said suit had en-' tirely come to an end, the said defendant, accompanied by his counsel, left the office of the said justice of the peace, without' any word being said or act done by the said justice of the peace in regard to the entry of any judgment on the said twenty-first day of June, A. D. 1907.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">About ten days after that defendant\u2019s counsel, upon inquiry made of the justice, learned that judgment had been entered on June 21, 1907. There was no reason why the defendant could not have inquired of the justice what he intended to do, before he left the justice\u2019s office. The justice was not obliged upon the instant after the evidence closed, to announce publicly the judgment. His record does show that he entered judgment publicly on June 21, and it was easily within the power of the defendant to have learned that fact by inquiry, and the facts do not warrant the neglect of the defendant to take the appeal when, he did ascertain that judgment had been entered against him. He had then ten days in which to take it, and we fail to find anything either upon the record, or in the defendant\u2019s answer, which would excuse his action and warrant the court in extending the time asked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">And now, December 9, 1907, for the reasons above stated, the rule to show cause why the appeal should not be quashed and stricken from the record, is made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-9\"><em>Rogers L. Burnett, </em>for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuO\">Under the circumstances, the time for appeal runs from the end of ten days, or from the date of notice of judgment, if such notice be given before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>ten days expire: Boyd v. Ward, 10 Pa. C. C. Rep. 9; Hoffner v. Kottka, 2 Pearson, 360; Taylor v. Smith, 2 Clark, 318; Haines v. Townsend, 1 Chester County Rep. 146; Imler v. Houser, 1 Pa. C. C.
