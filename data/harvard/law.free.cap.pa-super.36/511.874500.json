I think I will say to you, gentlemen, that if you find for the plaintiff he will be entitled to the monthly pay which he was to receive and interest from the date at which they were due until the date cf your verdict. Not entitled to interest due, but that you may allow him anything up to six per cent for its detention. Not interest, as we said a moment ago. That was a slip. But you may allow him anything up to six per cent by way of its detention. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-12\">17. It is admitted that the plaintiff was to receive $900 for the school year of nine months, and was to board himself outside of the institution. He has- received $140, so that the amount of your verdict will be the difference between $140 he received and $900, which is $760, with interest on same. <em>Answer: </em>That is affirmed if you find for the plaintiff. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-13\">Defendant presented this point:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b550-14\">1. The acceptance of the check of November 19, 1904, marked \u201cin full,\u201d is to be treated as an accord and satisfaction, and there can be no recovery in this case. <em>Answer: </em>This is refused. That is a question for the jury under all the evidence. That point means this, gentlemen: You will remember that when the final check of $50.00 was given to the plaintiff it had on it \u201cin full,\u201d and the defendant asks us to say to you, as a matter of law, that receiving that check in full was an acknowledgment that that was all that was due him, and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>therefore, you will not be permitted to find in his favor.' 'We submit that question to you. As the court remembfersy that-transaction was something like this: After the plaintiff-had' been informed that his services were no longer needed, or was discharged, that Dr. Delurey tendered to him in cash, if T remember, notes, $50.00, and requested him to sign a receipt'in full, and that the doctor then or soon after, the court does not' recollect how soon after, handed him this check to his order-marked \u201cin full.\u201d He says when he went to use it \u2014 I am not1 sure just when he discovered it, but before he used it he marked on the back of it, \u201cin full to November 19, 1904,\u201d indorsed his name on it and drew the money from the bank. Now, it will be for you to say whether he did receive that check in full payment or not. You will remember that he refused to sign a receipt in full, and took the check, and he says, if I remember, because of his circumstances he could not wait and had to have the money, and he indorsed this on the back and drew the money, so that it will be for you to say whether under all the evidence in the case he did accept that check in full.

Pusey, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Aum\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">This suit was brought by the plaintiff to recover the balance due on a contract made with the defendant, for services to be rendered as a teacher of languages in the defendant college, at a salary of $900 for the school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">After rendering services for two months, and after receiving $140 in money, the plaintiff was discharged, the reason for such action by the college being that he was inefficient. The circumstances attending his discharge were described by the president of the college as follows: \u201cIn view of the fact that I had discovered him to be inefficient, I felt that was the termination, or cause for the termination of the verbal contract into which we entered in New York, and/ secondly, paying him in full for the time, on the basis of the year, paying him for the time he was there, I felt that I was giving him all that was justly due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The last payment of $50.00, was paid by a check dated November 19,1904, drawn to the plaintiff\u2019s order, and marked \u201cin full,\u201d which was paid November 23, 1904, and which on examination 'by the maker was discovered to be indorsed \u201cIn full to date, Nov, 19, 1904.\u201d The form of this indorse-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>meat was not known by the defendant until some time' after the check had been paid. At the time the check was given, payment in money was demanded by the plaintiff and refused because it was accompanied by a demand that the plaintiff should sign a receipt in full for all demands. The check was accepted under protest and the plaintiff alleges, that having no other source of income he was obliged to have it cashed, and, further, that he made an honest effort to secure other employment within the term mentioned in his contract, and failed. So that during that time he did not earn a penny. His claim was for the difference between $900, the annual salary, and $140 which he received, or $760 with interest. The verdict was for $460 in his favor. After a full review of the law and the facts, the court refused a motion for a new trial, as well as a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\">It does not appear that any complaint or objection was made to the plaintiff\u2019s performance of his contract until the day of his discharge, hence he was entitled to the amount of money represented by the check, whether he remained in the institution or not. His right to recover in this action is independent of his right to receive the $50.00 then paid to him. No services were rendered after that payment, and there is no question of a compromise of a disputed claim, or of an actual acceptance of a smaller sum as an accord and satisfaction: Martin v. Frantz, 127 Pa. 389. In Benseman v. Insurance Company, 13 Pa. Superior Ct. 363, the effect to be given to a check or receipt marked with the words.\u201cin full\u201d is elaborately considered, and the principles of law there announced are applicable to the present case. There was no relation of trust or confidence between the parties. There was a controversy between them. They were dealing at arm\u2019s length. The plaintiff was loath to leave the employment. The defendant insisted that he should do so on account of his inefficiency. There was no attempt to adjust the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the balance of the year. The check given him, marked \u201cin full\u201d has no special significance other than the interpretation put upon it by the plaintiff\u2019s indorsement, \u201cin full to Nov. 19, 1904,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>there is not a suggestion in this record that he accepted and used it with any other view than that it was a payment in full for services rendered to that date. There was no explanation as to what the term \u201cIn full\u201d signified, and in the absence of such explanation, the meaning was properly left to the jury: Rhoads\u2019s Estate, 189 Pa. 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">As said by the court, \u201cWhat his understanding about it was, will be for the jury to say under the circumstances, whether he took it in full.\u201d The making of the contract and its partial performance are not in dispute, the defense being limited to its claim of the plaintiff\u2019s inefficiency, and the right to discharge him for that reason. In this, the burden of proof was on the defendant to satisfy the jury that its reason for discharging the plaintiff was good; this fact having been fully submitted, as presented in the third assignment of error, it must be considered as properly determined against the defendant. And so, too, the court properly and fairly submitted to the jury the question of the plaintiff\u2019s efforts to secure employment during the balance of the year, and his duty to procure other service if he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The employment was for a determinate period, and if th\u00e9 plaintiff was improperly dismissed before the term of service had expired \u2014 and this fact was so determined by the verdict\u2014 the plaintiff was prima facie entitled to recover the stipulated compensation for the whole term if it appears that he honestly endeavored to secure employment during that period and as honestly failed: King v. Steiren, 44 Pa. 99; Wilke v. Harrison Bros. &amp; Co., 166 Pa. 202; McDowell\u2019s Appeal, 123 Pa. 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The jury was specially cautioned not to allow interest as such on the plaintiff\u2019s claim, if they found in his favor, but was instructed \u201cyou may allow him anything up to six per cent by way of its detention,\u201d which, in the light of the verdict, was not harmful to the defendant. In this there was no error. The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
