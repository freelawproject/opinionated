On Chambersburg street and the Springs Hotel road from the Public Square to the borough limits. And on Washington street and the Taneytown road from the Philadelphia and Reading railroad station to the borough limits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-5\">This electric railroad was constructed on positions of said streets in the borough of Gettysburg in compliance with the provisions of the ordinance of July 31, 1891, and other ordinances passed by said borough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-6\">The conditions of these ordinances are largely immaterial to our present inquiry and we need mention but few of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-7\">The rail used in the construction of this railroad is known as the \u201cT\u201d rail, and the guage of the railway is four feet eight and one-half inches.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-8\">The company is required to pike the portions of all the streets included between rails of its tracks and also two feet on both sides with such crushed stone or other material made firm and solid with heavy rollers as shall be satisfactory to the committee on streets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-9\">The said company is also obliged to save and keep the borough of Gettysburg harmless from any damage that may be done to persons, corporations or property by reason of - the construction and operation of said railway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-10\">On July 2, 1895, the following ordinance of the borough of Gettysburg was duly approved: \u201cThat all street railway companies which now occupy or which may hereafter occupy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>or acquire the right to occupy any of the streets, avenues or public thoroughfares of the borough of Gettysburg, shall within thirty days from the passage of this ordinance, and annually thereafter, before the 1st day of June, pay an annual license fee of $50 for each and every car run or propelled along or upon the streets, avenues or public thoroughfares aforesaid, and each car so run or propelled shall be numbered apd have its number painted in a conspicuous place and a certificate of license duly numbered shall be hung in each.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-3\">For years the defendant company and its predecessor in title have paid this license.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-4\">At the request of the defendant company, the town council, in 1904, as appears by their minutes, passed a certain resolution whereby the enforcement of the above-mentioned ordinance was so modified that but $50.00 per year was to be paid on three cars each only and $1.00 per day on each car above three run on any one day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-5\">This is all the fee now sought to be collected by the borough under the ordinance of June 2, 1895, as modified by their subsequent action, and, as before stated, $50.00 each for three cars, and $1.00 for an additional car used during the year, is all that is sought to be recovered in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-6\">The defendant company has six cars which it owns and to some extent operates. They are all unusually heavy and large cars, having considerably more carrying capacity than the ordinary trolley cars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-7\">This may be said to be purely an excursion railroad, transporting tourists over the streets of Gettysburg to and from the battlefield.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-8\">It is operated only one-half the year from about May 30th to November. During the balance of the year there is no. pretense of operation, and the borough is left with the annoyance of tracks, poles and wires, without any compensating public service in any way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b639-9\">During the summer and fall months, 'the road at times is operated to its full capacity to meet the demand of big days and excursions which are not unfrequent here. At times the road is entirely unable to accommodate the demand of visitors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>and then but one car a day will be run upon a regular schedule, passing a given point at intervals of one hour.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-4\">The uncertain and spasmodic running of this railway, in our opinion, requires at least as careful supervision on the part of the borough in the interests of the public, as if it were continually and regularly operated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-5\">The defendant company made regular examination and inspection of its cars, tracks, poles and wires.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-6\">The liability of the defendant company to keep the streets through which their tracks run in proper condition was looked after by the highway committee of the council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-7\">It does not appear that the borough authorities made any regular inspection tour of the cars of the company. In fact, they made no such inspection. It does appear, however, and we so find \u2014 that the cars of the company stop at the Eagle Hotel in the borough as a kind of station. That during the year for which this license fee is charged they also stopped at times at the two different railroad stations in the town, and this, on big days, caused or helped to cause a blocking of the crowd and vehicles at these places, requiring the employment by the borough of extra police for the supervision and control of the same and the safe and proper handling of the cars of said company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-8\">The evidence in this case might not justify us in finding that from June 1, 1904, to June 1,1905, the borough of Gettysburg actually expended the sum of $151 in the inspection and supervision of the cars, tracks, etc., of this company, but we are clearly of the opinion that such an amount might reasonably and fairly be expended, in such a careful and thorough inspection and supervision of this railway, as it is the duty of the borough of Gettysburg to exercise for the safety of its citizens and the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-9\">We refuse to find that the ordinance of June 2, 1895, modified as it has been by the action of council, to an annual fee of $50.00 for each of three cars and an additional $1.00 per day for one car used in excess of three (when but $1.00 for an entire year is charged for an additional car) is an unreasonable ordinance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Some informalities in reference to the action of council were referred to on the argument, but we understand none of them are now proved, and that the question of the reasonableness of the ordinance as modified and now only sought to be enforced, is now before us.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-5\">It is admitted that the borough ordinance imposing a license fee on the cars of the defendant company, such as is involved in this suit, would be void as a mere revenue measure, and can be sustained only as an exercise of-the police power which is inherent in all municipalities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-6\">But \u201ccertainly if a municipal regulation is adopted which would be lawful if intended for one purpose and unlawful if intended for another, the presumptiqn is that the purpose was lawful, unless the contrary clearly appears: Johnson v. Philadelphia, 60 Pa. 445. And the employment of special police at certain times by the borough to control the crowd and supervise the running of the defendant\u2019s cars is an affirmance of this presumption.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-7\">There being nothing in the testimony before us to justify a removal of this presumption, the ordinance in question must be treated as intended and passed by the borough authorities in the exercise of their police powers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-8\">It is also admitted that the exercise of this police power by the borough to be valid, must impose only a reasonable fee for police inspection and supervision. \u2022&gt; \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-9\">But the unreasonableness of the fee necessary to make void an ordinance so enacted, must be so clearly apparent as to demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the part of the municipal authorities. The amount of the license fee rests in the first instance with the borough, and it is only where discretion is abused that the courts are justified in interfering: North Braddock Borough v. Traction Co., 8 .Pa. Superior Ct. 233; New Hope Borough v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 306; Kittanning Electric Light, Heat and Power Co. v. Kittanning Boro., 11 Pa. Superior Ct. 31.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-10\">The elements which enter into the question of the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>ableness of the fee are the necessary or probable expenses incident to the issuing of the license and the probable expense of proper inspection, regulation and police surveillance. The measure of the reasonableness of the charge is not the amount annually expended by the borough in a particular year: Taylor Boro. v. Postal Tel. &amp; Cable Co., 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 344.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-4\">If it were possible to know in advance the exact cost of a proper supervision of the defendant company, that would constitute the proper limit of the fee, but in the nature of things that is impossible and \u201cso the municipality is at liberty to make the charge large enough to carry any reasonable anticipated expense. It is authorized to fix such charge in advance and need not wait until the end of the period for which the license is granted. It may not act arbitrarily or unreasonably, but the risk may rightfully be cast upon the licensee, and the charge cannot be avoided because it subsequently appears that it was somewhat in excess of the actual expense of the supervision:\u201d Schellsburg v. W. U. Tel. Co., 26 Pa. Superior Ct. 343.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-5\">The decision of the supreme court of the United States, in Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. New Hope Borough, decided in 1904, in which the judgment of the Supreme Court of this state affirming the judgment of our Superior Court, which had affirmed the common pleas in giving judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defens,e, was reversed; as well as the case of the United Telephone, etc., Co. v. Borough of Carlisle, 31 Pa. C. C. Rep. 481, and other cases decided by our Superior Court in reference to companies engaged in interstate commerce, since the above decision by the supreme court of the United States \u2014 we feel are not controlling as to the case in hand, because the defendant company is a purely local company, incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, is doing a purely local business, and is not engaged in interstate commerce in any way.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b642-6\">Where a federal question is involved the decision of the supreme court of the United States must undoubtedly control, but upon all questions of purely state law, the decisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania are alone of binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>authority: Kittanning Boro. v.

Such repairing is a duty on the part of the borough which does not pertain to the exercise of its police power: Secs. 2 and 4 of Act of assembly approved April 3, 1851, P.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Section 2 of the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 109, provides that \u201cthe decision of the court shall be in writing, stating separately and distinctly the facts found, the answers to any points submitted in writing by counsel and the conclusions of law.\u201d Failure to conform substantially to these requirements, if assigned for error, is ground for reversal. But we are unable to agree with appellant\u2019s counsel that they were not observed by the learned trial judge in the present case. It is not clear that the points were not virtually answered in the court\u2019s general findings and conclusions. See Commonwealth v. Monongahela Bridge Company, 216 Pa. 108. But be that as it may, the court cured the irregularity, if any, by answering then specifically when the objection was raised by the exceptions first filed, and giving opportunity to file exceptions to its answers. The findings of fact, while not numbered, are stated in separate paragraphs, and with sufficient regard to formality. Then, after discussion of legal principles applicable to the case, and citation of pertinent authorities, the court set forth in a distinct paragraph, and in such form that it could not be misunderstood, a conclusion of law, which, if correct, would sustain a judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favor for the amount therein directed. The fact that a judge\u2019s discussion of the pertinent' legal'principles and authorities does not follow, but precedes, his statement of the final conclusion or conclusions of law is not ground for valid objection to the form of the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">It is argued that the ordinance is invalid because there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>allusion therein to police inspection or regulation. But the learned judge properly held that this is not ground for holding that it was adopted for revenue purposes and not as a police measure. The regulation of matters affecting the public through the medium of a license fee, or, as sometimes called, a license tax, is a recognized exercise of the police power, and it is settled by decisions relating directly to such ordinances as that now under consideration that if a municipal regulation is adopted, which would be lawful if intended for one purpose and unlawful if intended for another, the presumption is that the purpose was lawful, unless the contrary clearly appears: Johnson v. Philadelphia, 60 Pa. 445; Oil City v. Oil City Trust Co., 151 Pa. 454; Lansdowne Borough v. Springfield Water Co., 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">It is contended further that the burden of proving the reasonableness of the ordinance, and particularly the reasonableness of the license fee, was on the plaintiff. But the exact contrary has been held in numerous cases. The rule that should govern the exercise of the power to revise the action of municipal authorities, conferred upon the courts by the Act of April 17, 1905, P. L. 183, need not be considered in this case. But in an action, such as this is, to recover a license fee, the rule is definitely settled by the decisions that the courts will not declare the ordinance void because of the alleged unreasonableness of the fee charged, unless the unreasonableness be so clearly apparent as to demonstrate an abuse of discretion on the part of the municipal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Considerable stress is laid by defendant\u2019s counsel on the fact that the borough through its officers and agents did not inspect the cars of the defendant company. But it is to be borne in mind that the annual license fee for which the action was brought is not a property tax, and that the police purpose for which it was imposed, presumably, included more than a mere periodic inspection of the cars. Such' fee has been spoken of as a specific charge to meet the entire expense of the duty of regulation, inspection and supervision cast upon the municipality with respect to the manner in which the company is exercising its privilege: Kittanning Borough v. Consolidated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Natural Gas Co., 219 Pa. 250; Pottsville Borough v. Pottsville Gas Co., 33 Pa. Superior Ct. 480. It is to be borne in mind, further, that while evidence as to the action of the borough during the year for which the license fee in suit was demanded was admissible for some purposes, yet the fact that the borough neglected some part of its supervisory duty during the year is not, standing alone, a bar to an action to recover a reasonable license fee for a particular year which was due and collectible at the beginning of the year: West Conshohocken Borough v. Conshohocken Electric Light <em>&amp; </em>Power Co., 29 Pa. Superior Ct. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The defendant offered to show that throughout the year for which the license fee of $50.00 a year for each of three cars, and $1.00 a day for each additional car, was demanded in this action, there was another ordinance in force whereby electric railway companies, and other companies having poles carrying overhead wires, were required to pay to the borough \u201cas a license fee for the inspection of the same and for the ground occupied by the poles an annual sum of fifty cents for each pole.\u201d We are not satisfied with the reason assigned by counsel for objecting to this offer. They say that it was irrelevant to the question before the court, which was the reasonableness of the \u201clicense tax for the cars of the company.\u201d But the proper determination of that question depended upon the question whether the charge was imposed for mere inspection of the cars, or was intended to meet the entire expense of the duty of regulation, inspection and supervision cast upon the borough with respect to the manner in which the company is exercising its privileges. It was upon the latter theory that the learned court proceeded in arriving at the conclusion that the amount of the charge \u201cmight reasonably and fairly be expended, in such a careful and thorough inspection and supervision of this railway as it is the duty of the borough of Gettysburg to exercise for the safety of its citizens and the public.\u201d From this and.other portions of the learned judge\u2019s findings and conclusions it is fairly to be inferred, that in determining the reasonableness of the fee he took into consideration theexpense to the borough incident to proper inspection and super<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>vision of the poles as well as of the other parts of the railway. But a license fee which might be reasonable, if intended to cover the probable expense incident to proper police supervision and inspection of the railway and its operation as a whole, might be excessive and unreasonable when considered in connection with the fact that under another ordinance an additional license fee is exacted for the inspection and supervision of a part of the railway, as, for example, the poles and wires. We are of opinion that the evidence should be admitted, and, unless its bearing on the case is explained away in some manner not now appearing, that it should be considered in determining the reasonableness of the license fee in suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The remaining inquiry that we deem necessary to notice particularly is as to the admissibility of evidence to the effect, that in consequence of the occupation of the streets by the railway tracks, and of the kind of rails used, the great burden of travel is cast upon the sides of the streets, and this increases the cost to the borough of repairing and maintaining them. The question stated broadly is, whether the probable additional cost to the borough of maintaining and keeping in repair the portions, outside the tracks, of the streets on which an electric railway is lawfully operated, under municipal consent, may be included in the license fee imposed by the municipality in the exercise of its police power. In the numerous cases in which the limits of the power of municipalities in this regard have been considered, it has been generally held that the elements which enter into the charge are the necessary or probable expense of such inspection, regulation and police surveillance as municipalities may lawfully give to the erection and maintenance of the appliances which individuals and corporations may acquire the right to introduce and maintain, upon and under the surface of the public highways: Pottsville Borough v. Pottsville Gas Co., 33 Pa. Superior Ct. 480 and cases there cited. It appears in the present case that municipal consent was given to the defendant company upon certain conditions, \u2014 inter alia, to keep in repair the portion of the street between the rails and a certain space on either side. The court properly held that for failure to comply with these conditions the remedy of the bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>ough was upon its contract. It seems equally clear that a direct attempt to impose on the defendant the duty of repairing the street outside the limits covered by those conditions could not succeed, and if the municipality could not do that directly, except by making it a condition upon which its consent was given, it is impossible to see how it could do it indirectly by making the annual license fee sufficiently large to cover the probable cost of such repair. This would introduce an element into such charge which has not heretofore been recognized as entering into it \u2014 an element, too, which it is not necessary to introduce in order to indemnify the borough against loss by reason of its expenditure in the exercise of the police power, upon which, alone, ordinances imposing such charges are sustained. The learned judge admitted the kind of evidence we are now considering with evident hesitation, and at the same time said that he would pass later upon the question whether it should be considered by the court on the question of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the ordinance. It does not clearly appear in his findings and conclusions that he did consider it; indeed, there is some ground for inferring that he did not. But, on the other hand, he does not expressly say that he wholly excluded it from consideration. To say the least, there is not absolute certainty with regard to the matter. The uncertainty is to some extent increased by the fact that the admission of the testimony was the subject of two of the exceptions to the decision of the court and that in entering final judgment no allusion was made to them. Under the circumstances we feel constrained to sustain the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
