The \"inherent defect\" exception to a carrier\u2019s COGSA liability, \u00a7 1304(2)(m) was not proved by the testimony that the chemical has a natural tendency to form peroxides when exposed to oxygen. Here, the uncontradicted testimony was that the chemical was properly treated by an inhibitor and protected from oxygenization by a nitrogen blanket during shipment and, thus, should not have formed peroxides. In order to establish this exception to COGSA liability, the carrier must show (as it did not here) some defect, quality, or vice adhering to the individual cargo of the chemical in question. <em>Horn v. Cia de Navegacion Fruco, S.A., </em>404 F.2d 422, 435 (5th Cir.1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b345-20\">TATE, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b345-21\">The plaintiff, The Quaker Oats Company (\u201cQuaker Oats\u201d), appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of its claim under the Carriage of Goods by the Sea Act (\u201cCOG-SA\u201d), 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1300-1315, for damages to a cargo of tetrahydrofuran, a white chemical, shipped aboard the M/V Torvan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ger, a vessel owned by Westfal Larsen and Company (\u201cWestfal Larsen\u201d), made defendants herein. Quaker Oats contends that the district court erred as a matter of law in finding that Westfal Larsen, the defendant carrier, had successfully rebutted the shipper Quaker Oats\u2019 prima facie case, thus shifting the burden of proof back to Quaker Oats, without explaining the cause of the loss. Finding that the court did err in applying the COGSA burden-shifting scheme, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Quaker Oats purchased approximately five hundred metric tons of tetrahydrofuran from Mitsubishi Corporation of Tokyo, Japan (\u201cMitsubishi\u201d). Mitsubishi chartered the Torvanger to transport the tetrahydrofuran from Kobe, Japan to Houston, Texas. Analysis of a composite of samples of the tetrahydrofuran taken after the cargo had been loaded on the vessel in Kobe, Japan indicated that the peroxide content was well within commercially acceptable levels. Samples taken upon the Torvanger\u2019s arrival in Houston from the three tanks aboard the vessel in which the chemical was carried, however, revealed peroxide contamination in one of the tanks beyond commercially acceptable levels. Quaker Oats sued the Torvanger and Westfal Larsen, asserting rights under COGSA for recovery of expenses incurred in purging the peroxide from the tetrahydrofuran.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-19\">Both parties agree that this dispute is governed by COGSA, which regulates the rights and liabilities arising out of the carrier\u2019s issuance of a bill of lading with respect to cargo damage or loss.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cTo enforce their respective rights under the Act, litigants must engage in the ping-pong game of burden shifting mandated by Sections 3 and 4. [46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1303 and 1304].\u201d <em>Nitram, Inc. v. Cretan Life, </em>599 F.2d 1359, 1373 (5th Cir.1979). The plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by proving that the cargo for which the bill of lading issued was \u201cloaded in an undamaged condition, and discharged in a contaminated condition.\u201d <em>Socony Mobil Oil Company v. Texas Coastal and International, Inc., </em>559 F.2d 1008, 1010 (5th Cir.1977). The \u201cbill of lading shall be prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods as therein described.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">Once the plaintiff has presented a prima facie case, \u201cthe carrier then has the burden of proving that it exercised due diligence to prevent the damage or that the harm was occasioned by one of the excepted causes delineated in 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2).\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Blasser Brothers, Inc. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Northern Pan-American Line, </em>628 F.2d 376, 381 (5th Cir.1980); <em>accord Nitram, Inc. v. Cretan Life, supra, </em>599 F.2d at 1373; <em>Socony Mobil Oil Company, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 1010; <em>Nichimen Company, Inc. v. M/V Farland, </em>462 F.2d 319, 325 (2nd Cir.1972). <em>See also </em>2A Benedict on Admiralty \u00a7 56 (7th ed. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">If the carrier rebuts the plaintiffs prima facie case with proof of an excepted cause listed in \u00a7 4(2)(a)-(p) of COGSA, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(a)-(p), the burden returns to the plaintiff to establish that the carrier\u2019s negligence contributed to the damage or loss. <em>Blasser Brothers, Inc. v. Northern Pan-American Line, supra, </em>628 F.2d at 382; <em>Cf. Lekas &amp; Drivas, Inc. v. Goulandris, </em>306 F.2d 426, 432 (2nd Cir.1962). If the plaintiff is then able to establish that the carrier\u2019s negligence was a contributory cause of the damage, the burden shifts to the carrier \u201cto segregate the portion of the damage due to the excepted cause from that portion resulting from [the carrier\u2019s] own negligence.\u201d <em>Nitram, Inc. v. Cretan Life, supra, </em>599 F.2d at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In addition to rebuttal of the prima facie case by proof of one of the specific exception causes of cargo damage, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(a)-(p), the carrier may also rebut the prima facie case by relying on the catch-all exception in \u00a7 1304(2)(q) of COG-SA, which provides that the carrier may exonerate himself from loss from any cause other than those listed in 4(2)(a)-(p) by proving that the loss or damage occurred \u201cwithout the actual fault and privity of the carrier....\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(q). The carrier\u2019s burden of establishing \u201chis own freedom from contributing fault ... is no mere burden of going forward with evidence, but a real burden of persuasion, with the attendant risk of nonpersuasion.\u201d Gilmore and Black, The Law of Admiralty \u00a7 3-37 at p. 168; \u00a7 3-43 (2nd ed. 1975). Consequently, the burden of proof does not return to the plaintiff, but rather judgment must hinge upon the adequacy of the carrier\u2019s proof that he was free from any fault whatsoever contributing to the damage of the goods entrusted to his carriage. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">The district court in this case found that Quaker Oats had established a prima facie case by producing evidence that the tetrahydrofuran was \u201cwithin purchase order specifications\u201d upon delivery to the Torvanger and that \u201cat least a portion of it was no longer in that condition when tendered to [Quaker Oats]\u201d after shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-18\">In rebuttal to that prima facie case, the carrier Westfal Larsen produced evidence by which peroxide formation could allegedly be considered an \u201cinherent vice\u201d of tetrahydrofuran, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(m), and that due diligence was exercised by Westfal Larsen to avoid any other possible causes of peroxide formation. Though finding the evidence on the \u201cinherent vice\u201d exception to be \u201cnon-dispositive,\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court found that Westfal Larsen success<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>fully rebutted Quaker Oats prima facie case by producing evidence of due diligence \u201cwith respect to the preparation of the loading and storage equipment, the loading of the cargo, and the care of the cargo during voyage <em>...\u201d </em>thus, \u201creturning] to Quaker Oats the burden to show that the peroxide formation was caused at least in part by [Westfal Larsen\u2019s] negligence.\u201d Finding that the shipper Quaker Oats failed to carry the burden, the district court rendered judgment for Westfal Larsen, the defendant carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Before explaining the error in the district court\u2019s application of the COGSA burden-shifting scheme, the nature of the chemical shipped and the reasons for its peroxide contamination should be noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Tetrahydrofuran (\u201cthe chemical\u201d) has a natural tendency to form peroxides, especially if exposed to oxygen, unless it is chemically inhibited. Here, before shipment, the seller had treated the chemical with an inhibitor, and in fact the two tanks fully filled with the shipped chemical arrived without contamination; only the third tank, partially filled, was found to be peroxide-contaminated upon arrival. As a further safeguard against exposure to oxygen, all tanks were injected with a \u201cnitrogen blanket\u201d of sufficient pressure, designed to insulate the chemical from oxygen during shipment. The vessel\u2019s officers inspected the \u201cnitrogen blanket\u201d periodically and with due diligence, the district court found, and a water content analysis performed upon the cargo\u2019s arrival in Texas indicated that the nitrogen blanket had been properly maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We thus have the following situation: If we accept the testimony offered for the shipper Quaker Oats (as the district court did), the chemical was loaded and found after testing to be free of peroxide contamination when shipped and when the bill of lading was issued. If we accept the testimony offered for the defendant carrier, as the district court equally did, the vessel\u2019s officers performed with due diligence their duty of maintaining the protective nitrogen cover that should have made exposure to oxygen and peroxide contamination impossible during the period that the cargo was entrusted to the care of the shipper. Consequently, if all the evidence is true, the evidence shows no cause for the peroxide contamination. However, that contamination must have resulted either from some defect in the chemical or its processing for shipment, for which the carrier would not be responsible \u2014 which the evidence does not prove; or else that contamination must have resulted during shipment from some failure of the vessel\u2019s officers or of the vessel \u2014 which again is not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">The district court held that the carrier\u2019s proof of due diligence in preparation of the cargo, its loading, and its care during the voyage \u201cwas sufficient to return to the Plaintiff the burden to show that the peroxide formation was caused at least in part by the Defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> None of the specific excepting causes (including the \u201cinherent defect\u201d exception, see note 3 <em>supra), </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(a)-(p), were proved by the carrier, so the burden did not shift back to the shipper to prove that carrier negligence contributed to the damage. Under COGSA, the carrier\u2019s proof of the remaining general catch-all exception to liability relied upon, \u00a7 1304(2)(q), is not shown by its simple and to be expected evidence that its crew did all it was supposed to do (although here, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ever, somewhat corroborated as to the nitrogen blanket by testing on arrival). The statute provides, more stringently, that the carrier shall prove that its fault did <em>not </em>contribute to the accident: \u201cthe burden of proof shall be on the person claiming the exception to show that neither the actual fault or privity of the carrier nor the fault or neglect of the agents or servants of the carrier contributed to the loss or damage.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(q).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">For purposes of this catch-all no-fault exception to liability, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(2)(q), the presumption of fault \u2014 resulting from the arrival of cargo, damage free when shipped under bill of lading, but contaminated on arrival \u2014 is thus not rebutted by simple proof of the carrier\u2019s own due diligence, evidence peculiarly within its knowledge and control during the period of the shipment of the cargo entrusted to its care. For the \u00a7 1304(2)(q) exception <em>(see </em>note 2, supra) to come into play, the carrier must first prove what that \u201cother cause\u201d was. <em>See, </em>W. Tetley, Marine Cargo Claims 245, 246 (1978). But the district court found that \u201cno one knows what caused the cargo to form peroxide in the way it did\u201d (R. 14) and indeed concluded that the cause of the damage was a \u201cmystery\u201d (R. 12).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">To rebut the presumption of fault when relying upon its own reasonable care, the carrier must further prove that the damage was caused by something other than its own negligence. <em>Calmaquip Engineering West Hemisphere Corporation v. West Coast Carriers Ltd., </em>650 F.2d 633, 640-41 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Socony Mobil Oil Company, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 1013. Once the shipper establishes a prima facie case, under \u201cthe policy of the law\u201d the carrier must \u201cexplain what took place or suffer the consequences.\u201d <em>Companie De Navigation, etc. v. Mondial United Corporation, </em>316 F.2d 163, 170 (5th Cir.1963); <em>see also </em>discussion of issue similar to the present in <em>Socony Mobil Oil Company, supra, </em>559 F.2d at 111. \u201c[T]he law casts upon [the carrier] the burden of the loss which he cannot explain or, explaining, bring within the exceptional case in which he is relieved from liability.\u201d <em>The Vallescura, </em>293 U.S. 296, 303, 55 S.Ct. 194, 196, 79 L.Ed. 373 (1934).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Here, contrary to the policy of the statute, the trial court placed the burden upon the shipper, not the carrier, to explain the unexplained or unexplainable loss. Its judgment must therefore be reversed, and the case remanded for entry of judgment awarding the plaintiff the damages sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">For the reasons stated, the judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s claim is REVERSED, and the case REMANDED for the award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\">.
