The unanimous award of the appraisers and umpire finally and conclusively determines that prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>to the loss by fire the car had sustained a substantial depreciation in value and that the loss by fire alone was a partial loss. <em>(Remington </em>v. <em>London Assur.

The trial court, having found as a fact that the parties, after the loss and disagreement as to the amount thereof, entered into a written agreement providing that the amount of the loss by fire alone should be determined by appraisers, and such determination having been made, erred in finding that the written agreement entered into by plaintiff and defendant insurer on November 4, 1921, did not preclude plaintiff from seeking to recover the stipulated value of the truck as a total loss. <em>(Silver </em>v. <em>Western Assur.

The insurance being for a year upon an automobile subject to the usual depreciation and wastage of value, and the loss having occurred after seven months\u2019 use, the trial court erred in finding that the policy issued by defendant was a valued policy for $5,720 as stipulated damages in the event of total loss. <em>(Norwich Union F.

Co., </em>204 App. Div. 174.) The purpose and effect of a \u201c valued \u201d policy is to fix conclusively in advance of total loss the value of the property insured and thus establish the extent of the insurer\u2019s liability in the event of total loss. <em>(Michael </em>v. <em>Prussian Nat.

The award of the appraisers finding a partial loss only and fixing the \u201c sound value \u201d at the time of loss to be less than the agreed value fixed by the policy is not binding on the insured. Upon due proof of total loss, insured may recover for the full agreed value of the property. <em>(Steinberg </em>v. <em>Boston Ins. Co., </em>144 App. Div. 110; <em>Broadway Ins.

Rep. 390.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b278-5\">Hobbs, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARqz\">The plaintiff insured his new automobile truck with the defendant insurance company for $5,720. The trial court has decided that the policy covering the truck is a valued policy, that there was a total loss of the truck by fire, and has awarded judgment to the plaintiff for the amount of the policy. Before this action was commenced, appraisers selected by the parties had fixed the sound value of the truck at the time of the fire at $3,700 and the loss and damage at $2,700.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">A valued policy is one in which the words \u201c valued at <em>\u201d </em>appear and the amount at which the property insured is <em>\u201c </em>valued at <em>\u201d </em>definitely fixes the liability of the insurer and is conclusive on the parties. <em>(Michael </em>v. <em>Prussian Nat. Ins. Co., </em>171 N. Y. 25; <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>McLoon, </em>100 Mass. 475.) The policy in question fixes the amount at which the property was insured or valued at as $5,720. It is, therefore, a technical valued policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">In case of a total loss under a valued policy the amount to be recovered is the amount of the policy without regard to depreciation or other elements entering into the market value of the property at the time of the loss. The appraisal clause in a valued policy is inoperative when there is a total loss. <em>(Empire Development Co. </em>v. <em>Title G. &amp; T. Co., </em>225 N. Y. 53., 58; <em>Penna. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Drackett, </em>63 Ohio St. 41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Consent to an appraisal does not constitute a waiver of claim to a total loss. <em>(Penna. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Drackett, supra; Seyk </em>v. <em>Millers Nat. Ins. Co., </em>74 Wis. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">An appraisal clause does not permit appraisers to determine whether a loss was in fact total, as an appraisal is to determine the amount of damage only. <em>(Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bourbon County Court, </em>115 Ky. 109.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">The question to be determined under the appraisal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>this case was, what was the <em>\u201c </em>loss or damage.\u201d The words \u201c loss or damage \u201d as used in the policy are explained and limited by the policy which reads: \" In the event of loss or damage under this policy, this Company shall be hable only for the actual cost of repairing or, if necessary, replacing the parts damaged or destroyed.\u201d It also provides that in case of <em>\u201c </em>loss or damage \u201d the policy shall be reduced by the amount of such <em>\u201c </em>loss or damage.\u201d Such provisions can only refer to a \u201c loss or damage \u201d less than a total loss. The provision of the policy for an appraisal reads: <em>\u201c </em>In the event of disagreement as to the amount of loss or damage,\u201d an appraisal shah be had, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">It seems clear that the appraisal was to cover only <em>\u201c </em>loss or damage \u201d less than a total loss. If the insured under such a policy claims a total loss and the insurer a partial loss, and the latter insists on an appraisal, the granting of the appraisal by the insured cannot estop him from litigating the question of a total loss. If it be decided that the loss was not total, then the appraisal stands, but if it be decided that the loss was total, then under the valued policy the plaintiff would be entitled to receive the amount of the policy. Any other construction disregards the fact that the policy is a valued policy and treats it as an open policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b279-8\">O\u2019Brien, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIR\">(dissenting). Assume that the policy is a valued one and that, in the event of total loss, the full value as therein stated is recoverable. Assume also that when property insured under a valued policy is 'Conceded to have been completely destroyed and to have passed out of existence, appraisal may not be enforced. <em>(Rosenwald </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>50 Hun, 172; <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Eagle Fire Co., </em>12 App. Div. 39.) When, however, the parties to an insurance contract disagree respecting the fact whether damage is partial or loss is total that rule does not apply, In such circumstances an appraisal provision in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>policy controls. <em>(Williamson </em>v. <em>Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Ins. Co., </em>122 Fed. Rep. 59; <em>Littrell </em>v. <em>Allemannia Fire Ins. Co., </em>222 App. Div. 302.) This policy provides for an appraisal \u201cin the event of disagreement as to the amount of loss or damage.\u201d The parties disagreed, one asserting that the loss was total, the other that the damage was only partial. After such disagreement, they contracted by formal written instrument, pursuant to the terms of the policy, to submit to appraisers for determination concerning the amount of loss or damage. Such a determination necessarily includes ascertainment whether the loss is total or the damage partial. If a total loss is concluded by the appraisers, the amount payable is the sum at which the property is valued in the policy; if a partial damage is decided, then the amount is \u201c the actual cost of repairing or, if necessary, replacing the parts damaged or destroyed.\u201d A loss is total only when the property has sustained such extensive damage that repairs would not be reasonably practicable. <em>(Corbett </em>v. <em>Spring Garden Ins. Co., </em>155 N. Y. 389, 394; <em>Slocum </em>v. <em>Saratoga &amp; W. Fire Ins. Co., </em>149 App. Div. 867, 870.) Since no charge of fraud, corruption or obvious mistake is made, the appraiser\u2019s determination of a loss or damage less than total seems to me to be conclusive. In the prevailing opinion three cases in other States are cited with approval. <em>(Penna. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Drackett, </em>63 Ohio St. 41; <em>Seyk </em>v. <em>Millers Nat. Ins. Co., </em>74 Wis. 67, and <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bourbon County Court, </em>115 Ky. 109.) All those decisions are based upon statutes the operation of which is of course limited to their respective States. Believing that the true rule in New York is announced in <em>Littrell </em>v. <em>Allemannia Fire Ins. Co. (supra), </em>I vote for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Pound, Crane and Kellogg, JJ., concur with Hubbs, J.; O\u2019Brien, J., dissents in opinion in which Cardozo, Ch. J., and Lehman, J., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
