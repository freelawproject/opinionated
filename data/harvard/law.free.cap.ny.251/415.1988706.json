The proof showed that the defendant, between the hours named, was operating along a village street a Mack truck having in tow a trailer loaded with a trench digger machine which was in excess of eight feet in width. Article 11 of the Highway Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 25), in section 281, provides that the article shall be exclusively controlling upon the registration, numbering and regulation of motor vehicles, and the licensing and regulation of chauffeurs and operators and \u201c on their use of public highways.\u201d Section 282-a of the same article provides: \u201cNo person shall operate or drive or cause to be operated or driven upon a public highway or bridge thereon, in any county not wholly included within a city, a motor vehicle or trailer having,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201c 1. A width of body, inclusive of load, of more than eight feet, * * It further provides: \u201c In cases of emergency, the state commissioner of highways, may grant permission, in writing, to exceed the limits prescribed herein.\u201d Within the meaning of the section a village street is a \u201c public highway.\u201d (\u00a7 281.) In moving a trailer which, \u201c inclusive of load,\u201d was more than eight feet wide, along a street of the village of Ossining, the defendant was performing an act, concerning which the Highway Law made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>exclusive provision. Therefore, no ordinance of the village had force to render criminal the act of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The judgment of the County Court and that of the Court of Special Sessions should be reversed and the information dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Cardozo, Ch.
