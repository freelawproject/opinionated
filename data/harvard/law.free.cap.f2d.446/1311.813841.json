On cross-motions for summary judgment, appellees prevailed. This appeal presents two claims of error as undermining that judgment. One is that the dismissal was invalid because appellant had not been supervised, counselled, and evaluated as contemplated by the Government\u2019s formulations of personnel policies. For the reasons set forth in the margin, we find no occasion on this score to disturb the District Court\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The other challenge is to the refusal of the Civil Service Commission to entertain an appeal from the departmental action. Our conclusion in this regard is that the Commission, in the light both of the relevant statutes and of the constitutional evocations peculiar to this record, read too narrowly the provision currently made by regulation for appeals to it by probationary employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-12\">Appellant, a sociologist with sound academic credentials and extensive experience in race relations, was appointed, effective January 11, 1965, an Education Research and Program Specialist in the Office of Education of HEW. By a memorandum dated December 23, 1965, Mr. Seeley, the head of the division in which appellant worked, recommended to the Personnel Director of the Office of Education that appellant\u2019s employment be terminated during probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>Seeley represented his conclusion to be that appellant \u201chas not demonstrated that her general character traits and capacity are such as to fit her for satisfactory service;\u201d and he enumerated the following respects in which he purported to find \u201ca lack of aptitude and of cooperativeness:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-4\">\u201cA. Unwillingness or inability to accept direction except with manifest resentment and bad grace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-5\">B. On one fairly substantial project, hostile and bitter response to cooperating with staff assigned to gather information from files assigned to her charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-6\">C. A lack of objectivity and a tendency to allow her emotional reactions on matters affecting civil rights to cloud sound judgment on how to handle inquiries or proposals assigned to her for staff work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1371-7\">This recommendation was approved, and five days later Mr. Seeley wrote a letter to appellant advising that her employment would terminate on January 7, 1966.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This letter reiterated the three reasons contained in the earlier memorandum, although the third was revised to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1371-8\">\u201c3. Your failure to use sound judgment in handling inquiries and proposals assigned to you for staff work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"anp-dedup-0\">On January 7, 1966, appellant wrote a letter to the Secretary of HEW requesting review and a hearing on her termination. The Director of Personnel of HEW responded on behalf of the Secretary on January 10, in a letter which asserted that the notice of termination was in compliance with Civil Service Commission requirements, and that there was no provision for formal review or hearing apart from appeal to the Civil Service Commission on the ground of a violation of Subchapter 8-4(d) of the Federal Personnel Manual, which prohibits a termination action against a probationer based on \u201cpolitical discrimination except as required by law * * * sex or marital status * * * [or] a physical handicap if the duties of the position may be efficiently performed by a person with that handicap.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1371-16\">On January 17, 1966, appellant filed with the Civil Service Commission a petition and affidavit asserting the invalidity of her termination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A copy of this was apparently filed also with HEW, because there was further internal review of the matter within the Department, culminating in a second letter, dated February 1, 1966, from the Director of Personnel to appellant reaffirming the position taken earlier, and stating that \u201c[T]he only appropriate avenue of appeal for you is that covered by paragraph [8 \u2014 4(d) ] of Chapter 315 of the Federal Personnel Manual, and is to the Civil Service Commission.\u201d On February 1, appellant retained an attorney, who filed a further petition with the Commission alleging that appellant\u2019s ter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>mination was caused by political discrimination; and a further affidavit of appellant was submitted in support of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">This affidavit asserted a belief that Mr. Seeley had, beginning in the summer of 1965, \u201cinitiated a pattern of activity to suppress, intimidate and eliminate staff members of the Office of Equal Educational Opportunities who participated in local, private, volunteer civil rights activity or who otherwise indicated a strong feeling that Negroes should have equal rights * * A number of incidents were cited as founding this belief. Appellant recited that she herself had \u201ccontinued to work actively in Washington CORE, serving as Chairman of its Housing Committee, and continued to make recommendations and take positions in carrying out assignments that would advance the attainment of equal rights for all citizens as quickly as possible.\u201d Appellant insisted that her work performance had been satisfactory, and that the true reason for dismissal had been \u201cher active, persistent efforts to achieve equal rights for all citizens * * She averred that her \u201ccivil rights organizational affiliation and activity\u201d was political in character because it was \u201cdirected toward changing the character and structure of society,\u201d and that to terminate her employment for this reason was to engage in the forbidden political discrimination. The Commission was requested to set the matter for hearing so that appellant could \u201cdemonstrate the legal and factual basis of her claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">On May 6, 1966, a letter was sent to appellant\u2019s counsel by the Chief of the Commission\u2019s Appeals Examining Office. After reviewing appellant\u2019s assertions, it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1372-8\">\u201cThat there was disagreement with the Acting Director\u2019s policy toward civil rights activity by staff employees does not support a conclusion that <em>partisan political considerations </em>were the underlying reasons for the removal of [appellant].\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1372-11\">The letter concluded with a finding that the appeal was \u201cnot within the purview of Section 315.806\u201d of the Commission\u2019s regulations, and was therefore to be denied without inquiry into the merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-12\">Appellant pursued the matter to the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review. The Board, in a letter dated August 31, 1966, sustained the ruling of the Appeals Examining Office. The Board characterized appellant\u2019s allegations of political discrimination as founded upon \u201corganizational activities and affiliation\u201d which \u201cmay be recognized as [engaging] in programs seeking to influence the formulation of public policy, and to promote political action, in the area of civil rights.\u201d The Board went on to say:</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-13\">\u201c * However, the various laws, rules and regulations for which the Commission has specific enforcement authority, relating to political activity of Federal employees, have the particular and direct objective of insulating the Federal civil service from either reward or reprisal based upon political influences, specifically as resulting from affiliation with or support of recognized partisan political parties, their candidates for public office,-or their political campaign activities. It is this specific protection against partisan political discrimination which is provided under the limited authority established by Part 315 of the Civil Service Regulations, governing the Commission\u2019s appellate review of agency decisions to terminate probationary employees * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-15\">The Board concluded that \u201cthe facts and circumstances which have been alleged do not establish a substantive basis to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>conclude that [appellant\u2019s] termination may have been \u2018based on political reasons not required by statute,\u2019 within the meaning and intent of Section 315.806 of the Civil Service Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-3\">The District Court, upon the cross-motions for summary judgment pending before it and the administrative record so developed, granted appellees\u2019 motion without identification or discussion of its reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">In this court the Government in its brief asserts generally that \u201cthere is no vested legal right to government employment,\u201d and that a federal employee, like any other, may be discharged at the will of the employer, absent any statutory or contractual provision to the contrary. It recognizes, however, that, continuously from the enactment of the Civil Service Act of 1883, 22 Stat. 403, the Congress has seen fit to provide \u201ca limited statutory protection to some federal jobs, and the executive branch itself has added additional protections,\u201d in consequence of which the Government may not terminate federal employment in violation of any procedural or substantive rights accruing by reason of the particular employment. Service v. Dulles, 354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1957). Judicial review, so it is said, is significantly limited in scope, although \u201ca court may examine whether an agency has discharged an employee in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations, for to deny someone those \u2018rights\u2019 would be to deny them due process of law. United States ex rel. Accar-di v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">These principles are, by and large, unexceptionable, although the impact of the Constitution in all its manifold aspects, including the First Amendment, is arguably neglected in this summation. <em>See </em>Pickering v. Board of Education, 391 U.S. 563, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968). It is certainly true that, in the present state of the law, Congress may limit the full range of political activities which a federal employee might, without jeopardizing his employment, otherwise engage in. Congress has indeed done so in the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7324, with respect to partisan political activities. United Public Workers, etc., v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 67 S.Ct. 556, 91 L.Ed. 754 (1947). What is not so clear is whether federal employment, even in a probationary status, entails a forfeiture under any and all circumstances of statutory and First Amendment political rights of free expression in the realm of policies and ideas, and of freedom to associate with others, in and out of government, in the pursuit of what are, in the larger sense, political goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-11\">Congress has contemplated that \u201c[t]he President may prescribe rules which shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, that there shall be a period of probation before an appointment in the competitive service becomes absolute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3321. Under this authority, a period of one year has, by Commission regulation, been prescribed to this end. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.802. In the Hatch Act itself, Congress has said that a federal employee, including one in a probationary status, retains \u201cthe right to vote as he chooses <em>and to express Ms opinion on political subjects </em>and candidates.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7324(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-12\">The executive branch by regulation has proscribed the termination of federal employees in the classified service, including probationers, based on \u201cpolitical discrimination except as required by law.\u201d This latter clause obviously means that engaging in political activity of the kind banned by the Hatch Act exposes civil service employees, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>bationary or permanent, to lawful discharge. It does not give explicit notice that such employees may, for expression and association of an essentially political nature although not in the familiar partisan context, have their employment terminated, at least without the right to have the matter heard and determined upon appeal to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-4\">The Commission has seen fit to interpret its regulation as confined to partisan political activity in the Hatch Act sense. It appears to believe that it has in terms excluded from the concept of political discrimination any conduct which does not fit into the traditional partisan mould of organized contention for elective political office. With all the deference to be accorded an agency\u2019s construction of its own regulations, we do not think the words used compel this reading. We think, moreover, that such a reading is at odds with the Congressional purpose, stated in the Hatch Act itself, that the statutory proscription of partisan political activity does not extend to the right of an employee \u201cto express his opinion on political subjects,\u201d or to engage in political activity in connection with \u201ca question which is not specifically identified\u201d with political parties. We suggest, finally, that such an interpretation could not, compatibly with the First Amendment, be constitutionally maintained as against any and all activities involving speech and association relating to public policies of an essentially political, albeit non-partisan, nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-5\">This is not to say that, in certain politically sensitive areas of federal employment, the employing agency has no right to exact conformity to reasonable standards of circumspection and discretion in the pursuit, in and out of the office, of non-partisan political purposes. The functioning of an agency can be impaired, and its effectiveness in achieving its statutory missions can be blunted, by conduct, including speech and association, routinely available to the private citizen. People resign from public employment every day because of these constraints, and because they believe they can be more uninhibited and more effective in their advocacy of public policies off, rather than on, the public payroll. The Constitution does not invariably relieve a federal employee from this stern and frequently difficult choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-7\">It may conceivably be, as the Government presses upon us, that appellant has put her personal policy preferences ahead of her obligation to be a useful and cooperative employee; and that her employer was in this instance justified in concluding that her continuance would impede the discharge by HEW of its statutory responsibilities. But neither we, nor the District Court, are warranted in so concluding on this record, which consists solely of untested affidavits and unexamined unilateral assertions. Surely it is one of the central purposes of the Civil Service Commission to inquire, by evidentiary hearing if necessary, into this tangle of assertion and counter-assertion, and to make a fair and rational judgment on the question of whether, as the Government insists, appellant subordinated her public duties to her personal prepossessions, or whether, as appellant alleges, her performance of the one was unimpaired by her indulgence of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">There is enough in the record before us to raise a nonfrivolous issue as to a possible entrenchment upon appellant\u2019s political rights of speech and association, limited though they may be in some degree by the special character of her employment. The determination of that precise degree is surely one of the most difficult problems faced by government administrators, and their judgments in good faith on this score are not lightly to be overborne by reviewing authorities who function in more sheltered surroundings. In this case the record suggests that the employing agency itself assumed that the question was appropriate for Commission inquiry, since appellant was expressly advised that her recourse was by appeal to the Commission. The Commission declined to entertain that appeal because of what we be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>lieve to be, in the light of the precise Hatch Act protections, its unacceptably narrow view of the jurisdiction it had held itself out to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">It was the Commission\u2019s refusal to entertain this appeal which we believe to be in error. In these circumstances, we think the equities of both sides are best served by reversing the District Court and remanding the case to it for remission to the Commission for further proceedings consistent herewith.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The merits of appellant\u2019s claim of improper termination remain, of course, open. <em>See </em>Goodman v. United States, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 7, 424 F.2d 914, 920 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1370-8\">. The directory, as distinct from the mandatory, character of the personnel instructions and standards for supervision and training relied upon by appellant in this branch of her argument has recently been settled in the main for this court by Donovan v. United States, 389 U.S.App.D.C. 364, 433 F.2d 522 ( 3970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 944, 91 S.Ct. 955, 28 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971). A somewhat more difficult issue is jjresentod by IIEW\u2019s apparent failure to observe the. instruction of the Federal Personnel Manual that a probationary employee is to be formally evaluated between the ninth and tenth months of service, but this court has not regarded this omission as invariably invalidating a termination. Kepler v. Celebrezze (Xo. 19,828, decided without opinion, May 6, 1960). In any event, we do not get from this record a sense that these matters of supervision are at the core of this controversy, or that they played any significant role in bringing appellant\u2019s employment to the crisis of termination. On the basis of appellant\u2019s own affidavits, it would not appear that she was unaware of any strains between herself and her immediate supervisor, or that the final expressions of dissatisfaction by the latter with her work came as a surprise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1370-14\">. Mr. Seeley\u2019s memorandum notes that he had discussed the matter of termination with appellant personally on December 23. Appellant alleges that Mr. See-ley told her in this conversation that \u201cdespite her competence and. ability, ho would have to recommend that [shel not be retained, among other things, because she was inflexible and not objective in her work because of her strong personal position on civil rights.\u201d In complaint and affidavit, appellant has also alleged that (!\u25a0) her activities outside of office hours, particularly in the promotion of the housing objectives of the Washington chapter of CORE, were offensive to Mr. Seeley, although, so she asserts, they did not impair her work in the office, (2) her urging upon Mr. Seeley of stronger policy lines in respect of school integration was met with disfavor, and (3) Mr. Seeley, by a pattern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>of intimidation and elimination, sought to discourage attempts within the office to raise the issue of whether the office under his leadership was discharging adequately its responsibilities in the matter of educational integration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1371-10\">. The record before us contains a confidential memorandum, dated January C, 1966, to the Secretary of IIEW from the Acting TJ.S. Commissioner of Education which supported Mr. Seeley by representing that appellant was not being terminated because of her deep commitments to the cause of civil rights, but because she had permitted \u201cher emotions on civil rights matters to cloud lier judgment in performing lier official duties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1371-18\">. The references to the Commission\u2019s regulations throughout this opinion are main]y as they existed at the time of the events in question. In 1969 there was a revision and rearrangement which did not, however, affect substance in respect of the issues before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1371-19\">. The affidavit was accompanied by written statements signed by ft number of the employees in appellant\u2019s office to the effect that she had been found by them to be a courteous, cooperative, and competent fellow worker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">. Section 315.S06, relating to the appeal rights to the Commission of probationers, provides that a terminated probationer employee may appeal \u201ca termination not required by statute which ho alleges was based on political reasons * * *.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">. Another section of the Hatch Act makes clear that its strictures do not extend to political activity in connection with \"a question which is not specifically identified with a National or State political party or political party of a territory or possession of the United States.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7326.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1375-15\">.
