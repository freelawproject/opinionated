We stated that the court erroneously granted a judgment n/o/v for the defendants, and we held that the plaintiff was entitled to entry of judgment on the jury verdict. In fact, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-23\">Our opinion pointed out the problem of discerning what the trial court meant by its statement accompanying the foregoing rulings: \u201cthe court finds that, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>a matter of law, no consideration existed for the agreement mentioned in Special Issue No. 5.\u201d We are unable to exclude the possibility that the statement was a ruling, and, if so, an incorrect one, that as a matter of law there had to be consideration for the agreement independent of the plaintiff\u2019s written undertaking to sell his stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">The judgment entered on the verdict for defendants on the contract claim must be reversed. Our holding in the prior opinion that, as to that claim, the plaintiff is entitled to entry of judgment on the jury verdict must be withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Rehearing granted. Reversed and remanded for new trial on both claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-15\">. While at the same time denying plaintiff\u2019s and defendants\u2019 motions for judgment n/o/v and plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
