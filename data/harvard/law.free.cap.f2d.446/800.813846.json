Newman, in connection with the January 1969 sales by Newman to each of the plaintiffs of 10,000 shares of unregistered stock<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Diversa, Inc. On the instructions of the Trial Judge, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. Rule 49(a), the jury returned a special verdict in the form of written findings on individual issues of fact. The jury found, among other things, that the unregistered stock had no market value; that the plaintiffs had purchased it on the assurances of the defendant that he would replace the unregistered shares with the same number of registered, fully marketable shares of Diversa on or before July 2, 1969; and that on July 2, 1969, the fair market value per share of freely marketable shares of Diversa was $10.37y2. Based on these findings and on the undisputed evidence that the defendant had refused to comply with the plaintiffs\u2019 demand for replacement of the shares, the Trial Judge entered judgment for the plaintiffs in the amount of $103,750 each.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-21\">The defendant appeals. We find merit in one of his contentions: that the judgment must be amended to require the plaintiffs, upon satisfaction of the award, to surrender to him the 20,000 unregistered shares. In all other respects, however, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-23\">The plaintiffs are Washington state corporations engaged in the securities business in Seattle. John R. Lewis is president and one of four stockholders of the corporation that bears his name; Glenn E. Hinton is the sole stockholder of his company. Since about 1958, the plaintiffs have invested on the over-the-counter market, for themselves and their customers, in the stock of Diversa, Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>a Corporation headquartered in Dallas, Texas. In the course of their periodic visits to Dallas, Lewis and Hinton became acquainted with defendant Newman, an independent investor in close touch with the Diversa management and particularly with Gerald C. Mann, Sr., Diversa\u2019s president and chairman of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In the latter part of 1968, Lewis and Newman met in Dallas and discussed the possible purchase by the plaintiff corporations of some unregistered Diversa stock. In December of 1968, Newman called Lewis and broached the subject again. There is a conflict in the testimony as to what was said on these occasions, Newman testified that Hinton and Lewis thought that unregistered Diversa stock was a bargain at $10 a share, and wanted to make an immediate and unconditional purchase. Hinton and Lewis testified that unregistered Diver-sa stock was worthless to them as an investment, and that they took an interest in Newman\u2019s proposal only because Newman led them to believe that the proceeds of the sale would go to Diversa and that Diversa badly needed the capital. Lewis and Hinton further testified that they agreed to buy unregistered stock at $10 per share only on the condition that Newman agreed to replace the unregistered stock with registered stock within six months of the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The sale was arranged by the end of December. On or about January 2, 1969, plaintiffs each paid Newman $100,000, and shortly thereafter Newman delivered to each plaintiff 10,000 shares of unregistered Diversa stock. In March, Newman made it apparent that he considered himself bound only to use his best efforts to obtain registered stock for a possible exchange. Negotiations between Lewis, Hinton, Newman and the Diversa management failed, and when July and August came and went without compliance on Newman\u2019s part with the plaintiffs\u2019 demand, plaintiffs filed this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The jury, in response to the questions submitted by the Trial Judge pursuant to Rule 49(a), found as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">1. Newman represented to the buyers that the purpose of the sale of unregistered stock was to enable Diversa to carry on foreign operations and that Gerald C. Mann, Sr. would guarantee that 20,-000 shares of freely marketable common stock would be made available for exchange of the shares in question by July 2, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">2. These representations were material and made to induce the plaintiffs to purchase the stock and were relied on by plaintiffs in purchasing the stock for $10 per share. They were also false.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">3. Newman failed to disclose to the plaintiffs that the shares were being sold for his own account, and that he had purchased the shares at $5 per share shortly before the sale to plaintiffs was consummated, from an affiliated company of Diversa.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">4. A reasonable man would attach importance to such undisclosed facts in determining whether to purchase the stock for $10 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">5. If said facts had been disclosed to plaintiffs, they would have regarded them as material in deciding whether or not to purchase the stock for $10 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">6. Newman entered into a verbal agreement with Lewis that the unregistered shares purchased would be replaced by Newman with a like number of fully marketable shares by July 2, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">7. The unregistered stock had no market value on or about January 2, 1969, and none on or about July 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-14\">8. The fair market value of freely marketable shares of stock of Diversa on or about July 2, 1969, was $10.37V2-</p>\n<p id=\"b860-15\">9. Newman, in making the representations in connection with the sale, acted without malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-16\">The $207,500 judgment entered for plaintiffs on the special verdict is general in form. The appellees contend that the verdict and judgment are consistent with each of the theories advanced in their complaint, i. e., common law fraud, breach of contract, and violation of anti-fraud provisions of the federal se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>curities laws \u2014 specifically, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a)) and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S. C. \u00a7 78j(b)), as supplemented by SEC Rule 1 Ob-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. This Circuit has never squarely determined whether a private civil action for damages lies for violations of Section 17(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is now established beyond dispute, however, that such an action lies for violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 1 Ob-5,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we hold that the jury\u2019s tiffs under these provisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state-law theories are not well briefed by the parties on appeal. Accordingly, and without prejudice to appellees\u2019 contention that the verdict will also sustain a judgment in their favor on these counts, we proceed to consider the appellant\u2019s points of error in the context of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Appellant attacks the special verdict on three grounds. He argues that the jury was incorrectly instructed, that the evidence was insufficient to support certain of its findings, and that the Trial Judge erred in failing to submit to the jury certain interrogatories offered by appellant\u2019s counsel. We find the first two contentions to be without merit, and reject the third on the ground that the appellant\u2019s failure to move in timely fashion below precludes review.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Newman contends that the brief instructions of the Trial Judge were incomplete and in part incorrect. We discern no substantial error. The Trial Judge instructed the jury that the term \u201cmaterial\u201d as used in the interrogatories pertaining to Newman\u2019s alleged misrepresentations meant \u201cof solid or weighty character, substantial, of consequence, not to be dispensed with, important.\u201d The conventional test for materiality in cases arising under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is whether a reasonable man would attach importance to the fact misrepresented in determining his course of action in the transaction in question. See List v. Fashion Park, Inc., 2 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 457, 462, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 811, 86 S.Ct. 23, 15 L.Ed.2d 60; Gilbert v. Nixon, 10 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 348, 355-356, and cases cited therein. The purport of the conventional test and the one on which the jury was instructed appear to us, in the context of this case, to be the same. In any event, we are unable to discern any prejudice to the appellant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cf. Delancey v. Motichek Towing Service, Inc., 5 Cir., 1970, 427 F.2d 897, 902. Newman also contends that the charge, did not properly apprise the jury of the importance of \u201cthe peculiar knowledge, interest and years of experience of the plaintiffs in the security business, and with reference to the stock in question.\u201d Normally it is enough, for purposes of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, that the defendant\u2019s misrepresentations be material, and that the plaintiff rely on them to his detriment. See Reyos v. United States, 10 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 1337, 1347-1348; List v. Fashion Park, supra, 340 F.2d at 462; 2 A. Bromberg, Securities Law: Fraud- \u2014 SEC Rule 10b-5, \u00a7\u00a7 8.3, 8.6 (1969). There was no evidence in this case of past dealings between plaintiffs and defendant which might have put them on notice that Newman was not acting for Diversa as he purported to be, or that he would refuse to perform as he agreed to do. We hold that the instructions given by the Trial Judge were adequate and complete. Cf. L'Urbaine Et La Seine v. Rodriguez, 5 Cir. 1959, 268 F.2d 1, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">Newman contends that the evidence was insufficient to support most of the jury\u2019s findings. The principal witnesses in the case were Lewis, Hinton, and Newman himself. The testimony of Lewis and Hinton amply supported the jury\u2019s findings as to -the facts surrounding the transaction. Its finding on the fair market value of registered Diversa stock is not contested on appeal. In light of the other findings, the fair market value of the unregistered shares is immaterial: the defendant made no representations on this score, and the value of the unregistered shares is not an element in the calculation of plaintiff\u2019s damages. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict as to all material issues of fact. Cf. First Nat. Bank, Henrietta v. Small Business Admin., 5 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 280, 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">Finally, Newman complains of the failure of the Trial Judge to submit to the jury certain additional questions to be answered as a part of the special verdict. Rule 49(a), Fed.R.Civ.P., provides that if the court omits from its charge \u201cany issue of fact raised by the pleadings or by the evidence, each party waives his right to a trial by jury of the issue so omitted unless before the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>retires he demands its submission to the jury.\u201d This provision has an obvious salutary purpose and is deemed by some to be essential to the efficient and expeditious use of the special-verdict procedure. See generally 2B Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1053 (Rules ed. 1961), and authorities cited therein. Nothing in the record suggests that the defendant in this case ever secured a ruling from the Trial Judge on his proposed interrogatories, and the transcript indicates that he did not object when they were not included in the charge. His objections on appeal therefore come too late. United States v. H. M. Branson Distributing Company, 6 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 929, 937; Delta Engineering Corp. v. Scott, 5 Cir., 1963, 322 F.2d 11, 17, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 905, 84 S.Ct. 1164, 12 L.Ed.2d 176; see 2B Barron &amp; Holtzoff, supra, \u00a7 1053 at 334. The special verdict must stand as returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">The Trial Judge rendered judgment for each plaintiff in the amount of $103,750, or $10.37% (the jury\u2019s figure for the fair market value per share of registered Diversa stock on the date the plaintiffs were supposed to receive it) multiplied by the 10,000 shares sold to each plaintiff. Where a violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 results in injury to a purchaser or seller of securities, federal courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done. J. I. Case Company v. Borak, 377 U.S. 426, 433-434, 84 S.Ct. 1555, 1560-1561, 12 L.Ed.2d 423 (1964). Though the usual remedy in a Rule 10b-5 case involving a defrauded buyer is rescission and restitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we are satisfied that in this case, which involved not only factual misrepresentations on the original sale but a default by the seller on a related express agreement to exchange registered for unregistered stock, the measure of damages applied herein was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-15\">Newman contends, however, that the plaintiffs must be denied judgment on the verdict for a variety of reasons. In the first place, he maintains, their recovery is barred by the fact that they are <em>in pari delicto </em>with him under Section 5(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e(a), which renders unlawful certain sales of unregistered stock. This contention is presented for the first time on appeal. The plaintiffs respond that the transaction falls within at least one of the several categories of transactions exempted from the proscription of Section 5(a) by Section 4,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77d. Cf. United States v. Custer Channel Wing Corporation, 4 Cir., 1967, 376 F.2d 675, 677-680, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 850, 88 S.Ct. 38, 19 L.Ed.2d 119. The facts necessary to resolve this question were not developed below. Rule 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides \u2014 with reason, as this case illustrates \u2014 that the defense of illegality must be affirmatively pled. Newman, having failed to plead this defense below, may not exploit it now. Radio Corporation of America v. Radio Station KYFM, Inc., 10 Cir., 1970, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>424 F.2d 14, 17-18; Charm Tred Mills v. Erie P. Halliburton, Inc., 7 Cir., 1953, 202 F.2d 294, 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Newman further contends that plaintiffs are entitled to recover none of their damages because they are \u201cdealers and underwriters\u201d and hence not subject to the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. He did not make this contention at trial, and does not articulate it clearly on appeal. The fact that the plaintiff corporations were and are in the business of buying and selling securities does not in itself bar them from the relief they seek under Section 10(b). See, e. g., A. T. Brod &amp; Co. v. Perlow, 2 Cir., 1967, 375 F.2d 393, sustaining the right of a stock broker to recover from his customers under Rule 10b-5 for fraudulent failure to pay for securities purchased at their order. Concededly the plaintiffs here had a prior investment in Diversa which they stood ready to protect, if necessary, by furnishing additional capital to the company. We are unable to discern why this fact should be held to bar their recovery under the anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws, when it was the defendant\u2019s special knowledge of this fact that made his fraudulent scheme effective. We hold that the plaintiffs are members of the class entitled to the protection of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We must resolve against Newman any question as to whether the plaintiffs tendered the unregistered shares with the requisite formality and whether they do now in fact own all 20,000 shares. The answer in each case turns on factual questions which were not submitted to the jury, and on which the District Court made no express finding. Pursuant to Rule 49(a), the District Court is deemed to have made a finding in accord with the judgment on the special verdict. See General Insurance Company of America v. Fleeger, 5 Cir., 1968, 389 F.2d 159, 162-163; 2B Barron &amp; Holtzoff, supra, \u00a7 1053 at 335. With respect to tender, we note that the evidence indicated that the defendant adhered consistently from March of 1969 through the trial to the position that he was under no duty to effect the exchange, and that cases decided under Section 12 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 771, hold that tender in the complaint itself is sufficient. See Chapman v. Dunn, 6 Cir., 1969, 414 F.2d 153, 160; Moses v. Michael, 5 Cir., 1961, 292 F.2d 614, 619; Stadia Oil &amp; Uranium Company v. Wheelis, 10 Cir., 1957, 251 F.2d 269, 273-274; cf. Parker v. Baltimore Paint and Chemical Corporation, D.Colo., 1966, 39 F.R.D. 567, 568-569.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">The District Court awarded judgment to the plaintiffs without requiring them to surrender their unregistered stock. We hold, however, that the judgment must be modified so as to require plaintiffs to deliver the stock to defendant upon payment and satisfaction of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-17\">. \u201cUnregistered stock\u201d refers to stock which has not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77a-77aa.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-6\">.
