Trafficante, a Caucasian, and Dorothy M. Carr, a Negro, filed a complaint alleging that defendant-appel-lee, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the owner of the Parkmerced Apartment complex, was engaging in racially discriminatory practices in the rental of apartments, and seeking injunctive relief, actual and punitive damages, costs and attorney fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 13, 1970 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>a complaint in intervention was filed by four other residents of the Parkmerced complex and an unincorporated association of its <em>residents.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-4\">On December 21, 1970 Metropolitan sold<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Parkmerced property to the Parkmerced Corporation which took the property with notice of the pending litigation. Parkmerced Corporation was ordered joined as a party defendant under Rule 25, F.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">In dismissing the action the district court noted that the plaintiffs have not alleged, \u201cnor can they, that they themselves have been denied any of the rights granted by Title VIII or by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982 to purchase or rent real property.\u201d The court held that plaintiffs have no \u201cgeneralized standing\u201d to enforce the Act for the reasons that they were not \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610(a) and \u201cthe enforcement of the public interest in fair housing enunciated in Title VIII of the Act and the creation of integrated communities to the extent envisioned by Congress are entrusted to the Attorney General by \u00a7 813, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613, and not to private litigants such as those before the Court.\u201d We conclude that the district court properly held that the plaintiffs do not have the requisite standing to maintain this action under either the Civil Rights Act of 1968 or 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">The tests for determining standing to sue were summarized in Association of Data Processing Service Organizations v. Camp, 1970, 397 U.S. 150, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-12\">\u201cGeneralizations about standing to sue are largely worthless as such. One generalization is, however, necessary and that is that the question of standing in the federal courts is to be considered in the framework of Article III which restricts judicial power to \u2018cases\u2019 and \u2018controversies.\u2019 397 U.S. at 151, 90 S.Ct. at 829.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-13\">* * * -X- * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-14\">\u201c(The question of standing) concerns, apart from the \u2018case\u2019 or \u2018controversy\u2019 test, the question whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question. Thus the Administrative Procedure Act grants standing to a person \u2018aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.\u2019 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, (1964 ed; Supp. IV.) That interest, at times, may reflect \u2018aesthetic, conservational and recreational\u2019 as well as economic values.\u201d (Citing cases) Id. at 153-154, 90 S.Ct. at 830.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-15\">* * -X- -X- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1218-16\">\u201cApart from Article III jurisdictional questions, problems of standing, as resolved by this Court for its own governance, have involved a \u2018rule of self-restraint.\u2019 Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 255, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 1034, 97 L.Ed. 1586. Congress can, of course, resolve the question one way or another, save as the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>Article III dictate otherwise. Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346, 31 S.Ct. 250, 55 L.Ed. 246.\u201d Id. at 154, 90 S.Ct. at 830.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1219-4\">Accordingly it is necessary to examine the statutes upon which the action is based to determine whether plaintiffs have been granted standing to maintain the action. The complaint of Trafficante and Carr contains three causes of action. The first is based upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610 and the second upon \u00a7 3612 contained in the Fair Housing Title (Title VIII) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The third cause of action is based upon 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982, a part of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Are plaintiffs \u201cpersons aggrieved\u201d within the meaning of sections 3610 and 3612? Section 3610(a) defines a person aggrieved as one \u201cwho claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice or who believes that he will be irrevocably injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur * **.\" <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A person so aggrieved may file a complaint with the Secretary of H.U.D. The complaint must be filed within 180 days after the discriminatory act is alleged to have occurred and \u201cshall state the facts upon which the allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based.\u201d \u00a7 3610(b). If state or local law provides rights and remedies \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to those provided under' Title VIII, the Secretary must notify the appropriate agency to allow it an opportunity to resolve the problem. \u00a7 3610(c). Otherwise, the Secretary may attempt to reconcile the parties \u201cby informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion.\u201d \u00a7 3610(a). If the Secretary, or the state or local agency, is unable to resolve the problem, the complainant then has 30 days in which to file an action in the United States District Court for the district where the discriminatory housing practice is alleged to have occurred or where the respondent lives or has his principal place of business. However, if state or local law provides a substantially equivalent judicial remedy the complainant is limited to that remedy. \u00a7 3610(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">Alternatively, a person may bring a civil action directly in a United States District Court or a state or local court of general jurisdiction under section 3612 to enforce \u201cthe rights granted by sections 3603, 3604, 3605, and 3606.\u201d The action must be bought \u201cwithin one hundred and eighty days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred.\u201d In a proper case the court is authorized to appoint an attorney for the plaintiff and allow him to proceed without payment of costs or security. As remedies, the plaintiff may obtain injunctive relief, actual damages and up to $1,000 in punitive damages. A prevailing plaintiff may also recover attorney\u2019s fees if in the opinion of the court he is not financially able to assume such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">Sections 3603, 3604, 3605, and 3606 make unlawful specified acts of discrimination in the sale or rental of property (\u00a7\u00a7 3603 and 3604), its financing (\u00a7 3605), and in the provision of brokerage services (\u00a7 3606). Section 3604, the only section conceivably applicable, provides that, subject to certain exemptions, \u201cit shall be unlawful</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-12\">\u201c(a) To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, or national origin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1219-13\">\u201c(b) To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>race, color, religion, or national origin.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-4\">There is no allegation in either complaint that any of the plaintiffs was the direct object of any discriminatory housing practice proscribed by the Act; nor are any specific acts of discrimination alleged. Rather both complaints simply allege generally that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-5\">\u201c * * * as of the date of the filing of this complaint and for many years prior thereto, Metropolitan, as owner and operator of Parkmerced, has systematically discriminated against members of minority racial and ethnic groups * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">These acts of discrimination on the part of Metropolitan are said to have caused plaintiffs to lose</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-7\">\u201cthe benefits of living in a community with those persons who have been excluded from Parkmerced by reason of their race, color, or national origin, including the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-8\">\u201c(a) plaintiffs are deprived of the social benefit of living within a community which is not artificially imbalanced in a manner which excludes minority group members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-9\">\u201c(b) plaintiffs suffer the loss of business and professional advantages which accrues from contact and association with minority group members;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-15\">\u201c(c) plaintiffs are stigmatized within both the white and minority group communities as residents of a segregated \u2018white ghetto\u2019, causing such residents both embarrassment and economic damage in social, business and professional activities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1220-16\">Plaintiffs do not claim to have been injured as the result of any specific discriminatory housing practice committed against any particular person. Rather the injury for which they seek redress grows out of the alleged maintenance of a segregated \u201cwhite ghetto\u201d, or, in other words, out of a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of discrimination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">Section 3613 grants the Attorney General the power to bring an action for preventive relief where he believes that a person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the rights granted by Title VIII or where a group of persons has been denied these rights and such denial raises an issue of \u201cgeneral public importance.\u201d No provision of Title VIII grants a similar right of action to private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-18\">Construing the provisions of Title VIII as a whole, it seems clear that it was the intent of Congress to provide first, through sections 3610 and 3612 methods of redress for persons who are the objects of discriminatory housing practices and who seek to vindicate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>rights granted by sections 3603, 3604, 3605, and 3606; and second, to grant to the Attorney General the right to sue to correct \u201cpatterns and practices\u201d of discrimination. This conclusion is supported by the legislative history of Title VIII.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We find nothing in the Congressional discussion or debate to suggest that Congress intended to grant standing to sue to any private persons other than the direct victims of discriminatory housing practices proscribed by the Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">Do plaintiffs have standing to sue under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982? That section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-5\">\u201cAll citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-6\">In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 1968, 392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189, the complaint had alleged that respondents had refused to sell petitioners a home for the reason that one of them was a Negro. The lower courts had held that \u00a7 1982 applied only to state actions and did not reach private refusals to sell. In reversing the Court held that \u00a7 1982 prohibited all racial discrimination in the sale or rental of property and was a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">We find nothing in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer to indicate that section 1982 would be construed to grant standing to sue to anyone other than a person who was the victim of racial discrimination in the sale or rental of property.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In most of the cases decided subsequent to Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer the plaintiffs were persons who had been denied the right to purchase<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or rent<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> property because of their race or who were discriminated against in the terms or conditions of sale or rental for similar reasons.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>In Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 1969, 396 U.S. 229, 90 S.Ct. 400, 24 L.Ed.2d 386, a white person who was expelled from membership in a community recreation club because he had rented property and assigned his membership rights to a Negro was allowed to maintain an action for damages. A similar action was upheld in Walker v. Pointer, N.D.Tex.1969, 304 F.Supp. 56, where whites were evicted from rented premises because they had entertained Negro guests. In Sullivan the decision was placed on the ground that under Barrows v. Jackson, 1953, 346 U.S. 249, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 97 L.Ed. 1586, allowing state courts to enforce sanctions against persons who attempt to vindicate the rights of minorities would \u201cgive impetus to the perpetuation of racial restrictions on property.\u201d 396 U.S. at 237, 90 S.Ct. at 404. In Walker the court also relied on Barrows and in addition stated that to deny recovery would be to read into section 1982 a \u201cracist purpose * * * antithetical to the ennobling objective of the statute and of the Thirteenth Amendment from which it was drawn.\u201d 304 F.Supp. at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-4\">Appellants argue that on the basis of these decisions they have standing to sue. We do not agree. While the plaintiffs in Sullivan and Walker were white persons there was in each case a racially motivated interference with property rights. Here there is no allegation that defendants interfered with the leasehold rights of any of the plaintiffs. The Court\u2019s examination of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer, supra, makes it clear that the purpose of Congress was to forbid racial discrimination affecting the basic civil rights enumerated therein, including the right to purchase or lease property, and to guarantee the newly freed slaves the property rights enjoyed by white citizens. This Congress could do under the enforcement clause of the Thirteenth Amendment because discrimination in the sale or rental of housing is a \u201cbadge or incident\u201d of slavery. 392 U.S. at 441, 88 S.Ct. 2186. We find no indication that Congress intended to allow either third party enforcement of the rights granted by \u00a7 1982 or an independent right of action in a person who has not been stamped with a \u201cbadge of slavery\u201d either by an act of discrimination or some racially motivated interference with his property rights. Accordingly, we cannot say that the interest asserted by plaintiffs is \u201carguably within the zone of interests to be protected\u201d by section 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b1222-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1217-10\">. Prior to filing this action, plaintiffs, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610, had filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (H.U.D.). The complaint was referred by H.U.D. to the California Fair Employment Practices Commission, which returned it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>H.U.D. for the expressed reason that the Commission lacked adequate resources to deal with the charges. H.U.D. then notified plaintiffs that it was unable to achieve voluntary compliance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1218-8\">. Except as otherwise stated, the plaintiffs and plaintiffs in intervention will be referred to collectively as plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1218-9\">. More specifically Metropolitan leased the land to Parkmerced Corporation for 30 years with options to renew for an additional 45 years and sold the buildings and improvements to it subject to a long term mortgage and other security interests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1218-17\">. Accordingly we find it unnecessary, as did the district court, to consider the contention of Parkmerced that it was improperly joined as a defendant or Metropolitan\u2019s additional contentions that the sale of the property rendered the case moot as to it and that the federal courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3610(d) because plaintiffs had a \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d remedy under both the California Rumford Act (Cal.Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 35700 et seq.) and the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Cal.Civ.Code \u00a7\u00a7 51, 52).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">. Tlie complaint in intervention contains two causes of action \u2014 based upon sections 3612 and 1982 respectively. These plaintiffs did not file complaints with the Secretary under section 3610.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1219-14\">. It is true, as appellants argue, that this language, standing alone is very broad. It must be construed, however, with section 3602(f) which defines \u201cdiscriminatory housing practice\u201d as an \u201cact that is unlawful under section 3604, 3605, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>3606 of this title.\u201d The provisions of those sections are discussed later herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">. Additionally \u00a7 3604 makes it unlawful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-12\">\u201c(c) To make, print, or publish, or cause to be made, printed, or published any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, or national origin, or an intention to make any such preference, limitation, or discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-13\">\u201c(d) To represent to any person because of race, color, religion, or national origin that any dwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1220-14\">\u201c(e) For profit, to induce or attempt to induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of a particular race, color, religion, or national origin.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1220-20\">. In opposing defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss plaintiffs filed an affidavit of Dr. Alvin F. Poussaint expressing the opinion that the maintenance of segregated housing patterns tends to foster white racism and to cause various forms of psychological trauma in both white and minority residents of a largely segregated neighborhood. We accept Dr. Pous-saint\u2019s statement, as we do all of the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, as true. The affidavit itself, however, indicates that the thrust of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints is directed toward the maintenance by defendants of segregated housing conditions and not toward any specific act which may be actionable under the statutes in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">. See Congressional Record, volume 114, no. 17, p. S-983 (sponsor\u2019s summary of proposed legislation) ; pp. S-984-94 (remarks of Senators M\u00f3ndale and Brooke) ; no. 18, pp. S-1055-6 (remarks of Senator Tydings) ; no. 19, pp. S-1184-90 (remarks of Senators Javits, Hart and Kennedy) ; no. 36, p.

It is clear also that this holding will not prevent a judicial determination of appel-lees\u2019 alleged discrimination and non-compliance with the provisions of Title VIII. Shortly after the entry of the order dismissing this action, five Negroes, represented by the counsel for appellants here, filed a class action in the Northern District of California, Burbridge, et al. v. Parkmerced Corporation, et al., No. C-71-378, pursuant to sections 3612 and 1982, alleging that each of them had been denied housing \u201cbecause of his or her race, color, religion, and/or national origin.\u201d The complaint contains allegations similar to those set forth in the complaints in this action. Counsel informed the court at oral argument that the defendants did not challenge plaintiffs\u2019 standing to sue in that case; that an answer has been filed, and some depositions have been taken. Moreover, the present action is not a class action and would, of course, only determine the right of plaintiffs themselves to damages and injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1221-12\">. In comparing \u00a7 1982 with the Civil Rights Act of 1968 the Court noted that \u00a7 1982 \u201cmakes no provision for intervention by the Attorney General\u201d and is applicable \u201conly to racial discrimination in the rental or sale of property and enforceable only by private parties acting on their own initiative * * 392 U.S. at 414, 417, 88 S.Ct. at 2191.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1221-15\">.
