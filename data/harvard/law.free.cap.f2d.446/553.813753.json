The conviction was affirmed. State v. Wilwording, 394 S.W.2d 383 (Mo.1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-19\">Appellant then attacked the conviction collaterally pursuant to Mo.R.Crim.P. 27.26, V.A.M.R., alleging, inter alia, that even though his attorney had filed a brief in the Missouri Supreme Court, his failure to present an oral argument to that court constituted a denial of effective representation by counsel in violation of his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and under Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of Missouri. The sentencing court\u2019s denial of this motion was affirmed. Wilwording v. State, 438 S.W.2d 447 (Mo.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-20\">On July 17, 1969, appellant filed a petition in the federal district court alleging seven grounds in support of the issuance of. a writ of habeas corpus, including the denial of effective assistance of counsel. As to the six allegations which pertained to the validity of his conviction, including the denial of effective representation, Chief Judge Becker, in an exhaustive opinion, dismissed the petition with prejudice, and no timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>appeal was taken. Wilwording v. Swenson, 331 F.Supp. 1188 (W.D.Mo., Oct. 6, 1969) . The seventh ground, asserting that appellant\u2019s confinement to maximum security with consequent loss of privileges contravened federally protected rights, was dismissed without prejudice for failure to exhaust then available state remedies. <em>Id. </em>That issue reached this court in a separate proceeding. Wilwording v. Swenson, 439 F.2d 1331 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">On November 3, 1970, appellant filed another petition for habeas corpus in the same district court, alleging, inter alia, the same six grounds which had been denied with prejudice in his previous habeas corpus action. Chief Judge Becker, in a soundly reasoned opinion and order, considered the merits of the newly initiated contentions, but relying, rightly we think, upon Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 83 S.Ct. 1068, 10 L.Ed.2d 148 (1963), refused to reconsider the six grounds already litigated, including the claimed ineffective representation, giving controlling weight to his previous denial on the merits of those precise issues, Wilwording v. Swenson, 326 F.Supp. 1145 (W.D.Mo., Nov. 12, 1970) .</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Appellant here presents only the contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in the state courts in connection with the original trial and appeal. We decline to reach the merits of that contention because, upon review of the petitions of July 17, 1969, and November 3, 1970, and the respective decisions denying them, supra, we concur with the district court that it was unnecessary to reconsider that issue in the order presently appealed. <em>Sanders </em>teaches that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">\u201cControlling weight may be given to denial of a prior application for federal habeas corpus or \u00a7 2255 relief only if (1) the same ground presented in the subsequent application was determined adversely to the applicant on the prior application, (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ends of justice would not be served by reaching the merits of the subsequent application.\u201d 373 U.S. at 15, 83 S.Ct. at 1077.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">See also Harris v. Brewer, 434 F.2d 166, 168, n. 3 (8th Cir. 1970). The ability to focus judicial attention upon the pressing and legitimate claims of <em>all </em>litigants requires that, at some point, there be an end to the litigation of <em>each </em>claim or ground for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
