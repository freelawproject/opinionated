The principle issue on appeal is whether a prosecutorial conflict of interest deprived the Appellee due process of law. The petition arose out of the Appellee\u2019s conviction by a jury, in 1963, in Ohio on four counts of unlawful possession for sale, and four counts of unlawful sale of narcotics. He received consecutive sentences totaling 90 to 180 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-16\">The <em>alleged </em>constitutional deprivation arose out of the following stipulated facts. The Appellee was arrested by the Dayton, Ohio police on December 17, 1962, and released on bail on January 21, 1963. Approximately three months later, on April 16, 1963, the Appellee\u2019s trial began. During the three month interval, the Appellee \u201cpaid a number of visits\u201d to the law offices of Mr. Robert L. Abrahamson, an attorney at law. Abrahamson practiced in partnership with two other attorneys, one of whom, Mr. Keith A. Saeks, ultimately, as counsel for the State, helped prosecute the Appellee. During these visits, the Ap-pellee \u201cdiscussed the facts surrounding his narcotics charge with Mr. Abraham-son.\u201d The stipulation further provides that on one visit, the Appellee was accompanied to Abrahamson\u2019s office by Paul J. Looney, the police informant to whom the Appellee had made the four sales of narcotics that resulted in his convictions. Looney, according to the Appellee\u2019s brief, was a narcotics addict, who depended upon money supplied by the police to assuage his habit. Under police instructions, Looney deliberately lied to Abrahamson concerning the facts of the case, making statements to the effect that the Appellee was not guilty of the narcotics charges after all. The stipulation concludes that Abrahamson did not represent the Appellee at his trial; rather that the Appellee was ultimately represented by Mr. Clarence Stewart, another Dayton attorney. Prior to the Appellee\u2019s trial, Abraham-son and Stewart discussed the statements made by Looney to Abrahamson.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-17\">On these facts, the district court held, first, that the possibility that Abraham-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>son communicated facts the Appellee had related to him to Saeks, his partner and the prosecutor, was sufficient to justify a finding of impermissible conflict of interest depriving the Appellee his Fourteenth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Second, the district court held that the police use of Lon-ey to lie to the defense was constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">We treat first the district court\u2019s holding that the relationship between Saeks, the prosecutor, and Abrahamson, the lawyer with whom the Appellee discussed the case, created a conflict of interest which, <em>per se, </em>deprived the Appel-lee of due process. The district court held it unnecessary for the Appellee to show that he was prejudiced; according to the court, the mere fact of \u201cpossible communication among the partners in the firm about the case deprived him due process.\u201d The district court noted, as do we, that the Appellee \u201cdoes not allege that he can prove there was any discussion among the partners about his case\u201d and that \u201cmoreover, after some initial meetings [between Abrahamson and the Appellee], petitioner hired another lawyer and he was not represented by the firm in which the prosecutor was a partner.\u201d The district court did not say, and the record does not disclose, whether the Appellee ever retained Abrahamson in the first place, or whether he ever considered himself to have been represented by Abrahamson. Furthermore, if the Appellee was, at one time, represented by Abrahamson, the record does not disclose why he fired Abrahamson and hired Stewart.. Finally, the record does not indicate either that there was a disclosure of confidential information by Abrahamson to Saeks, or that there was an opportunity for such disclosure. On the current state of the record, it is just as likely that Abraham-son and Saeks neither spoke with each other, nor had the opportunity to do so, during any of the relevant time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The district court held that the mere relationship between the Appellee, Abra-hamson, and Saeks created an appearance of impropriety and unfairness that jeopardized public respect for law. Respect for the system could best be maintained, the court held, by granting the writ. On the present record, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\"> The danger to be apprehended in the instant ease is that Abrahamson, having been entrusted by the Appellee with confidential information, intentionally or inadvertently disclosed all or part of it to Saeks, who used it during the course of the prosecution. While we do not doubt that such circumstances would warrant a grant of the writ, we do not find them present on the record of this case. To hold otherwise, we would have to assume that the relationship between Abrahamson and the Appellee was one entitling the Appellee to confidentiality. More need be established in the proof of a confidential relationship than that an attorney and a defendant \u201cdiscussed the facts surrounding\u201d the alleged offense. <em>See generally </em>C. T. McCormick, Evidence 183-86 (1954 ed.). We would have to assume that the statements made were entitled to confidentiality, having been stated in confidence and being of a kind to which the privilege attaches. <em>See id. </em>at 186-94. We would have to assume that Saeks and Abra-hamson had access to one another and an opportunity to exchange the confidential information. Most importantly, we would have to assume that Abrahamson and Saeks did, in fact, exchange such information. The Appellee argues that this last assumption would follow logically'from the foregoing, <em>i.e., </em>that all involved here is \u201cthe most routine of daily events \u2014 an informal chat between law partners. Perhaps these two partners might have casually discussed Mr. Manuel\u2019s case over lunch or after-hours cocktails on some uneventful day over eight years ago.\u201d The short answer to this postulate is that the courts are not free to presume, without evidence to the contrary, that their officers, given opportunities to disclose their clients\u2019 confidences, so casually betray them even to members of their law firms. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>contrary, the courts must indulge every reasonable presumption that lawyers for criminal defendants will behave in a lawful, ethical manner and in good faith. The Appellee levels some strong charges, and they must be supported by evidence. They do not follow logically, or reasonably, from the mere fact that the Appel-lee \u201cdiscussed the facts\u201d of his case with an attorney who was in the same law firm as the attorney who prosecuted him. The more reasonable inference, on this record, is that the apparent conflict was, if at all, an inadvertent one, and that Abrahamson made no disclosures whatsoever. We are conscious of the need to maintain public respect for law, however we are not ready to presume, as a matter of law and without clear proof to the contrary, that attorneys entrusted with their clients\u2019 secrets so casually betray them \u201cover lunch * * * \u201d etc. Such a presumption would irreparably undermine public trust in the administration of justice, and, having no basis in fact, would do so unjustifiably.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Appellee cites Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), among other cases, for the proposition that disclosure or prejudice need not be proved in the instant case. <em>Glasser, </em>however, involved a conflict whereunder two co-defendants, whose defenses to criminal charges were inconsistent, were represented, under court appointment, by the same lawyer. Since the attorney might not have been able to get one of his clients off without inculpating the other, the Supreme Court held that his representation was inadequate and denied the defendant Glasser effective assistance as a matter of law. In <em>Glasser, </em>unlike the instant case, prejudice to the defendant need not have been proved because it was a logical and necessary consequence of the conflict. In the instant case, however, prejudice was not a necessary consequence or even a reasonable inference, for the foregoing reasons. <em>See also </em>Jones v. Baker, 406 F.2d 739, 740 (10th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Turning to the district court\u2019s alternative ground for granting relief, we do not believe that Looney\u2019s statements to Abrahamson, alone, are sufficient ground for habeas corpus. We do know, by way of stipulation, that Abrahamson discussed Looney\u2019s statements with Stewart, who ultimately defended the Appellee, however, we have no way of knowing whether they had any impact at all upon the defense, or were, in any way, prejudicial. Again, the Court is of the opinion that prejudice was not a necessary consequence of Looney\u2019s statements to Abrahamson, whose relationship with the Appellee is unclear, and who did not represent the Appellee in court. We therefore believe a <em>per se </em>rule is inappropriate. The district court cited Caldwell v. United States, 92 U.S.App.D.C. 355, 205 F.2d 879 (1953), for the proposition that prejudice need not be shown where the police attempt to invade the attorney-client relationship, assuming there was one here In <em>Caldwell, </em>however, the spy was a government agent, who, by posing as a defense assistant, completely infiltrated and gained free access to the defense. As a \u201cdouble agent\u201d he listened to the interrogation by defense counsel of witnesses and had free access to all defense records. Most importantly, however, in <em>Caldwell, </em>the court found that the agent actually reported back to the prosecution information he gleaned by his invasion of the attorney-client relationship. It is true that in <em>Caldwell </em>there was \u201cmuch controversy as to whether Bradley [the agent] actually interfered with or prejudiced the defense.\u201d 205 F.2d at 880. But, the court held, the gross intrusion upon the defense, and the infiltration of the attorney-client relationship obviated the need for a showing of prejudice. <em>See also </em>Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 304-309, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In the instant ease, the penetration of the attorney-client relationship, assuming one existed between Abrahamson and the Appellee, consisted of a single visit by Looney to Abrahamson\u2019s office. There is no allegation that Looney overheard incriminating statements, or otherwise monitored the defense. The stip<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>ulation does not even strictly provide that Looney lied to Abrahamson. It states that Looney \u201cmade a statement to the attorney [Abrahamson] the import of which, if true, would be to exonerate Richard Manuel on the pending narcotics charge.\u201d There is no contention that Abrahamson in any way acted upon this statement, or that Stewart, who ultimately represented the Appellee, believed it or acted upon it. Indeed, on the current record, it may be assumed that Stewart, as the Appellee\u2019s defense attorney, personally interviewed Looney and was told the truth. In any event, the likelihood of prejudice to the Appel-lee is sufficiently remote and speculative that it should be proven. Hoffa v. United States, <em>swpm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">We believe, for the reasons stated, that the stipulation of the parties does not provide grounds sufficient for ha-beas corpus relief. We are therefore of the opinion that the judgment of the district court must be vacated, and that this cause must be remanded for an evi-dentiary hearing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
