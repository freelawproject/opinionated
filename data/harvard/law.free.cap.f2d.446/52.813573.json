After unsuccessful challenge to the constitutionality of this statute through the hierarchy of state courts, plaintiff brought this action in the District Court for the Western District of New York, seeking to enjoin enforcement of the limit provided by the statute as violating the Fourteenth Amendment rights of its members and asking for the convocation of a three-judge court. Feder<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>al jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Chief Judge Henderson dismissed the complaint on the ground that the right to augment police salaries by outside work was not a \u201cpersonal right\u201d within the scope of the Civil Rights Act, citing as authority, binding upon him, this court\u2019s decision in Tichon v. Harder, 438 F.2d 1396 (2 Cir. 1971). While we do not quarrel with that view, the action should also have been dismissed on the ground properly asserted in the answer, see F.R.Civ.P. 8(c), that the state judgment was <em>res adjudicata. </em>Having lost in the state courts, plaintiff\u2019s remedy was to seek review by the Supreme Court. The Civil Rights Act, unlike federal habeas corpus, does not permit a second bite at the cherry. Howe v. Brouse, 422 F.2d 347 (8 Cir. 1970); Scott v. California Supreme Court, 426 F.2d 300 (9 Cir. 1970). We add for good measure that the constitutional challenge was unsubstantial and the complaint could properly have been dismissed on that ground also.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
