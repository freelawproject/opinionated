Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1455-31\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1455-32\">The appellant was convicted by a jury of interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312. After sentencing, the appellant\u2019s court-appointed attorney filed a notice of appeal in his behalf, but now moves this Court to relieve him as appellate counsel on grounds that the appeal is frivolous. In compliance with Anders v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493, counsel has supplemented his motion with a brief. Therein he states that after a conscientious examination of the record, he can find no issue which might arguably support the appeal. The appellant himself has been advised of his right to respond to counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1398\">*1398</page-number>motion by raising any points he claims are appealable. He has failed to submit any such reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">We have carefully \u25a0 reviewed the entire record in this case and find no arguable merit in the appeal. We, therefore, dismiss the appeal under Local Rule 18, and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. See United States v. Minor, 5th Cir. 1971, 444 F.2d 521; Lemus v. Government of Canal Zone, 5th Cir. 1971, 443 F.2d 23.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
