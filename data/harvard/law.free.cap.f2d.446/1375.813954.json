McGrath Corp., stevedores, was injured while engaged in an unloading operation from the M/V Beersheva, a vessel owned by Zim Israel Navigation Co. The accident occurred when a loading platform on which plaintiff and a coworker were standing suddenly became dislodged causing plaintiff to fall. The Trial Court found that the platform was not an appurtenance of the vessel and that the cargo sling being used in the unloading operation did not render the vessel unseaworthy. Liability was premised upon the theory that an act of plaintiff\u2019s co-worker caused the accident and that \u201ca ship is rendered unseaworthy when longshoremen make negligent use of seaworthy equipment.\u201d 297 F.Supp. 378, 382. Judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff against Zim Israel and McGrath did not dispute its indemnity obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-15\">Despite the seeming incongruity of holding that a seaworthy vessel can be instantaneously transformed into an unseaworthy condition by a negligent act of a stevedore\u2019s employee, this court felt bound by previous decisions of the Supreme Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> II.and its own decisions in reliance thereon<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to affirm the judgment. At the same time the court recognized that conflict existed between the Circuits (the Fifth<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Ninth<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) but said that it was for the Supreme Court \u201cto resolve the apparent conflict between the Circuits.\u201d 417 F.2d 476, 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-16\">This resolution has now been made by the Supreme Court in Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562 (1971) but not without vigorous dissent by four Justices thereof. 400 U.S. at 501-504, 91 S.Ct. 514. The majority opinion reviewed the many cases which over the years have created the problem and came to the conclusion that it would be erroneous \u201cwhere no condition of unseaworthiness existed, to hold the shipowner liable for a third party\u2019s single and wholly unforeseeable act of negligence.\u201d 400 U.S. at 500, 91 S.Ct. at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-17\">Upon Zim Israel\u2019s petition, certiorari was granted (four Justices dissenting), the judgment vacated and the case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>remanded \u201cfor further consideration in the light of Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corp., 400 U.S. 494, 91 S.Ct. 514, 27 L.Ed.2d 562, decided January 25, 1971.\u201d 401 U.S. 930, 91 S.Ct. 914, 28 L.Ed.2d 211 (1971). Such consideration has now been given in the light of that decision and the case is remanded to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York with instructions to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1434-10\">.
