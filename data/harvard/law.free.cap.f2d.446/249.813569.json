The defendant, Dr. Small, was at the time a medical examiner for the Superior Court and acting within the scope of his employment. Plaintiff sought general and exemplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-23\">The district court dismissed upon the grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations and that the appellee was immune from liability for the act charged. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-24\">Although the complaint, filed in October 1970, does not state its basis for federal jurisdiction, we assume it charges a violation of her civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. That statute contains no limitation period but resort may be had to the California law. A liability \u201ccreated by statute\u201d must be brought within three years. Cal.Code Civ.P. \u00a7 338(1). As such her action is barred. Donovan v. Reinbold, 433 F.2d 738 (9th Cir. 1970); Smith v. Cremins, 308 F.2d 187 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-25\">In addition, Dr. Small was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity and was immune from liability for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Burkes v. Callion, 433 F.2d 318 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-26\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
