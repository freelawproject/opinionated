On this appeal, the assertions of error by the appellant are:</p>\n<p id=\"b706-25\">1. Whether the proof of an offense not charged in the indictment and the introduction of evidence obtained upon the arrest of McClain for that offense for the purpose of showing, scheme, knowledge, and intent were error?</p>\n<p id=\"b706-26\">2. Whether introduction of the objected to exhibits was error when two of these exhibits were obtained from McClain before he was advised of his rights?</p>\n<p id=\"b706-27\">3. Whether admission of evidence of McClain\u2019s flight and concealing of evidence and evidence relating to the mass theft of identification and credit cards was error?</p>\n<p id=\"b706-40\">4.
