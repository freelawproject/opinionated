He was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659 on his plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">On this appeal he contends that the two suitcases did not constitute a part of an interstate shipment within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659, because they had reached their final destination and had been delivered by the common carrier to airport employees. We reject this contention. While the baggage had arrived in the state of destination it had not been delivered to its owner so that the interstate shipment was not yet complete. <em>Cf., </em>United States v. Maddox, 394 F.2d 297 (4 Cir. 1968). Therefore, Jones\u2019 unlawful taking of the suitcases constituted a clear violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 659.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-17\">Deeming oral argument unnecessary, we grant the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance, and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
