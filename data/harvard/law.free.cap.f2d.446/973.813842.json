Charlotte-Mecklen-burg Board of Education, 1971, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554. We think that the district court, because of its familiarity with local conditions, should have the first opportunity to determine whether the school desegregation plan the court approved for the Board of Education of the City of Fair-field, Alabama, complies with the principles established in the <em>Swann </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-29\">We remand this cause therefore to the district court for it to determine <em>forthwith </em>the acceptability of the school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>board\u2019s student assignment plan. In making this determination the court should consider the feasibility and advantages of clustering schools or non-contiguous zoning. The district court should also consider whether the school board is in compliance with the <em>Singleton </em>requirements for faculty ratios and whether the location of a high school complex in a black neighborhood will tend to promote segregation as alleged by plaintiffs-appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">The case is remanded to the district court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Costs shall be divided between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">The Clerk is directed to issue the mandate forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
