Inc. v. Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1444-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1444-10\">This is an appeal from appellant Kidd\u2019s jury conviction for conspiring to cause forged and falsely made securities to be transported in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 2314. Only one point of error is raised, i. e., that the trial court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial made on account of a particular witness\u2019 testimonial references to appellant\u2019s \u201ccharacter.\u201d The two allegedly prejudicial statements, following one after the other, were as follows: On direct examination by the Government, the witness was asked, \u201cDid you' see or hear from Mr. Kidd thereafter?\u201d The witness replied, \u201cYeah, after I got arrested, I called him at his place of business and we just talked in general about me being arrested and him being arrested in Cobb County.\u201d [Transcript at 34]. The very next question asked the witness by the Government attorney was, \u201cDid you have any conversation with the defendant about the checks in question here or about passing the cheeks at that time?\u201d The witness answered, \u201cHe offered to make me some, the same deal he made to Johnson, was his statement, and he talked about being arrested in Birmingham.\u201d [Transcript at 35]. It is to the witness\u2019 references to appellant\u2019s arrests that objection is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-12\">After both these statements the appellant\u2019s attorney objected and moved for a mistrial. Both times the motions\u2019 for mistrial were denied. Immediately following the second reference to appellant\u2019s arrest, however, the trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-13\">Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, that statement made by Mr. Karras will go out. You are so admonished to disregard the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-14\">This specific admonition to the jury to disregard the statement had been preceded by the following general preliminary instructions to the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-15\">The defendant is not on trial for any act or conduct not alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-16\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-17\">If any objection to a question 'is sustained by the court, or any evidence is ordered stricken by the court, the jury must disregard the question of the evidence entirely and may draw no inference from the wording of the question, or speculate what a witness would have answered, or to speculate why evidence was ordered stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"Axnz\">We have examined this Record carefully and have concluded that the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury was sufficient to cure any prejudice that may have resulted from the witness\u2019 utterances of the questioned statements. We note that it was immediately after the second statement that the trial judge interposed his instruction. As a general rule, this Court has stated that evidence withdrawn from the jury with a direction by the court that it is to be disregarded may not be the basis of reversible error. United States v. Pritchard, 5th Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 327, 328. Only in cases in which the remark is so high<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1387\">*1387</page-number>ly prejudicial as to be incurable is the trial court\u2019s instruction considered insufficient. Our review of this case indicates that, in the context of the whole trial below, these two remarks did not prejudice the appellant. As indicated by Leonard v. United States, 5th Cir. 1967, 386 F.2d 423, a reference to a prior arrest does not absolutely connote guilt. In this case, moreover, as in <em>Leonard, </em>the references were volunteered inadvertently, and were not provoked by the Government attorney\u2019s questioning. The evidence against appellant in this case was easily sufficient to support the jury verdict he received. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
