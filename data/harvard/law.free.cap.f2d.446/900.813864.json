The district court concluded that the petitioner\u2019s allegations were without merit and invoked the presumption of the correctness of state court findings. There is nothing in the record now before us which indicates the district court made an independent review of the record of the state hearing before relying upon the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>court findings. It appears that the reporter\u2019s transcript of the state court trial was not even filed or lodged with the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">We have held that a federal district court may rely upon state court findings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d) in a petition by a state court prisoner for habeas corpus only after an independent review has been made of the transcript of the state hearing. Selz v. California, 423 F.2d 702, 703 (9th Cir. 1970), and other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
