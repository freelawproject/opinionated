On July 8, 1965, appellants filed a new administrative Claim in the amount of $2,100.00. In light of failure of the Government to act on this Claim, appellants filed the instant action on July 28, 1966 \u2014 two years after the accident occurred \u2014 seeking $2,000.00 personal injury damages for Mrs. Schwartz and $100.00 property damages to the automobile which was owned by appellant Milton S. Schwartz.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-15\">The District Court, to which the case was tried, on September 16, 1969, awarded damages of $2,100.00 to appellants. In doing so, the District Court held that the plaintiffs had failed to sustain their burden \u201cof showing us any newly discovered evidence or intervening facts,\u201d bearing on Mrs. Schwartz\u2019 injuries, and accordingly their claim \u201cmust be limited to the amount claimed before the [federal] agency\u201d under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2675(b), which provides that \u201cAction under this section shall not be instituted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1382\">*1382</page-number>for any sum in excess of the amount of the claim [$2,100.00] presented to the federal agency, except where the increased amount is based upon newly discovered evidence not reasonably discoverable at the time of presenting the claim to the federal agency, or upon allegation and proof of intervening facts, relating to the amount of the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">Appellants here urge that the District Court erred in its finding that they had failed to sustain their burden of showing newly discovered evidence or intervening facts relating to their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">On review of the trial record, we cannot say that the District Court erred in the respects stated. On this score, we note that the administrative Claim seeking damages of $2,100.00 was filed a year after the accident occurred, and the instant action seeking the same amount was filed two years after the accident, and that during the entire two year period Mrs. Schwartz frequently consulted various physicians, with respect to the injuries sustained in her accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">The Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1439-16\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7, 2371 et seq., and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
