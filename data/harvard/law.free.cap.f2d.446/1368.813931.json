Varney complains that the district court erred in remanding the case without hearing his allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">Varney\u2019s indictment for theft by deception resulted from the alleged sale of stock in World Wide Import &amp; Export, Inc. when no such company existed in Georgia. Varney lists the eight claims set out in the margin as supporting his right to remove.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Varney could establish the validity of these claims, it is patent that none of them support removal under Section 1443. Thus the district court did not err in refusing to conduct a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\"> To support removal under Section 1443(1), it is necessary that the defendant claim rights under a law \u201cproviding for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality.\u201d Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966). <em>See also </em>Georgia v. Spencer, 441 F.2d 397 (5th Cir. 1971). Varney\u2019s contentions have nothing to do with racial equality. Section 1443(2) is equally unavailable since its provisions are limited to federal officers and those authorized to act for them or under them. City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S. 808, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-19\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court must be</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1426-15\">. \u00a7 1443.
