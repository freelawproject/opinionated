The publicity consisted of a few newspaper stories. The pretrial accounts gave some of Hitchcock\u2019s personal history and his and certain eyewitnesses\u2019 versions of the homicide. The newspaper stories published during the trial simply reported the course of the trial. We have examined the clippings, and we find nothing in them that supports his assertion that their publication deprived him of a fair trial. <em>(See, e. g., </em>Evans v. Arizona (9th Cir. 1969) 410 F.2d 1122; Gawne v. United States (9th Cir. 1969) 409 F.2d 1399, cert. denied (1970) 397 U.S. 943, 90 S.Ct. 956, 25 L.Ed.2d 123; Loraine v. United States (9th Cir.) 396 F.2d 335, cert. denied (1968) 393 U.S. 933, 89 S.Ct. 292, 21 L.Ed.2d 270.)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-17\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-14\">. In 1958 petitioner was convicted of first degree murder. His conviction was affirmed by the Arizona Supreme Court in State v. Hitchcock (1960) 87 Ariz. 277, 350 P.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-15\">After exhausting his state court remedies, petitioner filed a petition for federal habeas relief on June 13, 1968. This court reversed a denial of the petition and remanded to give petitioner an opportunity to amend his petition in Hitchcock v. Eyman (9th Cir. 1969) 418 F.2d 1245.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-28\">The present petition comprises a consolidation of the first petition and a second filed during petitioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
