Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District (en banc), 5 Cir., 1970, 419 F.2d 1211; Id. 425 F.2d 1211, insofar as they relate to the issues in this case, and which reflects any changes in conditions relating to school desegregation in Bessemer since the time of this court\u2019s decree of August 28, 1970 [No. 29209]. See also Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 5 Cir., 1970, 432 F.2d 875.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">The district court is further ordered to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the subject of school closings and proposed construction of school facilities to determine whether or not the school board\u2019s actions are or have been racially motivated and in compliance with Swann, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-21\">The district court shall require the school board to file semi-annual reports during the school year similar to those required in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir., 1970, 433 F.2d 611, at 618-619.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-22\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-23\">Vacated and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
