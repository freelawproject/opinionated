App. \u00a7 462 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The local board\u2019s denial of his request for conscientious objector classification was not erroneous. Appellant\u2019s SSS Form 150 was submitted after the mailing of a valid induction order, and the Form failed to show a change in circumstances beyond the registrant\u2019s control since all that was presented was conscientious objection which had crystallized after receipt of the induction order. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2; Ehlert v. United States, 422 F.2d 332 (Ninth Cir. 1970), affirmed 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (April 21, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Further, the denial by the local board of appellant\u2019s request for an occupational deferment was not erroneous. Since the request was made after the receipt of the induction order, the registrant was required to state not only a <em>prima facie </em>case substantively for the deferment itself, but also a <em>prima facie </em>case for a change in circumstances beyond his control. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2; United States v. Stacey, 441 F.2d 508 (Ninth Cir., 1971). Even assuming that appellant did make a <em>prima facie </em>showing for the deferment itself, still the facts which he presented to the local board did not indicate that his employment status had changed after the mailing of his induction order. Accordingly, there was no <em>prima facie </em>statement of a change in circumstances beyond his control, and the board was correct in not reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Finally, since the local board did not err in either instance in refusing to reopen the registrant\u2019s classification, the registrant had no right to a personal appearance of which he could have been deprived. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1624.1, 1624.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
