On appeal the shipowner claims the liability over of the stevedore (Mc-Grath) and/or the shipper (Westinghouse), contributory negligence of the plaintiff, an error in the trial court\u2019s charge on unseaworthiness, and an excessive award of damages to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">The jury found no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, no negligence on the part of Westinghouse, 100 per cent liability for unseaworthiness on the part of the shipowner and $49,571.00 damages. On consideration of all of the evidence, the trial court found that there was no factual basis in the light of the verdict for a finding that any of the stevedore\u2019s employees could have known the slats were insufficient, and directed judgment for the stevedore on the shipowner\u2019s third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-13\">The court also dismissed the third-party complaint against the shipper on the basis that the shipper could not be held to have breached any implied warranty that the crates were fit for their contemplated shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-14\">Appellant\u2019s main argument as to plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence and for liability over against the stevedore, the shipper or both, is based on the testimony of plaintiff\u2019s fellow worker and eye witness Pizzo. Pizzo testified that the slats on the crate in question were four in number, about four feet long, \u201cabout a quarter of an inch\u201d thick and \u201cabout an inch and a half, two inches\u201d wide. These were supposed to be the top slats of the crate for a transformer, a crate, according to this witness, 4 feet wide, 4 feet long and 5 feet 5 inches high. On the strength of that testimony the shipowner argues that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent and that the stevedore was liable over because \u2014 even though the plaintiff was found by the jury not to be contributorily negligent\u2014 his fellow employees should have seen the danger in the situation and should have laid a flooring over the crates, as with dunnage, before permitting its employees to walk over them. Failure to do so, the argument runs, was a breach of the stevedore\u2019s implied warranty of workmanlike performance. Mortensen v. A/S Glittre, 348 F.2d 383, 385 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-15\">Similarly on the strength of Pizzo\u2019s testimony, the shipowner seeks indemnity from the shipper on the ground that quarter-inch slats on a crate were not built to sustain the weight of a longshoreman, and that the shipper should have known that longshoremen walk on crates during cargo operations. Simpson Timber Co. v. Parks, 390 F.2d 353 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>Cir.), cert. denied 393 U.S. 858, 89 S.Ct. 126, 21 L.Ed.2d 127 (1968). This case presents, then, the unusual factual situation where the shipowner\u2019s defense against the injured plaintiff and claims over against the third parties turns on the defendant\u2019s asserting the credibility of plaintiff\u2019s own witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-4\">We agree with the conclusion of the court below that the jury, in finding the plaintiff not contributorily negligent, discarded his fellow worker\u2019s testimony as to the slat dimensions. That testimony was countered by plaintiff\u2019s own Exhibit 5, setting forth the dimensions and specifications for export crates for Westinghouse transformers. These show the top slats should have been I\"x6\"x25\", and three in number, to be nailed with ordinary 8d nails. The 1\" thickness is specified, but, as plaintiff\u2019s witness Swift, the Westinghouse shipping and packaging foreman, testified, the rough finished wood, ponderosa pine or spruce, was actually closer to <em>%\" </em>in thickness. The dimensions for each crate varied slightly with the voltage and size of the transformer, according to the foreman Swift, who supervised the crating operation, from 26\"x26\"x47\" to 36\"x38\"x60\" overall.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From his testimony it appeared that the crates for this shipment were built according to specification. One hundred two of these crates, weighing a total of 68,025 pounds, i. e., approximately 667 pounds each on the average, were stowed in the No. 5 hatch, 85 of them in the lower hold aft, where the plaintiff\u2019s injury occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\">There was ample testimony permitting the jury to infer that the injury occurred as the result of a latent defect in one of the slats which was between 26\" and 36\" long, 5\" and 7\" wide, and <em>%\" </em>and 1\" thick. There was expert evidence from a marine surveyor who had considerable maritime experience with general cargoes, including transformers, justifying a jury finding that transformers crated \u00a1according to the shipper\u2019s specifications! would readily support a longshoreman\u2019s weight and would customarily be handled by walking on top of crates already stowed, building up the level of the cargo all around, without using dun-nage for walking purposes. Besides this affirmative evidence the jury did not have tp leave its common sense outside the jury room: the idea of crating 600-pound i transformers with orange-crate slats, */4\" thick and 1 y2\" or 2\" wide, as Pizzo \u2014 [-no doubt out of overzealous regard for his fellow worker\u2019s injuries\u2014 would ihave had the jury believe were used, strikes us as incredible on its face. Every; longshoreman walking on the crates \u00a1would have been injured and the transformers in a shambles had this been the case. Rather, the jury chose to believe the plaintiff\u2019s and Westinghouse\u2019s proof that the transformers were crated according to specifications; it is precisely bn this basis that the verdict may be explained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-13\">With Pizzo\u2019s slat-dimension testimony out of the case, the Venezuelan Line\u2019s,case on liability tumbles, like the proverbial house of cards. The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent as a matter of law in doing something customarily done; similarly the stevedore\u2019s other employees could not be required to have foreseen any danger from following this customary stevedoring practice. While the shipper\u2019s liability stands on a different footing, there is no requirement that a shipper provide an absolutely safe container on which longshoremen or crew may walk. It is enough that the shipper be free from negligence. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1304(3), to which the instant bill of lading was subject, so provides.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Act here applies. Serrano v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>States Lines, 238 F.Supp. 383, 388 (S.D.N.Y.1965). Unlike Simpson Timber Co. v. Parks, 390 F.2d 353 (9th Cir.), cert. denied 393 U.S. 858, 89 S.Ct. 126, 21 L.Ed.2d 127 (1968), the jury here found no negligence on the part of the shipper; in <em>Simpson </em>the jury found that the shipper had negligently packaged a bundle of doors and failed to warn of the danger. 390 F.2d at 355.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">The trial court\u2019s charge on seaworthiness, objected to also, was that if the jury found that plaintiff was injured \u201cwhen a slat on a crate on which he was standing during the course of his work broke, then you must find that the shipowner was liable to the plaintiff.\u201d While this is very brief and to the point and not containing the usual \u201cseaworthiness\u201d boilerplate, it produced no error in this case in light of the jury\u2019s obvious rejection of Pizzo\u2019s testimony that the slats were only thick, for as the court pointed out the presence of a cargo container or crate with a latent defect causing injury renders a vessel unseaworthy. Gutierrez v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 373 U.S. 206, 212-213, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297 (1963); Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., 369 U.S. 355, 364, 82 S.Ct. 780, 7 L.Ed. 2d 798 (1962); Reddick v. McAllister Lighterage Line, Inc., 258 F.2d 297, 299 (2d Cir. 1958). While it may seem unfair to a shipowner that he be held responsible for a latent defect in a cargo container, he can recover over if he proves the shipper negligent, Simpson Timber Co. v. Parks, supra, 390 F.2d at 355, and the doctrine of unseaworthiness is not exactly a narrow one. Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d 941 (1960); Oliveras v. American Export Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc., 431 F.2d 814 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-10\">The shipowner complains that the verdict of $49,000 plus medical expense of $571 is excessive. Appellant concedes that the plaintiff\u2019s loss of earnings up to the date of his retirement was $4,725, and indeed the jury could have found it was in excess of $6,000. Moreover, plaintiff was forced to retire at the age of 64 when he had a work life expectancy, according to the U. S. Department of Labor \u201cwork expectancy tables\u201d apparently relied upon by the plaintiff in argument, and not objected to, of six years. At $4 an hour, this alone would have justified a verdict larger than the one rendered. The jury may well have considered, however, that plaintiff would have retired at age 65, but even on that basis the verdict is still supportable. He retired on May 1, 1969; he reached 65 on March 5, 1970; thus, he lost an additional 44 weeks\u2019 wages at $160 per week ($4 per hour), or $7,040. He had a permanent painful injury consisting of a chronic olecranon bursitis; a life expectancy of 13 years; and as symptoms of the injury restricted motion, lack of strength, tenderness and swelling in his elbow. The award here may properly be upheld as one for disability, pain and suffering. At least it is not so excessive as to shock the court\u2019s judicial conscience. Grunenthal v. Long Island R. Co., 393 U.S. 156, 89 S.Ct. 331, 21 L.Ed.2d 309 (1968); Vaccaro v. Alcoa Steamship Co., 405 F.2d 1133, 1139 (2d Cir. 1968); Dagnello v. Long Island R.
