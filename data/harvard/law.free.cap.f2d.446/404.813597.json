Harrison and his wife Gale of the Town of Braintree, Massachusetts, brought this civil rights action against certain officials of said town<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for damages caused by the failure of said officials to enforce the zoning by-laws of the town and for conspiring to protect and prefer the interests of Textron Industries, Inc., which had a factory there, over the legal rights of the plaintiffs. The suit was brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. Jurisdiction is said to be founded on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343. The district court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">The complaint is in ten counts. In the first four, brought solely under \u00a7 1983, Harrison alleges certain \u201cwrongful\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d activity on the part of each of the four named defendants which he claims resulted in damage to him. In Counts V through VIII, also brought under \u00a7 1983 alone, his wife alleges the same \u201cwrongful\u201d and \u201cunlawful\u201d activity by reason of which she claims she also was damaged. Count IX, brought under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985, alleges a conspiracy against Harrison by the defendants and others not named, and Count X alleges a similar conspiracy against his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">The allegations set forth in the complaint are substantially as follows. Plaintiffs and their children have resided in their family home in Braintree since June 1963. The house is located in a residentially zoned area. In January 1964 Textron purchased a thirty-five acre tract located on both sides and in the rear of plaintiffs\u2019 home and constructed a factory in the rear. Driveways to and from the factory extended across the residentially zoned area on both sides of plaintiffs\u2019 home and were used daily by several hundred people, as well as by trucks going to and from the factory. Plaintiffs brought a mandamus proceeding against the building inspector in the state court to compel him to enforce the \u25a0 zoning by-law and thus prevent the aforesaid use of said residentially zoned land for driveways to and from the factory. When the case reached the Supreme Judicial Court on demurrer the court held that, if the facts alleged by the plaintiffs were established, the driveways in question violated the Braintree Zoning By-Laws, but the court ordered that neither the writ nor any compliance order issue prior to June 30, 1966, in order \u201cto give an opportunity for orderly municipal action in respect of providing legal access to land in the industrial zone.\u201d Harrison v. Building Inspector of Braintree, 350 Mass. 559, 563, 215 N.E.2d 773, 776 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-12\">Plaintiffs further allege in Counts IX and X that after this decision the defendants, acting under color of state law, conspired among themselves and with others for the purpose of depriving plaintiffs of their right to equal protection of the law by persuading the Brain-tree planning board to recommend and the town meeting to adopt an unconstitutional and invalid by-law to permit the continued use of said driveways.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs successfully attacked this new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>by-law. On appeal from the Land Court, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that \u201cthe use for industrial access * * * of strips of residentially zoned land on both sides of [plaintiffs\u2019] property is unreasonable as a matter of law.\u201d Harrison v. Town of Braintree, 355 Mass. 651, 656, 247 N.E.2d 356, 360 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The district court dismissed the complaint on two grounds: (1) that there was no statutory basis of jurisdiction for the \u00a7 1983 action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) since the rights asserted by the plaintiffs depend for their existence upon the infringement of property rights, citing Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 841, 91 S.Ct. 82, 27 L.Ed.2d 75 (1970); and (2) that, because statutory authority is a prerequisite for a federal cause of action for damages, jurisdiction cannot be founded solely on the violation of a constitutional right and federal question jurisdiction of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, 409 F.2d 718, 720 (2d Cir. 1969), which was reversed subsequent to the district court\u2019s decision, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (U.S. June 21, 1971). In this opinion we shall consider the jurisdictional adequacy of \u00a7 1343, but because of our decision we need not reach the question of whether the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bivens, supra, </em>applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\"> We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the first eight counts because they do no more than allege \u201cwrongful\u201d conduct by the defendants. Where a state official\u2019s judgment and discretion are of vital concern, we require a showing of purposeful discrimination or at least an allegation that his misdeeds were knowing or reckless. <em>See </em>City of Boston v. Massachusetts Port Authority, 444 F.2d 167 (1st Cir., 1971). <em>Compare </em>Madison v. Manter, 441 F.2d 537 (1st Cir. 1971), and Kelley v. Dunne, 344 F.2d 129, 133 (1st Cir. 1965), <em>with </em>Whirl v. Kern, 407 F.2d 781 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 901, 90 S.Ct. 210, 24 L.Ed.2d 177 (1969). There is a vast difference between alleging an act to be merely \u201cwrongful\u201d or \u201cunlawful\u201d and the \u201c \u2018showing of purposeful discrimination\u2019 * * * necessary in order to raise a claim under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d City of Boston v. Massachusetts Port Authority, <em>supra </em>at 169; <em>see </em>Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U.S. 1, 11, 64 S.Ct. 397, 88 L.Ed. 497 (1943). Although the allegations in the first eight counts are deficient under this test, we think Counts IX and X <em>have </em>sufficiently alleged \u201cpurposeful discrimination.\u201d We therefore move to a closer consideration of those two counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">Because of the focus of argument by both parties, the district court confined its attention to the scope of \u00a7 1343(3), the jurisdictional basis for a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. But in Counts IX and X of their complaint plaintiffs also relied on \u00a7 1985(3), which creates a cause of action \u201c[i] f two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire * * * for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws. * * * \u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of a conspiracy to deprive them of equal protection of the local zoning laws constitute a valid cause of action under \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">Since plaintiffs have alleged more than $10,000 in damages, they could bring this case as a civil action arising under the laws of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The federal courts also have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(1), which provides for jurisdiction over any civil action brought by any person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-14\">\u201cTo recover damages for injury to his person or property, or because of the deprivation of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, by any act done in furtherance of any conspiracy mentioned in section 1985 of Title 42.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Section 1343(1) presents none of the problems raised in Eisen v. Eastman, <em>supra, </em>regarding \u00a7 1343(3) jurisdiction, because both \u00a7 1343(1) and \u00a7 1985 clearly contemplate actions involving property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Furthermore, we think there is arguable jurisdiction in this case under \u00a7 1343(3), even under the interpretation of that provision outlined in Eisen v. Eastman, <em>supra. </em>That case, which involved a constitutional challenge to the New York City rent control laws, held that, generally speaking, \u00a7 1343(3) grants jurisdiction in \u00a7 1983 actions involving \u201cpersonal rights\u201d but not in those involving \u201cproperty rights.\u201d This \u201ccivil rights-property rights\u201d distinction is derived from the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Stone in Hague v. C. I. O., 307 U.S. 496, 518-532, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939), who concluded that \u00a7 1343(3) grants jurisdiction \u201cwhenever the right or immunity is one of personal liberty, not dependent for its existence upon the infringement of property rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531, 59 S.Ct. at 971. A strict reading of this rule would deny \u00a7 1343(3) jurisdiction in the instant case since the civil right, <em>i. e., </em>unequal application of the zoning law, is, in a sense, dependent on a property right, ownership of land in Braintree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Although this court has held that it had jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(3) in at least one \u201cproperty rights\u201d case, Cobb v. City of Malden, 202 F.2d 701 (1st Cir. 1953), it has never had occasion directly to confront the \u201ccivil rights-property rights\u201d distinction. Nor has the distinction ever been expressly applied by the Supreme Court; however, the Court has affirmed, per curiam, cases in which lower courts have applied it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The \u201ccivil rights-property rights\u201d distinction has been adopted by three circuits,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in addition to the Second, and has not been rejected by any federal appellate court that has considered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">As Judge Friendly pointed out in <em>Ei-sen, supra, </em>this distinction is easy to apply in pure property cases <em>(e. g., </em>tax cases), on the one hand, or in pure personal rights cases (e. <em>g., </em>free speech), on the other. But</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-15\">\u201c[gjreater difficulty has been experienced with cases involving denials or revocations of licenses or discharges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>from public employment. These can be viewed about equally well as complaining of a deprivation of the personal liberty to pursue a calling of one\u2019s choice or of the profits or emoluments deriving therefrom.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>421 F.2d at 565.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>Eisen </em>itself did not resolve this problem since the plaintiff in that case alleged no purposeful discrimination, \u201conly the loss of money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 566. A review of subsequent Second Circuit eases, however, seems to suggest that, where there are overtones of a deprivation of a substantial personal right mixed with a deprivation of property rights, the court <em>will </em>take jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(3). <em>See </em>Johnson v. Harder, 438 F.2d 7 (2d Cir. 1971) (rights to welfare payments);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Taylor v. New York City Transit Authority, 433 F.2d 665 (2d Cir. 1970) (dismissal from civil service employment); Gold v. Lomenzo, 425 F.2d 959 (2d Cir. 1970) (revocation of a real estate broker\u2019s license) (Friendly, J.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Tichon v. Harder, 438 F.2d 1396, at 1400 (2d Cir. 1971) (dismissal from public employment without impact on reputation <em>not </em>a \u201cpersonal\u201d right).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">We note further that <em>Eisen </em>cited with apparent approval the case of Burt v. City of New York, 156 F.2d 791 (2d Cir. 1946), a case not unlike the instant one. In <em>Burt, </em>the court took \u00a7 1343(3) jurisdiction in \u201can architect\u2019s damage action against city building officials for purposeful discrimination in rejecting his applications or imposing upon him unlawful conditions while not doing so to others.\u201d <em>Eisen, supra, </em>421 F.2d at 565. Similarly, in National Land &amp; Development Co. v. Specter, note 4 <em>supra, </em>the Third Circuit emphasized that \u201can allegation of a personal vendetta by an elected public official to stifle his political opponents by injuring their business enterprises\u201d <em>would </em>state a claim for which there would be \u00a7 1343(3) jurisdiction. <em>Id., </em>428 F.2d at 100. And in Willis v. Reddin, 418 F.2d 702 (9th Cir. 1969), the court distinguished Howard v. .Higgins, note 4 <em>supra, </em>on the ground that <em>Willis </em>involved \u201csomething more than money,\u201d namely, an attempt to deprive the plaintiff of his right to bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Counts IX and X in the instant case allege a conspiracy to deprive plaintiffs of their personal rights to have the law applied evenly to them by local town officials. We conclude that the allegations in Counts IX and X are sufficient for the court to take jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(1), the jurisdictional counterpart of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). We also conclude that it is very possible that even under <em>Eisen </em>the court would have jurisdiction under \u00a7 1343(3) as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\">.

All three of these cases involved tax statutes, and none involved an allegation of \u201cpurposeful discrimination\u201d against the individual or class to which he belonged. None is inconsistent with the recognition by the court in <em>Abernathy </em>\u201cthat the arbitrary exclusion of a person rightfully belonging to a class of persons legally immune from state taxation is a denial of the \u2018equal protection\u2019 clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Supra, </em>208 F.Supp. at 795. <em>See </em>Snowden v.

The position of the Fifth Circuit is unclear. The distinction was applied in Bussie v. Long, 383 F.2d 766 (5th Cir. 1967). But the court took the position in Atlanta Bowling Center, Inc. v. Allen, 389 F.2d 713, 715 n. 9 (5th Cir. 1968), that the circuit has not expressly adopted it since all prior cases satisfied the \u00a7 1331 $10,000 jurisdictional amount requirement. <em>See generally </em>H.
