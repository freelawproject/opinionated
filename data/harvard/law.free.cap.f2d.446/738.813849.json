A consent decree was entered, reciting that the parties had agreed to a settlement of the action and entry of the decree. It provided that plaintiff\u2019s copyright of the jeweled bee was \u201cgood and valid in law,\u201d that defendants had manufactured a jeweled bee \u201calleged to be similar,\u201d and that defendants were enjoined from infringing plaintiff\u2019s copyright and from manufacturing or selling copies of plaintiff's jeweled bee pin.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-23\">Later plaintiff filed a motion for an order holding defendants in contempt of the consent decree. The district court, after an evidentiary hearing, found that while defendants had manufactured and sold a line of jeweled bee pins, they designed their pins themselves after a study of bees in nature and in published works and did not copy plaintiff\u2019s copyrighted bee. The court further found that defendants\u2019 jeweled bees were \u201cnot substantially similar\u201d to plaintiff\u2019s bees, except that both \u201cdo look like bees.\u201d The court concluded that defendants had neither infringed plaintiff\u2019s copyright nor violated the consent decree, and entered a judgment order denying plaintiff\u2019s motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-24\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b797-25\">Both in this court and below, the parties have assumed that defendants are bound by their concession of the validity of plaintiff\u2019s copyright in the consent decree. Although we accept that assumption for purposes of this litigation, we expressly save the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>whether the line of cases upon which the assumption is based, <em>see </em>Siebring v. Hansen, 346 F.2d 474, 477 (8th Cir. 1965), and cases cited, survived Lear, Inc. v. Adkins, 395 U.S. 653, 89 S.Ct. 1902, 23 L.Ed.2d 610 (1969), and in this circuit, Massillon-Cleveland-Akron Sign Co. v. Golden State Advertising Co., 444 F.2d 425 (9th Cir. 1971). <em>See also, </em>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc. v. University of Illinois Foundation, 402 U.S. 313, 91 S.Ct. 1434, 28 L.Ed.2d 788 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Plaintiff contends that its copyright registration of a jeweled bee entitles it to protection from the manufacture and sale by others of any object that to the ordinary observer is substantially similar in appearance. The breadth of this claim is evident. For example, while a photograph of the copyrighted bee pin attached to the complaint depicts a bee with nineteen small white jewels on its back, plaintiff argues that its copyright is infringed by defendants\u2019 entire line of a score or more jeweled bees in three sizes decorated with from nine to thirty jewels of various sizes, kinds, and colors.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Although plaintiff\u2019s counsel asserted that the originality of plaintiff's bee pin lay in a particular arrangement of jewels on the top of the pin, the elements of this arrangement were never identified. Defendants\u2019 witnesses testified that the \u201carrangement\u201d was simply a function of the size and form of the bee pin and the size of the jewels used. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, repeatedly pressed by the district judge, was unable to suggest how jewels might be placed on the back of a pin in the shape of a bee without infringing plaintiff\u2019s copyright. He eventually conceded, \u201cnot being a jeweler, I can\u2019t conceive of how he might rearrange the design so it is dissimilar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">If plaintiff\u2019s understanding of its rights were correct, its copyright would effectively prevent others from engaging in the business of manufacturing and selling jeweled bees. <em>We </em>think plaintiff confuses the balance Congress struck between protection and competition under the Patent Act and the Copyright Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The owner of a patent is granted the exclusive right to exploit for a period of seventeen years (a maximum of fourteen years for design patents) the conception that is the subject matter of the patent. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 154, 173. The grant of this monopoly, however, is carefully circumscribed by substantive and procedural protections. To be patentable the subject matter must be new and useful, and represent a nonobvious advance \u2014 one requiring \u201cmore ingenuity and skill than that possessed by an ordinary mechanic acquainted with the business\u201d; an advance that would not be obvious to a hypothetical person skilled in the art and charged with knowledge of all relevant developments publicly known to that point in time. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545 (1966). A patent is granted only after an independent administrative inquiry and determination that these substantive standards have been met. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 131. This determination is subject to both administrative and court review. 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 134, 141, 145, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">Copyright registration, on the other hand, confers no right at all to the conception reflected in the registered subject matter. \u201cUnlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea \u2014 not the idea itself.\u201d Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.S. 201, 217, 74 S.Ct. 460, 470, 98 L.Ed. 630 (1954) (footnote omitted). Accordingly, the prerequisites for copyright registration are minimal. The work offered for registration need only be the product of the registrant. So long as it is not a plagiarized copy of another\u2019s effort, there is no requirement that the work differ substantially from prior works or that it contribute anything of value. \u201cThe copyright protects originality rather than novelty or invention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 74 S.Ct. at 471. A copyright is secured simply by publishing the work with the required notice, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 10, and reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>istration is accomplished simply by filing a claim and depositing copies of the work with the Register of Copyrights, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11, 13. There is no administrative investigation or determination of the validity of the claim. A certificate is refused only if the object falls outside the broad category of matter subject to copyright registration. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4-5. A copyright affords little protection. It confers \u201conly \u2018the sole right of multiplying copies.\u2019 Absent copying there can be no infringement of copyright.\u201d Mazer v. Stein, <em>supra, </em>347 U.S. at 218, 74 S.Ct. at 471 (footnotes omitted). Because the registrant\u2019s protection is limited and the social cost therefore small, the life of the copyright is long and, under current proposals, potentially even longer \u2014 now twenty-eight years plus a renewal period of twenty-eight more, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 24, and, under Copyright Revision Bill \u00a7 543, 91st Congress, 1st Session, the life of the author plus fifty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Obviously a copyright must not be treated as equivalent to a patent lest long continuing private monopolies be conferred over areas of gainful activity without first satisfying the substantive and procedural prerequisites to the grant of such privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Because copyright bars only copying, perhaps this case could be disposed of on the district court\u2019s finding that defendants did not copy plaintiff\u2019s bee pin. It is true that defendants had access to plaintiff\u2019s pin and that there is an obvious similarity between plaintiff\u2019s pin and those of defendants. These two facts constitute strong circumstantial evidence of copying. But they are not conclusive, Overman v. Loesser, 205 F.2d 521, 523 (9th Cir. <em>1953); </em>Nimmer on Copyright \u00a7\u00a7 139.4, 141.2, and there was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that defendants\u2019 pin was in fact an independent creation. Defendants testified to independent creation from identified sources other than plaintiff\u2019s pin. The evidence established defendants\u2019 standing as designers of fine jewelry and reflected that on earlier occasions they had designed jeweled pins in the form of living creatures other than bees, including spiders, dragonflies, and other insects, birds, turtles, and frogs. Any inference of copying based upon similar appearance lost much of its strength because both pins were lifelike representations of a natural creature. Moreover, there were differences between defendants\u2019 and plaintiff\u2019s bees \u2014notably in the veining of the wings.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Although this evidence would support a finding that defendants\u2019 bees were their own work rather than copied from plaintiff\u2019s, this resolution of the problem is not entirely satisfactory, particularly in view of the principle that copying need not be conscious, but \u201cmay be the result of subconscious memory derived from hearing, seeing or reading the copyrighted work at some time in the past.\u201d Howell\u2019s Copyright Law 129 (4th ed. 1962). <em>See </em>Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., 81 F.2d 49, 54 (2d Cir. 1936); Harold Lloyd Corp. v. Witwer, 65 F.2d 1, 16 (9th Cir. 1933). It seems unrealistic to suppose that defendants could have closed their minds to plaintiff\u2019s highly successful jeweled bee pin as they designed their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">A finding that defendants \u201ccopied\u201d plaintiff\u2019s pin in this sense, however, would not necessarily justify judgment against them. A copyright, we have seen, bars use of the particular \u201cexpression\u201d of an idea in a copyrighted work but does not bar use of the \u201cidea\u201d itself. Others are free to utilize the \u201cidea\u201d so long as they do not plagiarize its \u201cexpression.\u201d As the court said in Trifari, Krussman &amp; Fishel, Inc. v. B. Steinberg-Kaslo Co., 144 F.Supp. 577, 580 (S.D.N.Y.1956), where the copyrighted work was a jeweled pin representing a hansom cab, \u201cthough an alleged infringer gets the idea of a hansom cab pin from a copyrighted article there can be no infringement unless the article itself has been copied. The idea of a hansom cab cannot be copyrighted. Nevertheless plaintiff\u2019s expression of that idea, as embodied in its pin, can be copyrighted.\u201d Or as Judge Hand put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>it in Sheldon v. Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corp., <em>supra, </em>81 F.2d at 54, \u201cdefendants were entitled to use, not only all that had gone before, but even the plaintiffs\u2019 contribution itself, if they drew from it only the more general patterns; that is, if they kept clear of its \u2018expression.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also </em>Millworth Converting Corp. v. Slifka, 276 F.2d 443, 445 (2d Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">The critical distinction between \u201cidea\u201d and \u201cexpression\u201d is difficult to draw. As Judge Hand candidly wrote, \u201cObviously, no principle can be stated' as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the \u2018idea,\u2019 and has borrowed its \u2018expression.\u2019 \u201d Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487, 489 (2d Cir. 1960). At least in close cases, one may suspect, the classification the court selects may simply state the result reached rather than the reason for it. In our view, the difference is really one of degree as Judge Hand suggested in his striking \u201cabstraction\u201d formulation in Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 1930). The guiding consideration in drawing the line is the preservation of the balance between competition and protection reflected in the patent and copyright laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">What is basically at stake is the extent of the copyright owner\u2019s monopoly \u2014 from how large an area of activity did Congress intend to allow the copyright owner to exclude others? We think the production of jeweled bee pins is a larger private preserve than Congress intended to be set aside in the public market without a patent. A jeweled bee pin is therefore an \u201cidea\u201d that defendants were free to copy. Plaintiff seems to agree, for it disavows any claim that defendants cannot manufacture and sell jeweled bee pins and concedes that only plaintiff\u2019s particular design or \u201cexpression\u201d of the jeweled bee pin \u201cidea\u201d is protected under its copyright. The difficulty, as we have noted, is that on this record the \u201cidea\u201d and its .\u201cexpression\u201d appear to be indistinguishable. There is no greater similarity between the pins of plaintiff and defendants than is inevitable from the use of jewel-encrusted bee forms in both.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">When the \u201cidea\u201d and its \u201cexpression\u201d are thus inseparable, copying the \u201cexpression\u201d will not be barred, since protecting the \u201cexpression\u201d in such circumstances would confer a monopoly of the \u201cidea\u201d upon the copyright owner free of the conditions and limitations imposed by the patent law.

Co., 140 F.2d 182, 184 (7th Cir. 1944). <em>See also </em>Continental Cas. Co. v. Beardsley, 253 F.2d 702, 705-706 (2d Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
