With the United States Attorney\u2019s consent, Eck pleaded guilty to the lesser-included offense of stealing goods valued at less than $100. On November 10, 1969, the district court ordered the sentencing continued for one year for the purpose of Eck\u2019s demonstrating to the court that he could lead a law-abiding life. When Eck returned a year later, the court was satisfied with Eck\u2019s behavior, and it requested the United States Attorney to dismiss the indictment. The request was refused. The district court thereupon dismissed the indictment in the interest of justice, and this petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-18\">The district court\u2019s merciful inclinations appear entirely appropriate in view of the nature of the offense, of Eck\u2019s youth, his lack of any prior criminal record, and his good conduct during the rehabilitative year. However, we are unable to find any authority permitting judicial discretion to be substituted for prosecutorial discretion in dismissing the indictment. <em>(Cf. </em>United States v. Brokaw (S.D. Ill. 1945) 60 F.Supp. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-19\">Eck argues that the district court\u2019s action can be sustained as an informal grant of one year\u2019s probation. Had the court wished to impose a probationary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>sentence, it could have done so under the provisions of the Federal Youth Corrections Act. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 5005 et seq.) It did not follow that procedure, and we have been able to discover no statutory authorization for the course adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The writ shall issue instructing respondent to set aside the dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
