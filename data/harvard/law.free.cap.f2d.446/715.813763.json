See 434 F.2d 933. While petition for rehearing and for rehearing en banc filed by the defendants-appellees was pending before this Court, the Supreme Court on February 23, 1971 decided the eases of Younger v. Harris, 1971, 401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669; Samuels v. Mackell, 1971, 401 U.S. 66, 91 S.Ct. 764, 27 L.Ed.2d 688; Boyle v. Landry, 1971, 401 U.S. 77, 91 S.Ct. 758, 27 L.Ed.2d 696; Perez v. Ledesma, 1971, 401 U.S. 82, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701; Dyson v. Stein, 1971, 401 U.S. 200, 91 S.Ct. 769, 27 L.Ed.2d 781; and Byrne v. Karalexis, 1971, 401 U.S. 216, 91 S.Ct. 777, 27 L.Ed.2d 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">We considered that the relevance of those cases to the disposition of the petition for rehearing required that the parties be directed to file additional briefs. Upon consideration of those briefs and of the effect of Younger v. Harris and the other February 23, 1971 cases on this case it is now by the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b774-16\">Ordered: the judgment appealed from is vacated and set aside, the petition for rehearing is granted, our opinions of November 12, 1970 are withdrawn and this case is remanded to the district court for a full evidentiary hearing, findings of fact and conclusions of law in the light of the principles announced by the Supreme Court in the above cited cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b774-17\">GOLDBERG, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AG-\">(specially concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b774-18\">Though I concur without reservation in the granting of the petition for rehearing and the order concomitant therewith, nonetheless I feel compelled to make the following observations because of the important and sensitive nature of the issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-19\">In <em>Younger </em>and its companion cases the Supreme Court clarified what sever<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>al commentators <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> felt that <em>Dombrowski </em><footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and its progeny<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had left unclear: the proper role of a federal district court when asked to interfere with a pending state prosecution. Stressing \u201cthe fundamental policy against federal interference with state criminal prosecutions,\u201d 401 U.S. at 46, 91 S.Ct. 746, at 751, 27 L.Ed.2d at 676, a majority of the Supreme Court held that a federal district court may not enjoin a pending state prosecution<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unless the plaintiff can prove the existence of \u201cirreparable injury\u201d that is \u201cboth great and immediate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Certain types of injury were found not to constitute the requisite \u201cirreparable injury.\u201d Specifically, \u201cthe cost, anxiety, and inconvenience of having to defend against a single criminal prosecution\u201d did not by themselves justify federal intervention. Instead, \u201cthe threat to the plaintiff\u2019s federally protected rights must be one that cannot be eliminated by his defense against a single criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 91 S.Ct. 746, at 751, 27 L.Ed.2d at 676-677. Moreover, despite intimations to the contrary in <em>Dombrowski, </em>where state proceedings are pending, the necessary \u201cirreparable injury\u201d is not established by the mere fact that a statute is facially overbroad or vague and thus \u201cchills\u201d protected expressive activity. To halt a pending state prosecution the plaintiff must show in addition \u201cbad faith, harassment, or any other unusual circumstance that would call for equitable relief.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 54, 91 S.Ct. 746, at 755, 27 L.Ed.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>679-681. In Samuels v. Mackell, <em>supra, </em>a companion case, the Court similarly held that where a state prosecution is pending, \u201cthe same equitable principles relevant to the propriety of an injunction must be taken into consideration by federal district courts in determining whether to issue a declaratory judgment.\u201d Accordingly, where an injunction would be impermissible, \u201cdeclaratory relief should ordinarily be denied as well.\u201d 401 U.S. at 73, 91 S.Ct. 764, at 768, 27 L.Ed.2d at 693-694.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">In our original opinion in the instant case we held that, despite the absence of an adequate appellate record wherein plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of bad faith harassment could be tested for factual reliability, we were obligated to examine the facial validity of the four Mobile, Alabama, ordinances in question. After declaring that three of those ordinances were unconstitutional on their faces,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we remanded the case to the district court (1) to determine the necessity and propriety of injunctive relief, and (2) to conduct an evidentiary hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of defendants\u2019 bad faith prosecution and repressive action. Since the subsequent decisions in the Supreme Court have profoundly altered the legal framework against which this case was decided, I agree that \u201crespect for the law as the Supreme Court construes it\u201d requires that our original opinion be vacated and that the case be remanded to the district court for reconsideration in light of the <em>Younger </em>series of cases. Livingston v. Garmire, 5 Cir. 1971, 442 F.2d 1322; see Byrne v. Kara-lexis, <em>supra-, </em>Dyson v. Stein, <em>supra. </em>However, lest we extravagate the meaning of or overreact to the Supreme Court\u2019s February sextet, with its sixteen majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions, I think that it is important to note what that series of cases did not purport to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Where pending state proceedings are concerned, the Supreme Court did not decide the independent force of the federal anti-injunction statute, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283. In the words of Justice Black in <em>Younger:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-11\">\u201cBecause our holding rests on the absence of factors necessary under equitable principles to justify federal intervention, we have no occasion to consider whether 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283, which prohibits an injunction against state court proceedings \u2018except as expressly' authorized by Act of Congress\u2019 would in and of itself be controlling under the circumstances of this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay6\">The municipal court prosecutions under sections 14-051, 14-7, and 14-13 were begun prior to the initiation of the federal suit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, if plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cirreparable injury\u201d are meritorious, the district court on remand must determine whether or not the anti-injunction statute is nevertheless an independent bar to federal relief. Several issues will be intertwined in this deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>mination: (1) whether section 2283 is even applicable where bad faith enforcement is established; <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (2) whether, if section 2283 is applicable, 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 is an exception to its terms \u201cexpressly authorized by Act of Congress\u201d;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (3) whether, if section 1983 is not an exception, a declaratory judgment falls without section 2283\u2019s proscription against the issuance of \u201cinjunctions.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Perhaps most importantly, the Court did not determine the propriety of federal injunctive or declaratory relief against threatened state criminal prosecutions where no state proceedings are pending. As stated in his concurring opinion in <em>Younger, </em>Justice Stewart, joined by Justice Harlan, emphasized that \u201cthe Court today does not resolve the problems involved when a federal court is asked to give injunctive or declaratory relief from <em>future </em>state criminal prosecutions.\u201d 401 U.S. at 55, 91 S.Ct. 746, at 757, 27 L.Ed.2d at 681-682 (emphasis in original). Since there are no pending municipal prosecutions under section 14-11 of the Mobile ordinances, the district court, if it finds no evidence of bad faith, must still determine whether or not the \u201cirreparable injury\u201d envisioned by <em>Younger </em>is requisite to federal injunctive relief against threatened prosecutions, and, if so, whether declaratory relief is nevertheless independently available.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-5\">.

The Court made clear that in referring to \u201cpending\u201d state prosecutions, it had reference only to state proceedings initiated prior to the filing of the federal action. Younger v. Harris, supra, 401 U.S. at 41, 91 S.Ct. 746, at 749, 27 L.Ed.2d at 674 (\u201cWe express no view about the circumstances under which federal courts may act when there is no prosecution pending in state courts at the time the federal proceeding is begun\u201d). The Court did not decide the propriety of federal relief when a state prosecution was begun after the federal suit was filed but was pending at the time of the federal hearing. That unanswered question assumes some importance, for it has been held that state proceedings are not pending within the intendment of the federal anti-injunction act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2283, when filed subsequent to the federal action.

Further elucidating the test for federal intervention, Justice Black for the majority in <em>Younger </em>wrote :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-14\">\u201cThere may, of course, be extraordinary circumstances in which the necessary irreparable injury can be shown even in the absence of the usual prerequisites of bad faith and harassment.

Patterson, 323 F.2d 201 (CA 5 1963).\u201d 401 U.S. at 118, 91 S.Ct. 674, at 693, 27 L.Ed. at 724-725 n. 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">In <em>Dyson, </em>the Court stressed that the existence of such irreparable injury was a matter to be determined carefully under the facts of each case, 401 U.S. at 203, 91 S.Ct. 769, at 771, 27 L.Ed.2d at 784. For an example of a recent case decided subsequent to <em>Younger </em>which found sufficient irreparable injury to justify federal intervention, see Taylor v.

Mobile, Alabama Code \u00a7 14-7 was declared to be facially constitutional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b776-13\">. Because the municipal proceedings were initiated prior to the present proceedings, the district court will be spared the necessity of considering whether a subsequent municipal suit which is pending at the time of the federal hearing either is subject to the equitable principles of <em>Younger </em>or, contrary to the holding in <em>Dom-irowski, </em>is subject to the prohibitions of section 2283.
