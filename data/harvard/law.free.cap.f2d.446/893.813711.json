We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">In December, 1965 the appellant received a six-year sentence for conspiracy to smuggle heroin into the United States, and was mandatorily released in December, 1969, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164. He contends that since he was not eligible for parole on his federal sentence, he could not have been under the jurisdiction of the United States Parole Board subsequent to his release in 1969. He therefore concludes that the detainer lodged against him by the Parole Board is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-16\">This reasoning is faulty, since \u201ca prisoner having served his term or terms less good-time deductions shall, upon release, be deemed <em>as if released on parole </em>until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced less one hundred and eighty days.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4164 (emphasis added). Thus the appellant was legally subject to the Parole Board\u2019s supervision until some time in June, 1971; and his arrest on state charges constituted sufficient grounds for issuance of a mandatory release violator warrant and detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
