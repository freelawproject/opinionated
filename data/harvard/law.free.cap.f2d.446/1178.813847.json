The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>fendants sell to employers for the coverage of their employees broad coverage medical care (health and accident) insurance, which includes the risk of cancer. The respective contentions on the merits were aptly stated by Judge Eden-field :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-4\">\u201cDefendants seek to justify the COB clause on the ground that it takes away the \u2018profit\u2019 from an illness by . reimbursing only up to an insured\u2019s medical expenses, reduces group health premiums, helps stabilize rising medical costs and eliminates medical malingering. Plaintiff, on the other hand, argues that the COB provision in defendants\u2019 comprehensive group health policies forces it to always be the primary carrier and pay \u2018first,\u2019 reduces benefits to the insured who receives but a single benefit for two or more premiums, and excludes plaintiff from the large employer market. Plaintiff reasons that employees with comprehensive group health plans which include, among many other things, protection against cancer, would be unreeeptive to plaintiff\u2019s dread disease policy since their cancer recovery would be reduced under their group health plan to the extent of plaintiff\u2019s reimbursement. Plaintiff adduces certain evidence which allegedly demonstrates that the employees of several companies have dropped plaintiff\u2019s policies due to the COB provisions in their comprehensive group plans.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-7\">While AFL moved for a permanent, as well as a preliminary, injunction, it did not submit for a final decree. The motion for permanent injunction was properly denied for the reason well stated by Judge Edenfield:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1238-8\">\u201cA permanent injunction for the plaintiff is obviously not proper at this early stage, since it would amount to a final determination of the action. The uncertain record in this case does not permit its issuance against the defendants. 3 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 1433 [p. 494].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1238-9\">Judge Edenfield called attention that the purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo, 7 Moore Federal Practice \u00b6 65.04 [1], and that several factors must coalesce before the plaintiff may secure a preliminary injunction, including (1) that the plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law and will be irreparably harmed if the injunction does not issue;, (2) that the balance of hardships tilts toward the plaintiff; and (3) that the plaintiff has at least a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits. Judge Edenfield held: \u201cOn the present state of the record, plaintiff cannot carry the day on any of these factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-10\">We agree with Judge Edenfield\u2019s reasoning on the first two factors \u2014 irreparable injury<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the balancing of hardships.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>Both the plaintiff-appellant and the defendants-appellees devote the major part of their respective briefs and arguments to the third factor \u2014 likelihood of success on the merits. The propositions of law are so intriguing that we are severely-tempted. We are, however, bound by the consistent and wise policy of this Circuit not to decide the merits of a case on an appeal from a decision denying a motion for preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1239-4\">Application of some such rule is especially desirable in this case, because any decision on the merits would be of such importance that the losing party should have some opportunity to obtain review by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-5\">We hold simply that because of the plaintiff\u2019s failure with respect to the first two factors, irreparable injury and balancing of hardships, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">.

It states that people have canceled its cancer policy if they also carry defendants\u2019 COB group coverage and that its agents are often too discouraged to even solicit companies with COB group insurance coverage, recognizing that plaintiff\u2019s dread disease policy will not be truly duplicative and will therefore be undesirable to the employees. However, the plaintiff cites only a few instances of actual cancellation, hardly enough to establish irreparable injury. * * * While it may well be true, as plaintiff contends, that plaintiff would be doing more business absent the COB policies, it is not being irreparably damaged at present by tlieir existence. Plaintiff\u2019s last annual report indicates that business is flourishing with an 85% increase in sales of cancer policies and with annualized premiums expected to increase this year by some $5 million. Plaintiff can still sell its policies to employees not covered by COB-type group health policies, as well as directly to individuals. Moreover, there is some reason to think that it may still be able to sell its cancer coverage to group health holders with antiduplication clauses, since with both the plaintiff\u2019s policy and the group policy, an insured would receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>full recompense for all of his cancer-related expenses. The group policy alone might not give this assurance. Additionally, money damage should be a sufficient substitute for injunctive relief, if plaintiff ultimately recovers. There is no reason to doubt the defendants\u2019 solvency if a final decision is rendered against them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1238-12\">See note 6 on page 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b1239-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>6. \u201c * * * If the pendente lite injunction is denied, but the plaintiff ultimately prevails, its business during the interim would simply continue on its present course \u2014 a course anything but perilous. However, if the injunction is granted, and the defendants ultimately win, they may be inconvenienced. Plaintiff seeks an injunction against use of COB only against its own dread disease franchise policies. Therefore, during the pendency of the in-, junction, the defendants would be forced to discriminate between benefits paid to those insured with plaintiff, and those insured with others. In addition, those people insured with both the defendants and the plaintiff would be required to pay higher premiums on their non-COB group policies. Such a temporary arrangement would create administrative problems for the defendants if the injunction was later dissolved. In short, the status quo, which a preliminary injunction seeks to maintain, would best be preserved by keeping the parties in their present positions. To grant the injunction would disturb the status quo as it has existed for several years, imposing hardships on the defendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1239-19\">.
