For this a timely motion was made for a mistrial. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">The point here does not amount to much. The evidence was overwhelming. De Carlo was photographed in the act and he was found with \u201cbait\u201d money in his possession. Also, his fingerprints were found at the scene of the event. Thus, it was not error to deny a motion for a mistrial. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705; Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
