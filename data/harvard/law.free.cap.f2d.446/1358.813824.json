His defense was that he was within the exception to \u00a7 1326 in that the Attorney General of the United States had expressly consented to his reapplying for admission to this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1417-16\">On voir dire outside the presence of the jury, appellant testified that the Attorney General had given consent by a letter to appellant, which appellant stated was in his personal effects in North Carolina. Appellant acknowledged that he had not attempted by either telephone or correspondence to locate the person having his personal effects and obtain the letter from him. His explanation was that for him to do so would, in some fashion not spelled out, breach the anonymity of various persons who were, in appellant\u2019s opinion, privileged to have their identities unrevealed. This was an unacceptable explanation for appellant\u2019s failure to produce the original of the alleged letter. IV Wigmore, Evidence, (3d ed.) \u00a7 1192 et <em>seq. </em>Appellant may not complain of the court\u2019s limiting his efforts to establish by cross examination of a government witness the possible existence of a copy of the alleged letter in government files \u2014 a copy the government certified did not exist \u2014 \u25a0 because if a copy existed the \u201cbest evidence rule\u201d barred him from introducing it. Consequently there was no evidence that appellant was within the exception of \u00a7 1326, and, in addition, the government introduced an official certificate of the nonexistence of such a letter, which stood unrefuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>Our conclusion on this issue makes it unnecessary to consider the contention of appellant that he was unduly restricted by the trial court into inquiry into the possible existence of a letter written by appellant to the Attorney General allegedly seeking the Attorney General\u2019s consent to apply for reentry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1418-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
