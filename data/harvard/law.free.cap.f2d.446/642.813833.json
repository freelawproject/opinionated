They were tried separately, but were represented by the same attorney. Petitioner claims the joint representation deprived him of the right to effective assistance of counsel. The district court denied a writ of habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\"> Joint representation is permitted unless specific prejudice appears. Carlson v. Nelson, 443 F.2d 21, 22 (9th Cir. 1971); Lugo v. United States, 350 F.2d 858, 859 (9th Cir. 1965). The burden of proving such prejudice lies with the petitioner. Kruchten <em>v. </em>Eyman, 406 F.2d 304, 312 (9th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">Petitioner claims that his attorney could not effectively cross-examine petitioner\u2019s fiancee without breaching the attorney-client privilege; but since the fiancee did not testify, no such prejudice occurred. Petitioner also claims his attorney should have called petitioner\u2019s fiancee to testify on petitioner\u2019s behalf; but petitioner\u2019s fiancee informed the court that if called she would invoke the Fifth Amendment and refuse to testify. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that if she had testified her testimony would have helped petitioner. To the contrary, the attorney for petitioner and his fiancee represented at the habeas petition hearing that her testimony would not have been beneficial to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"AlS\">Affirmed</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
