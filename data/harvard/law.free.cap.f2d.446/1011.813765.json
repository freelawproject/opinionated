Such plan shall comply fully with the principles established in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 1971, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554, and with full exploitation of the broad equitable powers available to the district court to effectuate this order as authorized in <em>Swann, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-17\">The district court is ordered promptly to appoint a bi-racial committee to advise with the Board of Education and with the district court with respect to such desegregation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-18\">The district court shall require the school board to file semi-annual reports during the school \u2022 year similar to those required in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir. 1970, 438 F.2d 611, 618-619.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-19\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"Avk\">Vacated and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1070-11\">. Under the stringent requirements of Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969), which this Court has carried out in United States v. Hinds County School Board, 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 852, and of Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477 (1970), implemented in Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1970, 419 F.2d 1211, this Court has judicially determined that the ordinary procedures for appellate review in school desegregation cases have to be suitably adopted to assure that each system whose case is before us \u201cbegin immediately to operate as unitary school systems.\u201d Upon consideration of the parties\u2019 memoranda and so much of the record as is available or determined to be needed by the Court, the Court has proceeded to dispose of this case as an extraordinary matter.
