We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-12\">The sole contention presented upon this appeal is that appellant\u2019s court-appointed attorney rendered ineffective representation at trial by his failure to subpoena an alleged alibi witness as requested by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-13\">The district court conducted a full evi-dentiary hearing at which appellant was present and represented by counsel. No evidence was offered in support of the claimed denial of effective counsel except appellant\u2019s own testimony. Appellant\u2019s allegations were repudiated by his former court-appointed counsel who testified that he had attempted to contact the alleged alibi witness on a number of occasions prior to trial, to no avail. He stated that as a matter of discretion he did not subpoena the witness because \u201cwhen I have no idea what testimony is going to be elicited from a witness before he takes the witness stand, I\u2019m not inclined to call him under any circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-15\">The district court, having heard the two witnesses\u2019 testimony, found that appellant had been represented by competent counsel, and that his attorney had done \u201ceverything that an attorney could possibly be expected to do in defense of his client.\u201d The alleged alibi witness was appellant\u2019s former employer in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the city in which the federal evidentiary hearing was held. The record does not indicate that any attempt was made by appellant to subpoena this man to testify at the hearing, nor to obtain his deposition or affidavit for use as authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-16\">The court below found that appellant failed to prove his contention by a preponderance of credible evidence; and after a careful examination of the record in this case we perceive no error in the district court\u2019s ruling. Smith v. Smith, 433 F.2d 582 (5th Cir. 1970); O\u2019Neal v. Smith, 431 F.2d 646 (5th Cir., 1970); Bowden v. State of Florida, 430 F.2d 1328 (5th Cir., 1970); Williams v. Beto, 354 F.2d 698 (5th Cir., 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-17\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
