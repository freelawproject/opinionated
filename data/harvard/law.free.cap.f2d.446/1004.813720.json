We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-22\">This is Lee\u2019s second appeal in this case. On his first appeal we affirmed the judgment of the district court in part but remanded for further findings \u201crelated to \u2018the fundamental fairness of Petitioner\u2019s original trial in Limestone County; the evidence as to intimidation of Petitioner\u2019s witnesses and as to racial prejudice in general in Limestone County at the time of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>Lee v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1970, 429 F.2d 524, 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-23\">On remand the district court carefully re-read the transcripts of Lee\u2019s trial and state habeas corpus hearing and concluded that \u201cthe petitioner was not denied due process of law at his trial due to racial prejudice or any lack of fundamental fairness.\u201d Specifically, the district court noted that following a full eviden-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>tiary hearing the state habeas court found that</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">(1) there was no evidence that any of the petitioner\u2019s witnesses were kept from testifying;</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">(2) there was no evidence that any members of the Negro race was systematically excluded either from the Grand Jury and/or the Petit Jury;</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">(3) there was no evidence that any particular rumor or feeling in the locality in any way affected the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">The district court concluded that these factual findings were adequately supported by the state court record and denied Lee\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">Our examination of the whole record in the ease has revealed no clear error in the district court\u2019s findings of fact and no error in its conclusions of law. The judgment of the district court is affirmed. <em>See </em>Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P.; Milton v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1970, 428 F.2d 463, 464; Perkins v.
