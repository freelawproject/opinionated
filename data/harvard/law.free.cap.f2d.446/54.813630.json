Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir. 1970. 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b113-13\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">This appeal is taken from the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to vacate the judgment and sentence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Antonio Urtiaga-Rogers. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">Appellant was convicted on his plea of guilty of a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4755(a) (1), by importing a quantity of marihuana without having registered and paid the special tax as provided under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4751-4753. He was sentenced on July 23, 1968 to serve five years; and there was no direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-17\">Appellant\u2019s sole contention is that his conviction under this statute was violative of his privilege against self-incrimination. He cites Leary v. United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in support of this claim. <em>Leary </em>held that the Fifth Amendment privilege is applicable to prosecutions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4744(a); but it did advert to the validity of the statute under which Urtiaga-Rogers was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-18\">In a recent case, the constitutionality of a conviction and sentence for violation of \u00a7 4755(a) (1) was upheld. United States v. King, S.D.Cal.1969, 307 F.Supp. 217, affirmed, 9th Cir. 1970, 430 F.2d 1177, cert. denied 1971, 401 U.S. 962, 91 S.Ct. 972, 28 L.Ed.2d 247. The offense involved was exactly the same as that for which Urtiaga-Rogers was convicted. Relative thereto, the district court held as follows in <em>King</em>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-19\">\u201cIn this case the defendant was convicted of a violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 4755(a) (1). Whatever may be the effect of <em>Leary </em>upon the manufacturing, producing, compounding, dealing in, dispensing, prescribing, administering and giving away portions of \u00a7 4751, <em>Leary </em>can have no effect on the importing provisions of that section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-20\">No one questions the power of the United States to regulate and tax the flow of goods across its international borders and prescribe conditions under which goods may be imported\u201d. 307 F.Supp. at 218.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-21\">Whereas denial of certiorari is not in all cases to be construed as a ruling on the merits of an appeal, we believe it has that effect in the <em>King </em>case. See Harrington v. United States, 5th Cir. 1971, 444 F.2d 1190. Accordingly we affirm the order of the district court on the authority of United States v. King, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-24\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-23\">. 395 U.S. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1532, 23 L.Ed.2d 57 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
