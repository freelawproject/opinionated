California (1962) 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) he had been denied effective assistance of counsel, because there was a conflict of interest between him and his co-defendant who were jointly represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">We agree with the district court that the first two grounds failed to state a claim for federal habeas relief. There was no denial of due process in the prosecution\u2019s proof of appellant\u2019s prior conviction (Spencer v. Texas (1967) 385 U.S. 554, 87 S.Ct. 648, 17 L.Ed.2d 606), and, from the facts alleged in the petition, it is plain that the manner in which the prior conviction was alleged and proved did not prejudice him. Because his prior conviction was for possession of narcotics, not for his status as an addict, the use of the prior conviction to enhance punishment for a second narcoitcs offense does not transgress Robinson v. California, supra, 370 U.S. at 664-666, 82 S.Ct. 1417. <em>(See also </em>Ramos v. United States (9th Cir. 1970) 432 F.2d 423; United States ex rel. Mudry v. Rundle (3d Cir. 1970) 429 F.2d 1316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-15\">The district court rejected the effective counsel issue on the ground that the petition indicated that the defenses of the jointly represented defendants were \u201centirely consistent.\u201d The district court\u2019s test was flawed. We have held that, in deciding whether or not joint representation deprived one or both defendants of effective counsel, the appropriate inquiries are: Did the representation deprive either or both of the defendants of the undivided loyalty of counsel? Did counsel have to, or did he in fact, \u201cslight the defense of one defendant for that of another\u201d? (Peek v. United States (9th Cir. 1963) 321 F.2d 934, 944, cert. denied (1964) 376 U.S. 954, 84 S.Ct. 973, 11 L.Ed.2d 973.)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-16\">The conclusion of the California appellate court that appellant\u2019s representation was not impaired does not supply a basis for sustaining the district court\u2019s determination of the issue. The district court cannot rely on conclusions in a state court\u2019s opinion. (Linden v. Dickson (9th Cir. 1961) 287 F.2d 55, 58.) It must examine the transcript of the state court proceeding and, if neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>sary, hold an evidentiary hearing. (Valdez v. California (9th Cir. 1971) 489 F.2d 1405; Maxwell v. Eyman (9th Cir. 1970) 429 F.2d 502.)</p>\n<p id=\"A0qe\">The order is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in respect solely of the representation issue,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-11\">. The factual background is related in the opinion of the California Court of Appeal, People v. Sanchez (1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 467, 82 Cal.Rptr. 582.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-12\">. Petitioner had been civilly committed to a hospital under \u00a7 3051, California Welfare and Institutions Code, upon his prior offense. California has held that \u201c[t]he fact that upon conviction further proceedings are suspended and a defendant is committed as a narcotics addict * * * does not foreclose the effect of the conviction in determining the extent of punishment for a second offense.\u201d People v. Rodriguez (1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 522, 527, 52 Cal.Rptr. 643, 646.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
