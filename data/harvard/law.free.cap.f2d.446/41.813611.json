The trial court, at the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 case, directed a verdict adverse to plaintiffs under Rule 50(a) Fed. Rules Civ.Proc. Appeal follows the entry of the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-24\">Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to their claim, may be summarized. During July, 1965 Muske-gon shipped interstate fifty drums of the liquid chemical dimethyl-carbamoyle-chloride (DMCC) to a customer at Boulder, Colorado. The drums, consisting of fiberboard over a plastic container, were placed at the point of origin on equipment belonging to Wolverine Express for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>transit to Boulder. Attached to each drum was a cautionary label indicating in some detail the existence of a hazardous product having potential physical and toxicological properties \u201cnot fully investigated\u201d and giving remedial instructions in case of spillage. The bill of lading did not specifically note the shipment as dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In due course the shipment arrived at the Ringsby Trucking Company\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> docks at Denver, Colorado. Additional freight had by then been packed upon the top of the drums. At some unknown point between the point of origin and Denver one of the drums had been pierced and had resulted in toxic fumes permeating the Ringsby trailer. Plaintiffs, employees of Ringsby, inhaled the fumes and were injured while unloading the freight destined for Denver and which had been placed on top of the Muskegon shipment. Against this evidentiary background the trial court directed a verdict for failure to show any actionable negligence on the part of the defendant manufacturer-shipper.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The ruling of the trial court is manifestly correct. Although plaintiffs plead active negligence on the part of Muske-gon in packaging and labeling no proof of any kind was offered in support of this contention. Nor are we referred to any case imposing absolute liability upon a shipper under the stated circumstances, nor any ease under Colorado law, or otherwise, indicating the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. The evidence negatives entirely that the drums were under the exclusive control of Muskegon at the time of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Any reliance on res ipsa loqui-tur is misplaced. Hook v. Lakeside Park Company, 142 Colo. 277, 351 P.2d 261. And <em>see </em>Martin v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 3 Cir., 281 F.2d 801, a case factually similar considered under Pennsylvania law. All other evidence, sueh as failure to furnish plaintiffs with protective masks, points to negligence on the part of Ringsby, not defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">. Although counsel\u2019s opening statements indicate the shipment was transferred from AVolverine equipment to Ringsby at Chicago, the evidentiary record does not contain such proof.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
