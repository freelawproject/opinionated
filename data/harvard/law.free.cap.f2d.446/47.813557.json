The district court, in its first decision dismissing the action, concluded that the higher wages paid to men by defendant bank were due to the men\u2019s participation in a training program purposed to prepare them for officer positions. Wirtz v. First Victoria Nat\u2019l Bank, 58 CCH Lab.Cas. \u00b6 32,074 (S.D. Tex.1968). Finding that the training program was vague and illusory, and administered in a discriminatory fashion against women, we reversed and remanded for a determination of whether in fact there was unequal pay for equal work and whether any differences in pay could be justified under the exceptions of the statute. Shultz v. First Victoria Nat\u2019l Bank, 5th Cir. 1970, 420 F.2d 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-14\">On remand, the district court again dismissed the action, finding that the wage differentials were due to inequality in work assignments and defendant\u2019s merit system in the promotion of its employees. Hodgson v. First Victoria Nat\u2019l Bank, 63 CCH Lab.Cas. \u00b6 32,378 (S.D.Tex., 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">Review of district court findings is limited by Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a), and this Court cannot set aside these findings unless they are clearly erroneous. After a careful review of the record, we have found substantial evidence to support the district court decision, and cannot, therefore, consider it clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
