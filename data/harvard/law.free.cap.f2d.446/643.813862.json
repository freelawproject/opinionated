Raymond Paul Patrick v. State of Missouri, Civ. No. 18968-2 (W.D.Mo., February 10, 1971). We believe the District Court correctly decided each of the issues presented to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The District Court based its findings and conclusions upon the transcript of a state evidentiary hearing held in connection with the appellant\u2019s motion for post-conviction relief. At that hearing, held in April 1969, the appellant was represented by two attorneys. He presented evidentiary support for each of the substantive issues he now raises. The appellant contends that some of the medical records relating to his mental condition were unavailable at the state court hearing. He argues that the District Court should have held an eviden-tiary hearing and attempted to find these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">No issue regarding the adequacy of the medical records introduced at the state court hearing has ever been raised by the appellant or his attorneys until this appeal. The appellant testified at the state court hearing that the records introduced were accurate, but did not comprise all of his medical records. We have been given no indication of the possible impact of the additional records, assuming, arguendo, that they exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-13\">Neither Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), nor its progeny require a separate federal evidentiary hearing in all circumstances. On its face, the state hearing afforded the appellant a full and fair determination of his allegations. His complaint of missing medical records is not sufficient to establish a need for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">The judgment of the District Court is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
