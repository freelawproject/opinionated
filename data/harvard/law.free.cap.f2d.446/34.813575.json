Appellant was working the press when injured, at which time her thumbs were burned and crushed after insertion in the heated press while it was in operation. Appellant urges the press was defectively designed, and relies on negligence, strict liability, and implied warranty. We <em>affirm </em>the directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-21\">At the time the press was purchased by Motorola, Inc., safety gates were available for the press, but were not purchased by Motorola. Molds for use in the machine were similarly available, but Motorola chose to make and use its own. There were in evidence facts on which the trial court concluded Motorola had made modifications in the machine itself after purchase, during the five years it owned and operated it. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>lant and all other employees had been instructed that if anything went wrong with the operation of the press, to stand back and call the operator\u2019s supervisor. These instructions were not followed by the plaintiff in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We need not delve into the questions of whether appellant was guilty of contributory negligence, or assumed the risk involved. Nor need we discuss any problems of warranty, as a basis for products liability, inasmuch as liability can properly rest on tort, rather than contract law, and thus avoid the complications of privity, or the lack of it. <em>Cf. </em>Bailey v. Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 6 Ariz.App. 213, 431 P.2d 108, 110-112; (1967); Prosser, 69 Yale Law Journal, 1099, 1134 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Under Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), we are bound by the law of the forum state in diversity cases, of which this is one. \u201cStrict Tort Liability\u201d, as set forth in \u00a7 402A of the Restatement of Torts (Second) (1965) is applicable in Arizona. (O. S. Stapley Co. v. Miller, 103 Ariz. 556, 447 P.2d 248 (1968) ). Section 402A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">\u201c(1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">\u201c(a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and \u201c(b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-11\">\u201c(2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although \u201c(a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-12\">\u201c(b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">The Arizona law was further set forth relatively recently in Maas v. Dreher, 10 Ariz.App. 520, 460 P.2d 191 (1969), rev. denied by Arizona Supreme Court (1970), which points out that \u201cstrict liability\u201d does not mean \u201cabsolute liability,\u201d (i<em>d. </em>at 192) (citing and relying upon Campo v. Scofield, 301 N.Y. 468; 95 N.E.2d 802 (1950), and interpreting Stapley v. Miller, <em>supra, </em>and \u00a7 402A' of the Restatement (Second)), and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjV\">\u201cAs previously stated herein, one of \u25a0 the elements which <em>plaintiff </em>must prove to establish a cause of action in strict liability is that the product was \u2018in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous.\u2019 This is determined by an objective test, not by the particular plaintiff\u2019s subjective appreciation of danger. As stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, Sec. 402A, comment <em>i </em>at 352 (1965):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-14\">\u2018The article sold must be dangerous to an extent beyond that which would be contemplated by the <em>ordinary consumer </em>who purchases it, with the <em>ordinary knowledge common to the community </em>as to its characteristics. (Emphasis supplied)\u2019 in original.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-15\"># * * -X- -x- *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-16\">Applying the above stated principles to the evidence before the trial court, and considering that evidence in the strongest light in plaintiff\u2019s favor, we are of the opinion that plaintiff has completely failed to establish a cause of action in strict tort liability against any of the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-17\"><em>{id. </em>at 194)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-18\">* * * -X- * -X-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-19\">\u201cIn our opinion the trial court correctly applied the law to the facts and did not err in granting defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-20\"><em>{id. </em>at 195)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-21\">There was no credible evidence presented by appellant which satisfied her burden to prove the press, as it was originally sold, was in a defective condition, or was unreasonably dangerous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The evidence disclosed that the press had been modified from its original condition by Motorola, Inc., after its purchase, and that such modifications made it dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">See: Morrow v. Trailmobile, Inc., 12 Ariz.App. 578, 473 P.2d 780, 784-785 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The case of Elder v. Crawley Book Machinery Co., 441 F.2d 771 (3rd Cir., decided March 1, 1971) relied on by appellant, is not persuasive, as it considers only the interpretation of the word \u201cvoluntary,\u201d and its relation, as one of plaintiff\u2019s acts, to the doctrine of assumption of risk. <em>Elder </em>itself points out (441 F.2d at p. 773, note 2) that Bartkewich v. Billinger, 432 Pa. 351, 247 A.2d 603, is a case where \u201cthe plaintiff failed to prove that the machine was dangerously defective\u201d, just as that proof was lacking here, and just as it existed in <em>Elder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
