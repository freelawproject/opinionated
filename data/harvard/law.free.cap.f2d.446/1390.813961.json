Each count charged that appellant, a postal employee, knowingly and willfully embezzled a letter entrusted to him, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1709. He asserts four grounds for reversal, none of which is meritorious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-23\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts, and to show the specific intent to embezzle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-24\">Appellant\u2019s motion to strike the testimony of a postal inspector on the ground that the questioning after his arrest \u201cwas unbecoming to a postal inspector\u201d was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-25\">Appellant was informed of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) prior to the questioning and thereafter elected to give an exculpatory statement. We find no error in the receipt of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1448-26\">Finally, appellant contends that the court should have granted his post-trial motion to interview the jurors. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1391\">*1391</page-number>The motion was based on the possibility that one or more jurors may have consented to the verdict under the erroneous impression that it could be corrected on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-5\">The motion was properly denied. Testimony by a juror, as to the reasons for the jury\u2019s decision, cannot be used to impeach the jury\u2019s verdict. Walker v. United States, (9 Cir. 1962) 298 F.2d 217, 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b1449-6\">The judgment is affirmed. The mandate will issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
