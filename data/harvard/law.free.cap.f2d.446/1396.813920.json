He is entitled to credit on his sentence for time spent on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">2. His guilty plea was induced by coerced confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-8\">3. He was incompetent at his trial due to physical abuse of arresting officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">4. His trial counsel was ineffective because counsel refused to represent him unless he pled guilty and because counsel failed to raise the competency issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">5. No evidence was presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">6. The trial record is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-12\">7. The trial judge told the jury that it had no function.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-13\">8. The trial judge related his account of the crime to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-14\"><em>We </em>make note of these asserted grounds for the benefit of the record, especially as to any habeas corpus petitions which might hereafter be filed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-15\">The District Court examined the record of the state habeas corpus hearing and found it to be full, fair, and complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-16\">The District Court further found, on the basis of this record, that the appellant had not shown himself to be entitled to any relief. There had been an eviden-tiary hearing in the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-17\">We agree with the District Court and its Judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
