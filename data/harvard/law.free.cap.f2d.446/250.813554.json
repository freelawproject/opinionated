CARTER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Guy James Morrison, serving in the United States Army, filed for discharge as a conscientious objector under the provisions of Army Regulation 635-20.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His application was ultimately denied by the Conscientious Objector Review Board [CORB] and by the Adjutant General. Morrison filed a petition for writ of ha-beas corpus in the district court on the ground that the Army had wrongfully denied him discharge. The district court granted the writ and ordered Morrison\u2019s discharge. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">A. <em>Factual Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">The earliest manifestations of Morrison\u2019s conscientious objector beliefs were during a personal appearance before his selective service board in April of 1968. At that time, Morrison was appearing personally to assert his right to a I-S [student] deferment. At this hearing, he offered the board a written statement of his \u201cpolitical and moral attitudes.\u201d The contents of this proferred statement could certainly be considered an expression of conscientious objection to war.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The board ruled, however, that it would not consider the statement because it was irrelevant to Morrison\u2019s I-S deferment request. Morrison retained the statement and made no further attempt to submit the material to the board prior to receiving his induction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">After receiving his induction notice, Morrison completed and returned a C.O. Form 150 to his local board. After various proceedings within the Selective Service System, Morrison was again ordered to report and submitted to induction into the Army on June 16, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>After six months of basic combat training, advanced infantry training and the Vietnam Training Course, Morrison filed for discharge from the Army as a conscientious objector under AR 635-20. Following numerous intermediate interviews, the CORB denied Morrison\u2019s application for discharge on the ground that he had requested and been denied C.O. status by the Selective Service System, and that he had \u201cprovided no convincing evidence of a change in his beliefs.\u201d The decision of the CORB is ordinarily considered final, but in this instance, at the United States Attorney\u2019s request, the Adjutant General conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of all prior proceedings. The Adjutant General determined that \u201cMorrison\u2019s professed views were fixed prior to his induction\u201d and, therefore, \u201ccannot be approved under the provisions of AR 635-20.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Morrison\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus stated that his \u201cbeliefs have crystalized [sic] and matured since his induction into the Armed Forces and his application for discharge is thereby substantially different than the application submitted to the Selective Service System.\u201d The petition concluded with the allegation that the Army wrongfully denied Morrison's application for C.O. status under AR 635-20. The district court found that Morrison\u2019s C.O. beliefs crystallized <em>after </em>he received his induction order, and that his C.O. request had not been considered on its merits by the Selective Service System [i.e. there had been no reopening of his classification] .<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court held that \u201cAR 635-20 and the crystallization requirements therein should only be applied to deny a forum to persons whose claims have been heard and denied on the merits by the Selective Service System or to those who, knowing of their claims, can be said to have waived them.\u201d The court then concluded that Morrison \u201cbe discharged from the custody of the United States Army * * *\u201d and granted the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">B. <em>The Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-10\">We note at the outset that our examination here is limited to alleged errors in the Army proceedings. Morrison\u2019s habeas corpus does not complain of errors by the Selective Service System, and does not name the System or any of its personnel as defendants to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Our review of military determinations is said to be \u201cthe narrowest known to the law.\u201d Negre v. Larsen, (9 Cir. 1969) 418 F.2d 908, affirmed sub nom. Gillette v. United States, 401 U.S. 437, 91 S.Ct. 828, 28 L.Ed.2d 168. We are limited to a determination of whether there is a basis in fact in the record for the military determination. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1945). Speer v. Hedrick, (9 Cir. 1969) 419 F.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">1. <em>\u201cLate Crystallization\u201d and AR 635-20.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The district court found that CORB erred by denying Morrison\u2019s C.O. claim on the ground that it previously had been presented to and denied on its merits by the Selective Service System. The court determined that Morrison\u2019s claim had not been considered on its merits by the Selective Service System because of the limitations imposed by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 on reopening classifications after the issuance of an induction order. Thus, the court found that the bases and beliefs for conscientious objection expressed in Morrison\u2019s Form 150 were of the \u201clate crystallization\u201d genre.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The district court also held that the Adjutant General\u2019s denial of Morrison\u2019s claim on review of CORB\u2019s determination was improper. The Adjutant General denied Morrison\u2019s claim because it was founded upon bases and beliefs that became fixed prior to induction. The court ruled that, because a \u201clate crystallization\u201d claim was involved, the Adjutant General\u2019s interpretation of AR 635-20 resulted in the denial of <em>any </em>forum to consider the beliefs asserted in Morrison\u2019s Form 150 on their merits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Upon examination of the record, we cannot sustain the district court\u2019s finding that Morrison\u2019s Form 150 claim was one of \u201clate crystallization.\u201d The evidence clearly indicates that the bases and beliefs expressed in Morrison\u2019s Form 150 had crystallized <em>prior to </em>the issuance of his induction order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>fore, this case represents a \u201clate filing\u201d of C. 0. beliefs and not a \u201clate crystallization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In discussing \u201clate filing\u201d, this court has stated that: \u201cIf the registrant has formed conscientious objection beliefs before the order of induction, and has ample time to notify the Board to this effect and has failed to do so, he is not entitled to have his classification reopened.\u201d United States v. Kanner, (9 Cir. 1969) 416 F.2d 522, 525. Because Morrison\u2019s claim did not involve a \u201clate crystallization\u201d of beliefs, the Army could properly find that Morrison waived his right to assert a C.O. claim based <em>solely </em>upon those bases and beliefs (expressed in his Form 150 and the material submitted in April 1968) that existed and could have been asserted in the Selective Service System prior to the issuance of his induction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">Morrison has not been denied a forum for the consideration of his claim. He could have tested the proceedings before the Selective Service Board either by refusing induction and raising the question in a criminal appeal or by submitting <em>pro forma, </em>to induction and immediately seeking relief by habeas corpus. Instead he voluntarily submitted to induction and 'six months training, and then, when ordered to combat duty, raised his claim before the military by habeas corpus, asserting error in the military\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">2. <em>\u201cNew\" Claims and AR 635-20.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A58\">Morrison\u2019s petition declared that his C.O. beliefs \u201ccrystalized [sic] and matured since his induction into the Armed Forces and his application for discharge is thereby substantially different than the application submitted to the Selective Service System.\u201d It is, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>possible that the bases and beliefs supporting a C.O. claim will change significantly over a period of time as the result of reading, dialogue with others, continued introspection, and the influence of life\u2019s experiences. For example, a C.O. claim that was correctly diagnosed as insincere during selective service proceedings may subsequently become sincere as the result of traumatizing experiences in the military. Also, a regis- \u25a0 trant may have thoughts and views that have not crystallized. But once sincerely held views have crystallized, he is a conscientious objector. Further experience may strengthen or weaken these beliefs. There should be no half-and-half standard. The Selective Service Boards, the courts, and the miliary in various situations, have the obligation to determine whether at a certain time, views and beliefs of a C.O. nature have crystallized or become fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Recognizing this evolutionary characteristic of C.O. beliefs, AR 635-20 provides that the Army will consider \u201cclaims based on conscientious objection <em>growing out of experiences prior </em>to entering military service, but which did not become <em>fixed </em>until entry into the service * * *\u201d [Emphasis added]. The regulation also provides that it will not consider those claims that are based solely on beliefs that existed prior to induction. In light of <em>Ehlert v. United States, </em>(1971) 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625, we assume that this regulation is presently being interpreted to provide consideration for claims that did not become fixed until after the issuance of an induction order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, it is only those C.O. claims that are based solely upon pre-induction order beliefs that will not be considered by the army.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Morrison\u2019s application for discharge contained assertions that his beliefs and the bases for his beliefs changed after his induction into the Army and are not the same as those presented to the Selective Service System. In conclusion he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-11\">\u201cFinally, how have my views changed since coming into the army? I would say that the change has been both quantitative, in the sense that my commitment to the sanctity of life has deepened, and quisitative, in the sense that I have done a good deal of research and reflection on the theory and practice of non-violence as a means of resolving conflict, since for one who feels as I do, non-violent methods are the only acceptable ones.\u201d [Appendix to appellant\u2019s brief, p. 117].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Thus, he asserts that his C.O. claim is <em>not </em>based solely upon pre-induction order beliefs. The CORB found that \u201cMorrison has provided no convincing evidence of a change in his belief.\u201d The district court, however, did not reach the issue because of its disposition of the case on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">The district court erred in finding that Morrison\u2019s views expressed to the Army were of the \u201clate crystallization\u201d type and in overruling the decision of CORB that Morrison had \u201cpresented no convincing evidence of a change in his beliefs,\u201d and the decision of the Adjutant General that \u201cMorrison\u2019s professed views were fixed prior to his induction.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>was the precise issue presented by Morrison\u2019s petition for Habeas Corpus. The Army\u2019s finding that Morrison\u2019s views had not changed and were fixed prior to induction must not be disturbed if there is a basis in fact to support it. Speer v. Hedrick, supra, Negre v. Larsen, supra, Estep v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">If Morrison was asserting before the Army a \u201cnew claim,\u201d it must be founded upon bases and beliefs that were previously unmatured or unfixed before the induction order. A mere strengthening of prior C.O. beliefs is not sufficient. If he was a bona fide C.O. prior to his induction, then no \u201cnew basis\u201d for that claim after induction has any bearing on the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">3. <em>Court\u2019s Order of Discharge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The district court ruled that Morrison\u2019s application for discharge stated a prima facie claim to C.O. status, that the Army improperly denied that claim, and, therefore, that Morrison must be discharged from the custody of the Army. The Government asserts that the court should not have summarily ordered a discharge, but should have remanded Morrison and his claim for further proceedings within the Army. We conclude that the Government\u2019s position is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"Azx\">Stating a <em>prima facie </em>case of conscientious objection does not automatically entitle a serviceman to discharge. If the Army has erred in interpreting the crystallization requirements of its own regulations, then the matter should be returned to the appropriate military board for further consideration. We view the proper form of relief in such circumstances as that stated by this court in Zemke v. Larsen, (9 Cir. 1970) 434 F.2d 1281, 1283, to-wit: \u201c[T]he district court [shall] allow the Department of the Army a reasonable time for reconsideration of appellant\u2019s application by the Conscientious Objector Review Board and for further action thereon by the Adjutant General; failing which appellant is entitled to his release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The case is reversed and remanded to the district court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-15\">. \u201c3. Policy, a. Consideration will be given to requests for separation based on bona fide conscientious objection to participation in war, in any form, when such objection develops subsequent to entry into the active military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">b. Federal courts have held that a claim to exemption from military service under Selective Service laws must be interposed prior to notice of induction, and failure to make timely claim for exemption constitutes a waiver of the right to claim. However, claims based on conscientious objection growing out of experiences prior to entering military service, but which did not become fixed until entry into the service, will be considered. Requests for discharge after entering military service will not be accepted when \u2014 (1) Based solely on conscientious objection which existed, but which was not claimed prior to induction, enlistment, or entry on active duty or active duty for training. (2) Based solely on conscientious objection claimed and denied by the Selective Service System prior to induction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-18\">. Excerpts from Morrison\u2019s 4/29/68 statement of \u201cpolitical and moral\u201d attitudes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbT\">\u201cI could never kill anyone. I believe with all my heart in the commandment which prescribes that <em>\u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019. </em>It would destroy me emotionally if under any circumstances I destroyed the life of another human being.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-19\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-20\">\u201cI believe that all war is absurd, futile, and immoral. War represents what is basest and ugliest in human nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-21\">If these statements, <em>inter alia, </em>are sincerely held and occupy a position in Morrison\u2019s life similar to that of religion, then the requirements of <em>Welsh </em>would appear to be satisfied. Welsh v. United States, (1970) 398 U.S. 333, 90 S.Ct. 1792, 26 L.Ed.2d 308. Morrison\u2019s statements in his application to the Army clearly indicates his O.O. views are within the scope of <em>Welsh. </em>[Appendix to appellant\u2019s brief [p. 112, et seq.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b310-5\">. Because Morrison\u2019s Form 150 was filed after the issuance of his induction order, the local board refused to reopen his I-A classification on 9/16/68 and again on 10/21/68. After each refusal, Morrison complained to the State Director, and both times the State Director requested the local board to reconsider reopening Morrison\u2019s classification. Finally, on 11/25/68, the local board minutes indicate that Morrison was \u201cClassified to Class I-A.\u201d He was sent a new classification card and a notice that he had 30 days in which to request a personal appearance or to appeal. Morrison requested and obtained both a personal appearance and an appeal. These acts are consistent with the Board\u2019s obligations under the regulations whenever it <em>reopens </em>a classification. 32 C.F.R.. \u00a7\u00a7 1625.12, 1625.13. When a local board reopens a classification, it is required to consider all new information on its merits. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The district court\u2019s finding that the board did not consider Morrison\u2019s C.O. claim on its merits must be based on the conclusion that, notwithstanding the apparent indicia of reopening, the board perfunctorily and summarily denied Morrison\u2019s C.O. request without giving his claims good faith consideration. In view of Morrison\u2019s claim for relief, limited to the action of the military and our disposition of this appeal on other grounds, it is not necessary that we review this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-12\">The Government\u2019s contention that there was a reopening by the local board, which was followed by both a personal appearance and an appeal within the Selective Service System, and a classification of I-A by the appeal board, is probably not determinative of the case, nor a sound basis on which to rest our decision. Clay v. United States, 403 U.S. 698, 91 S.Ct. 2068, 29 L.Ed.2d 810, 1971, makes clear that where there are possible alternate reasons for an appeal board\u2019s decision, that decision will not be sustained where no reason is stated for the denial of the registrant\u2019s claim and the reclassification in I-A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b311-11\">. The absence of a forum in either the Selective Service System or the Army that would consider \u201clate crystallization\u201d eases was the basis for Judge Ely\u2019s concern in his concurring opinion in this court\u2019s <em>en tana </em>decision in Ehlert v. United States, (9 Cir. 1970) 422 F.2d 332, 335. On certiorari, the Supreme Court expressly conditioned its decision on the existence of a forum to consider \u201clate crystallization\u201d claims. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">\u201cWe are assured, however, by a letter included in the briefs in this case from the General Counsel of the Army to the Department of Justice, that present practice allows presentation of such claims, and that there thus exists no possibility that late crystallizers will find themselves without a forum in which to press their claims. Our conclusion in this case is based upon that assurance. For if, contrary to that assurance, a situation should arise in which neither the local board nor the military had made available a full opportunity to present a prima facie conscientious objection claim for determination under established criteria, see Welsh v. United States, <em>supra, </em>a wholly different case would be presented.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsRX\">Ehlert v. United States, (1971) 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b311-13\">. The record shows that Morrison supplied the Army, as part of his \u201cApplication for Conscientious Objector Status,\u201d with his original C.O. application to the Selective Service Board (Form 150). [Appendix to applicant\u2019s brief, p. 112], Morrison also included in application to the Army, a verbatim statement of the material he tendered to the Selective Service Board on April 29, 1968. [Appendix to appellant\u2019s brief pp. 122-123].</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">The record is thus replete with references to the existence of Morrison\u2019s C.O. beliefs <em>prior to </em>the issuance of his induction order. For example, in Morrison\u2019s Form 150 the following statements appear :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-15\">\u201cI have been non-violently involved out of pacifist conviction in several demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. I have spoken out against that conflict on numerous occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-16\">* * :]\u2022 * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-17\">On innumerable occasions, I have discussed the moral issues raised by the existence of organized warfare with my friends. My letters to Miss Jacoby, who is writing a supporting statement on my behalf, testify to my convictions. On April 29, of 1968, when I appeared before the local board to appeal a I-A classification [actually, a personal ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>pearance to request a I-S deferment] I brought with me a statement of belief in the event that the board might find it relevant. I was told that the statement was not relevant, and I kept it. I enclose that statement with this application [see excerpts at note 2 <em>supra].\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Several letters were filed in support of Morrison\u2019s Form 150. Lt. James Strat-ton stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u201cI have known Guy Morrison for four years. * * * [H]e can not reconcile himself to the taking of another human\u2019s life. For this reason, he finds war and all its surrounding aspects as inhuman and against his moral beliefs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">This conciousness [sic] of the irrationality of war and killing has been a part of Guy\u2019s life as long as I have known him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Miss Evelyn Jacoby stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">\u201cI have been a close friend of Guy Morrison for the last two and one half years. During this period of time he has frequently discussed at length with me his views about war. * * * The anticipation of being asked to participate in that form of human conflict which be considers a violation of his humanity and the humanity of all men has been the source of incredible anguish and soul searching for him for a long time. Had he realized before now that a consciencious [sic] objector status was not restricted to a specific religious sect, he would have applied for this status two years ago. He was just recently informed of his eligibility by a friend who is a member of the American Friends Service Committee (Quakers).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">Mr. Anthony Hozeny stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-17\">\u201cI have known Guy Morrison for approximately five months. During this time I have become convinced of the sincerity of his beliefs. Violence and war are repugnant to Guy\u2019s beliefs. It is appalling to him that he might ever participate, whether as a combatant or as a non-combatant affiliated with the military, in the destruction of another human life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-18\">* * iji * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-19\">Guy has not applied for a C.O. classification previously, first of all because he was not initially aware of his eligibility for this classification, and secondly, because the intense physical and mental anguish that his beliefs have demanded from him has made it difficult to get down his views explicitly on paper.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-20\"><em>See also </em>the excerpts from Morrison\u2019s statement of \u201cpolitical and moral attitudes\u201d presented to his local board at note 2 <em>supra. </em>The only evidence supporting Morrison\u2019s assertion that his C.O. beliefs did not crystallize until after he received his induction order were his own self-serving and uncorroborated statements to that effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\">. The Supreme Court in Ehlert v. United States, makes clear that a registrant is entitled to an in-service determination of Iris claim on the merits only where there was a late crystallization of his beliefs. The opinion speaks of those whose \u201cconscientious objection\u201d crystallized after notice of induction (402 U.S. pp. 103 and 106, 91 S.Ct. 1319), whose \u201cviews are late in crystallizing\u201d (402 U.S. p. 103, 91 S.Ct. 1319), whose \u201cconscientious objection ripens\u201d (Id.), and whose \u201cconscientious scruples took shape\u201d belatedly (Id.).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">As to the claims of those whose alleged conscientious objection has crystallized <em>bettveen notice and induction, </em>the Court concluded that it would base its decision upon the Army\u2019s assurance that, notwithstanding the apparent limitations of AR 635-20, a forum would be provided in the Army to consider \u201clate crystallization\u201d claims.
