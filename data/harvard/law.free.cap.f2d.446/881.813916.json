Lee contends the denial was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-20\">The officer and the Board denied Lee\u2019s application as a matter of discretion because they found he had not demonstrated his bona fide nonimmigrant status at the time of entering the United States on a nonimmigrant visa. This is a proper factor for the Board\u2019s consideration, Castillo v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 350 F.2d 1, 3-4 (9th Cir. 1965), and there was evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-21\">Petitioner argues that the decision of the Board may lead an American consul abroad to reject any subsequent application by petitioner for documentation on the ground that he obtained his nonimmigrant visa through fraud. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (19). At oral argument the Board\u2019s counsel agreed that the seriousness of the consequences which may flow from the Board\u2019s exercise of discretion is a factor in determining whether that discretion has been abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">The Board stated in its decision, however, that \u201cthe order for petitioner\u2019s deportation is not based upon any charge of fraud or misrepresentation\u201d; and the Board\u2019s brief in this court states that the decisions of the special inquiry officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>and the Board \u201ccontain no charges against Lee of fraud or misrepresentation upon which any denial of a visa application could be based.\u201d We have acted upon these assurances in concluding that, although the record is not strong, it is sufficient to sustain the Board\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The petition to review is denied and the order of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
