The statute of limitations applicable to such claim is Cal.Civ.Proc. 338, subd. 1 [Donovan v. Reinbold, 433 F.2d 738 (9th Cir. 1970)], which provides that an action must be commenced within three years from the claim\u2019s accrual. This court has held in conspiracy cases that a statute of limitations starts to run on the date of the last overt act alleged to have caused the complainant injury. Lambert v. Conrad, 308 F.2d 571 (9th Cir. 1962); Hoff<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>man v. Halden, 268 F.2d 280 (9th Cir. 1959). In this case that date was September 5, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">True, plaintiff did not commence this action until January 17, 1969 \u2014 well beyond the three year period. But plaintiff, in his amended complaint, made allegations to the effect that on September 5, 1965 \u2014 the date the claim accrued \u2014 he was, and thereafter remained, until March 23, 1966, continuously imprisoned in execution of the sentence of a criminal court. By virtue of Cal.Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 352, subd. 3 the statute of limitations was tolled during that period. Ney v. California, 439 F.2d 1285 (9th Cir. 1971). Thus, plaintiff\u2019s allegations affirmatively showed that the action was not barred; the court should not have dismissed it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-12\">. Defendant\u2019s contention that no civil rights claim is stated was not presented to the district court; we therefore express no opinion on its merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
