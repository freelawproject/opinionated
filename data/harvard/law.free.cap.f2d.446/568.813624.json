App. \u00a7 462, failure to submit to induction into the armed services.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-31\">In 1967 he registered and was classified II-S because he was in high school. He stated his belief in a Supreme Being and wrote that \u201cGod is the only being with the right to kill.\u201d In 1968 he was classified I-A, received Form 217 notifying him of his right to a personal appearance and an appeal, but did not appeal. In 1969 he was again classified IA, received the same Form 217 and again failed to appeal. On April 9, 1969, he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>ceived a final I-A classification after having told his local board he would not report for induction. Again, he did not appeal. He refused induction on June 17, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Appellant\u2019s contention that his conscientious objector claim was improperly rejected may not be considered. He has completely failed to invoke or exhaust his administrative remedies in a situation where they should have been pursued. McGee v.
