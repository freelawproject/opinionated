Through appointed counsel, appellant contends that the trial court prejudiced the defense of insanity by requiring defendant to present his medical expert out \u00f3f turn. The record belies this contention. At the commencement of trial, Schultz\u2019s attorney advised the trial court that Dr. Bell, Schultz\u2019s medical-psychiatric witness remained \u201con call.\u201d At the conclusion of the government\u2019s case in chief, except for presentation of exhibits, Schultz\u2019s counsel called Dr. Bell as defendant\u2019s first witness without any intervention by the trial judge. The record discloses the following colloquy:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">THE COURT: Do you want to call the doctor, this doctor, in rebuttal, or do you know at this point?</p>\n<p id=\"b68-18\">MR. MARTIN [attorney for government] : I don\u2019t know, I will talk to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-19\">THE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-20\">MR. O\u2019SHEA [attorney for</p>\n<p id=\"b68-21\">Schultz]: Can we get Dr. Bell ?</p>\n<p id=\"b68-22\">THE COURT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-23\">MR. O\u2019SHEA: Would you get Dr. Bell ? (Addressing the bailiff.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-24\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b68-25\">MR. O\u2019SHEA: First of all, Dr. Bell, I kind of called you unexpectedly, I apologize for that.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-26\">THE WITNESS: That is all right.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao\">This record indicates that defense counsel made a deliberate choice in the order of calling his witnesses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-27\">Schultz, pro se, has supplemented his counsel\u2019s brief and charged that the jury selection in this ease took place out of his presence, as well as out of the presence of the district judge. At oral argument, counsel for both sides indicated a recollection of the jury selection contrary to that of Schultz. The transcribed reporter\u2019s notes furnished us at our request by the United States Attorney\u2019s office disclose the commencement of jury selection in the presence of Schultz, both attorneys, and the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-28\">We find no merit in the contentions made by appellant. We dismiss this appeal as frivolous.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-13\">. We reversed Schultz\u2019s initial conviction on this charge. United States v. Schultz, 431 F.2d 907 (8th Cir. 1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-29\">. Counsel also called defendant\u2019s wife as a witness, and defendant himself testified against his counsel\u2019s advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
