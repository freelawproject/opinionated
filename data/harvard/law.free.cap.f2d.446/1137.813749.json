Following routine questioning regarding citizenship (\u201cUnited States\u201d) and purchases made in Mexico (\u201cplaster of paris and glass items\u201d), the Customs Inspector requested appellant to open the trunk. Cursory inspection disclosed \u201cwhat appeared to be a false compartment.\u201d A more thorough inspection of this \u201ccompartment\u201d conducted at the secondary inspection area resulted in the discovery of 55 pounds of marihuana and 385,000 amphetamine tablets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1139\">*1139</page-number>Appellant was charged in a four count indictment with smuggling the marihuana and amphetamine tablets into the United States from Mexico (Counts I and III), violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545, respectively, and with facilitating the transportation thereof (Counts II and IV), also respective violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 545. At a jury trial, appellant was found guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">Appellant initially argues that the verdicts are not supported by substantial evidence. At the core of her position is the following testimony of Customs Agent Aros which was elicited during the government\u2019s case in chief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1197-6\">\u201cYes. I told her that the daughter also stated they were supposed to meet Carol Wells, Lupe, Alex and Bobby across the line at a service station once inside the United States; and Mrs. Guzman, with this says, 7 <em>told yon enough. I refuse to answer any further questions\u2019, </em>and the interrogation was terminated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">In his opening summation to the jury, the government\u2019s counsel referred to appellant\u2019s refusal to continue the interrogation and asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she finish?\u201d During his final summation, the government\u2019s counsel again directed the jury\u2019s attention to this refusal and inquired, \u201cAre these reasonable, are these things reasonable?\u201d In appellant\u2019s view, \u201cabsent the damaging comments by prosecution concerning defendant\u2019s refusal to testify, the record is strikingly vacant of any evidence to show knowledge.\u201d To bolster her contention that the record does not support the jury\u2019s verdict, appellant has recapitulated the highlight of her self-serving testimony which, in effect, portrays her as an innocent, ignorant, pawn of international drug traffickers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">In truth, appellant\u2019s contention is yet another attempt to persuade this court that the innocuous act of driving across an international border an automobile later discovered to be a \u201cload car\u201d for contraband is insufficient evidence to support a smuggling conviction. We have repeatedly held that \u201cThe discovery of undeclared marihuana in a car crossing the border <em>establishes the illegal importation.\u201d </em>Plascencia-Plascencia v. United States, 423 F.2d 803 (9th Cir. 1970); United States v. Teran, 434 F.2d 605 (9th Cir. 1970). The question of the occupant\u2019s <em>knowledge </em>of the concealed contraband is for the trier of fact to answer, not a court of review. Having answered this question by way of a guilty verdict, it has long been our position that evidence which is the subject of this controversy serves as a substantial basis to draw an inference of such knowledge. United States v. Simon, 424 F.2d 1049 (9th Cir. 1970); Eason v. United States, 281 F.2d 818 (9th Cir. 1960); Evans v. United States, 257 F.2d 121 (9th Cir. 1958), cert. den. 358 U.S. 866, 79 S.Ct. 98, 3 L.Ed.2d 99 (1958), reh. den. 358 U.S. 901, 79 S.Ct. 221, 3 L.Ed.2d 150 (1958). Indeed, this result is all the more palatable in light of the jury having been given the opportunity to consider the exculpatory testimony of appellant. United States v. Zumpano, 436 F.2d 535 (9th Cir. 1970); Plascencia-Plascencia v. United States, 423 F.2d 803 (9th Cir. 1970); Aguilar v. United States, 363 F.2d 379 (9th Cir. 1966), cert. den. 388 U.S. 921, 87 S.Ct. 2119, 18 L.Ed.2d 1369 (1967). In sum, while we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>do not condone the conduct of the government\u2019s counsel, we cannot agree \u201cthat the record is strikingly vacant of any evidence to show knowledge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Appellant also fires a double barreled salvo at the guilty verdicts by asserting that on two occasions she was denied her Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination. Firstly, appellant maintains that the portion of Agent Aros\u2019 testimony detailing her refusal to continue the post-arrest interrogation was violative of the rule that \u201c * * * it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 468, fn. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1625, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Secondly, appellant contends that the references to her refusal to continue the interrogation made by the Assistant United States Attorney during his closing summations to the jury was a blatant violation of the tenet that the prosecution may not comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. In short, appellant argues that \u201cin light of the insufficiency of the evidence\u201d the government\u2019s infringements upon her guarantee against self-incrimination \u201cmay well have been the factors influencing the jury to decide as they did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim that at trial she was not accorded her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is made for the first time on appeal. Because of the belated nature of this assertion, we are bound by the settled principle that barring prejudicial error, an appellant is in no position on review to complain when he made no objection during the trial. Holt v. United States, 272 F.2d 272 (9th Cir. 1959); Az Din v. United States, 232 F.2d 283 (9th Cir. 1956), cert. den. 352 U.S. 827, 77 S.Ct. 39, 1 L.Ed.2d 49 (1956). Finding no such error to have been committed in the instant case, we are persuaded that appellant\u2019s tardy objections are subject to the settled principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-9\">In so ruling, we recognize that error in the form of Agent Aros\u2019 testimony and the closing remarks of the government\u2019s counsel is a part of the record. United States v. Allsenberrie, 424 F.2d 1209 (7th Cir. 1970); United States v. Sprengel, 103 F.2d 876 (3rd Cir. 1939). Nevertheless, we are satisfied that what error was injected in the trial proceedings was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Appellant was apprehended at the border driving an automobile containing 266 pounds of contraband. Her testimonial profession that she was without any knowledge of the illicit cargo\u2019s presence was inferentially refuted by the testimony of her daughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of this evidence, we are satisfied that the three statements in controversy did not influence the jury\u2019s decision. United States v. Wick, 416 F.2d 61 (7th Cir. 1969), cert. den. 396 U.S. 961, 90 S.Ct. 430, 24 L.Ed.2d 425 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-12\">The instant situation is in marked contrast with the one present in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). There, the prosecution\u2019s closing argument was riddled with references to defendants\u2019 failure to testify. Indeed, this failure was an intricate part of the prosecution\u2019s argument to the jury. Here, the three <em>isolated </em>statements in controversy were more unfortunate than prejudicial. Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>cause of the substantial evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict, we can perceive no disquieting effects resulting from appellant\u2019s courtroom silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1197-10\">. According to appellant, the sojourn to Tijuana began when her estranged \u201cboy friend\u201d Alfred Nardoni (she had not seen him for six months) agreed to loan her his automobile. \u201cOn the spur of the moment\u201d two girl friends, Carol Wells and Lupe (surname not disclosed by the record) decided to join appellant and her daughter. Appellant denied knowledge of a second automobile accompanying her to the border city. In Tijuana, appellant met with Nardoni. She denied seeing one, Bobby Miramon in Tijuana. Appellant returned to the United States without Carol and Lupe because \u201cthey wanted to stay and have a good time.\u201d Given the lateness of the hour and the age of her daughter, appellant felt compelled to return home. She was unable to speculate how Carol and Lupe returned from Mexico.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1198-6\">. Called as a rebuttal witness for the government, appellant\u2019s daughter stated that \u201cBobby and Alex * * * went down\u201d with them to Tijuana in another automobile. This testimony rebutted appellant\u2019s claim that she was unaware of a second automobile accompanying her to Mexico. Also, the daughter\u2019s testimony refuted the assertion tbat slie did not meet with a man named \u201cBobby\u201d in Tijuana. Clearly, the credibility of appellant\u2019s assurance to the jury that she was free of any knowledge concerning the contraband secreted in the automobile\u2019s \u201chidden compartment\u201d, was severely undermined by the rebuttal testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
