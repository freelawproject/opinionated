The District Court enjoined the appellant from interfering with the appellees\u2019 exercise, on the facility premises, of certain peaceful activities which the court found were protected under the guarantees of the First Amendment. The court\u2019s legal conclusion followed from its factual determination that the appellant\u2019s facility was, in scope, \u201cthe functional equivalent of a public business district.\u201d Tanner v. Lloyd Corp., Ltd., 308 F.Supp. 128, 130 (D.Ore.1970); <em>cf. </em>Wolin v. Port of New York Authority, 392 F.2d 83 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 940, 89 S.Ct. 290, 21 L.Ed.2d 275 (1968). <em>See also </em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S. 308, 88 S.Ct. 1601, 20 L.Ed.2d 603 (1968); Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501, 66 S.Ct. 276, 90 L.Ed. 265 (1946). Since such a factual determination, in relation to a particular case, must necessarily rest upon a consideration of all of the demonstrated circumstances of that case, we have concluded that we are powerless to hold that the critical factual determination which is here involved was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed upon the basis of the District Court\u2019s Findings of Fact and the reasoning logically followed therefrom, set forth in the court\u2019s Opinion reported at 308 F.Supp. 128 (D.Ore.1970). <em>See also </em>Diamond v. Bland, 3 Cal.3d 653, 477 P.2d 733, 91 Cal.Rptr. 501 (1970), cert. denied sub nom. Homart Dev. Co. v. Diamond, 402 U.S. 988, 91 S.Ct. 1661, 29 L.Ed.2d 153 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\">. Our opinion is not, of course, an extension of the holdings of the Supreme Court in <em>Amalgamated Food </em>and <em>Marsh. </em>The extent to which the appellant\u2019s facility had been opened to public use is reflected in the District Court\u2019s factual determinations. It was found, <em>inter alia, </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar8\">\u201cThe Mall is open to the general public. In addition, the Corporation invites groups to conduct activities there, if those activities will promote \u2018customer motivation.\u2019 It has invited schools to hold football rallies, service organizations to hold Veterans Day ceremonies, and presidential candidates to give speeches during election years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201cThe Corporation also permits groups which it believes to be worthy to use the Mall even though they do not add to \u2018customer motivation.\u2019 It permits the American Legion to sell \u2018buddy\u2019 poppies at least once each year, and every year before Christmas, it permits bellringers for the Salvation Army and Volunteers of America to set up kettles and solicit contributions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-19\">\u201cThe Corporation prohibits other groups from using the Center for their own purposes. It denied the March of Dimes and Hadassah, a national Zionist women\u2019s service organization, the opportunity to solicit contributions and denied Governor Tom McCall the opportunity to make a political speech. As part of this policy, the Corporation prohibits the distribution of handbills within the Mall.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-21\">308 F.Supp. at 129-130.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
