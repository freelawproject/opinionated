We decide the questions against the appellants and, finding no reversible error, we affirm each of the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-7\">The contention most seriously urged is that, in denying the appellant\u2019s <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motion to suppress and in admitting into evidence the fruits of the search of the automobile, the district court violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Decision of that question requires a detailed consideration of the relevant evidence. On the facts pertinent to this issue, there is little or no dispute among the attorneys on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellee\u2019s counsel candidly concedes that \u201cThe statement of the case and statement of facts as they appear in the brief on behalf of John Henry Brown, appellant, and the brief on behalf of Sinclair Hughes, Jr. and Roger Lavon Nooks, appellants, are substantially correct.\u201d We therefore quote at some length from the brief on behalf of appellant Brown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-8\">\u201cOn November 25, 1968, at approximately 12:45 P.M. the Bank of Stapleton in Jefferson County, Georgia, was robbed by three Negro men, one of whom was armed with a pistol (R. 254). The robbers ordered three bank employees and a customer into the vault, took money from the tellers\u2019 windows and escaped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-14\">\u201cSix or eight minutes later, John C. Kilgore, Jr., the head cashier and vice-president of the Bank notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in Augusta and the Georgia State Patrol station in Thompson, Georgia, of the robbery (R. 150).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-16\">\u201cAlerted by the radio broadcast to be on the lookout for a late model white Chevrolet with three Negro occupants, local police officers began the search. * * * The Sheriff of Warren County, Alton R. Dye, also heard the radio broadcast, and he proceeded alone to the intersection of Georgia 16 and 16-C on</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-15\">\u201cAt approximately 1:00 o\u2019clock P.M. the Sheriff of Jefferson County, Zollie Compton, was notified of the robbery. He, in turn, called the local Georgia Bureau of Investigation Agent, Don Branch, and they proceeded to the Bank of Stapleton. Witnesses at the Bank informed Sheriff Compton and Agent Branch that the robbers had escaped in a white 1969 Chevelle Chevrolet with a paper tag from Dunlap Chevrolet in Augusta (R. 63). This detailed description of the getaway car along with the information that three Negro men were involved was broadcast over the police radio by the Georgia State Patrol station at Thompson. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>the Warren-Glascock County line at a point about six miles from Stapleton. Sheriff Dye testified that at this time he had a description of the getaway car (R. 224) and a \u2018vague description\u2019 of the robbers (R. 306). As to the robbers themselves, Sheriff Dye admitted that ,he knew only that \u2018three colored males\u2019 were involved and that he had no more detailed information as to their size, distinguishing physical characteristics or dress (R. 224, 306-07).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-4\">\u201cSheriff Dye parked his car at the highway intersection and stood beside it with his rifle laying across the top of his car (R. 308). At approximately 2:00 P.M. Sheriff Dye observed Appellant Brown \u2014 a Negro male \u2014 driving pass (sic) the intersection toward War-renton at a lawful rate of speed, apparently alone, in a 1964 yellow Buick convertible with a black top. Appellant\u2019s car was the fourth automobile to pass the intersection after the Sheriff arrived (R. 170).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-5\">\u201cAccording to Sheriff Dye, Appellant, as he drove pass (sic) \u2018threw up his hand and waved at me, and as he continued on north he kept looking back at me and veering to the left across the center line.\u2019 (R. 224).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-6\">\u201cSuspicious, Sheriff Dye pulled Appellant\u2019s car over by using his red lights (R. 230). Sheriff Dye told Appellant to get out of his car and to hand over his driver\u2019s license \u2014 which Appellant did (R. 225).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-7\">\u201cAs Sheriff Dye checked Appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, he testified that Appellant \u201cgot to being a little nervous.\u201d (R. 225). He further testified that Appellant was talking a lot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-8\">\u201c \u2018He never did quit talking. This boy talked about me and my people, my father. He was born and raised in about a mile from where I was. He knew me. At the time I didn\u2019t know him. It had been years since I had seen him.\u2019 (R. 225).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-9\">\u201cDuring this time, according to Appellant, Sheriff Dye searched Appellant\u2019s automobile:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-10\">\u201c \u2018He (Dye) went under the front seat and back of it and looked around over the inside of the ear.\u2019 (R. 208).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a0v-dedup-0\">\u201cAlthough Sheriff Dye saw nothing incriminating in the car, he testified that he thought he heard a sound which he could not identify come from the trunk:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-11\">\u201c T heard a rustling or something in the trunk of this automobile. I don\u2019t know what kind of sound it was, but it was a movement of some type. * * *\u2019 (R. 225).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-12\">\u201cSheriff Dye later testified that the sound could have been made by some cargo shifting (R. 238), and he surmised Appellant might have been hauling liquor because the car was sagging in the rear and had mud and grass underneath it (R. 230). Sheriff Dye admitted that he had no actual basis for his suspicion that Appellant was carrying liquor and stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-13\">\u201c T stopped the car because he was acting suspicious toward me. He was looking back at me and got on the wrong side of the road. <em>I knew there was something wrong. I didn\u2019t knoiv what.\u2019 </em>(R. 231) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-14\">\u201cAt this point Sheriff Dye asked Appellant for the key to open his trunk and Appellant replied that he did not have it (R. 225).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-15\">\u201cSheriff Dye himself looked and saw that there was not another key in the ignition switch (R. 225).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1344-16\">\u201cBased merely on his suspicion that there was \u2018something\u2019 in the trunk which appellant did not want him to see, Sheriff Dye placed Appellant under arrest (R. 238) by placing Appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license in his pocket (R. 225) and by ordering Appellant to drive to the Chevrolet dealer in Warrenton so the trunk could be opened by a locksmith (R. 225, 233).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>\u201cSheriff Dye candidly admitted that there was nothing about the car or the driver which identified either with the bank robbery (R. 317) and, furthermore, at the time of arrest he had <em>no concrete evidence </em>that Appellant had any connection with the robbery of the Bank of Stapleton (R. 238). Significantly, Sheriff Dye stated that if he had sought to obtain a search warrant from a magistrate at this point, he would not have known what reason to give:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-5\">\u201c \u2018No, sir, I didn\u2019t know what for. <em>I didn\u2019t know what I was looking for but I knew 1 was going to look in the trunk of that car.\u2019 </em>(R. 239) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-6\">\u201cAs ordered by Sheriff Dye, Appellant, under arrest, proceeded toward Warrenton driving his own car (R. 311) followed closely by Sheriff Dye. It was at this point when Sheriff Dye radioed a description of the man he now had in custody that Sheriff Compton in another patrol car informed Sheriff Dye that the man he had just arrested fit the description of one of the robbers of the Bank of Stapleton (R. 311, 319-21, 226-27, 237-38).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-7\">\u201cA few minutes later, the procession of Appellant and Sheriff Dye toward Warrenton was intercepted by Agent Herndon [of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation] and all three cars stopped. Agent Herndon re-checked Appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and his tag number which verified the bill of sale Appellant had exhibited for his Buick. The three cars then continued on toward Warren-ton \u2014 -Agent Herndon leading, Appellant in the middle and Sheriff Dye behind Appellant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-8\">\u201cAs the procession passed a major highway intersection, Appellant in the middle vehicle turned left sharply and quickly accelerated. Sheriff Dye gave chase and Agent Herndon who had driven by the intersection spun his car around and joined the chase which reached speeds up to 115 m.p.h. (R. 125).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Herndon radioed the cars position and a roadblock was set up by other police officers, one of whom shot out the tires on Appellant\u2019s Buick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-12\">\u201cAppellant got out of his car with his hands up surrounded by law enforcement officers with guns drawn (R. 65, 91, 92, 132, 138). Sheriff Dye in hot pursuit ran up to Appellant and hit him in the back of the head with the butt of his rifle (R. 139). Appellant was handcuffed as he lay on the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-13\">\u201cWhen Appellant emerged from his automobile, it rolled into a nearby ditch. As officers searched the inside of the car, they were surprised (R. 74) to see two men looking up at them from the trunk through the torn flap into which the top of the covertible folds<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (R. 66). The trunk was then pried open with a crowbar and codefendants Nooks and Hughes and a box of money were discovered. A gun was discovered on the floor board under the front seat (R. 67). Nooks and Hughes were placed under arrest and handcuffed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1345-14\">\"The government stipulated at the October 3, 1969 hearing on defendant\u2019s motions to suppress that no search warrant or arrest warrant was obtained during this critical period (R. 57).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1345-15\">The briefs and arguments on appeal focus on the validity of Sheriff Dye\u2019s arrest of Brown at the time that he placed Brown\u2019s driver\u2019s license in his (Dye\u2019s) pocket and ordered Brown to drive to the Chevrolet dealer in Warren-ton. Much, however, intervened between that time and the search of the automobile, including the following: (1) Dye heard from Sheriff Compton that Brown\u2019s description fitted the description of one of the robbers of the Bank of Stapleton. (2) Brown precipitately and forcibly attempted to escape from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>Dye\u2019s custody and fled driving at speeds up to 115 m.p.h. (3) During that flight, he shot directly at Sheriff Dye. (4) The presence of two other men in the trunk of the automobile was unmistakably revealed both visually and audibly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">Before the trunk of the automobile was opened it had become academic whether Brown\u2019s original arrest was lawful or not. Brown\u2019s description and his precipitate flight had furnished additional evidence to show probable cause for his arrest and for the search of the automobile. Further, Brown had committed another crime by shooting directly at Sheriff Dye. Indeed, it became necessary to open the trunk to rescue Nooks and Hughes, as well as to arrest them. Under the circumstances known at the time of the actual search of the automobile, there can be no doubt as to the validity of that search. The nexus between that search and Brown\u2019s original arrest had been attenuated. The fruits of that search cannot realistically be treated as fruits of Brown\u2019s original arrest. We need not, therefore, pass judgment on the lawfulness, vel non, of that arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-15\">We hold simply that, at the time the trunk of the automobile was opened and the automobile was searched, probable cause existed for the arrest of all three, Brown, Nooks and Hughes; the search of the automobile incident to that arrest was \u201creasonable\u201d; and the relevant fruits of that search were admissible in evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-17\">Brown, Nooks and Hughes were positively identified as the bank robbers by John C. Kilgore, Jr., Vice President and Cashier of the Bank, by Mrs. Edna A. Kilgore, Assistant Cashier of the Bank, and by Paul H. Swint, the only customer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>of the Bank at the time of the robbery. After their arrest, all three of the accused were placed in Sheriff Compton\u2019s ear and were driven to the Bank by Sheriff Compton and Agent Branch. The car with the three accused handcuffed in the back seat was parked about ten or fifteen feet from the front of the Bank while Sheriff Compton returned the money which had been recovered. There were at least four police cars at the scene of the final arrest of the three accused and no necessity was shown for driving these accused men to the Bank. The testimony is conflicting as to whether Mr. and Mrs. Kilgore viewed them in the Sheriff\u2019s car. Brown, Nooks and Hughes so testified. Mr. Kilgore admitted going out on the sidewalk and seeing the car with several people sitting in it, and hearing the Sheriff say, \u201cWe got them,\u201d but denied going out and identifying anybody in the ear. Mrs. Kilgore denied seeing the vehicle in which the three accused men were riding. Both Mr. and Mrs. Kilgore admitted seeing pictures of the three men in a local newspaper. The caption above the pictures read \u201cSheriff Compton and Deputies Catch Stapleton Bank Robbers.\u201d Underneath each of the pictures in the newspaper appeared the name and home address of the accused whose photograph had been reproduced. Certainly the photographs, which were mug shots taken after the arrests, should not have been furnished to the press and published in this manner. A copy of the newspaper is certified as an original exhibit on appeal. The pictures are extremely dark and unclear. Both Mr. and Mrs. Kilgore made positive identification of their observation of them while they were in the Bank committing the crime and not on any picture or on other views of the defendants. Mr. Swint, the customer in the Bank, was equally positive the three defendants as the bank robbers, and testified that they relied on in his identification of the three defendants. There is no contention that Mr. Swint viewed pictures of the accused or the defendants themselves on any occasion other than the robbery. There is no indication in the record that any formal line-up was ever conducted. In summary, Swint\u2019s in-court identification of the defendants was completely untainted, and the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Kilgore was admissible for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">When all is said and done, there can be no real doubt as to the identity of the defendants. They were captured in the act of fleeing with the loot from the bank robbery. Within two hours of the robbery (R. 260) the exact amount of money stolen, with clearly identifying bank papers, was recovered from the trunk of the automobile in which the defendants were riding (Brown in the driver\u2019s seat and Nooks and Hughes locked in the trunk) and was returned to the Bank. Under circumstances so shrieking of guilt, if there were any error in admitting evidence of in-court identification, it would be error without injury, \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 1967, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">As to Brown, the jury returned the following verdict (R. 381):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-9\">\u201cWe, the jury, find the defendant, JOHN HENRY BROWN, Guilty of Robbery of a Bank accompanied by an assault or the putting in jeopardy of the life of another by the use of a dangerous weapon, as charged in the Indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-10\">\u201cThis 27 day of October, 1969.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-11\">Jerry Robbins</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"anv-dedup-0\">FOREMAN\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">Verdicts in identical form, except for the defendant\u2019s name, were returned as to Nooks and Hughes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-13\">Appellants contend that the verdicts are invalid because of the connective \u201cor\u201d between the word \u201cassault\u201d and the words \u201cputting in jeopardy of the life of another by the use of a dangerous weapon.\u201d The argument is that there is no sufficiently definite finding that the defendant did either alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>As noted at the outset of this opinion, the indictment charged the defendants with violating Section 2113(a) (d), Title 18, United States Code. The indictment employed, however, the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d instead of \u201cor.\u201d In using \u201cor\u201d the verdicts follow the language contained in Section 2113(d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The verdicts followed a form submitted (along with forms for two other possible verdicts) to the jury by the court and explained at length in the court\u2019s charges (R. 353, 356, 358, 365-367). At the conclusion of the court\u2019s charge, out of the presence of the jury, the court asked for any objections to the charge. Counsel for each of the defendants responded, \u201cNo exceptions, your Honor.\u201d (R.369). When the jury returned its verdict as to each of the three defendants, no objection was made to the form of the verdict and counsel waived polling of the jury. See Rule 31, Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\"> The verdict of the jury should be construed with reference to the indictment, the court\u2019s charge, and the entire record to arrive at the intention of the jury, and all fair intendments should be made to sustain the verdict.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> So construed, we find the verdicts sufficiently definite and valid. There is no inconsistency between the two alternatives. That is especially true in the light of the definition of \u201cassault\u201d in the district court\u2019s charge: \u201cAny willful attempt or threat to inflict injui'y upon the person of another when coupled with an apparent present ability to accomplish that purpose and an intentional display of force such as would give the victim reason to fear or expect to be in bodily harm constitutes an assault.\u201d (R. 358) Certainly the forms of the verdicts do not constitute plain error which should be noticed although not brought to the attention of the district court. Rule 52(b), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">We find no reversible error in the record, and the judgments of conviction are therefore Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">ON PETITION FOR REHEARING AND PETITION FOR REHEARING EN BANC</p>\n<author id=\"b1348-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">The Petition for Rehearing is denied and no member of this panel nor Judge in regular active service on the Court having requested that the Court be polled on rehearing en banc (Rule 35, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure; Local Fifth Circuit Rule 12), the Petition for Rehearing En Banc is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1342-13\">. \u201c(a) Whoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank, or any savings and loan association; or</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-27\">;}{ # 5\u00a1{ # *</p>\n<p id=\"b1342-28\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>* <em>* </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">\u201c(d) Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1343-11\">Subsection (f) is also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1343-12\">\u201c(f) As used in this section the term \u2018bank\u2019 means any member bank of the Federal Reserve System, and any bank, banking association, trust company, savings bank, or other banking institution organized or operating under the laws of tlie United States, and any bank the deposits of which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1343-18\">.
