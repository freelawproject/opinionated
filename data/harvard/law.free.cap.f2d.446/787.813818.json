Because we find no infirmity in the procedures that led to Law-ton\u2019s induction, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">Lawton was classified I-A on November 9, 1970. His random sequence number was reached by his local board in 1970, but insufficient time remained in the calendar year to induct him. Accordingly, in the middle of December, the board notified him that effective January 1, 1971, he would be in the Extended Priority Selection Group. Law-ton contends that as a member of this group, he should have been inducted during the first quarter of the year and that on April 1, 1971 he was entitled to assignment to a lower priority group. The government asserts that issuance of Lawton\u2019s induction order on April 5 and his induction on April 21, 1971 complied with the regulations pertaining to the Extended Priority Selection Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-16\">On November 26, 1969, the President, by Executive Order, amended Selective Service Regulations to provide for the induction of registrants by lottery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As aptly described in the Senate Report on the Selective Service Amendment Act of 1969: \u201cThe purpose of the system is to establish for the age group 19 to 20, and those older if in a deferred category, 1 year of maximum exposure for prime vulnerability for induction. After the 1 year those not inducted would be placed in a lower order for call.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>To implement selection by lottery the regulations established a First Priority Selection Group, which includes all registrants who are subject to maximum vulnerability for induction during a given calendar year.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The regulations define the Extended Priority Selection Group as those members of the First Priority Selection Group whose random sequence numbers had been reached during the year but who had not been issued orders to report for induction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Registrants exposed to induction, but not actually inducted during the period of their maximum exposure are assigned to a series of lower priority groups, which are annually reduced one step further in priority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The regulations were also amended to provide for the following order of call: (1) volunteers; (2) Extended Priority Selection Group; (3) First Priority Selection Group; (4) lower priority selection groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-20\">Since Lawton was placed in the Extended Priority Selection Group, his exposure to induction is governed by 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.7(d) (5)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-21\">\u201cMembers of the Extended Priority Selection Group who have not been issued orders to report for induction and originally scheduled for a date prior to April 1 shall forthwith be as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>signed to the lower priority selection group to which they would have been assigned had they never been assigned to the Extended Priority Selection Group; except that members of the Extended Priority Selection Group who would have been ordered to report for induction to fill the last call in the first quarter of the calendar year but who could not be issued orders shall remain in the Extended Priority Selection Group and shall be ordered to report for induction as soon as practicable. Circumstances which would prevent such an order shall include but not be limited to those arising from a personal appearance, appeal, preinduction physical examination, reconsideration, judicial proceeding, or inability of the local board to act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Lawton claims that in accordance with the first clause of this regulation he should have been inducted, if at all, prior to April 1, 1971. In support of his position, he draws an analogy to United States v. Stevens, 438 F.2d 628 (9th Cir. 1971), where a nine-month delay in induction for a security check after the registrant was ordered to report effected a cancellation of the induction order. The analogy to <em>Stevens, </em>however, is imperfect because its decision rested on 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1632.2,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which the court interpreted as prohibiting a local board from postponing induction for more than 120 days from the date of the order to report. Here, in contrast, the April 1 cutoff provided in \u00a7 1631.7(d) (5) does not have the finality of the 120 day period found in \u00a7 1632.2. Section 1631.7(d) (5) expressly allows induction after April 1 and no specific limitation is placed on the issuance of the order. Instead boards are required to order induction \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">The government contends that Lawton was properly inducted under the second clause of \u00a7 1631.7(d) (5), which authorizes the induction after April 1 of members of the Extended Priority Selection Group where orders for an earlier induction could not be issued. Lawton replies that this provision is not applicable to him because he did nothing to delay or impede his induction. He says, moreover, that the local board was not precluded from acting for reasons beyond the government\u2019s control, such as resignation of its members or vandalism of its files. The record supports Lawton\u2019s assertion that he fully cooperated with his local board and that he instituted no administrative or judicial proceedings that delayed his induction. The government concedes as much, and it attributes the delay in this case to the \u201cinability of the local board to act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">We believe the phrase \u201cinability of the local board to act\u201d should not be restricted to the extraordinary situations that Lawton suggests. The regulation employs the phrase, along with others, to illustrate the circumstances, some unspecified, which will justify induction after April 1. When a member of the Extended Priority Selection Group has not been inducted during the first quarter of the year because of the \u201cinability of the local board to act,\u201d we interpret \u00a7 1631.7 to allow induction after April 1 if (a) the local board and the armed forces have proceeded with reasonable dispatch to comply with regulations governing the selection, examination, and induction of registrants, and (b) the registrant was inducted as soon as practicable. The facts, we believe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>show that these conditions were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">On January 12, 1971, Lawton was ordered to report for a physical examination to be held on January 27, 1971. The scheduling of his physical examination, Lawton contends, delayed his induction in violation of a specific directive from Selective Service National Headquarters. He refers to a letter of March 5, 1970 written by the Acting Director to all State Directors instructing them to expedite physical examinations for all I-A registrants with random numbers 1 through 215 and all deferred registrants within the same numerical range who were likely to be removed from their current status in the next six months. Lawton\u2019s random sequence number was 159, and until his reclassification on November 9 he had a II-S deferment. He was not, however, among the deferred class of registrants mentioned in the directive. The record does not disclose that his deferment was likely to be removed during the six-month period specified by the Acting National Director, and he was not reclassified until after the expiration of the period. The board, therefore, did not violate the directive by failing to order his physical examination while he was in a deferred status.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Moreover, the board acted promptly after Lawton was reclassified. On October 16, 1970, the board had received its armed forces physical examination call for November. The November call was filled by registrants who became eligible for physical examinations before Lawton was reclassified. Lawton was not examined in December because the board received no call for physical examinations then. For these reasons it is apparent that the board was not dilatory in scheduling Lawton\u2019s examination in January. But aside from the reasonableness of the delay, it is of decisive importance that the January examination would not have prevented Lawton\u2019s induction in March had it not been for another cause of delay which we will presently discuss. We hold, therefore, that the board did not violate any regulation or directive in ordering Lawton to be examined on January 27, and the scheduling of the examination is not a bar to his induction.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Lawton also complains that his induction was impermissibly delayed by a needless security check. On January 27, when Lawton appeared for his physical examination in Raleigh, North Carolina, he qualified his security questionnaire and statement of personal history by noting that he had attended meetings and associated with members of the Ku Klux Klan, Students for a Democratic Society, and the Southern Student Organizing Committee. On February 3, the Commanding Officer of the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station in Raleigh noted that Lawton was mentally, morally, and physically qualified for military service, but because the Ku Klux Klan is on the Attorney General\u2019s list of organizations that pose a threat to national security, he sent Lawton\u2019s papers to the Army Recruiting Command in Hampton, Virginia, for a security check. The same day he notified the board of Lawton\u2019s status: \u201cAcceptability for induction held in abeyance, not presently acceptable for induction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">On February 12, the security officer of the Recruiting Command wrote the Commanding Officer of the Examining Station that Lawton was acceptable for induction. The local board received notice of Lawton\u2019s acceptability on February 24 and immediately notified him. The entire process, from the time Law-ton completed his security questionnaire and personal history until he was notified of acceptability, took less than 30 days. The district court found no undue delay in these proceedings, and the record contains no evidence to establish that this finding is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">Because a local board must notify a registrant of his acceptability 21 days before induction, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.7(a), Lawton could not be included in the March draft call, which was scheduled for March 11. Therefore, he was assigned to the next month\u2019s call, and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>April 5 he was ordered to report on April 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Lawton concedes that he qualified his security questionnaire and personal history, but, as he correctly points out, he did not acknowledge membership in an organization on the Attorney General\u2019s list. He contends, therefore, that he was available for induction when the army found him mentally, morally, and physically fit on February 3. He relies on Army Regulation 604-10 \u00a7 3-3a, which provides that a registrant who qualifies his security questionnaire or personal history statement is eligible for induction if he does not acknowledge that he is a member of an organization on the Attorney General\u2019s list or that he is a Communist. The difficulty with Lawton\u2019s position is that \u00a7 3-3a must be read with other regulations that provide for a security check when a registrant qualifies his security questionnaire or personal history even though he has not acknowledged membership in a listed organization.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Personnel at the Examining and Entrance Station are not authorized to make this check. They must send a request for the check to the Army Recruiting Command in Hampton, Virginia.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When the Recruiting Command advises the. Examining and Entrance Station that the registrant has been cleared for induction, the Station is directed to notify the local board that the registrant is acceptable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Until Lawton\u2019s local board received notice that he was acceptable, it was powerless to issue his order to report for induction. 32 C.F.R. 1631.7(a). This we hold was an instance of the \u201cinability of the local' board to act\u201d within the meaning of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.7(d) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-13\">The local board and the armed forces acted with reasonable dispatch and Law-ton was ordered to report for induction as soon as practicable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the regulations pertaining to the induction of members of the Extended Priority Selection Group were not violated. Lawton\u2019s induction was lawful and the district judge properly denied the writ.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-10\">.
