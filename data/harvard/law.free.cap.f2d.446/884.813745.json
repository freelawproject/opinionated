Ewell, 383 U.S. 116, 86 S.Ct. 773, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966); United States v. Penland, 429 F.2d 9 (9th Cir. 1970); York v. United States, 389 F.2d 761 (9th Cir. 1968); Moser v. United States, 381 F.2d 363 (9th Cir. 1967), cert. den. 389 U.S. 1054, 88 S.Ct. 802, 19 L.Ed.2d 850 (1968). The complaint was filed within the period of the statute of limitations, and the present record fails to show that Saiz was prejudiced by the delay in filing formal charges. Saiz\u2019s bare allegation that delay dimmed his memory of events does not show actual prejudice. <em>See </em>United States v. Bray, 442 F.2d 1064 (9th Cir. 1971); United States v. Penland, 429 F.2d 9 (9th Cir. 1970). The general allegation that three potential witnesses and the robbery victim were unavailable as a result of the delay is too vague to establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that the jury could have reached a different result by considering the asserted evidence foreclosed by delay.\u201d Estrella v. United States, 429 F.2d 397, 400 (9th Cir. 1970). <em>See </em>United States v. Walton, 411 F.2d 283, 288 (9th Cir. 1969). Moreover, there has been no showing in this case that the delay was the result of purposeful or oppressive Government conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Based as it is on the insufficiency of the allegations of the petition, our decision in this case should not be read to preclude District Court consideration of a future petition containing allegations of prejudice that do meet the standards of <em>Estrella, supra, </em>and <em>Walton, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
