Not satisfied with her money, he would physically abuse her. She got tired of it. Thus, this prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-23\">The instructions were quite accurate. The evidence was abundant that the dominant purpose of the peregrinations was to use her for commercial purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-24\">It is asserted that it was error to deny counsel\u2019s request for the addresses and phone numbers of the jurors, so he could interview the jurors after the verdict. He was not entitled to any such \u201croom service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-25\">The mandate will issue now.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
