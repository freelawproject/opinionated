We need consider only her contention that, in submitting the case to an eleven-man jury, the court failed to comply with Rule 23(a), F.R. Crim.P. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-27\">When the jury retired, the forelady sent a note to the court indicating that a file containing documents that were not in evidence was found in the jury room. The jury was recalled to the courtroom and the jurors were questioned by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>judge as to how much of the file they had seen. As a result, the forelady was excused. Defense counsel said that he would have no objection to substituting the alternate juror. The court replied that the alternate juror \u201chas gone home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only thing we can do is excuse her and go on with eleven jurors.\u201d Defense counsel asked permission to \u201ccheck with the defendant for a moment.\u201d After doing so, he said \u201cShe wants to go ahead, your honor. I would agree with that.\u201d Defense counsel and counsel for the government then stipulated orally to a verdict by eleven jurors. No one mentioned Rule 23(b); counsel should have called it to the court\u2019s attention but did not do so. Rule 23(b), F.R.Crim.P., states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACy\">\u201cJuries shall be of 12 but at any time before verdict the parties may stipulate in writing with the approval of the court that the jury shall consist of any number less than 12.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">Counsels\u2019 oral stipulation for an eleven-member jury was not in writing, but did appear in the reporter\u2019s transcript. The court did not personally address Guerrero-Peralta, and no statement by her concerning her decision to proceed appears in the record. An oral stipulation may, under certain circumstances, satisfy the Rule, but it must appear from the record that the defendant personally gave express consent in open court, intelligently and knowingly, to the stipulation. Rogers v. United States, 7 Cir., 1963, 319 F.2d 5; see Bayless v. United States, 9 Cir., 1967, 381 F.2d 67, 75 (oral waiver of jury trial as to certain issues, citing Rogers); Taylor v. United States, 9 Cir., 1944, 142 F.2d 808, 816 (citing Patton v. United States, 1930, 281 U.S. 276, 312, 50 S.Ct. 253, 74 L.Ed. 854).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">The government argues that the defendant\u2019s express consent need not appear in the record; that it is enough if both counsel agree to the oral stipulation, the court approves it, and the defendant is present and remains silent. It cites Williams v. United States, 7 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 36, 39; Horne v. United States, 5 Cir., 1959, 264 F.2d 40, 41.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think that this goes too far. Rule 23(b) is \u201ca mandatory requirement.\u201d United States v. Hayutin, 2 Cir., 1968, 398 F.2d 944, 950 (dictum). The purpose of a written stipulation under Rule 23(b) is to provide \u201cthe best record evidence of the <em>express </em>consent of a defendant.\u201d United States v. Virginia Erection Corp., 4 Cir., 1964, 335 F.2d 868, 871 (emphasis in original). Express consent given orally by the defendant personally and appearing on the record may be equally good evidence, but that much, as a minimum, must appear. An assertion by defense counsel that the defendant has consented is less reliable evidence, even when coupled with the inference of acquiescence drawn from defendant\u2019s failure to protest. Such an assertion is insufficient to show that the defendant\u2019s consent, if indeed it was given, was given with the requisite degree of understanding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-5\">. Rule 24(c), F.R.Crim.P., provides, in part that \u201cAn alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b935-6\">. <em>Patton, </em>states emphatically that waiver of the right to a jury of twelve requires \u201cthe express and intelligent consent of the defendant\u201d (281 U.S. at 312, 50 S.Ct. at 263). The note of the Advisory Committee on Rules states that Rule 23(b) \u201cis a restatement of existing practice, the constitutionality of which was approved in Patton v. United States * * *.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b935-12\">. We note that both <em>Williams </em>and <em>Horne </em>involved a collateral attack on the judgment while here we have a direct appeal. In <em>Horne, </em>Judge Brown drew a distinction between the two, stating that failure of the defendant personally to stipulate was an error that should have been, but was not, raised on direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b935-14\">. Compare McCarthy v. United States, 1969, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418, and Heiden v. United States, 9 Cir., 1965 (in banc), 353 F.2d 53, dealing with the requirements of Rule 11, F.R. Crim.P.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
