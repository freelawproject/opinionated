Cas. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u201c The general rule is, that patents are to be so construed, if possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ble, that the inventor shall have the benefit of what he has actually-invented, if he has invented anything.\u201d <em>Woodman </em>v. Stimpson, 3 Fish. Pat. Cas. 98, 101; <em>Goodyear </em>v. <em>Berry, ib. </em>439, 447, 448; <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Ogden, ib. </em>640, 645; 7 Blatch. 61, 65; <em>Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co. </em>v. Gardner, 4 Fish. Pat. Cas. 227; <em>Tompkins </em>v. Gage, 5 Blatch. 268, 273; <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Whisen, </em>2 Bond 115, 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">In terms, the title of this patent applies to a threshing machine, and no other. The question is, whether the patented invention includes \u201c an improved driving gearing,\u201d or the <em>\u201c </em>motive power\u201d involved therein, as described in the third claim of the specification, when applied to a sawing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The purpose of the combination which constitutes the <em>\u201c </em>improved driving gearing\u201d is declared, in the specification, to be the prevention of more strain upon the shafts when the machine is working than when running free. The language of the claim, therefore, does not preclude the broad construction for which the plaintiff contends, if the court can properly allow it. But the contention of the defendant is, that \u201c there must be several patents for several improvements of distinct machines ; that a patent, to be legal, must be for a machine as such, and not for an idea or a principle ;\u201d and that unless the principle, or idea, or mode of operation, be connected with each class of machines by a separate patent, the pretended invention is a mere <em>\u201c </em>abstraction,\u201d not patentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">There can be no doubt that, in cases where an invention for which a patent is sought comes within the category of a machine, the patent must be for it, and not for its \u201c mode of operation,\u201d nor for its \u201c principle,\u201d nor for its \u201c idea\u201d <em>(Burr </em>v. <em>Duryee, </em>1 Wall. 531, 579); that a new idea, to become patentable, must be embodied in working machinery, and adapted to practical use; and that a new force or principle can be patented only in connection with the means by which it operates. <em>Sickels </em>v. Borden, 3 Blatch. 535; <em>Morton </em>v. <em>N. Y. Eye </em>Infirmary, 5 Blatch. 116; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Sprague, </em>2 Story 164; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Harford, </em>1 Web. Pat. Cas. 331, 342; Higgins\u2019s Dig. 6, 58; <em>Jupe </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>1 Web. Pat. Cas. 146; <em>Househill Co. </em>v. <em>Neilson, ib. </em>673-718; Curtis Pat. 140-192. But the driving gearing, as described in the patentee\u2019s claim, although involving an idea, a principle, and a mode of operation, is not a mere abstraction if capable of practical application and embodiment in working machinery adapted to practical use. Although the principle can be patented only in connection with the means by which it operates, still, if it be a new principle or mode of operation, capable of such practical adaptation in connection with a threshing machine, it is patentable, though its practical application may be adapted to other kinds and classes of machinery. In order to render different letters patent necessary, the inventions \u201c must be wholly independent of each other, distinct inventions for unconnected objects, as, one to spin cotton, and another to make paper.\u201d <em>Wyeth </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>before cited. But one patent may be taken for different improvements in a single machine; and one patent may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>include two or more separate machines or improvements, each of which is or may be auxiliary to produce the same general result, as a saw and a cutter, each of which may be applied separately to the dividing of ice. If this driving gearing is patentable, as embodying the practical application of a principle to machinery, it may be united in the same patent with other improvements of a threshing machine. And when the means, devices, and organizations are patented, the patentee is entitled to the exclusive use of the mechanical organization, device, or means for all the uses and purposes to which it can be applied, without regard to the purposes to which he supposed, originally, it was most applicable. All modes, however changed in form, but which act on the same principle and effect the same end, are within the patent. <em>McComb </em>v. <em>Brodie, </em>5 Fish. Pat. Cas. 384; <em>Densmore </em>v. <em>Schofield, </em>4 Fish. Pat. Cas. 148, 154. The principle and mode of operation of this driving gearing, patented in connection with a threshing machine, is a new invention, applicable indeed to various kinds of machinery, but having a common purpose, and performing the same function when variously applied. It is an \u201c improved driving gearing\u201d for the application of motive power, and, whether applied to a threshing machine or a sawing machine, it performs the function and fulfils the purpose of its invention. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Blandy, </em>2 Fish. Pat. Cas. 89; <em>Cook </em>v. Ernest, 5 Fish. Pat. Cas. 396; <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Fiske, </em>2 Mason 112, 117; <em>Electric Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Brett, </em>10 C. B. 838; <em>Brunton </em>v. <em>Hawkes, </em>4 B. <em>&amp; </em>Ald. 541. \u201c The inventor of a machine is entitled to the benefit of all the uses to which it can be put, no matter whether he has conceived the idea of the use or not.\u201d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Ryer, </em>91 U. S. 150, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">II. An assignment of a patent right is void as against subsequent purchasers without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent Office within six months from the date thereof. U. S. Gen. St., <em>s. </em>4898. But as between the plaintiff and S., his assignor, a verbal assignment was as good as any other. <em>Pitts </em>v. <em>Whitman, </em>2 Story 609, 611. The plaintiff had no legal title to an exclusive right derived by this assignment whereby he could, in his own name, sustain an action at law for an infringement of the patent; but the verbal assignment vested in the plaintiff all the equitable right which S. had in the patent for Sullivan county, with the right to prosecute, in the name of S., any infringement of the patent, and the right to grant licenses and collect royalties; and the sale to the defendant of the plaintiff\u2019s equitable interest, to the extent of the right to use this machine in Sullivan county, furnished a sufficient consideration for the note in suit. <em>Chanter </em>v. <em>Dewhurst, </em>12 M. &amp; W. 823. A recovery by the plaintiff upon the note in suit would be a bar against any claim of S. against the defendant for the use of the machine, because S., holding the legal title as a mere trustee for the plaintiff, would be estopped to deny the right of the beneficiary to grant a license for the use of the machine. <em>Oldham </em>v. Langmead, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>cited in <em>Hayne </em>v. <em>Maltby, </em>3 Term 438, 441; <em>Cutler </em>v. Bower, 11 Q. B. (N. S.) 973; Higgins\u2019s Pat. Dig. 347, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\">III. The right of the defendant to use the machine in Sullivan county without the plaintiff\u2019s license, depends upon the question whether N., the defendant\u2019s grantor, had the right to sell the machine without restriction as to its use. N. derived his title from W., who could confer no greater right than he possessed <em>(Hawley </em>v. Mitchell, 4 Fish. Pat. Cas. 390), which was \u201cthe right to use and vend to others to be used the said improvement * * * for, to, and in the county of Merrimack, * * * and in no other places. These words limit the place of sale and the place of use. The right of limitation and restriction in a grant by the patentee or his assigns, which would not seem to be questionable, has been judicially recognized. <em>Chaffee </em>v. <em>Boston Belting Co., </em>22 How. 217, 221; <em>Bloomer </em>v. <em>McQuewan, </em>14 How. 539, 548, 549; <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Wooster, </em>6 Fish. Pat. Cas. 375, 3 Pat. Off. Gaz. 441. The defendant, therefore, as against the plaintiff, acquired by his grant from N. a title to his machine, but a title with a restricted right of use. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Burks, </em>1 Holmes 41. He had no notice of the restriction nor of the plaintiff\u2019s equities ; but \u201c notice,\u201d said Clifford, J., in <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>before cited, \u201c is not required; as the law imposes the risk upon the purchaser, as against the real owner, whether the title of the seller is such that he can make a valid conveyance or not.\u201d If not concluded by the maxim <em>caveat </em>emptor, the defendant must look to his immediate grantor for redress.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
