St., <em>c. </em>264, <em>s. </em>14, for negligently killing O. H. J., whose sole heir is his mother, A. M. It is the same case reported 58 N. H. 408. A. M. made an assignment in writing to C. of all her interest in the action. The assignment was absolute upon its face, but was really intended for the security of her counsel for their services and disbursements, the understanding being that the excess should belong to the assignor. Notice of the assignment having been given by the assignee to the defendants, they moved <em>\u201c </em>to dismiss the action for want of a proper party in court to prosecute the same.\u201d The motion was denied, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-11\">I. <em>A.

An assignment of Mrs. M.\u2019s interest in the action cannot avail to hinder, delay, or control the judgment against the defendants, which must follow the event of the suit in the manner prescribed by law.
