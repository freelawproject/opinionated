J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHh\">A deputy of sheriff Thurston, having Plummer\u2019s execution, appointed an appraiser, who was sworn within thirty days after judgment. Everett became sheriff in place of Thurston. The creditor took the execution from Thurston\u2019s deputy, and delivered it to Everett, who caused two more appraisers to be appointed, and completed the levy, the three appraisers acting together. Whether \u201cshall,\u201d in Gen. St., <em>c. </em>197, <em>ss. </em>9, 10, means \u201cmay,\u201d or whether a sheriff can be required, after he goes out of office, to complete his official business, we need not inquire. The statute, reasonably construed, does not prohibit the completion by Everett of the levy begun by a deputy of his predecessor. For some purposes, the authority of various successive public officers is necessarily continuous. The appraisers appointed by the two officers were appointed by \u201c the officer levying such execution,\u201d within the meaning of Gen. St., <em>c. </em>218, <em>s. </em>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">One of the appraisers was appointed by the creditor after he had assigned the execution to the defendant. If the defendant had the right of appointment, he has adopted the appointment made by the creditor, by claiming under the levy. <em>Odiorne </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>9 N. H. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u201c If the debtor, on due notice, neglects to appoint an appraiser,\u201d \u201c the officer shall appoint an appraiser for him.\u201d Gen. St., c. 218, <em>s. </em>8. The officer\u2019s return is, \u201c I caused\u201d an appraiser to be appointed \u201c by myself for the debtor within named, as he neglected to appoint.\u201d This is insufficient, because it does not show \u201c due notice.\u201d <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>2 N. H. 495, 497; <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Ellison, </em>3 N. <em>H. </em>279, 287; <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Aiken, </em>6 N. H. 306, 327; <em>Whittier </em>v. <em>Varney, </em>10 N.
