The question reserved is, whether, as against the claimants, the plaintiff has a lien on certain logs for all or any part of his labor. Pacts found by a referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-12\">The writ commanded the sheriff to attach the goods or estate of the defendant, \u201c and especially to attach about seven hundred thousand feet of spruce logs and about twenty thousand feet of pine logs now landed on the land of John Head, in Shelburne, in said county of Coos, near and upon the bank of the Androscoggin river, and upon said river, in order to secure and preserve the plaintiff\u2019s lieu thereon for the labor herein specified.\u201d The sheriff returned that he \u201c attached as the property of the defendant the logs within mentioned, in order to secure and preserve the plaintiff\u2019s lien thereon for the within indebtedness.\u201d The claimants objected that the description of the logs, the lien, and the labor, in the writ, was insufficient; that the declaration and specification should have alleged that the plaintiff labored at cutting, hauling, or drawing the logs, and claimed a lien on them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-13\">The logs attached on the plaintiff\u2019s writ are those on which he claims a lien. They were cut during the logging season of 1876-\u20197, by the defendant\u2019s men, of whom the plaintiff was one, on the land of one Kronberg, in Shelburne, and hauled to the Androscoggin river, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>where they were attached on the plaintiff\u2019s writ, March 17, 1877. <em>By </em>the contract made between the defendant and Kronberg, September 12, 1876, the defendant was to pay Kronberg a certain price per thousand feet, on or before May 1,1877. After that contract was made, the defendant made a contract with the claimants, by which the claimants were to have the logs, and pay Kronberg the sum he would be entitled to receive from the defendant. The logs were to be delivered to the claimants, when measured, on the bank of the river. The claimant\u2019s mark was put upon them in the woods by the defendant\u2019s men, by order of the claimant\u2019s agent. The claimants contend that upon these facts the defendant was a sub-contractor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-3\">The plaintiff commenced his job October 2, 1876, and, working continuously, finished the last of January or the first of February, 1877. A part of his work was done within sixty days of the attachment, and a part before that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-4\">The claimants contend that the plaintiff has no lien for any work done more than sixty days before the attachment, and that his work cannot be divided, and consequently he has no lien for any of it. The referee found that the contract under which the plaintiff\u2019s work was done was a continuous one.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-5\">Ray, <em>Drew &amp; </em>Jordan, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-6\"><em>Twitchell &amp; </em>Evans, for the claimants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b510-7\">Foster, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2i\">The logs became the property of the defendant as fast as they were cut, Kronberg having reserved no lien upon them. The claimants took them by purchase from the defendant, subject to the plaintiff\u2019s right to enforce his lien, under the provisions of Gen. St., c. 125, s. 14, whereby it is enacted that \u201cAny person, who labors at cutting, hauling, or drawing wood, bark, logs, or lumber, shall have a lien thereon for his personal services, which lien shall take precedence of all other claims, except liens on account of public taxes, to continue sixty days after the services are performed, and may be secured by attachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">There was no privity of contract between Kronberg and the claimants, and we are unable to discover any ground upon which the defendant can be regarded as an agent or sub-contractor of the owner. The claimants were not, therefore, entitled to notice of the plaintiff\u2019s lien, as provided by Laws of 1871, c. 1, <em>s. </em>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The marking of the logs with the claimants\u2019 mark in the woods was an act done under the direction of the claimants\u2019 agent. The title did not pass from the defendant until the logs were delivered to the claimants on the bank of the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The statutory lien of a lumberman commences with the commencement of his work, continues a limited time after the performance of the labor, and may be secured by attachment. All persons dealing with the owner of the property are bound to take notice of the statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>tory liability of an incumbrance of this nature, and must regulate their contracts and conduct with reference thereto. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>51 N. H. 213, 214, 215; <em>Freeto </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>58 N. H. 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The description of the logs contained in the mandate for their attachment was quite as definite as the nature of the case would see'm to permit, and we regard it as sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The sufficiency of the precept to the officer, and of his attachment, depends not at all upon the form of the declaration in the writ or the specification, which are not intended to convey directions to the officer, but only information for the court and the defendant. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>51 N. H. 213, 216. The mandate to the officer is sufficient, if any reference therein to the character of the plaintiff\u2019s labor were required.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The referee has found that \u201c the contract under which the plaintiff\u2019s work was done was a continuous one,\u201d by which, we suppose, is meant that it was an entire contract or job for continuous labor. If this is to be regarded as a conclusion of law, it seems fully justified by the facts disclosed. The lien, therefore, attached as security for all the labor performed in cutting or hauling the logs from the beginning of such work, and continued for a period of sixty days after the last labor was performed under such continuous contract. The object of the statute was not to secure a lien for no more than sixty days\u2019 work, or for no more labor than was actually expended during the sixty days immediately preceding the attachment, but to apply the lien to all the labor done under the contract, notwithstanding it may have occupied a period much longer than sixty days. <em>Calef </em>v. <em>Brinley, </em>58 N. H. 90; <em>Freeto </em>v. <em>Houghton, </em>before cited; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>117 Mass. 179; <em>Stine </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>9 Mo. 558; <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>West, </em>12 Iowa 122; <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>14 Wis. 125; <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Winslow, </em>18 Pa. 160; <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Kingan, </em>19 Pa. 841; <em>Yearsley </em>v. <em>Flanigen, </em>22 Pa. 489; <em>Derrickson </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>29 N. J. L. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The attachment made within sixty days of the plaintiff\u2019s last work preserved his lien for all his work, including that done more than sixty days before the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff on the report.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-10\">Doe, C.
