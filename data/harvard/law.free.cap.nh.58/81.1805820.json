J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZq\">If the defendant, without authority, had sold the plaintiff\u2019s personal property and received the price, the plaintiff could ordinarily waive the tort, ratify the unauthorized sale, and recover the money of the defendant in this form of action; and, so far as his rights depend upon the general principles of agency, waiver, and ratification, he may confirm the unauthorized sale of his real estate. The defendant objects that nothing passed by his deed, and that the plaintiff may recover the land of the purchaser, who will have a remedy against the defendant on his warranty. If this objection is supported by any distinction between real and personal estate, it might have been obviated by a conveyance of the land from the plaintiff to the defendant before suit. And it may be obviated in the same way at any time before judgment. <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>22 Pick. 18; <em>Manning </em>v.
