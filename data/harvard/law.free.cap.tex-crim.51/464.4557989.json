The indictment, as stated above, which appellant was prosecuted under, was for- rudely displaying a pistol in a public place, same' being a deadly weapon. The transcript shows in this ease, as contained in this record, the defendant was charged with carrying a pistol. We furthermore note the fact that there is no seal upon the transcript. These errors vitiate the transcript, and the court should have sustained the motion to qaush same. The fact of putting the seal upon the papers by the district clerk after same were filed in the county court was unauthorized. See Rev. Civ. Stats, of Texas, art. 1122; Turner v. State, 18 S. W. Rep., 96; Hale v. Gee, 29 S. W. Rep., 44; Brumley v. State, 11 Texas Crim. App., 114; Walker v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">For the error of the court in refusing to quash the indictment, and the errors pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded,</p>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
