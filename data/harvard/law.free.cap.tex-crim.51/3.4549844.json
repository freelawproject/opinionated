Subsequently, the court set aside his judgment awarding a new trial, and sought to reinstate the judgment of cbnviction. Upon this error is assigned. Appellant\u2019s contention is well taken. After a motion for new trial has been awarded appellant, the case stands as it originally stood, that is, for trial. This question was discussed in Mathis v. State, 40 Texas Crim. Rep., 316. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-14\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
