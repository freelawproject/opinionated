In a clause of the order overruling motion in arrest of judgment appears this language: \u201cIt is further noted that said defendant asked leave for twenty days after the adjournment of this court in which to prepare and file a statement of facts and bills of exception.\u201d But there is no order entered up by the court granting said leave. In the absence of an order from the district judge granting said twenty days the statement of facts cannot be considered.
