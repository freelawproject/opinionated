The evidence shows that the party from whom the animals were taken was dead at the time of this trial, but as suggested by the trial court, in his charge, this fact can be proved by circumstantial evidence as well as by positive testimony, and we hold that it was clearly done by the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">Appellant objects to the following charge of the court: \u201cIf wheii the defendant\u2019s possession of the animals mentioned in the indictment was questioned (if you find he had possession of them), he stated that he got the animals from a drover on Plum Creek, and if such statement is reasonable and probably true, then, unless the State has shown such explanation of possession to be false, you will acquit the defendant.\u201d Appellant insists this charge is on the weight of evidence, and is an inaccurate statement of the law. We think it is a charge upon the weight of the evidence. We have repeatedly held this is an erroneous charge. As we understand the evidence, however, there is no evidence suggesting a charge on recent possession. For a discussion of a proper charge see Wheeler v. State, 34 Texas Crim. Rep., 350; Franks v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 149, 35 S. W. Rep., 977, and Mathews v. State, 32 Texas Crim.
