On the morning of and preceding the homicide, the mother of the deceased was permitted to testify, that she was at home by herself, and appellant came there. The witness went on to state some preliminary facts as to what she did herself in regard to cleaning up the house, and matters of that sort, which were excluded by the court upon exception of appellant. She then stated that she sat down and after a while it seemed she heard some one coming in at the back part of the house and wondered who it was, heard whoever it was drag his feet upon the back gallery. The witness says it rather frightened her. The court asked, \u201cWho was that?\u201d A. \u201cIt was Henry Vaughn, and I sat there and he stood there awhile and he said \u2018Where is Mary?\u2019\u201d Q. \u201cWhat time in the morning was that?\u201d A. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess it was about 10 o\u2019clock as well as I remember. I didn\u2019t look at the clock. I know it was late. So I sat there and was eating and paid no attention to him, and he stood there, and after awhile he said, \u2018Where is M\u00e1ry?\u2019 I said she went off this morning. \u2018What time did she go?\u2019 I said I don\u2019t know what time she went; I didn\u2019t notice what time she went. He stood there awhile and looked at me; he passed right in my back by the little door coming from the kitchen to the dining-room, and he looked so straight, looked like he was looking under the dresser.\u201d Counsel for the defendant: \u201cWe objected to that, your honor.\u201d The court: \u201cState what he did.\u201d A. \u201cThen he turned back and said to me, \u2018Mary has been to Lucy Leith\u2019s talking about me.\u2019 I said: \u2018Here you go with a whole lot of lies; here you go, you ought to stop it man and attend to your business and stop listening to lies,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Another thing you can\u2019t blame people for talking, you come here to make a racket.\u2019 \u201d ,, Counsel for the defendant: \u201cWe object to what she said about what, other people said.\u201d The court: \u201cShe is telling the defendant this.\u201d Counsel for the defendant: \u201cWe except to the ruling of the court.\u201d Exception was reserve'd to this testimony because irrelevant; what she did was immaterial, and all of the testimony ivas prejudicial. This is signed with the qualification that the court sustained defendant\u2019s exception except as to the conversation with the'defendant by the witness. This was not error. That portion of the conversation occurring between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>witness and appellant in regard to Mary, the deceased, and as detailed in this bill of exceptions, was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">A bill of exceptions was reserved to the action of the same witness in giving way to her feelings and shedding tears, and some exclamations made by her on the witness stand. This witness stated that when she arrived at the gate where the 'homicide was committed a policeman stood there and did not ivant her to see her deceased daughter lying in the yard. Counsel for the defendant: \u201cWe object to. that, if the court please.\u201d The court: \u201cNever mind that, state what you did and saw.\u201d A. \u201cThen I saw when I looked over the gate\u2014 Oh Lord it\u2019s awful hard\u2014when I got to the gate and was going in they had a man to keep me from going in and a lady pulling me and I looked over the gate and saw, Oh Lord, Oh my Cod\u2014Oh Lord.\u201d The expression, \u201cOh Lord\u201d was repeated three or four times. Appellant objected to the action of the witness and suggested that she quiet herself, and requested a bill of exceptions to the entire proceedings. The court remarked that they are trying to quiet her as hard as they know how. The witness cried and sobbed, and the proceedings were delayed a little while, and the deputy sheriff handed her some water. Whereupon counsel for the defendant asked the court to instruct the jury not to consider the actions of the witness. The court made the following statement: \u201cThe jury is there to view the witness, I have nothing to say to the jury.\u201d Counsel for the defendant: \u201cWe except to the ruling of -the court.\u201d After the witness cried and sobbed for a few moments she was taken from the court room, by consent of all parties. .It is contended in bill of exceptions that this was highly prejudicial to appellant\u2019s cause before the jury, and the court should have instructed the jury to disregard her actions and exclamations. The court sign\u2019s this with the qualification that the court could not control the feelings of the witness, and the jury is the exclusive judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. Under the recent .case of Holt v. State, decided at the present term of this court, this would not constitute a cause for reversal. For a discussion of the matter see that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Caroline Smith was testifying for the State, and stated that she was standing on the track with Lucy Leith and they started up the track, and Henry Vaughn said, \u201cMrs. Smith.\u201d Counsel for defendant at this point objected to what was said by the parties, as it was the defendant talking in her presence. Appellant then said, \u201cI want to have a private talk with my wife and don\u2019t want any one to know my business,\u201d and witness said, \u201cI will go back Mary,\u201d \"and Mary said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t go back.\u201d Mary was appellant\u2019s wife. It is objected - because this testimony was immaterial and prejudicial. We are of opinion that this evidence was admissible. It was the appellant himself talking to the parties present, and asking them to excuse themselves so that he could have a private talk with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">While Caroline Smith was on cross-examination, appellant asked her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>if she ever saw deceased with a razor, which she denied. She further denied that she ever saw her with a knife except when sitting at the table eating. There are several questions and answers along this line wherein appellant sought to prove by this witness that she had seen deceased with a razor or knife, and further that she had the reputation of carrying a razor, all of which was denied by the witness. Appellant then sought to prove by the same witness that she knew something about a difficulty between the deceased and one Mary Akers, in which difficulty deceased had cut the other woman with a razor. The witness denied ever having heard of it or knowing anything about it. She was then asked if she had ever heard anything about, it. The State\u2019s counsel then objected and the court sustained the objection. The only purpose, it seems, for which this testimony was sought was in trying to prove the habit of deceased in carrying a razor, and that she would likely carry into execution any threats she might .make. Strictly speaking, this testimony as presented was not admissible, and as presented by the bill it shows no reason for its admission. Appellant was the husband of the deceased, and if she was in the habit of earning a razor he perhaps would have known that fact. Appellant\u2019s theory seems to be that if she had the reputation of carrying a razor, that it would be deducible, therefore, that her reputation was such that she would carry into execution a threat. One presumption cannot he based upon another. While it might be proved that the reputation of the deceased was that of a dangerous person and she was liable to carry into execution a threat, still this could not be proved by another reputation that she had of going armed with a razor. We are of opinion that the court did not err in refusing to admit the testimony as presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Stevens, the constable, was introduced for the purpose of identifying the knife used by appellant in committing the homicide. It seems that appellant was under arrest at the time he told the witness that the knife pointed out was the knife used in committing the homicide, and this was subsequent to the warning given by the constable, and, among other things, after being so warned, appellant identified the knife in question as the knife, with which he cut the throat of the deceased. Counsel for defendant insisted that the witness was attempting to give testimony which was brought out at the inquest proceedings, but this seems to be left in doubt as to whether it was at the inquest or at the jail after the warning. This part of the bill seems to present the question: Q. \u201cYou say you had a conversation with the defendant ?\u201d A. \u201cYes, the knife was lying on the table, and I asked him, if it was the knife he referred to in the conversation in the county jail, and he said \u2018yes, it was the knife.\u2019\u201d Q. \u201cI will ask you to examine that knife, Mr. Stevens?\u201d A. \u201cWell, it looks just like the knife.\u201d Q. \u201cIs anything about it you recognize?\u201d A. \u201cThe blood on it and it is the same make of knife. I did not have it in my pos- . session all the time.\u201d Q. \u201cIs this the knife ?\u201d A. \u201cThat\u2019s the knife.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Q. \u201cThis is the knife he identified and said it was the knife he used in this killing (at inquest proceedings) ?\u201d A. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Counsel for the defendant: \u201cTh\u00e9 -court understands our exception goes to all this testimony?\u201d The- court: \u201cYes, I understand the objection.\u201d Exception was reserved to this because it was shown the defendant stated he did not care to make any statement to them; that frequently, in making his statements he hesitated and stopped and would not proceed again to make a statement except upon the urgent solicitation of the constable and district attorney, and that a part of the testimony was from statements made or claimed by him to have been made by the defendant at the inquest proceedings, which were in fact a preliminary hearing; that at said examination or inquest the defendant was not represented by counsel and the State was, and that appellant was there under arrest. It is a difficult matter to understand exactly what the trouble is and which occurrence the testimony relates to or bears upon, and in that condition of the record we do not feel authorized to review the bill of exceptions. It was admissible to identify the knife as was done. Bills of exception must be clear enough to indicate to the court the testimony sought to be excluded and the reasons for its exclusion. Unquestionably, if appellant identified the knife and made statements indicating that the knife in question was the one he used, having been warned before, making such statements, it would be admissible, although he was under arrest, but what bearing the inquest proceedings had upon the identification of the knife and from what is said in the bill, we are unable to understand, but as the bill is presented, it fails to show error.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">While appellant was testifying in his own behalf, the following matters occurred, speaking of deceased: Q. \u201cDid you know her general reputation as to whether or not she carried razors?\u201d State objected. Q. \u201cWell then, do you know her general reputation as to whether she was a peaceable and law abiding woman, or a violent and dangerous woman?\u201d The court: \u201cAnswer yes or no.\u201d A. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d Counsel for the defendant: \u201cI object to the court and counsel for the State instructing the witness.\u201d The court: \u201cI have to instruct this witness, to answer yes or no, the statute says so.\u201d Counsel for the defendant: \u201cWe object to the manner in which the court is doing it.\u201d The court: \u201cThe objection is overruled.\u201d Counsel for the defendant: \u201cWe except.\u201d We fail to see where there is anything reserved in this bill of exceptions that was any way injurious. The court instructed the witness that he must first answer yes or no, as to whether he knew her general reputation, before answering what that reputation was. We think the court was correct in this. .There was no error in this because the witness answered that he did not know anything about the deceased\u2019s reputation. The same character of proceedings was had with reference to other witnesses set out in bills of exception, which we deem unnecessary to review. In every instance, the witnesses, sooner or later, after being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>instructed by the court, answered the question, and generally favorably to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Another bill of exceptions was reserved to the ruling of the court refusing to permit the witness Robinson to state that no man could belong to the TJ. B. F. society or order unless he was a pretty good man, appellant being a member of that order. We suppose this evidence was offered to show that it related to appellant\u2019s general reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">There were several charges requested by appellant, two of which were given, and the other two refused. The rejected instructions had relation to and bore upon same questions as those submitted in the charges given, and were sufficiently covered by the instructions given. It is not necessary to repeat charges when once given, and it is not error to refuse to repeat the charges after they have been once given.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">After the testimony had closed and pending the argument, during perhaps a recess of the court, at least the jury had retired to the water-closet, one of the jurors was overheard to state in reference to appellant, \u201cI believe the damn scoundrel is guilty, and for my part we will hang him.\u201d That this affiant further stated that he heard some members of the jury discussing the case, but this wras the only language which he could relate that he had heard. It is contended that this is reversible error or rather that it constituted ground for a motion for new trial. No authority has been cited in support of this statement, and Scott v. State, 4 Texas Ct. Rep., 842, is authority against appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">There is another question presented for revision. While counsel for appellant was discussing the facts to the jury, one or two jurors took issue with him in regard to counsel\u2019s statements as to what the witness Caroline Smith should have testified. When this discussion arose between the counsel and the jurors, the counsel requested that the stenographer who took down the testimony should be called with his stenographic report and read to the jury from such report the particular statements about which the controversy or discussion arose. This was declined by the court, and the bill is qualified by stating that the court asked the jury if any of them desired the witness to be recalled and they all answered in the negative. The statute provides that at the request of the jury any witness may be recalled to state the testimony given by the witness in regard to any particular point about which a controversy may arise, but by its terms it does not authorize the court to recall a witness for any other reason. In fact, the statute has limited the right to recall a witness to the request by the jury, and not only so, but when recalled a witness\u2019 testimony must be a repetition of the statements made while on the witness stand. We have found no case where witnesses have been recalled otherwise than under the statute, nor a discussion of such questions. Nor do we feel authorized to extend the statute to reproducing the testimony by the stenographer instead of the witness as provided by the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>If it was necessary to have the exact language of the witness before the jury, then the witness must be called, unless by agreement they might substitute the stenographer\u2019s statement on the theory that he had taken down correctly the statement of the witness, but when the tefms of the statute are invoked the witnes smust be recalled. It may be further noted that the bill of exceptions does not state the testimony about which the disagreement arose. We are of opinion that the bill is deficient in this; that in this as other matters, the bill must be not only sufficiently definite for the court to understand the question at issue, but it must show something that would have probably injured appellant\u2019s cause before the jury. The case from the State\u2019s standpoint would justify the verdict of the jury. There was evidence which would have authorized the jury to find a milder punishment. Appellant killed his wife he says because she had been going with another man, but upon the trial there was a failure to show this testimony otherwise than by his statements. The party from whom he said he obtained this information was placed on the stand and denied conveying to him such information. Appellant and his wife had been separated sometime, and it seems his wife had refused to live with him. He went to her mother\u2019s where she was living, and under the circumstances from which the jury might infer, with coolness, deliberation, and premeditation, cut her throat and killed her. Under the condition of the record we do not feel that the court would be authorized to say that the jury had rendered a verdict not supported by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\">Finding no error in the record, the jdugment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
