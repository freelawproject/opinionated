By virtue of sub-division 13 of said act this tax was levied and the following section 14 levied a tax upon the same class but who practiced their profession only locally. So it will be observed that the difference between the two sections or subdivisions of said occupation tax law is found in the fact that one class applies to traveling physicians, etc., while the other applies to local physicians. By the Act of the Twenty-Sixth Legislature, page 320 of the acts of that body, sub-division 14 was repealed. It related only to that particular clause of the Act of the Twenty-Fifth Legislature which pertained to the physicians, etc., who were localized in their practice. It is contended that by the repeal of said sub-division 14, the provisions of the repealing act are sufficiently broad and comprehensive to repeal sub-division 13 with reference to traveling physicians. Such was not the intention .of the Legislature. By the terms of the Act of the Twenty-Sixth Legislature sub-division 14 is specifically enumerated and only subdivision 14 is mentioned as having been repealed. There is nothing in the contention of appellant, therefore, that the act as to traveling physicians was repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>It is also urged that there is no license law under which appellant can be punished, because the license is not particularly described. We cannot assent to that proposition. Article 112, Penal Code, provides: \u201cAny person who shall pursue or follow any occupation, calling or profession, or do any act taxed by law, without first obtaining a license therefor, shall be fined in any sum not less than the amount of the taxes due, and not more than double that sum.\u201d Unless the law specifically prescribes what a license is or may contain, a receipt for the occupation tax is regarded as a license, and unless the Legislature prescribed otherwise, a receipt for the tax will operate as a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Appellant urges insufficiency of the evidence to bring him within the terms of the law. This question cannot be reviewed or discussed because the facts are not before us. There is what purports to be a statement of facts in the record, but it was not filed in the trial court, and was not approved until after the adjournment of court. The record does not contain any authority for the filing of the statement after the adjournment of court. So this question will not be reviewed. As the record is presented, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">March 20, 1907.</p>\n<author id=\"b25-9\">DAVIDSON, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A-3\">The judgment, on a former day of this term, in this case was affirmed. We find among the papers what is supposed to be appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing, which is not signed by appellant or his attorneys. Treating it as an oversight on the part of the attorneys failing to sign this motion, we do not find anything stated in it which requires a revision of the case. The affirmance occurred without reference to the statement of facts because filed out of term time and the record does not contain the necessary order for that purpose. This unsigned and unsworn application before us for rehearing states that there was an order made but it was not entered of record; in fact, it was never entered in the minutes of the court. If the order had been entered upon the minutes or the court\u2019s docket, it would have afforded a sufficient reason for this court to entertain said statement of facts, but as the matter is presented, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
