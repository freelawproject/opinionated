HOLDERMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">On March 21, 2007, District Judge David H. Coar, who was then presiding in this case, granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification in this multi-district antitrust litigation. More than four years later, on June 7, 2011, after Judge Coar\u2019s December 31, 2010 retirement and the May 18, 2011 reassignment of this case, defendants Noranda, Inc., Falconbridge Limited, and NorFalco LLC (collectively \u201cNoranda\u201d) and defendants Intertrade Holdings Inc., Pressure Vessel Services, Inc., Koch Sulfur Products Company, and Koch Sulfur Products Company, LLC (collectively \u201cKoch\u201d) filed \u201cDefendants\u2019 Motion to Decertify\u201d (Dkt. No. 641), now pending before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-8\">Noranda and Koch (together \u201cDefendants\u201d) argue that decertification is warranted in light of \u201csignificant developments in Rule 23 jurisprudence,\u201d changes in the expert testimony relied on by Plaintiffs, and additional discovery undertaken since the entry of Judge Coar\u2019s March 2007 class certification order. For the reasons set forth below, Defendants\u2019 motion (Dkt. No. 641) is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">\n<em>JUDGE COAR\u2019S MARCH 21, 2007 OPINION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">The class certified by Judge Coar on March 21, 2007, was proposed by Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and certified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1120-12\">All persons (excluding federal, state, and local governmental entities and political subdivisions, the Defendants, and their respective parents, subsidiaries and affiliates) who purchased sulfuric acid in the United States directly from one or more of the Defendants or their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, or joint ventures during the period January 1, 1988 through January 16, 2003.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1120-13\">(Dkt. No. 536 (\u201cCertification Order\u201d) at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-14\">In analyzing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, Judge Coar first found that Plaintiffs had satisfied the four requirements of Rule 23(a): numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation. <em>(Id. </em>at 3-9.) Defendants do not take issue with Judge Coar\u2019s findings, and this court need not further discuss the details of Judge Coar\u2019s reasoning on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-15\">Judge Coar next analyzed whether Plaintiffs had demonstrated \u201cthat common questions of law or fact predominate over individual questions\u201d under Rule 23(b)(3). <em>(Id. </em>at 9.) Noting that \u201cquestions of impact and damages revolving] around individual determinations\u201d had the potential to \u201cmove this case beyond the scope of permissible certification under Rule 23(b)(3),\u201d Judge Coar determined that, at the class certification stage, \u201cPlaintiffs need only establish that they have \u2018realistic methodologies for establishing damages on a classwide basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 10-11 (quoting <em>In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litig., </em>94 C 897, MDL 997,1994 WL 663590, at *5 (N.D.Ill.1994)) (Kocoras, J.).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifieal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>ly, Judge Coar required Plaintiffs to make \u201ca threshold showing that what proof they will offer will be sufficiently generalized in nature\u201d to warrant class treatment. <em>(Id. </em>at 15 (quoting <em>In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litig., </em>200 F.R.D. 297, 319 (E.D.Mich.2001)).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Judge Coar recognized that the parties\u2019 respective experts, Dr. Martin Asher testifying for Plaintiffs and Dr. Lauren Stiroh testifying for Defendants, disagreed on a number of factors relevant to the determination of class-wide damages, including the fungibility of sulfuric acid of different strengths across different geographic regions and \u201cthe conformity of the price changes across types and regions.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 15.) Judge Coar declined, however, to engage in a \u201cbattle of the experts\u201d at the class certification stage, stating \u201cthis is not the right time ... to launch into an extensive analysis of the facts or weighing of the merits.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Relying on \u201cDr. Asher\u2019s testimony, the likelihood that sulfuric acid can be treated as a fungible good, preliminary evidence that Defendants approached the market as one that was national in scope, and the possibility for adjusting the class mechanism in the future,\u201d Judge Coar found that Plaintiffs had made a \u201cthreshold showing\u201d that they would be able to establish injury on a class-wide basis, thus satisfying the predominance requirement of Rule 23(b)(3). <em>(Id. </em>at 15-16.) Judge Coar also explicitly retained the ability to alter or amend the class certification order \u201cshould regional variations make the class untenable as defined.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 17)(eiting Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1)(C).) Finally, Judge Coar found \u201cprovisionally\u201d that \u201cclass certification presents the most efficient means of adjudicating the controversy,\u201d as required by Rule 23(b)(3). <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">\n<em>RELEVANT PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5q\">The class certification motion granted by Judge Coar on March 23, 2007, was initially filed by Plaintiffs on May 5, 2004, including Dr. Asher\u2019s 12-page expert report. (Dkt. No. 659 (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Mem.\u201d) at 6-7; <em>see also </em>Dkt. Nos. 55-57.) During the course of subsequent pretrial discovery, however, Plaintiffs additionally identified two different individuals as their testifying experts: Dr. James McClave and Dr. Robert Tollison. (Id.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After Judge Coar issued his March 21, 2007 order granting class certification, Defendants filed a motion to reconsider arguing that Plaintiffs had abandoned Dr. Asher as an expert witness. <em>(Id.; see also </em>Dkt. No. 537.) Judge Coar summarily denied Defendants\u2019 motion to reconsider without elaboration. <em>(Id.; see </em>Defs.\u2019 Ex. 4 (\u201c4/11/2007 Tr.\u201d) at 3-4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">Three and one-half years later, on September 24, 2010, Judge Coar granted in part and denied in part Defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 601.) Defendants attempted to appeal portions of Judge Coar\u2019s September 24, 2010 ruling, but the Seventh Circuit dismissed the interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction on June 10, 2011. (Dkt. No. 674.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-11\">As stated earlier, Judge Coar retired from the federal bench effective December 31, 2010, and the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation reassigned this case to this court\u2019s calendar on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>May 18, 2011. Also as stated earlier, Defendants filed their pending motion to decertify (Dkt. No. 641) on June 7, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">\n<em>LEGAL STANDARD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEO\">Under Rule 23, \u201c[a]n order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.\u201d Fed. R. Civ.P. 23(c)(1)(C); <em>see also Gen. Tel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 160, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982) (\u201cEven after a certification order is entered, the judge remains free to modify it in the light of subsequent developments in the litigation.\u201d); <em>Eggleston v. Chi. Journeymen Plumbers\u2019 Local Union No. 130, U.A., </em>657 F.2d 890, 896 (7th Cir.1981) (\u201cIf the certification of the class is later deemed to be improvident, the court may decertify, sub-classify, alter the certification, or permit intervention.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">On the other hand, \u201claw-of-the-case principles are applicable when a case is transferred to a new judge midway through litigation.\u201d <em>Gilbert v. Ill. State Bd. of Educ., </em>591 F.3d 896, 902 (7th Cir. 2010). Under these principles, \u201c[t]he successor judge should depart from the transferor judge\u2019s decision only \u2018if he has a conviction at once strong and reasonable that the earlier ruling was wrong, and if rescinding it would not cause undue harm to the party that had benefitted from it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>HK Sys., Inc. v. Eaton Corp., 553 </em>F.3d 1086, 1089 (7th Cir.2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-9\">It is clear that Judge Coar was open to revisiting the class certification question under appropriate circumstances. Judge Coar\u2019s holding explicitly depended, in part, on \u201cthe possibility for adjusting the class mechanism in the future,\u201d and Judge Coar repeatedly suggested that \u201caltering or amending the class\u201d was an appropriate means of addressing \u201ccomplications that arise while moving forward.\u201d (Certification Order 16-17.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-12\">As noted by Plaintiffs, however, the issues of law and fact raised by Defendants in their motion to decertify already existed at the time of Judge Coar\u2019s March 2007 order. For example, although Defendants argue that new Seventh Circuit case law \u201cnow demandfs] a more rigorous analysis of the requirements of Rule 23,\u201d (Defs.\u2019 Mem. 8 (citing <em>American Honda Motor Co. v. Allen, </em>600 F.3d 813 (7th Cir.2010))), the Seventh Circuit long ago made clear that district judges must resolve competing expert opinions where relevant to Rule 23 class certification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-13\">A district judge may not duck hard questions by observing that each side has some support, or that considerations relevant to class certification also may affect the decision' on the merits. Tough questions must be faced and squarely decided, if necessary by holding evidentiary hearings and choosing between competing perspectives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-14\"><em>West v. Prudential Securities, Inc., 282 </em>F.3d 935, 938 (7th Cir.2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In fact, Defendants quoted this very passage from West in their briefing before Judge Coar. (Dkt. No. 76 at 10.) Likewise, immediately after Judge Coar\u2019s ruling Defendants alerted Judge Coar to the fact that Plaintiffs had \u201cabandoned\u201d Dr. Asher. (Dkt. No. 537 \u00b6 7.) Judge Coar declined to revisit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>his class certification order at that time. Despite being aware of these potential problems with Judge Coar\u2019s ruling, Defendants did not seek to obtain appellate review under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Having reviewed Judge Coar\u2019s class certification order and the arguments now before this court, the court is not left with a strong conviction that Judge Coar\u2019s approach to the class certification issue in this case was wrong. Despite his stated refusal to \u201cengage in a \u2018battle of the experts,\u2019 \u201d (Certification Order 15), Judge Coar nevertheless resolved the competing expert opinions in this case in favor of Plaintiffs. On the question of whether it is possible to prove a class-wide injury to the sulfuric acid market as a whole, Judge Coar accepted Dr. Asher\u2019s expert opinion in the affirmative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1123-6\">Even if Dr. Stiroh\u2019s interpretation of the sulfuric acid market is correct and each consumer transaction is negotiated according to a unique set of conditions, it is nonetheless possible for the Plaintiffs to establish that the starting point for such negotiations was set artificially high by the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">(Certification Order 15.) Noting that \u201cthe predominant issue remains the conspiracy itself,\u201d Judge Coar concluded that class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) was appropriate in this case. <em>(Id. </em>at 16.) While Judge Coar\u2019s use of the term \u201cthreshold showing\u201d is, perhaps, unfortunate, this court understands Judge Coar to have used this term only to emphasize that Plaintiffs would eventually need to prove to the satisfaction of a jury that \u201call putative class members suffered an injury and that the injury resulted from anti-competitive harms to the market as a whole.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">This court is also convinced that rescinding Judge Coar\u2019s certification order at this stage of the litigation would cause undue harm to Plaintiffs. Defendants have had multiple opportunities before Judge Coar or before the Seventh Circuit to raise the issues they now have advocated to this court. To seek decertification more than four years after Judge Coar\u2019s class certification order with arguments that either were presented, or could have been presented, to Judge Coar prior to March 21, 2007, when he issued that ruling, is unwarranted and inappropriate. The trial in this eight-year-old case is set to begin in just over two months and is poised to be tried as a class action. Reconsideration of Judge Coar\u2019s certification order would undeniably delay the resolution of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims at that trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-10\">To the extent Defendants take issue with Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on Dr. McClave\u2019s expert opinion in support of class certification, the court has not considered Dr. McClave\u2019s opinion in that regard. If Plaintiffs seek to introduce Dr. McClave\u2019s opinion through his testimony at the trial, the court will consider Magistrate Judge Cole\u2019s rulings on the <em>Daubert </em>motions pending before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-11\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-12\">For the reasons set forth above, Defendants\u2019 \u201cMotion to Decertify\u201d (Dkt. No. 641) is denied. All pending dates remain as previously scheduled by this court. (Dkt. Nos. 662, 678.) The parties are strongly encouraged to discuss settlement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">. Judge Coar acknowledged that \"courts have generally refused to let the difficulty of dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>ages determinations stand in the way of class certification.\" (Certification Order 12 (citations omitted).) At the same time, however, Judge Coar recognized \u201cit is nonetheless possible that determining the <em>existence </em>of damage for all members might defy class-wide proof.\u201d (Certification Order 12 (emphasis in original).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1121-12\">. Plaintiffs' designation of Dr. McClave and Dr. Tollison took place on October 28, 2005. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. 7.) On May 22, 2006, Defendants filed <em>Daubert </em>motions challenging the expert opinions of both Dr. McClave and Dr. Tollison. (Defs.\u2019 Mem. at 7; <em>see also </em>Dkt. Nos. 350, 353, 356.)
