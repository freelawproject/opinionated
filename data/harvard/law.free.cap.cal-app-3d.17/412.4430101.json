This section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201cWhen a court of competent jurisdiction makes an order compelling a parent to furnish support or necessary food, clothing, shelter, medical atdendance, or other remedial care for his child, proof that such order was made, filed, and served on the parent or proof that the parent was present in court at the time the order was pronounced <em>and proof of noncompliance therewith shall be prima facie evidence of a contempt of court.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Their first contention is that the statute, creating \u201cprima facie evidence of a contempt of court,\u201d denies to the alleged contemner due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. They argue: \u201cSince it is necessary in order to find an individual to be in contempt of court that it be shown he had the ability to comply with the previous court order and willfully failed to do so, the ultimate effect of section 1209.5 is that the facts of ability to comply and willful failure to comply are presumed from the facts that he had knowledge of the order and did not comply with it. It is the position of petitioners that such a statutory presumption is \u2018irrational\u2019 or \u2018arbitrary\u2019 and hence a denial of due process of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Reliance is placed upon <em>Tot </em>v. <em>United States, </em>319 U.S. 463 [87 L.Ed. 1519, 63 S.Ct. 1241], and <em>Leary </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 6 [23 L.Ed.2d 57, 89 S.Ct. 1532].</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In <em>Tot the </em>United States Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a federal statute (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 902 (f)) which provided that the possession of a firearm or ammunition by any person convicted of a crime of violence shall be presumptive evidence that the firearm or ammunition was shipped or transported by such person in interstate commerce. The court found the statute\u2019s presumption to be unsupported by reason. It was held (pp. 467-468 [87 L.Ed. pp. 1524-1525]), that the controlling test for determining the validity of a statutory presumption was that there be a rational connection between the fact proved and the fact presumed, and \u201cwhere the inference is so strained as not to have a reasonable relation to the circumstances of life as we know them, it is not competent for the Legislature\u201d to create such a rule. (P. 468 [87 L.Ed. p. 1525].)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In <em>Leary </em>the court considered another federal statute (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 176a) which imposed criminal sanctions on one who \u201c \u2018knowingly, with intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>defraud the United States, imports or brings into the United States marijuana contrary to law . . ., or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of such marijuana after being imported or brought in, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law. . . \u201d (395 U.S. at p. 30 [23 L.Ed.2d at p. 78].) The statute further provided: \u201cWhenever on trial for a violation of this subsection, the defendant is shown to have or to have had the marijuana in his possession, such possession shall be deemed sufficient evidence to authorize conviction unless the defendant explains his possession to the satisfaction of the jury.\u201d Constitutional fault was found, the court holding (p. 36 [23 L.Ed.2d p. 82]) that a \u201cstatutory presumption must be regarded as \u2018irrational\u2019 or \u2018arbitrary\u2019 and thus unconstitutional unless it can at least be said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The rule announced by <em>Tot </em>and <em>Leary </em>has long been accepted and applied in California. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>58 Cal.2d 794, 797 [26 Cal.Rptr. 297, 376 P.2d 297], it is said, \u201cThe rule is settled that a presumption of one fact from evidence of another is violative of due process if there is no rational connection between the fact proved and the fact presumed. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Since <em>Tot, Leary </em>and <em>Stevenson </em>unquestionably state the applicable constitutional principles, our immediate task is to determine whether section 1209.5 conforms to the standards there announced. The question before us may accordingly be summarized as follows: May it reasonably be said that the presumed facts of section 1209.5, i.e., petitioners\u2019 ability, and willful failure, to pay support, is more likely than not to flow from the proof, (1) that the court made a support order, thus finding an ability to pay at the time of the order, and (2) that petitioners had knowledge of the order? For the reasons which follow we have concluded that this question must be answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">As indicated, inherent in an order for child support is a determination of a present ability to make the required payments. It seems reasonable to infer that more likely than not such an ability will continue. (Cf., Civ. Code, \u00a7 3547\u2014\u201cA thing continues to exist as long as is usual with things of that nature.\u201d) Furthermore, one ordered to pay such support who for one reason or another finds himself, in whole or in part, unable to do so, is permitted to, and usually does, apply to the court for an appropriate modification of the order. From a finding of ability to pay at the time of the order and the failure to seek its modification, inferences may reasonably be drawn that an ability to meet the ordered payments continues, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>establishing the statute\u2019s \u201cprima facie evidence of a contempt.\u201d We cannot say that these inferences do \u201cnot have a reasonable relation to the circumstances of life as we know them\u201d; the Legislature\u2019s enactment of Code of Civil Procedure section 1209.5 was therefore not proscribed by the rule announced in <em>Tot, Leary </em>and <em>Stevenson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining contention is that section 1209.5 is somehow violative of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">They first point out, correctly, that a contempt proceeding, even though arising in a civil action, is quasi criminal in nature and the respondent therein is to be accorded all of the constitutional and procedural safeguards of any criminal proceeding. (See <em>In re Liu, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 135, 141 [78 Cal.Rptr. 85].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">Petitioners then argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cThe result of Code of Civil Procedure section 1209.5 is to shift the burden of going forward with the evidence to the alleged contemnor when the moving party has established the <em>prima facie </em>evidence required therein. ... In effect this presents an illusory choice to the defendant because if he exercises his right to remain silent and not be sworn as a witness, he will be adjudged in contempt of court without any further evidence being offered by the moving party. All the essential elements of a contempt of court will have been proven by virtue of the presumption allowed by the said code section. As a consequence of the said presumption, the accused contemnor is forced to waive his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination should he wish to have the opportunity to contest the alleged contempt. He must overcome the rebuttable presumption of contempt of court by offering testimony as to his lack of ability to comply with the previous court order and that his failure was not willful. The application of the said statute results in a chilling effect on the constitutionally protected right of petitioners to refrain from offering self-incriminating testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">In support of this contention petitioners first cite <em>In re Allen, </em>71 Cal.2d 388 [78 Cal.Rptr. 207, 455 P.2d 143], There a probation condition requiring a defendant in a criminal case to reimburse the county for court-appointed counsel was found to be invalid; it was held that such a condition was \u201can impediment to the free exercise of\u201d a right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. Their remaining authority is <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>390 U.S. 570 [20 L.Ed.2d 138, 88 S.Ct. 1209], where the United States Supreme Court found to-be unconstitutional a federal statute providing that upon a defendant\u2019s jury waiver, the death penalty could not be imposed. The court there said (p. 582 [20 L.Ed.2d p. 147]): \u201cWhatever might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>said of Congress\u2019 objectives, they cannot be pursued by means that needlessly chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights. . . . [T]he question is whether that effect is unnecessary and therefore excessive. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">We note that neither <em>Allen </em>nor <em>Jackson </em>hold that a statute which might in any conceivable or questionable way touch upon the exercise of a constitutional right is for that reason invalid. Indeed, as indicated, the court in <em>Jackson </em>was careful to point out that it was holding void only such statutes (p. 582 [20 L.Ed.2d p. 147]) \u201cthat <em>needlessly </em>chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights,\u201d and stated that \u201cthe question is whether that effect is <em>unnecessary </em>and therefore excessive.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">It has long been held that when <em>reasonably necessary, </em>or otherwise reasonably required for reasons of policy or convenience, the burden of proof or of going forward with the evidence, in certain circumstances may be placed upon the defendant in a criminal action. Such a burden rests upon the defendant: on a charge of false imprisonment, to establish the defense of lawful arrest <em>(People </em>v. <em>Agnew, </em>16 Cal.2d 655, 663 [107 P.2d 601]); on a charge of bigamy, to prove a good faith marriage <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vogel, </em>46 Cal.2d 798, 803 [299 P.2d 850]); on a charge of forgery, to show authority to sign another\u2019s name <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hassen, </em>144 Cal.App.2d 334, 343 [301 P.2d 80]); to establish the defense of insanity <em>(People </em>v. <em>Glover, </em>257 Cal.App.2d 502, 510, 511 [65 Cal.Rptr. 219]), or entrapment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>44 Cal.2d 371, 372 [282 P.2d 19]), or double jeopardy <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>200 Cal.App.2d 282, 285 [19 Cal.Rptr. 240]); to establish as unlawful an arrest made on a warrant <em>(Badillo </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>46 Cal.2d 269, 272 [294 P.2d 23]); and to prove a valid doctor\u2019s prescript tion, on a charge of possession of narcotics <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bill, </em>140 Cal.App. 389, 392 [35 P.2d 645]). In each of these situations one may possibly find a tendency to \u201cchill the exercise\u201d of Fifth Amendment rights; nevertheless since the \u201cshifting of the burden\u201d is not required \u201cneedlessly\u201d or \u201cunnecessarily,\u201d constitutional fault has never been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">A \u201cFifth Amendment\u201d attack on section 1209.5 appears never to have been previously made or resolved. A similar contention, however, has been repeatedly made on the closely analogous section 270 of the Penal Code. Section 270 relates to a true criminal offense, not a <em>quasi </em>criminal proceeding as embodied in section 1209.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Penal Code section 270 provides that it is a misdemeanor, and under some circumstances a felony, for a father to willfully omit without lawful excuse, to provide for his minor child. The statute then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">\u201cProof of abandonment or desertion of a child by such father, or the omission by such father to furnish necessary food, clothing, shelter or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>medical attendance or other remedial care for his child <em>is prima facie evidence that such abandonment or desertion or omission to furnish necessary food, clothing, shelter or medical attendance or other remedial care is wilful and without lawful excuse.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">In <em>In re Bryant, </em>94 Cal.App. 791, 794 [271 P. 926], the petitioner contended \u201cthat section 270, insofar as it attempts to make proof of abandonment, desertion, or omission, etc. <em>prima facie </em>proof that such omission or abandonment was wilful and without lawful excuse, is in violation of that part of section 13, article I, of the constitution [California\u2019s counterpart of the Fifth Amendment], which states that <em>\u2018no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, </em>or be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\u2019 . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The court disagreed, stating: \u201cSection 270 merely fixes the <em>quantum </em>of evidence which, until overcome, establishes beyond a reasonable doubt the guilt of a defendant charged with a violation of that section; <em>it does not compel a defendant to be a witness against himself.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) This holding of <em>Bryant </em>has been consistently followed by the courts of this state. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>258 Cal.App.2d 705, 708 [66 Cal.Rptr. 99]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>205 Cal.App.2d Supp. 858, 862 [23 Cal.Rptr. 566]; <em>In re Clarke, </em>149 Cal.App.2d 802, 807-808 [309 P.2d 142]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>47 Cal.App.2d 139, 142 [117 P.2d 402]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>42 Cal.App.2d 83, 85 [108 P.2d 51]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Yates, </em>114 Cal.App. 782, 788 [298 P. 961].) The rule is equally applicable to Code of Civil Procedure section 1209.5, here under attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">For the reasons we have stated we hold that Code' of Civil Procedure section 1209.5 does no violence to the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The petition for a peremptory writ of prohibition is denied; the alternative writ is discharged. The \u201cInterim Orderfs] re Contempt\u201d in Martin v. Martin, superior court No. 203840, filed September 11, 1970, and Kerley v. Davis, superior court No. 165314, filed September 21, 1970, are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Molinari, P. J., and Sims, J., concurred. .</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Petitioners\u2019 application for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 7, 1971.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
