J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aug\">This appeal presents a question of first impression in this state. It concerns the effect of adoption out of a testator\u2019s family of a great-grandchild who, except for his adoption, would be included in a description of the class of remaindermen of a testamentary trust. Stated more precisely, the issue is as follows: Where a testamentary trust provides for distribution to a class of remaindermen described as the \u201cchildren or issue surviving\u201d of certain primary beneficiaries with life estates therein, does the class of remaindermen include a child who'was bom after the testator\u2019s death and who was adopted by strangers in blood to the testator before the date of the termination of the tmst, or is such person excluded from said class of remaindermen by virtue of the fact of his adoption out of the family? We have concluded that the adoption results in such exclusion. Accordingly, the order of the trial court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">Testator Harvey A. Russell died on May 19, 1960, leaving a will executed on March 7, 1959. In the course of the administration of his estate the probate court made its decree of preliminary distribution on May 25, 1962 and its decree of final distribution on December 28, 1962. Each of these decrees established a testamentary tmst in the language of paragraph \u201cSixth\u201d of said will. Under its terms the tmst continues during the lifetime of various named \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d and terminates upon the death of the last survivor of the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d at which time the tmst estate is to be paid and distributed to the remaindermen. During the existence of the trust the net income is to be distributed to the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d in monthly or other convenient installments. If any of the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d shall die before the termination of the tmst with \u201cchildren or issue surviving\u201d such net income from his or her share of the trust is to be paid to such children or issue \u201cupon the principle of representation\u201d until the termination of the tmst, and upon the termination of the tmst the persons who are then receiving the income of the tmst shall receive the trust estate in the same prdportions as they are entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>receive such income. Upon the termination of the trust if any of the \u201cprimary beneficiaries\u201d shall have died without \u201cchildren or issue surviving,\u201d his or her share of the trust estate shall be distributed so as to augment proportionately the shares of the trust held for the benefit of the other beneficiaries. Under the provisions of the trust it is specified that the words \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cissue\u201d and \u201cdescendant\u201d as used in the trust shall be construed to include children legally adopted at the time of the testator\u2019s death and shall exclude children legally adopted after the time of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">' On August 27,1963, Carol Ann Camille Spear (hereinafter Carol Spear), one of the named primary beneficiaries, gave birth to a child named Victor. When Victor was approximately five months old he was given up for adoption to the Children\u2019s Home Society and he was subsequently adopted by third persons unrelated in blood to the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Pursuant to Probate Code section 1120,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trustee petitioned the court for instructions as to whether Victor had any interest in the trust after his adoption. The proceeding evolved into a contest between the guardian ad litem for Victor (appellant herein) and the guardian ad litem for the designated minor remaindermen and all unborn remaindermen (respondent herein). At the hearing only one witness, the aforementioned Carol Spear, testified. She was called by appellant and her testimony concerned itself with the fact and date of Victor\u2019s birth, his subsequent adoption, and her identity as a beneficiary of the subject trust. The only other evidence adduced by appellant was a certified copy of the aforementioned decrees of preliminary and final distribution. No evidence was presented or adduced by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The trial court made findings of fact respecting the fact of Victor\u2019s birth and his subsequent adoption, and found that at the time of decedent\u2019s death Victor\u2019s natural mother, Carol Spear, was living and that Victor was yet unborn. The court also found that the estate of decedent had been probated and that a final decree of distribution in said estate had been entered establishing the testamentary trust of decedent according to the terms of which Carol Spear was a beneficiary whose share, upon her death, would go to her children or issue surviving her. Further findings were made as follows: \u201cThe decedent . . . was familiar with the status of adopted persons\u201d; that he \u201cdid not provide for the possibility of class remaindermen being adopted out of his family by third persons,\u201d and that he \u201cintended his will would fit and be compatible with the general body of the law and public policy in effect at the time the will was executed.\u201d From these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>\u201cfindings\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the court concluded that any rights Victor may have had under decedent\u2019s will or trust as a class remainderman were dependent on his surviving Carol Spear as her child or issue; that Victor ceased to have the status of a child or issue of Carol Spear \u201cas the words \u2018children or issue surviving\u2019 are used in the decedent\u2019s trust and the decree of Final Distribution ... on the date of his adoption . . .\u201d; and that Victor \u201cis not a class remainderman under the terms of the decedent\u2019s will or trust . . . Upon the basis of these conclusions the court directed the trustee to exclude Victor and his issue from sharing in the corpus or income of the trust established by the will of decedent. It is from this order that appellant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">The announcement of the trial'court\u2019s decision prior to the making of its findings of fact and conclusions of law was in the form of a memorandum opinion. Such an opinion may not be used to alter or impeach the court\u2019s findings or judgment <em>(DeArmond </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co., </em>253 Cal.App.2d 648, 653 [61 Cal.Rptr. 844]; <em>Magna Development Co. </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>228 Cal.App.2d 230, 235, fn. 2 [39 Cal.Rptr. 284]), but it may be resorted to to ascertain the grounds of its decision <em>(Warren Southwest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wicks, </em>276 Cal.App.2d 152, 155 [80 Cal.Rptr. 723]; <em>Arruda </em>v. <em>Arruda, </em>218 Cal.App.2d 410, 417 [32 Cal.Rptr. 257]), to learn the process by which it reached its decision <em>(Warren Southwest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wicks, supra; Magna Development Co. </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>supra), to ascertain its theory of decision <em>(Warren Southwest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wicks, supra; Estate of Johnson, </em>240 Cal.App. 2d 742, 747 [50 Cal.Rptr. 147]) or to ascertain the basis for a conclusion of law where the conclusion gives no explanation for a ruling <em>(Professional Fire Fighters, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, </em>60 Cal.2d 276, 283 [32 Cal.Rptr. 830, 384 P.2d 158]).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">The memorandum opinion indicates that the trial judge concluded that the testator intended the phrase \u201cchildren or issue surviving\u201d to be governed by the policy expressed in section 257 in effect at the time the will was executed. That section, in pertinent part, provides: \u201cAn adopted child shall be deemed a descendant of one who has adopted him, the same as a natural child, for all purposes of succession by, from or through the adopting parent the same as a natural parent. An adopted child does not succeed to the estate of a natural parent when the relationship between them has been severed by adoption, . . . nor does such adopted child succeed to the estate of a relative of the natural parent, . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The memorandum opinion also discloses that the trial court\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>that the testator was familiar with the status of adopted persons was based on the statement in the will that he had adopted his daughter Camille and she in turn had adopted Carol Spear. The opinion also states that the testator evidenced an intention in his will to accept the spirit of section 257 when he chose to accept Carol Spear as though of the blood, \u201cbut overlooked the possibility of \u2018adopted-out\u2019 children.\u201d The basis for the latter conclusion, states the opinion, is to be found in subdivision \u201cH\u201d of paragraph \u201cSixth\u201d of the will which specifically provides that the words \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cissue,\u201d and \u201cdescendant,\u201d as used therein, should \u201cbe construed to include children legally adopted at the time of my death and shall exclude children legally adopted after the time of my death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Victor contends that since the decree of distribution had become final prior to his adoption the court was precluded, in the absence of any contention of ambiguity, from examining the will to determine the testator\u2019s intentions. He asserts that since there was no issue before the trial court as to whether the subject decrees of distribution were ambiguous, the decrees are conclusive as to the validity and interpretation of the will, including the rights of beneficiaries. The thrust of Victor\u2019s contention is that upon his birth he became a contingent remainderman since at that time he was \u201ca child\u201d or \u201can issue\u201d of Carol Spear under the terms of the trust as spelled out in said decrees. Accordingly, he argues that his subsequent adoption does not defeat his rights as such remainderman. Since both the preliminary and final decree of distribution contain identical language, insofar as the testamentary trust is concerned, we shall hereinafter refer to these decrees collectively as the \u201cdecree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Before proceeding to discuss the validity of these contentions we take cognizance of appellant\u2019s motion to augment the record before us to include a copy of the testator\u2019s will and certain documents in Victor\u2019s adoption proceedings. We reserved our ruling on the motion until we were prepared to decide the case on the merits. For the reasons hereinafter indicated the will is not necessary to our disposition of the case. With respect to the adoption documents, we have concluded that they are not needed to aid us in determining the appeal. There is no question on appeal as to the legality of Victor\u2019s adoption. Such legality and the fact of adoption is conceded by appellant. Moreover, the court below specifically found that Victor was legally adopted. That finding is not challenged. Accordingly, the motion to augment must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Adverting to appellant\u2019s contentions, we first take note of the applicable principles of construction which are well settled. These principles are stated in <em>Estate of Callnon, </em>70 Cal.2d 150, 156-157 [74 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>250, 449 P.2d 186],<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as follows: \u201cA decree of distribution is a judicial construction of the will arrived at by the court ascertaining the intent of the testator. [Citations.]  Once final, the decree supersedes the will [citations] and becomes the conclusive determination of the validity, meaning and effect of the will, the trusts created therein and the rights of all parties thereunder. [Citations.]  ... \u2018where the decree of distribution is contrary to the provisions in the will, the decree controls and prevails over the terms of the will with respect to the distribution of the property.\u2019 [Citations.]  Only if the language of the decree is \u2018uncertain, vague or ambiguous\u2019 [citations] may resort be had to the will to interpret but not to contradict the decree. [Citations.] ... \u2018if the distributive portions of the decree are free from ambiguity, . . . resort may not be had to the provisions of the will . . .\u2019in order to create an ambiguity. [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">In the instant case no contention was made by the parties in the trial court that the decree is uncertain, vague or ambiguous, nor was the will or any extrinsic evidence offered or adduced for the purpose of interpreting the decree. While the matter was under submission the trial court apparently determined that the decree is uncertain and ambiguous since it resorted, in part, to the will in interpreting the decree. The trial court\u2019s resort to the will was apparently done by taking judicial notice of it. The record discloses that, although the entire probate file was physically before the court, only the subject decrees contained in the file were offered or presented into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Court records are matters which <em>may </em>be judicially noticed. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (d); <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Arroyo, </em>56 Cal.2d 492, 496 [15 Cal.Rptr. 87, 364 P.2d 263]; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>271 Cal.App.2d 39, 49 [76 Cal.Rptr. 350].) Such records may be judicially noticed if a party requests that such notice be taken, furnishes the court with sufficient information to enable it to take judicial notice, and gives each adverse party sufficient notice of the request to prepare to meet it. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 453; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hatch, supra.) </em>Here no such request was made. The court may, however, take judicial notice of such court records, even when not requested to do so, because it has the discretionary power to take such notice under section 452 of the Evidence Code. (See comment to Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, 453.) However, where the matter to be noticed is one that is of <em>substantial consequence to the action, </em>the party adversely affected must be given a reasonable opportunity, before the jury is instructed or before the cause is submitted for decision by the court, to present information relevant to the propriety of taking judicial notice and as to tenor of the matter to be noticed. (Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>Code, \u00a7 455, subd. (a); see comment to Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 453, 455.) \u201cIf the judge does not discover that a matter should be judicially noticed until after the cause is submitted for decision, he may, of course, order the cause to be reopened for the purpose of permitting the parties to provide him with information concerning the matter.\u201d (Comment, Evid. Code, \u00a7 455.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In the present case there can be no question that decedent\u2019s will was of substantial consequence to the action. The record discloses, however, that the court took judicial notice of the will without a request to do so by any party and that it did not afford appellant, as the party adversely affected, an opportunity to- present information as to the propriety of taking judicial notice either before the cause was submitted for decision or upon a reopening of the case for such purpose. Accordingly, the trial court was not entitled to take judicial notice of decedent\u2019s will insofar as that document contained matters not included in the decree. In this connection we again note that paragraph \u201cSixth\u201d of the will was repeated and incorporated verbatim in its entirety in the decree. All the provisions of paragraph \u201cSixth\u201d of the will were, therefore, properly before the trial judge for consideration and interpretation, including subdivision \u201cH\u201d aforementioned. Under these circumstances, the only matter improperly considered by the trial court, because it was outside the record, is the provision in the will, deemed relevant by the trial court on the issue of the testator\u2019s intent, which indicates the testator\u2019s familiarity with adopted persons,. i.e., that provision alluded to by the court in its memorandum opinion indicating that he had adopted his daughter Camille and she had adopted her daughter Carol Spear.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Without the aid of extrinsic evidence the subject decree must be interpreted upon an independent examination of its terms notwithstanding that such terms may be uncertain, vague or ambiguous, since it is solely a judicial function to interpret a written instrument where the interpretation does not turn upon the credibility or aid of extrinsic evidence. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co., </em>62 Cal.2d 861, 865 [44 Cal.Rptr. 767, 402 P.2d 839]; <em>Estate of Russell, </em>69 Cal.2d 200, 213 [70 Cal.Rptr. 561, 444 P.2d 353].) In making this interpretation we are not bound by the construction of the instrument made by the trial court. <em>(Parsons </em>v. <em>Bristol Development Co., supra; Estate of Russell, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Adverting to the testamentary trust provided for in the decree, we apprehend that we are particularly called upon to interpret the meaning of the phrase \u201cchildren or issue surviving\u201d as this phrase is used with respect to the remaindermen who, in the event of the death of a primary beneficiary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>are to receive the share of such beneficiary upon the termination of the trust or the income from said share prior to such termination. In proceeding to construe the meaning of this phrase in the context of the provisions in which it is used, we first observe that when Victor was adopted his relationship to his natural mother was severed and a new relation was created between Victor and the adopting parents. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 228 and 229; <em>Matter of Cozza, </em>163 Cal. 514, 523-524 (126 P. 161) [overruled on other grounds, <em>Adoption of Barnett, </em>54 Cal.2d 370, 378 (6 Cal.Rptr. 562, 354 P.2d 18)].) By virtue of such adoption Carol Spear was relieved, from the time of the adoption, of all parental duties toward, and all responsibility for, Victor, and she had no right over him. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 229; <em>In re Darling, </em>173 Cal. 221, 223-224 [159 P. 606]; <em>Estate of Goulart, </em>222 Cal.App.2d 808, 820 [35 Cal.Rptr. 465].) In sum Carol Spear, from the time of the adoption, was no longer Victor\u2019s parent in the eyes of the law. <em>(Estate of Goulart, supra; In re Darling, supra, </em>at p. 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In <em>Estate of Heard, </em>49 Cal.2d 514 [319 P.2d 637], the Supreme Court was presented with the question whether the phrase \u201clawful issue\u201d used in a will included a child adopted by the testator\u2019s son after the will was made and the testatrix was deceased. In holding that the testamentary disposition of the residue of the trust to the \u201clawful issue\u201d of her son included an adopted child, the reviewing court applied the rule that \u201cCourts ... by necessity, draw on the statutes, case law and public policy in construing an instrument as they must suppose that the draftsman did not intend to pursue a course contrary to them unless he so states.\u201d (At p. 522.) In taking cognizance of this principle the Supreme Court observed that a testator is bound to know existing statutes affecting testamentary dispositions and that, unless a contrary intent is expressed, a testator intends that his will would be compatible with the general body of the law and public policy. \u201cWe cannot suppose,\u201d said the court, \u201cthat wills are made in a vacuum; that the status of an adopted child being the same as a biological offspring, which is the public policy of the state, may be completely ignored, or that it was ignored by a testator when making a will any more than he may be said to ignore many other rules of law and public policy.\u201d (At p. 522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The public policy alluded to in <em>Heard </em>is that which recognizes that adopted children are lineal descendants of their foster parent and are in the line of descent from him by virtue of statutory command, the same as if that line had been established by blood ties. (49 Cal.2d at p. 518.) In this state such policy has been expressed by the Legislature as embodied in the adoption statutes (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 221, 227, 228) and in the succes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>sion statute providing for the inheritance rights of adopted children (\u00a7 257). (See <em>Estate of Heard, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d 514, at pp. 519-522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">The situation presented in the instant case is the converse of that involved in <em>Heard. </em>However, the principles therein expressed are equally applicable here. We note, initially, that the decree constitutes a judicial construction of decedent\u2019s will arrived at by the probate court ascertaining the intent of the testator. <em>(Estate of Callnon, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 150, 157 [74 Cal.Rptr. 250, 449 P.2d 186]; <em>Whittingham </em>v. <em>California Trust Co., </em>214 Cal. 128, 132 [4 P.2d 142].) As already observed, the court, in judicially construing the testator\u2019s will in order to ascertain his intent, adopted verbatim the language and terminology used by the testator himself in paragraph \u201cSixth\u201d of the will. The decree does not express an intent contrary to the statutes, case law or the public policy with respect to the inheritance rights of adopted children. We are entitled to assume, therefore, that the court ascertained that the testator did not intend to pursue a course contrary to that expressed in the statutes, case law and public law with regard to the inheritance rights of adopted children, but, rather, that he intended his will to be compatible with such law and public policy. By the same token we are also entitled to assume that the court itself was aware of such law and public policy when it made its decree of distribution. Under that law and public policy, an adopted child, upon the severing of the relationship between him and his natural parent, succeeds to or inherits the estate of one who has adopted him and not the estate of his natural parent or a relative of the natural parent. (\u00a7 257; see <em>Estate of Garey, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 39, 41-42 [29 Cal.Rptr. 98]; <em>Estate of Goulart, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.2d 808, 820-823.)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">We perceive further that in the decree the court ascertained that the testator intended his will to be compatible with the law and public policy here under discussion. The decree specifically provides that the words \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cissue,\" and \u201cdescendant\u201d as used in the testamentary trust provisions include within their meaning children legally adopted at the time of the testator\u2019s death but do not include within such meaning children legally adopted after his death. The phrase excluding children adopted after the testator\u2019s death is susceptible of the construction that it includes children adopted into the family as well as those adopted out of it. If we construe this phrase to mean that it has reference only to children legally adopted into the family, the decree is left in the posture where the probate court has judicially construed that the testator in his will has not said anything about children who would be adopted out of the family after his d\u00e9ath. Such construction leaves us without any basis other than the rule declared in <em>Heard </em>in interpreting the decree with respect to the inheritance rights of children adopted out of the family. The decree is, therefore, interpreted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>to mean that the testator did not intend to include within the meaning of the words \u201cchildren or issue surviving\u201d children who would be adopted out of the family. Under such interpretation Victor, at the moment of his adoption, by operation of law, ceased to be and was no longer the child or issue of Carol Spear. Upon Carol Spear\u2019s death Victor will not be deemed, by the laws of this state to be her \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cissue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Appellant argues that section 257 is limited in its application solely to the rights of an adopted child as to his inheritance by succession and that it has no application to the rights of an adopted child where his interests are derived from a testamentary disposition as in the instant case. This contention is without merit.  Although \u201csuccession\u201d is defined in section 200 as \u201cthe acquisition of title to the property of one who dies without disposing of it by will,\u201d it frequently possesses the somewhat broader meaning of \u201cthe acquisition of rights upon the death of another.\u201d <em>(Chambers </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>186 Cal. 261, 266 [199 P. 33].) Accordingly, the decisions have interpreted the term \u201csuccession\u201d as it is used in section 257 since its amendment in 1955<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as having the broader meaning. Accordingly, the provisions of section 257 have been applied to situations where the question was whether an adopted child was an heir of the decedent under a testamentary disposition and as such entitled to succeed to the decedent\u2019s estate. <em>(See Estate of Heard, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d 514, 516-517 [testamentary trust]; <em>Estate of Garey, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 39, 40 [will]; <em>Estate of Goulart, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.2d 808, 811, 819 [will].) In <em>Goulart, </em>the court, in concluding that section 257, as amended in 1955, applies to testamentary dispositions as well as to rights of succession (at pp. 822-823) observed that the enactment of the amended statute intended \u201cto accomplish a complete severance of the former relationship of the adoptee with his natural, or biological, relatives, and to make them no longer \u2018kindred\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>in the eyes of the law, and on the other hand, to create a new kinship.\u201d (At p. 820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The motion to augment the record is denied.
