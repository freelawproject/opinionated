After plaintiff\u2019s opening statement the court granted defendants\u2019 motion for a nonsuit. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">There having been no objection raised to the statement of facts as set forth in defendants\u2019 brief, we adopt the same as the true statement of facts herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Plaintiff was arrested, made a ward of the juvenile court, and placed on probation for grand theft auto in San Diego in 1939. As indicated by a 1951 letter from a Merced Police Department inspector, Robert L. Kellerer, in 1941 plaintiff had been identified from a photograph as the person who had passed a forged check at a Merced chain store. The photograph of plaintiff was obtained by Merced from the San Diego Police Department bearing its identification number 12356.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">At some time after August 4, 1941, a notation was added to plaintiff\u2019s record at the Bureau, which stated as follows: \u201c8-4-41. Merced P.D. Eugene White, wanted;'fictitious checks. \u2018Rep. 285.\u2019 Subject is in El Reno, Oklahoma. Due to small amount involved, D.A. will not extradite. Still wanted if apprehended in California. L.E.T. 8-15-41.\u201d In addition, the following aliases were added to plaintiff\u2019s record: \u201cEnos White,\u201d \u201cNorman Railton,\u201d. \u201cVictor Kemp,\u201d and \u201cJ. B. Cabral.\u201d Presumably, these were the names used on the fictitious checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">In 1951, as a result of plaintiff\u2019s application to the National City Police Department for a police officer\u2019s position, the Bureau notified the Merced Police Department that plaintiff was in National City. Inspector Kellerer of the Merced Police Department replied as follows: \u201cReference is made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>to your letter of September 1951 relative to Eugene White who was wanted by this department for passing of fictitious checks in 1941. Upon review of this file, I find that suspect had been identified from a photograph as the person who had passed a forged check at one of the local chain stores. However, no complaint was apparently filed against him as he was known to have left the state. As a result, due to the statute of limitations, this department has no further hold on this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u201cA copy of the photograph of Gene Arthur White, San Diego P.D. 12356, is enclosed herewith for your files. A copy of this letter, as well as photograph, is being forwarded to Chief of Police, National City. Thank you for your information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In 1962, in connection with the employment of plaintiff by the Clovis Police Department, the Clovis police chief, Thomas Higgason, after having received the arrest record of plaintiff from the Bureau, wrote the Bureau as follows: \u201cDear Sir: The subject enclosed states alias names are false. Would you check once again and send the information to us as soon as possible. CII 629212. Eugene Arthur White. Thank you for your attention. Very truly yours, Chief of Police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The Bureau replied as follows: \u201cOctober 9, 1962. Dear Chief: This Bureau has received your recent inquiry concerning Eugene Arthur White, CI&amp;I 629212. Attached is a photostat of a fingerprint card of the subject, showing alias names as reported to this Bureau. If we may be of any further assistance in this matter, please do not hesitate to communicate with us. Yours very truly . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">In 1967, plaintiff went to the Bureau seeking to examine his record as he believed it contained erroneous information. He was shown his file, and he denied that the record was his. He was advised by the Bureau that if information in the file was incorrect he should have the agency which submitted the information so advise the Bureau; that the information would not be deleted solely on his claim that it was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">In 1967, at plaintiff\u2019s request for assistance, the Governor and others advised plaintiff to go to the Bureau to have the matter looked into, and Assemblyman Zenovich\u2019s office inquired into what the record contained in an attempt to assist plaintiff in his claim that the record was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Before turning to the merits of this appeal, we note the following code provisions relating to the duties and responsibilities of the Bureau:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">\u201cThe Attorney General shall exercise absolute control and management of the bureau.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11005.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>\u201cThe Attorney General shall procure from any available source, and file for record and report in the office of the bureau, all plates, photos, outline pictures, descriptions, information and measurements of all persons convicted of a felony, or imprisoned for violating any of the military, naval, or criminal laws of the United States of America, and of all well-known and habitual criminals.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">' \u201cThe Attorney General shall file all plates, photographs, outline pictures, measurements, information and descriptions received and shall make a complete and systematic record and index, providing a method of convenience, consultation and comparison.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11104.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u201c(a) The Attorney General shall furnish, upon application in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section, copies of all information pertaining to the identification of any person, such as a plate, photograph, outline picture, description, measurement, or any data about such person of which there is a record in the office of the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u201c(b) Such information shall be furnished to all peace officers, district attorneys, probation officers, and courts of the state, to United States officers or officers of other1 states, territories, or possessions of the United States, or peace officers of other countries duly authorized by the Attorney General to receive the same, and to any public defender or attorney representing such person in proceedings upon a petition for certificate of rehabilitation and pardon pursuant to Section 4852.08, upon application in writing accompanied by a certificate signed by the peace officer, public defender, or attorney, stating that the information applied for is. necessary for the due administration of the laws, and not for the purpose of assisting a private citizen in carrying on his personal interest or in maliciously or uselessly harassing, degrading or humiliating any person.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u201c(c) Such information shall not be furnished to any persons other than those listed in subdivision (b) of this section or as provided by law; provided, that such information may be furnished to any state agency, officer, or official when needed for the performance of such agency\u2019s, officer\u2019s or official\u2019s functions.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">In this appeal from a judgment of nonsuit pursuant to section 581c of the Code of Civil Procedure, special rules are applicable;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u201cAt the outset we note that the judgment of nonsuit operated as an adjudication upon the merits. [Citations.]  Although the judgment of nonsuit is an adjudication upon the merits it is not treated on appeal like most appeals when it is the duty of the appellate court to indulge every reasonable intendment in favor of sustaining the trial court. The appro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>priate rule which the reviewing court\u2018must follow is that the court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellant, must disregard all inconsistencies and draw only inferences from the evidence which can reasonably be drawn which are favorable to the appellant. [Citations.]  It is only when the result is a determination that there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a verdict in favor of the plaintiff that the granting of a motion for nonsuit is warranted. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Van Zyl </em>v. <em>Spiegelberg </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 367, 371-373 [82 Cal.Rptr. 689].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">As previously noted, the Bureau is required by law to receive and file information, fingerprints, photographs, crime reports, and other data submitted by law enforcement agencies, and to furnish, upon application, such information to authorized persons. (In general, see art. 3 (commencing with \u00a7 11100), ch. 1, pt. 4, tit. I, Pen. Code.)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In his complaint plaintiff makes a two-pronged attack. He first alleges that he was damaged by defendants\u2019 libelous utterances<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, secondly, that he was damaged through defendants\u2019 negligence and carelessness. With this background in mind, we turn to his contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred when it held that the publication was absolutely privileged. In this connection, subdivision 1 of section 47 of the Civil Code provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201cA privileged publication or broadcast is one made\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\u201c1. In the proper discharge of an official duty.\u201d He contends the word \u201cproper\u201d is consistent with a qualified privilege <em>(Saroyan </em>v. <em>Burkett </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 706, 708-709 [21 Cal.Rptr. 557, 371 P.2d 293]), and that it means \u201cfree of negligence,\u201d and was therefore a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">In <em>Saroyan, </em>the court examined the history behind subdivision 1 of section 47,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ruled that the Superintendent of Banks was a state official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>corresponding in rank to federal cabinet officers, and thus press releases issued by him were absolutely privileged. Plaintiff contends that the individual defendants did not have a rank corresponding to federal cabinet officers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">On the other hand, defendants submit that the <em>Saroyan </em>decision did not limit the applicability of the subdivision to state officers of the rank of federal cabinet members. They argue that public officials who are under a mandatory duty to publish information filed with them are entitled to an absolute privilege since they are pubhshing information in the \u201cproper discharge of an official duty.\u201d (Cf. <em>Hale Company </em>v. <em>Lea </em>(1923) 191 Cal. 202, 205-207 [215 P. 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">No California case has been cited, and we have found none, which is precisely in point. There is a conflict in the decisions of other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u201cThe common law immunity of absolute privilege is also allowed to the principal executive officers in the nation and states. A similar rule is applied in England. The policy involved here is the same as that involved in other cases of absolute privilege. In order to insure efficient government, policy-forming officials must be free to exercise their best judgment in the performance of their duties. The chief problem is the determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>the officials who should receive the complete immunity. It is clear that the President of the United States and the governors of the various states and territories come within the rule, as do the members of the President\u2019s cabinet and heads of agencies and comparable state officers. As to officials below this rank, the cases are in conflict, some courts applying the rule of absolute privilege, others the more limited protection of qualified privilege in which protection is dependent on the honesty and reasonableness of the official\u2019s conduct.\u201d (1 Harper and James, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 5.23, p. 429; see also Note, 26 A.L.R.3d 492.)</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The defendants\u2019 position is an appealing one, especially in view of the statutory scheme which requires the Bureau to collect and disseminate information relating to crime. However, there is no indication in <em>Saroyan </em>that absolute privilege is to be extended to executives of lesser rank. We therefore hold that the trial court erred in granting nonsuit on the basis that defendants\u2019 publications were absolutely privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Plaintiff also contends that the trial court erred when it found this publication to be conditionally privileged. This contention has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Civil Code section 47, defining privileged communications, also includes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-7\">\u201c3. In a communication, <em>without malice, </em>to a person interested therein, (1) by one who is also interested, or (2) by one who stands in such relation to the person interested as to afford a reasonable ground for supposing the motive for the communication innocent, or (3) who is requested by the person interested to give the information.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">This subdivision sets forth a qualified privilege. <em>(Kapellas </em>v. <em>Kofman </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 20, 28 [81 Cal.Rptr. 360, 459 P.2d 912].) The dissemination of information furnished by the Bureau at an authorized recipient\u2019s request falls within this statute. This privilege, however, is termed \u201cqualified\u201d or \u201cconditional\u201d because it applies only to a communication made \u201cwithout malice.\u201d <em>(Roemer </em>v. <em>Retail Credit Co. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 368, 370-371 [83 Cal.Rptr. 540].) The term \u201cmalice\u201d is discussed in <em>McCunn v. California Teachers Assn. </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 956, 962 [83 Cal.Rptr. 846]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">\u201cThe California Civil Code defines \u2018actual malice\u2019 as \u2018that state of mind arising from hatred or ill will toward the plaintiff; . . .\u2019 (Civ. Code, \u00a7 48a, subd. (4) par. (d).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">\u201cVarious definitions have also been announced by the California courts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>among them: \u2018[Malice is] a desire' or disposition to injure another founded upon spite or ill will. [While the] absence of malice is the absence of enmity.\u2019 <em>(Siemon </em>v. <em>Finkle, </em>190 Cal. 611, 618 [213 P. 954].) \u2018[The privilege] is lost if the publication is motivated by hatred or ill will . . . [citations], or by any cause other than the desire to protect the interest for the protection of which the privilege is given. . . . [It] is lost if [the publisher] has no reasonable grounds for believing his statements to be true.\u2019 <em>(Brewer </em>v. <em>Second Baptist Church, </em>32 Cal.2d 791, 797 [197 P.2d 713].) Actual malice or malice in fact, is a state of mind arising from hatred or ill will, evidencing a willingness to vex, annoy, or injure another person. <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Hearst, </em>160 Cal. 143, 157 [116 P. 530].) \u2018 \u201cActual malice, . . . means personal hatred or ill will towards the plaintiff, or wanton disregard of the civil obligations of the defendants toward the plaintiff.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Hearne </em>v. <em>DeYoung, </em>132 Cal. 357, 361-362 [64 P. 576].) Malice may also be implied if the defamatory remarks, although honestly believed to be true, are \u2018exaggerated, overdrawn, or colored to the detriment of plaintiff, or are not stated fully and fairly with respect to the plaintiff, . . .\u2019 <em>(Snively </em>v. <em>Record Publishing Co., </em>185 Cal. 565, 578 [198 P. 1].)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">In <em>Roemer </em>v. <em>Retail Credit Co., supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d at page 371, the court states: \u201c \u2018[0]rdinarily the privilege is lost if defendant has no reasonable grounds for believing his statements to be true\u2019 <em>(Brewer </em>v. <em>Second Baptist Church, </em>32 Cal.2d 791, 797 [197 P.2d 713]). But this is not to say that mere negligence in making \u2018a <em>sufficient </em>inquiry into the facts on which the statement was based\u2019 does, of itself, relinquish the privilege. \u2018Mere inadvertence or forgetfulness, or careless blundering, is no evidence of malice.\u2019 <em>(Davis </em>v. <em>Hearst, </em>160 Cal. 143, 167 [116 P. 530].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We note the holding in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hatch </em>(1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 39, 47-48 [76 Cal.Rptr. 350]: \u201cSince the qualified privilege creates a presumption that the communication is made innocently and without malice <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Express Publishing Co., </em>87 Cal.App. 246, 256 [262 P. 78]; <em>Lesperance </em>v. <em>North American Aviation, Inc., </em>217 Cal.App.2d 336, 341 [31 Cal.Rptr. 873]), the pleadings must contain affirmative allegations of malice in fact, and malice must exist as a fact in order to destroy the privilege. <em>(Lesperance </em>v. <em>North American Aviation, Inc., supra; Locke </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>7 Cal.2d 599, 602 [61 P.2d 922]; <em>Larrick </em>v. <em>Gilloon, </em>176 Cal.App.2d 408, 416 [1 Cal.Rptr. 360]; <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Wadler, supra.) </em>Such facts must establish that the person speaking the defamatory words entertained toward the person defamed a feeling of hatred or ill will going beyond that which the occasion for the communication apparently justified and different from that motive which prima facie rendered the communication privileged. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">With these principles in mind, we find nothing in the complaint or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>opening statement to support plaintiff\u2019s argument. There is no showing of malice on the part of the Bureau or its employees. It is true that the Bureau was advised by unsubstantiated statements that the information in plaintiff\u2019s record was false. However, the Bureau was under no duty to change or alter its records on the basis of the unsubstantiated word of the concerned individual. This is not a case where defendants had no reasonable grounds for believing their statements to be true. The information came from a law enforcement agency, and the Bureau was under a statutory duty to record and disseminate such information to authorized persons. Thus, we hold that the Bureau\u2019s dissemination of information was conditionally privileged. (See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hatch, supra, </em>271 Cal.App.2d at p. 48.) In this connection it must be remembered that plaintiff made no effort to have the contributing agency rectify the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Plaintiff alleges a \u201cconspiracy of silence.\u201d A charge of \u201cconspiracy\u201d is easily conjured up. Plaintiff fails, however, to show how he could prove such a conspiracy. In fact, plaintiff was allowed access to his records, but for some reason failed to try and correct the mistake, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Plaintiff further contends that the trial court erred in holding that no tort was demonstrated. The trial judge found, inter alia, that the claims of defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy were fatally defective since the necessary culpability was lacking. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The trial court found, and we so hold, that the publication of such material was conditionally privileged. There is no showing whatsoever of malice on the part of the Bureau\u2019s employees, and thus no abuse of the. privilege. We hold that the trial court properly granted a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Janes, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\">\u201cLibel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation to the eye, which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes him to be shunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 45.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b520-11\">\u201cSection 47 was enacted in 1872, and subdivision 1 has remained the same since that time. The annotation to section 47 made by the Code Commission in 1872 is significant. In a preface to the annotated edition of the Civil Code, it was said that the purpose of the notes to the various sections was to explain the \u2018reason\u2019 and \u2018intent\u2019 of the law and that, wherever there was an intent to modify existing law, the reasons for the change would be given. With respect to section 47, the annotation consists solely of the citation of a textbook and three New York cases, and according to these authorities an absolute privilege was confined to statements made in the course of judicial or legislative proceedings. The cases that contain language to the effect that the privilege conferred by subdivision 1 is an absolute one, e.g., <em>Hale Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>v. <em>Lea, </em>191 Cal. 202, 205 [215 P. 900]; <em>Snively </em>v. <em>Record Publishing Co., </em>185 Cal. 565, 577 [198 P. 1]; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Newby, </em>102 Cal.App. 110, 115 [282 P. 810, 283 P. 370], did not consider the background of the subdivision or the meaning to be given to the word \u2018proper\u2019 therein, and the only case involving an executive official, <em>Hale Co. </em>v. <em>Lea, supra, </em>held that the official was not privileged because he was acting outside the scope of his authority.</p>\n<p id=\"AJK\">\u201cIt thus appears that the problem of the extent, if any, to which executive officials have an absolute privilege cannot be satisfactorily resolved on the basis of the statutory language, the historical background of the subdivision or the California cases cited above, and a solution must be found by considering the treatment of the subject in the law generally. This approach is particularly appropriate in regard to the statute before us because it was evidently intended as a codification of the general principles developed by the courts. 66</p>\n<p id=\"ADS\">\u201cThe rule as it has developed with respect to both federal and state officials of high rank is set forth in section 591 of the Restatement of Torts, which reads: \u2018The President of the United States and the Governor of any State or Territory thereof, cabinet officers of the United States and the corresponding officers of any State or Territory thereof are absolutely privileged to publish\" false and defamatory matter of another in the exercise of an executive function, if the matter has some relation to the executive proceeding in which the officer is acting.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A9G\">\u201cWe are in accord with the rule granting an absolute privilege to state officials corresponding in rank to federal cabinet members.\u201d <em>(Saroyan </em>v. <em>Burkett, supra, </em>57 Cal.2d at pp. 709-710.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b521-13\">Although the Attorney General is required to exercise absolute control and management of the Bureau (Pen.

The issue is whether government officials in charge of files reflecting the personal histories of private persons are immune from damage liability created by their dissemination of false, defamatory information in their files after its falsity has been brought to their attention by an affected person. In my opinion, they are not immune.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">This is a damage action, not one for injunctive relief. The defendants are the State of California and A. L. Coffey, Chief of the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation. The Bureau is a component of the Department of Justice, which is under the directorship of the State Attorney Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>eral. I concur in that portion of the decision affirming the nonsuit won by Mr. Coffey, but believe that the nonsuit won by the State of California should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Our nation\u2019s current social developments harbor insidious evolutionary forces which propel us toward a collective, Orwellian society. One of the features of that society is the utter destruction of privacy, the individual\u2019s complete exposure to the all-seeing, all-powerful police state. Government agencies, civilian and military, federal, state and local, have acquired miles and acres of files, enclosing revelations of the personal affairs and conditions of millions of private individuals. Credit agencies and other business, enterprises assemble similar collections. Information peddlers burrow into the crannies of these collections. Microfilm and electronic tape facilitate the storage of private facts on an enormous scale. Computers permit automated retrieval, assemblage and dissemination. These vast repositories of personal information may easily be assembled into millions of dossiers characteristic of a police state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Our age is one of shriveled privacy. Leaky statutes imperfectly guard a small portion of these monumental revelations. Appellate courts should think twice, should locate a balance between public need and private rights, before deciding that custodians of sensitive personal files may with impunity refuse to investigate claims of mistaken identity or other error which threaten the subject with undeserved loss. The office of judges is to strike that balance rather than pursue sentiments of indignation or sympathy. It is obvious, nevertheless, that an unwarranted record of conviction, even of arrest, may ruin an individual\u2019s reputation, his livelihood, even his life.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The criminal histories stored by the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation are collected under statutory authority, primarily (but not entirely) for the socially important objective of crime control. No reasonable citizen would quarrel with the collection\u2019s primary objective. A statute restricts dissemination of these histories primarily (but not entirely) to those needing them for law enforcement. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 11105.) No statute fixes the duties of its custodians when they become aware of error. or falsity threatening an innocent citizen with infamy.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The criminal histories in the Bureau, one surmises, are collections of \u201craw\u201d fact, received from many sources and recorded without evaluation. No doubt inaccuracy, error and even outright falsity infiltrate the files. There will be little disagreement with the proposition that Bureau personnel are not obligated to investigate error or falsity until error or falsity is claimed. Penal Code section 11005 declares that the Attorney General shall exercise \u201cabsolute control and management\u201d over the Bureau. This statute does not permit one to view the Bureau as an automaton, passively preserving all data transmitted to it and helplessly disseminating all information requested of it. Section 11005 supplies the Attorney General and his subordinates within the Bureau ample power to conduct a reasonable investigation into a criminal history which unjustly maligns an innocent citizen and to correct inaccuracies in the Bureau\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">At this point the majority opinion states that \u201cthe Bureau was under no duty to change or alter its records on the basis of the unsubstantiated word of the concerned individual.\u201d In my view the quoted statement is an incorrect assumption of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s central allegations are these: In 1939 he had been involved in a youthful scrape of the \u201cjoy-riding\u201d variety. As a result, a record was established in the Sacramento files of the Bureau showing that a juvenile court had placed him on probation for \u201cgrand theft, auto.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1941, a local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>police department caused a check forgery charge to be entered on his record at the Bureau. Included were notations of five separate aliases used by the forger and of his whereabouts at El Reno (the location and designation of an Oklahoma state prison). The entry was the result of mistaken identity, for plaintiff was not the forger. During the following years the erroneous forgery entry on his record at the Bureau caused rejection of applications for employment as a policeman and the actual loss of one police job. Eventually he discovered the cause of these rejections and in 1967 went to the Bureau, charging that his record was erroneous and requesting correction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He was advised to take the matter up with the local police department which had furnished the information 26 years earlier. His effort to enlist the help of state officials proved fruitless and he brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">Propriety of the nonsuit turns on the adequacy of plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s opening statement to the jury. The public tort liability law provides the state approximately the same liabilities and immunities as its employees. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 815.2.) Thus the state will be liable if its participating employees are liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Let us get our conceptual bearings. This action simultaneously bears the earmarks of a suit for libel and one for invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each of these theories of action postulates results which vary with the character' of the defendant\u2019s communication, that is, whether it was innocent, malicious in fact, reckless or negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>For the purpose of a libel action, communications of the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation are conditionally privileged, even if erroneous or inaccurate; malice alone would cause loss of the privilege.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2018While mere negligence does not amount to malice, the latter appears when the statement was made with willful disregard for accuracy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Were libel plaintiff\u2019s sole theory of recovery, it would be necessary that he satisfy the jury that the Bureau acted with willful disregard of the harm emanating from an untrue report of crime. (See <em>A.B.C. Needlecraft Co. </em>v. <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc., supra'.) </em>Its unrealistic advice that plaintiff solicit the benevolence of the local police department which, a quarter-century earlier, had originated the error, was a bland cloak for official indifference, shunting the citizen in Kafkaesque fashion from agency to agency. Willful disregard lay not so much in the Bureau\u2019s communications of the record a\u00a7 in its willful immobility when the victim sought correction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Alternatively, the lawsuit is one for invasion of privacy. California law recognizes the actionable character of disclosures which unjustifiably expose the plaintiff\u2019s personal affairs to public view. When the disclosure is false or puts the plaintiff in a.false light, his lawsuit may move from the traditional defamation category and seek its legal underpinnings in the privacy cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although lack of malice is not a defense in a privacy invasion suit, somewhat parallel defenses are available, for example, the public interest in the disclosure or defendant\u2019s furtherance of its own legitimate functions. (See <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1967) 385 U.S. 374, 383-390 [17 L.Ed.2d 456, 464-468, 87 S.Ct. 534]; <em>Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, supra; Werner </em>v. <em>Times-Mirror Co., supra; </em>1 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>(1960) Torts, \u00a7 136; Prosser on Torts (3d ed.) p. 851.) In a general way, all these defenses involve judicial balance between the plaintiff\u2019s right to be \u201clet alone\u201d and the public interest in the disclosure. The point here is that the disclosure\u2019s truth, falsity or reckless disregard of truth profoundly alters the array of interests on each side of the lawsuit. (See, e.g., <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Crucial at this point is plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation continued to circulate his history after he claimed its falsity and requested correction. Statutory policy and overriding public interest had originally called upon the Bureau to disseminate defendant\u2019s record to authorized agencies. <em>(Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, </em>quote <em>ante, </em>fn. 2.) That interest suffered a profound alteration when plaintiff in 1967 brought the error of identity to the Bureau\u2019s attention. A minimal inquiry might have sufficed to reveal the error. The public interest in the circulation of criminal histories among enforcement agencies emphatically did not call for a <em>false </em>history. In counterbalance, plaintiff\u2019s private interest\u2014his interest to be free of damaging, unwarranted intrusions\u2014emphatically cried out for suppression of the false report.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In his opening statement to the jury, plaintiff\u2019s attorney described how his client had lost or been denied employment prior to 1967. The attorney went farther. He told the jury: \u201cIf that record is being published now, and we understand it has been published since 1967 at least eight or ten times, and it still has an alias on there, then those publications have been made in spite of the fact that CI&amp;I knew there was no alias supposed to be on that record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The attorney\u2019s declarations are ambiguous. They do not state specifically that the Bureau continued to give out the damaging information after 1967. In reviewing the nonsuit, we must accept these declarations in the light most favorable to plaintiff and draw all reasonably available favorable inferences. <em>(Van Zyl </em>v. <em>Spiegelberg </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 367, 372 [82 Cal. Rptr. 689].) Viewing the attorney\u2019s opening statement in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we must infer an allegation that the Bureau continued to give out the damaging information after its falsity had been brought to its attention. That allegation, in my view, sufficed to state a cognizable claim against the State of California, proof of which would justify an award of resultant damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Since plaintiff\u2019s suit against the State requires him to establish the liability of its employees, Government Code section 820.2 requires consideration. That section immunizes public employees from liability for injuries resulting from the exercise of discretion. In the sense, intended by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>820.2, discretionary activity is that involved in basic policy decisions, sometimes characterized as the \u201cplanning\u201d as opposed to the \u201coperational\u201d level of decision-making. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 782, 793-794 [73 Cal.Rptr. 240, 447 P.2d 352]; <em>Ramos </em>v. <em>County of Madera, 4 </em>Cal.3d 685 [94 Cal.Rptr. 421, 484 P.2d 93].) The rejection of plaintiff\u2019s demand for correction of his record and its continued dissemination thereafter do not rise to the level of discretionary activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The opening statement described no ground of recovery against A. L. Coffey individually. A public official has no personal vicarious liability fot a wrong committed by his subordinates unless he negligently selected of retained unfit subordinates. <em>(Fernelius </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1943) 22 Cal.2d 226, 235 [138 P.2d 12].) The opening statement did not charge Mr. Coffey with that kind of negligence. Except that he signed a letter in 1962 (before the Bureau was notified of the error in its records), there is no allegation that Mr. Coffey personally participated in any of the events. Thus the nonsuit in favor of Mr. Coffey was entirely proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I would reverse the nonsuit judgment won by the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied September 2, 1971.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-5\">See Packard, The Naked Society (1964); Brenton, The Privacy Invaders (1964); Westin, Privacy and Freedom (1967); Karst, <em>\u201cThe Files\u201d: Legal Control over the Accuracy and Accessibility of Stored Personal Data, </em>31 L. &amp; Contemp.

For these reasons, while the suspect or offender obviously does not consent to public exposure, his right to privacy must give way to the overriding social interest.\u201d <em>(Briscoe </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Association, Inc., 4 </em>Cal.3d 529, 536 [93 Cal.Rptr. 866, 483 P.2d 34].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ7y\">\u201c. . .

The law also provides for court orders sealing juvenile court records and for destruction of case records in the hands of other agencies. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 781.) The stigmatic consequences suffered by plaintiff were prophetically described by an official study conducted in 1960: \u201cMuch is made of the confidentiality of juvenile court records to avoid stigmatizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the juvenile offender, but it is more often the CII and FBI arrest record that haunts him in later years.\u201d (Report of the Governor\u2019s Special Study Commission on Juvenile Justice, Part I (1960) p. 47, quoted in <em>T.N.G. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at p. 780, fn. 18.) The <em>T.N.G. </em>opinion contains an extensive bibliography dealing with the stigmatic effects of relatively light brushes with the law and the relative ineffectuality of suppression or \u201cexpungement\u201d procedures. A simple but effective approach exists in New York. Ever since 1907 a law of that state has required the return of police records upon demand of persons arrested but not convicted of crime. (N.Y. Pen. Law, \u00a7 516.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">In a supplementary statement to the jury, plaintiff\u2019s attorney described correspondence between the Bureau and local police agencies from which Bureau personnel might conceivably have inferred as early as 1951 that its record was erroneous. These statements fell far short of fastening the Bureau with knowledge of the error prior to plaintiff\u2019s visit to the Bureau in 1967. Under no reasonable view of the evidence described in the opening statement could the Bureau have been charged with knowledge prior to the 1967 visit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Conceivably, also, the claim might be classed as one for negligence, i.e., breach of a duty of care arising from the custodian\u2019s recognition that the dissemination of information falsely attributing crime is likely to result in injury.
