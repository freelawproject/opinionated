The trial court concluded he was not covered by the policy at the time of his loss and entered judgment in favor of defendant. Green appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">Green was an employee of Farmer Brothers Company, which on 8 August 1962 contracted with American Casualty for a group policy providing accidental-death and dismemberment indemnity. Green joined the group and obtained coverage which included $50,000 for loss of a foot. Farmer Brothers paid in advance to American Casualty the $9 monthly premium on the 8th of each month, and then deducted $4.15 from Green\u2019s paycheck every two weeks to cover the approximate cost of the premium. Green\u2019s employment with Farmer Brothers terminated on 6 February 1967, when he disclosed to Farmer Brothers his embezzlement of its funds. On the evening of 8 February 1967 Green discharged a shotgun, as a result of which his left foot was amputated.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">1. Green\u2019s certificate of insurance from American Casualty provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201cThe individual coverage with respect to any Insured Person shall immediately terminate ... on the first premium due date following the date on which the Insured Person ceases to be an employee of the Policyholder. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The key issue is whether Green was covered by the policy on the evening of 8 February 1967. American Casualty argues that the policy\u2019s coverage became effective at 12:01 a.m. on 8 August; that a monthly premium covered the period from the 8th of one month to the 7th of the following month; that 8 February was a premium due date; that since Green\u2019s employment terminated prior to that date, his coverage ceased at 12:01 a.m. on 8 February 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">We do not accept this argument. Green\u2019s certificate of insurance mentions the time \u201c12:01 a.m.\u201d only once and then says no more than \u201cThis insurance is effective on [8 August] at 12:01 a.m. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The termination clause in the certificate of insurance merely provides that coverage terminates \u201con the first premium due date following the date on which the Insured Person ceases to be an employee.\u201d Because uncertainties in an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>surance policy must be construed in favor of the imposition of liability <em>(Humphrey </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc., </em>67 Cal.2d 527, 532 [63 Cal.Rptr. 50, 432 P.2d 746]), we construe the clause which states that coverage ends \u201con the first premium due date following the date on which the Insured Person ceases to be an employee\u201d to mean that coverage ends on the expiration of the premium due date.  This construction is consonant with general rules for interpretations of periods of time, since \u201ca day is the period of time between any midnight and the midnight following\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6806), and the law does not take fractions of a day into account unless provision is specifically made for them. <em>(City of Pleasanton </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>63 Cal.2d 643, 646 [47 Cal.Rptr. 807, 408 P.2d 135].)  When an act must be performed on a specified day, performance does not relate to any particular time of day but extends throughout the day. (47 Cal.Jur.2d, Time, \u00a7 10; 52 Am.Jur. 339, Time, \u00a7 15.)  Fanner Brothers could have rehired Green on the premium due date and paid the premium for his insurance any time during that day, and Green\u2019s coverage would have continued Without interruption. Our construction of the termination clause thus conforms duration of coverage to duration of opportunity to continue coverage, and we hold that Green was covered by the policy on the evening of 8 February 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><em>Leary </em>v. <em>Bankers Life and Casualty Company, </em>263 F.Supp. 565, affd. (8th Cir.) 387 F.2d 564 is precisely in point. In <em>Leary </em>the group policy provided that coverage would cease on the first day of the month following termination of employment. Leary resigned on 16 December 1965 and suffered an insured loss at 10:20 a.m. on 1 January 1966. <em>Held, </em>his coverage did not cease until the end of the first day of the month. \u201cIf defendant wanted the coverage to cease at 12:01 a.m. on the first day of the month following termination of employment . . . defendant could and should have expressly provided. . . .\u201d (263 F.Supp. at p. 569 (accord, <em>Bouvier </em>v. <em>Craftsman Ins. Co., </em>300 Mass. 5 [13 N.E.2d 619]; <em>Garelick </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>274 N.Y. 64 [8 N.E.2d 279]; cf. <em>National Security Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>152 Tex. 316 [257 S.W.2d 943, 38 A.L.R.2d 764], where the policy specifically provided the time of day at which coverage would end).)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">2. The insurance policy at bench excluded coverage for self-inflicted injury. Although the trial court heard evidence on the question whether Green intended to injure himself it made no finding on the subject. Green asks this court to find that his injury was accidental. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 909.) We decline to do so because, absent exceptional circumstances not present here, fact-finding is a function of the court which has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>heard the testimony and observed the witnesses. <em>(Lesem </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement, </em>183 Cal.App.2d 289, 302-303 [6 Cal.Rptr. 608].)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the trial court with instructions to determine whether the injury was accidental or self-inflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Roth, P. J., and Herndon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 26, 1971, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied June 23, 1971.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\">The master policy held by Farmer Brothers provides that \u201cAll periods of insurance shall begin .and end ait 12.01 a.m. . . .\u201d But this provision specifically relates only to the termination of Farmer Brothers\u2019 master policy and is not found in Green\u2019s certificate of insurance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
