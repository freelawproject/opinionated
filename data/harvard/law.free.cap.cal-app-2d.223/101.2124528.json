(Order, December 17, 1962.) The matter was submitted on the verified complaint and affidavit of one Winchester and the counteraffidavit of defendant secretary Birch. No answer was filed by defendants until after notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The verified complaint alleges that plaintiff owns and operates the \u201cEsquire Barber Shop\u201d in Santa Monica; that defendant union is an association of in excess of 50 journeymen barbers and barber shop proprietors of whom some 20 operate barber shops in Santa Monica in direct competion with each other and plaintiff; that the State Board of Barber Examiners has fixed $1.29 as the minimum price for a haircut in the Santa Monica area; that plaintiff offers and sells a haircut for $1.35, 70 per cent of which he pays to the journeyman barber who cuts the hair; that the proprietor members of defendant union in the Santa Monica area have agreed with each other and the union to charge not less than $1.75 for a haircut\u2014many charge $2.00\u2014and, when any barber shop not a party to such agreement charges less than $1.75, to authorize the Union Executive Board to meet the competition by setting different minimum prices; that members of defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>union walk up and down in front of plaintiff\u2019s barber shop during business hours and, as a prospective customer walks close enough to enter plaintiff\u2019s shop, approach him and give him a piece of paper stating\u2014\u201cSave $1.00 On Tour Next Haircut\u201d \u2014 to which is attached a \u201ccheck\u201d \u201cgood for One Dollar at a Union Barber Shop (listed on the back) in this area towards a haircut\u201d signed by the president and secretary-treasurer of the Barber\u2019s Union,\u201d and say in substance: \u201cTake this to any barber shop . . . The nearest barber shop is three blocks in either direction\u201d; that as a result many of plaintiff\u2019s prospective customers are detoured and diverted to barber shops operated by proprietor members of defendant union where they surrender the \u201cchecks\u201d and receive haircuts for payment of either 75 cents or $1.00 each; that members of defendant union distributing these \u201ccheeks\u201d in front of plaintiff\u2019s shop have not by banner, placard, card, speech or gesture stated, indicated or suggested that there exists between plaintiff and the union any \u201clabor controversy,\u201d \u201cstrike,\u201d \u201cboycott,\u201d \u201ceffort to organize\u201d or \u201clabor dispute\u201d or that they are seeking to persuade persons not to patronize plaintiff for any reason than to \u201cSave $1.00\u201d on their next haircut; that this plan, by which those proprietor members of defendant union operating barber shops near plaintiff offer to sell, and sell, a haircut to plaintiff\u2019s prospective customers for only 75 cents or $1.00 in cash, which is less than the minimum fixed by the state board ($1.29) and less than the cost to the proprietor union members (who have agreed to pay journeymen barbers in their shops not less than $1,225 for each haircut [70 per cent of the price to the patron]), has been carried out by defendant union for the purpose of injuring plaintiff as a competitor and destroying competition between him and the proprietor members of defendant union by underselling plaintiff and inducing his customers to leave his shop and get their haircut elsewhere for less than $1.35 ; and that said haircut, offered and sold at less than cost constitutes a \u201closs leader\u201d within the meaning of the Unfair Practices Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17030 et seq.) and an unfair trade practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Winchester\u2019s declaration alleges that, about to enter plaintiff\u2019s shop, he received two such \u201cchecks\u201d and went with defendants to Angel\u2019s Barber Shop three blocks away where he had a haircut for which he surrendered to the barber the two \u201cchecks\u201d and paid nothing else in cash or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The countershowing of defendants was by way of affidavit executed by defendant union secretary Birch alleging: that barbers\u2019 wages are based directly upon the price paid by patrons for \u201cthe services rendered by the barber\u201d thus, union members have an interest in the price charged by plaintiff; that the \u201cactivities described in the complaint\u201d constitute a labor dispute over wages\u2014since plaintiff has refused to comply with union conditions he is unfair to organized labor; that defendant union has found it necessary, when union wages are not paid to barbers for \u201cthe services rendered,\u201d to meet this competition by regularly accepted competitive methods; and that there is nothing done in front of plaintiff\u2019s shop except \u201cpeaceful picketing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-3\">While ordinarily \u201c \u2018. . . an injunction should not be granted <em>pendente lite </em>upon a complaint alone where, in response thereto, a verified answer is filed explicitly and unequivocally denying the allegations of such complaint\u2019 <em>(Martin </em>v. <em>Danziger, </em>21 Cal.App. 563, 564 [132 P. 284].)\u201d <em>(Moriyama </em>v. <em>Groshen, </em>52 Cal.App. 215, 218 [198 P. 225]), when the preliminary injunction herein was issued defendants had filed no answer\u2014the countershowing was by way of affidavit, which reflects no factual conflict concerning the \u201cactivities described in the complaint\u201d but only seeks to justify them as a legitimate means of forcing plaintiff to pay union wages, and labels them \u201cpeaceful picketing.\u201d Moreover, it has been consistently held that \u201ccircumstances may exist in a case which justify the issuance of a temporary injunction notwithstanding the absolute denials in the answer\u201d <em>(Monterey Club </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>48 Cal.App.2d 131, 144 [119 P.2d 349]; <em>Lutz </em>v. <em>Western Iron &amp; Metal Co., </em>190 Cal. 554 [213 P. 962]; <em>Metropolitan Laundry Co., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>20 Cal.App.2d 246 [66 P.2d 722]; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Jennings, </em>89 Cal. 440 [26 P. 965]; <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Foulks, </em>180 Cal. 171 <em>[179 </em>P. 886]; and where the allegations of the complaint make out a strong case for injunctive relief the defendant cannot deprive the court of its power and discretion to issue the injunction merely by filing an answer and denials or an affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The main issue presented by appellants is whether the preliminary injunction interferes with the union\u2019s right to picket; they claim the right \u201cto meet this [plaintiff\u2019s] competition\u201d by \u201cthe activities described in the complaint,\u201d which constitute \u201cpeaceful picketing.\u201d (Affidavit of Birch; A.O.B., pp. 6, 11, 12.) It is plaintiff\u2019s contention that defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ants\u2019 activities constitute neither picketing nor the legitimate incident of picketing or advancing the union\u2019s position in a labor dispute, and that under the guise of picketing defendants, by illegal means, are trying to eliminate him as a competitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">It is conceded by all that under the numerous eases cited by appellants, and <em>Messner </em>v. <em>Journeymen Barbers etc. International Union of America, </em>53 Cal.2d 873 [4 Cal.Rptr. 179, 351 P.2d 347], the union has the right to peacefully picket plaintiff\u2019s place of business. However, plaintiff\u2019s objection is not to union picketing, but to the $1.00 rebates on haircuts defendant union is allowing to his prospective customers if they will leave his shop and patronize a competitor union barber shop in the area. The action does not seek to enjoin or interfere with the union\u2019s right to organize plaintiff\u2019s shop or to picket his place of business by walking up and down or standing in front and/or displaying the customary signs or by orally announcing that he is unfair to organized labor or is nonunion. In fact, the complaint reflects a complete absence of any activity in the nature of picketing\u2014it alleges that although union members walk up and down in front of plaintiff\u2019s shop, they carry nothing and say nothing to indicate that any labor dispute or controversy exists\u2014and there is nothing to distinguish them from other members of the public; that their sole activity, carried on for the purpose of diverting customers from plaintiff\u2019s shop and underselling him, is their distribution to plaintiff\u2019s prospective customers of rebate \u201ccheeks\u201d for which a haircut may be purchased at specified union shops in the area at a price below cost to them; and that even the \u2018 \u2018 check, \u2019 \u2019 although issued by the president and secretary-treasurer of the Barber\u2019s Union, bears nothing to indicate a labor dispute\u2014only that it is good for \u201cOne Dollar\u201d towards a haircut at a \u201cUnion Barber Shop\u201d in the area \u201cto better acquaint you with Union Barbershop service and workmanship,\u201d that \u201cTour Union Barber . . . will accept this check as partial payment for a haircut . . and that \u201c(Union Barbers Are Better Barbers).\u201d Nor does the preliminary injunction say anything about picketing or walking up and down in front of plaintiff\u2019s place of business. It simply enjoins defendant union (the members of which include, as direct competitors of plaintiff, some 20 proprietors in that area) from delivering and making available to any of the plaintiff\u2019s prospective customers a $1.00 rebate on bartering serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ices as an inducement to divert them from plaintiff\u2019s barbershop to another; and leaves union members free to walk up and down in front of plaintiff\u2019s shop, and the union free to employ pickets to announce orally or by signs or cards or in any other legitimate manner that a labor dispute exists or plaintiff\u2019s shop is nonunion or unfair to organized labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\">Concerning a union\u2019s right to picket, the Supreme Court said in <em>Messner </em>v. <em>Journeymen Barbers etc. International Union, </em>53 Cal.2d 873 [4 Cal.Rptr. 179, 351 P.2d 347]: <em>\u201cIt </em>is clear that \u2018a union may use the various forms of concerted action, such as strike, picketing, or boycott, to enforce an objective that is reasonably related to any legitimate interest of organized labor. ... It is equally well settled that the object of concerted labor activity must be proper and that it must be sought by lawful means, otherwise the persons injured by such activity may obtain damages or injunctive relief. \u2019 <em>(James </em>v. <em>Marinship Corp., </em>25 Cal.2d 721, 728-729 [155 P.2d 329, 160 A.L.R. 900] and cases cited.) \u201d (Pp. 876, 877.) Whereas in the <em>Messner </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the issue was whether \u201cdefendants\u2019 peaceful picketing was directed toward a proper object . . .\u201d (p. 877), in the case at bar, assuming for the moment the object of their activities to be proper, <em>the </em>real question is whether it is sought by <em>laluful </em>means; if it is not, the injunction was properly granted. <em>(Messner </em>v. <em>Journeymen Barbers etc. International Union, </em>53 Cal.2d 873 [4 Cal.Rptr. 179, 351 P.2d 347].) Thus, do union members, here indistinguishable from other members of the public, in their activity of offering to plaintiff\u2019s customers $1.00 rebates on haircuts if they will leave plaintiff and patronize a competitor union barber shop, depart from the employment of \u201clawful means\u201d? It would appear that they do if the haircut at the competitor union shop costs the patron only the difference between the $1.00 rebate (paid by defendant union with union funds) and the fixed union price, and if the effect is to divert trade from or otherwise injure plaintiff as a competitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The complaint specifically alleges that by paying rebates of $1.00 on haircuts given to plaintiff\u2019s customers if they will leave him and patronize competitor union barbershops in the area, members of defendant union are offering a haircut for 75 cents or $1.00, an amount less than the minimum fixed by the state board ($1.29) and less than the cost of the haircut to them ($1,225 per haircut is paid by union proprietor members to the journeyman barber who cuts the hair), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>are thereby diverting numerous customers from plaintiff\u2019s shop to his union competitors and underselling him, injuring plaintiff as a competitor and destroying competition (Par. IX). Nowhere in their countershowing do defendants deny \u201cthe activities described in the complaint\u201d or their effect on plaintiff; they even concede they are using them as a \u201ccompetitive method\u201d \u201cto meet this (plaintiff\u2019s) competition,\u201d but attempt to justify them as \u201cpeaceful picketing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A4R8\">A \u201c \u2018Loss leader\u2019 \u201d constituting an unfair trade practice under the Unfair Practices Act, \u201cmeans any article or product sold at less than cost: ... (c) Where the effect is to divert trade from or otherwise injure competitors.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17030.) Section 17044 makes it unlawful for any person to sell or use \u201cany article or product as a \u2018loss leader \u2019 as defined in section 17030. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Relying upon section 16703, Business and Professions Code, appellants claim that only a commodity or product can be used as a \u201closs leader,\u201d and that labor (hair cutting) is not a commodity. While section 16703, Business and Professions Code in the chapter entitled \u201cBestraint of Trade,\u201d with which we are not here concerned, excludes labor, skilled, or unskilled, as a commodity \u2018 \u2018 [W] ithin the meaning of this chapter,\u201d pertinent sections in the following chapter entitled \u201cUnfair Trade Practices,\u201d known as the Unfair Practices Act (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17020 et seq.), with which we are concerned, make it clear that legislation denouncing unfair trade practices applies as well to the rendition of services and the output of a service trade. Accordingly, section 17024 provides: \u201c \u2018Article or product' includes any article, product, commodity, thing of value, service or output of a service trade.\u201d In our determination whether a haircut can be a \u201closs leader\u201d within the meaning of the Unfair Practices Act, we are concerned not with the actual work of the journeyman barber in cutting the hair, but with the purchase and sale of a haircut from a proprietor barber which clearly amounts to a \u201cservice or output of a service trade.\u201d Even defendants\u2019 counteraffidavit refers not to labor, but to \u201cbarber ing services\u201d and to \u201cservices rendered.\u201d Inasmuch as their plan, admittedly employed by defendants as a \u201ccompetitive method\u201d \u201cto meet . . . [plaintiff\u2019s] competition\u201d (affidavit of Birch), has injured plaintiff as a competitor and destroyed competition, the haircut which costs plaintiff\u2019s prospective customer but 75 cents or $1.00 at a competitor union barber shop is a \u201closs leader\u201d constituting an unfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>trade practice. This activity, under the guise of peaceful picketing, is carried on by means made unlawful by the Unfair Practices Act, for which plaintiff is entitled to a preliminary injunction <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pay Less Drug Store, </em>25 Cal.2d 108 [153 P.2d 9]; <em>Wholesale Tobacco Dealers Bureau </em>v. <em>National Candy &amp; Tobacco Co., </em>11 Cal.2d 634 [82 P.2d 3, 118 A.L.R. 486]; <em>Kofsky </em>v. <em>Smart &amp; Final Iris Co., </em>131 Cal.App.2d 530 [281 P.2d 5]), without bond.
