Have you any legal cause to show why judgment should not be pronounced at this time?\u201d to which the attorney for defendant replied: \u201cNo legal cause\u201d; thereupon the court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment in the state prison for the time prescribed by law. From the foregoing it appears that the court did not expressly declare that it had denied the defendant\u2019s application for probation. Relying upon this fact, the defendant contends that the court failed to consider and determine his application, and urges this failure as a ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">In support of this position the defendant cites the rule that failure of a court to consider and determine a defendant\u2019s application for probation deprives him of a substantial right, and requires a reversal of the judgment against him, as expressed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>57 Cal.2d 676, 681 [21 Cal. Rptr. 564, 371 P.2d 300, 85 A.L.R.2d 252], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Walters, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 98, 100 [11 Cal.Rptr. 597], together with the cases therein cited. However, in the foregoing cases, the court did not actually consider the defendant\u2019s application for probation.  In the instant case the record establishes that the court read and considered the report of the probation officer; invited all counsel to express their positions with respect to the application for probation; listened to their replies; directed the clerk to arraign the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>who did so and in the course thereof advised him that his application for probation had been denied, but he made no objection thereto; and thereupon pronounced judgment. Under these circumstances, the pronouncement of judgment was the equivalent of a formal order denying the application for probation. (Cf. <em>Oster </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>45 Cal.2d 134, 139 [287 P.2d 755]; <em>In re Herron, </em>217 Cal. 400, 404 [19 P.2d 4].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Following pronouncement of judgment, as appears from the record herein, the court signed and caused to be filed a document entitled \u201cCommitment to State Prison,\u201d using an appropriately filled in printed form for this purpose. The body of this document contained the following: \u201cThe defendant is duly arraigned and sentenced as indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u201cWhereas the said defendant having duly plead guilty in this court of the crime of Possession of Marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11530) a lesser included offense of Sale of Marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11531)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u201cand probation having been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u201cIt is Therefore Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed that the said defendant be punished by imprisonment in the California Institution for Men for the term prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u201cIt is further ordered that the defendant be remanded to the custody of the Sheriff of the County of San Diego, to be by him delivered into the custody of the Director of Corrections at the California Institution for Men at Chino.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">\u201cI hereby certify the foregoing to be a true copy of the Judgment duly made and entered on the minutes of the Superior Court herein. \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">From the record it also appears that a copy of the aforesaid \u201cCommitment to State Prison\u201d was filed in the case in which the stamped name of the trial judge appears in lieu of his signature, and upon the face of which there is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-12\">\u201cMinutes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-13\">Dept. No. 8</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-14\">Date: Feb. 21,1963\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">There is no other entry of the judgment in the minutes of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">The defendant contends that neither of the foregoing documents comply with the requirements of section 1207 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the Penal Code which provides: \u201cWhen judgment upon a conviction is rendered, the clerk... must enter the same in the minutes, stating briefly the offense for which the conviction was had, and the fact of a prior conviction, if any. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">It also is contended that the failure of the clerk to properly enter the judgment in the minutes of the court requires that the proceedings be remanded to the trial court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">After a conviction, following either a plea or verdict of guilty, the court must pronounce judgment upon the defendant (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1191, 1193, 1202, 1445), i.e., impose a fine or sentence of imprisonment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>147 Cal.App.2d 793 [305 P.2d 932].) Pronouncement of judgment must be done orally. <em>(In re Bateman, </em>94 Cal.App. 639, 640 [271 P. 757].) To do so the court must \u201cutter\u201d its determination in the premises. <em>(Ibid.) </em> This is a judicial act. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vaile, </em>2 Cal.2d 441, 445 [42 P.2d 321]; <em>In re Larsen, </em>44 Cal.2d 642, 647 [283 P.2d 1043].)  Entry of the judgment in the minutes records the action of the court in the premises; is a ministerial act <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Employees Assn., </em>127 Cal.App.2d 285, 290 [273 P.2d 824]; <em>McKannay </em>v. <em>McKannay, </em>68 Cal.App. 709, 715 [230 P. 218]); and does not constitute \u201cpronouncement\u201d of judgment.  The reason for requiring a minute entry of the judgment in a criminal case is to furnish a concise record showing the crime of which the defendant has been convicted and the punishment imposed, which will protect him against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. <em>(In re Basuino, </em>22 Cal.2d 247, 251 [138 P.2d 297]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Becker, </em>80 Cal.App.2d 691, 695 [181 P.2d 958].)  An irregularity in the minute entry purportedly recording a criminal judgment, because of its failure to conform to the requirements of Penal Code section 1207, does not affect the validity of the judgment actually pronounced. <em>(In re Mize, </em>11 Cal.2d 22, 27 [77 P.2d 472].)  Where the record as a whole shows the offense of which the defendant was convicted and the punishment imposed therefor, any such irregularity is not prejudicial <em>(In re Mize, supra, </em>11 Cal.2d 22, 25), and does not warrant a reversal of the judgment. <em>(In re Basuino, supra, </em>22 Cal.2d 247, 251-253; <em>In re Mize, supra, </em>11 Cal.2d 22, 25; <em>People </em>v. <em>Becker, supra, </em>80 Cal.App.2d 691, 69<em>5 </em>cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitman, </em>122 Cal.App.2d 490, 497 [265 P.2d 105]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Novel, </em>118 Cal.App.2d 534, 538 [258 P.2d 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">In the instant case it is apparent that the clerk used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the printed commitment order form as a basis for his minutes in recording the pronouncement of judgment. In doing so he caused his minutes to create an ambiguity by failing to strike from the printed form that paragraph thereof reciting that it was a <em>copy </em>of the judgment duly made and entered in the minutes. Nevertheless, the entry in question obviously was intended to be the original minutes of the court as indicated by the statement thereon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">\u201cMinutes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">Dept. No. 8</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">Date:Feb. 21,1963\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">and the printed paragraph stating that it was a copy of the minutes should be disregarded as surplusage.  Furthermore, the offense of which the defendant was convicted and the sentence imposed therefor appear with certainty from other parts of the record, <em>vis., </em>(1) the minute entry recording his plea of guilty to the offense of possession of marijuana, (2) the court reporter\u2019s notes, which are official records of the court (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69955), and (3) the order of commitment to the state prison signed by the trial judge and certified by the clerk, which set forth both the offense and the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Under these circumstances, any alleged defect in the form of the minutes kept by the clerk of the court, which we do not commend, does not require a reversal of the judgment. <em>(In re Basuino, supra, </em>22 Cal.2d 247, 251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">Griffin, P. J., and Brown (Gerald), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 5, 1964.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-17\">By order of this court the record herein was augmented by depositing with us the ease file of the superior court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
