L. 435. That section provides: \u201cNo husband who shall have, for one year or upwards previous to the death of his wife, wilfully neglected or refused to provide for his wife, or shall have for that period or upwards wilfully and maliciously deserted her, shall have the right to claim any title or interest in her real or personal estate after her decease, under the provisions of this act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The auditing judge found the facts a\u00a1s follows: \u2018 \u2018 Clarence Ziegler was married to Annie Ivona Finch, ..,.. on June 5th or 25th, 1917. He provided a home for her for one month or five weeks after the marriage and then with her removed to her mother\u2019s home where she died on March 12, 1920. Annie Ivona Finch and her husband did not live together in concord and harmony ; but had disputes which he alleges occurred from her supplying him with insufficient food after they had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>removed to Ms mother-in-law\u2019s home. They had a child born on June 29,1918. One week before the birth of this child he left his wife, remaining away for about six weeks. He returned to her and repeated the desertion several times and each time he was the offender. In January, 1919, he left Ms wife and did not return to her during her life-time. In September, 1922, he remarried. He has never supported Ms child or offered to do so. He did give his wife about $60 in small payments of $5 a month during the last year of her life .......When his wife died he was not permitted to enter the home of his mother-in-law and he left the payment of her funeral expenses and physician\u2019s bills to her relatives. He is not supported in his allegation that he lived with his wife until October, 1919. He was then living with his mother and sister.....We are clearly of the opinion that this man maliciously deserted Ms wife and never intended to provide for her. He never did offer her a home of her own after he returned with her to her mother\u2019s home, although he pretended to be wanting his wife to move; but can-celled all the articles in an order for furniture except what was necessary for a dining room and this was sent to his mother-in-law\u2019s house and not paid for by him.\u201d Exceptions were filed and were dismissed by the court in banc. The record contains sufficient evidence to support those findings. As the challenged decree logically follows the findings of fact, we must affirm it: \u201cThe prevailing rule is that findings of fact of an auditing judge, when based upon sufficient evidence, and especially if affirmed by the orphans \u2019 court, ia,s was done in this case, will' not be disturbed unless error is clearly shown and it appears the facts found were without sufficient evidence to sustain them, as he hears the witnesses testify, and therefore is better able to judge of their credibility: Ike\u2019s Est., 236 Pa. 429; Rorabaugh\u2019s Est., 229 Pa. 377; Shaw\u2019s Est., 54 Pa. Superior Ct. 444\u201d; Kvist\u2019s Est., 256 Pa. 30, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Decree affirmed at the cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
