We affirmed his convictions oh direct appeal. <em>United States v. Flores, </em>572 F.3d 1254, 1271 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Cir.2009). Cruz filed a motion to vacate his convictions and sentences under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied that motion, and we granted a certificate of appealability on two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-4\">(1) Whether the district court erred in determining that Cruz\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for essentially conceding in closing arguments that Cruz had shot and killed a person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b968-5\">(2) Whether the district court erred in determining that the prosecutor had not engaged in improper witness vouching during opening arguments that denied Cruz a fair trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition, we review its findings of fact for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. Garcia v. United States, </em>278 F.3d 1210, 1212 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">-I.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Cruz first contends that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel, in violation of the Sixth Amendment. To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, \u201ca petitioner must show (1) deficient performance by counsel and (2) a reasonable probability that counsel\u2019s deficient performance affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d <em>Michael v. Crosby, </em>430 F.3d 1310, 1319 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). If we find that the lawyer\u2019s performance was not deficient, \u201cwe need not address the prejudice prong.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-9\">The review of an attorney\u2019s performance is \u201chighly deferential,\u201d and \u201cno relief can be granted on ineffectiveness grounds unless it is shown that no reasonable lawyer, in the circumstances\u201d would have acted as the attorney did. <em>Id. </em>at 1319-20 (quotation marks omitted). Counsel will not be deemed incompetent because of tactical decisions \u201cas long as the approach taken \u2018might be considered' sound trial strategy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chandler v. United States, </em>218 F.3d 1305, 1314 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Cruz claims that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient because he conceded Cruz\u2019s guilt in closing argument. We disagree. At no point in his closing argument did Cruz\u2019s attorney concede Cruz\u2019s guilt. Cruz\u2019s attorney made it clear at the beginning of his closing argument that he would be discussing the facts as the government had presented them. He argued that the facts presented by the government showed that Cruz was \u201csurrounded,\u201d so \u201c[h]e\u2019s justified in doing what he did. Any of us would have done that.\u201d He further explained, \u201cIf I\u2019m being attacked, or you, or anybody, and I take out my weapon and I fire it at my attacker ... that is not malice murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">The government\u2019s charge against Cruz of a violent crime in aid of racketeering activity was based on the underlying charge of murder as identified in Georgia Code Ann. \u00a7 16-5-1 (a), which requires that the defendant act \u201cwith malice aforethought.\u201d The attorney\u2019s decision to focus his closing argument on arguing that his client lacked the requisite malice was a tactical decision. In light of the strong evidence supporting the government\u2019s allegation that Cruz fired the gun, such a decision was certainly not one that no reasonable attorney would make. We need not address the prejudice prong, given that it is clear that Cruz\u2019s counsel did not provide deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">Cruz also contends that the government improperly vouched for several of its witnesses by stating that they would be giving truthful testimony. We need not reach the merits of this claim because Cruz raises it for the first time with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>\u00a7 2255 motion. \u201cUnder the procedural default rule, a defendant generally must advance an available challenge to a criminal conviction or sentence on direct appeal or else the defendant is barred from presenting that claim in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding.\u201d <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1234 (11th Cir.2004). A petitioner may avoid that procedural bar only if (1) he shows cause for not raising the claim of error on direct appeal and actual prejudice from the alleged error or (2) a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent. <em>Id. </em>at 1234-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">Cruz did not raise the improper witness vouching claim on direct appeal. He has not made any argument in this Court showing cause for his failure to raise the issue on direct appeal, and he has not demonstrated actual prejudice from the government\u2019s statements, which merely explained the conditions of the plea agreements under which most of the witnesses were testifying. Although Cruz claims innocence, there is no evidence that the alleged witness vouching resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent. Therefore, Cruz\u2019s improper witness vouching claim is barred by the procedural default rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">The district court\u2019s denial of Cruz\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
