He contends that the district judge should have recused after improperly stating that Mr. Solano-Ra-mirez, who had earlier been convicted of committing a lewd and lascivious act with a child under the age of 14, had \u201craped\u201d the victim in that case. Mr. Solano-Ramirez also asserts that reversal is warranted because the district judge never acknowledged the mitigating evidence presented at sentencing and never mentioned the sentencing factors to be considered under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Following review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The revised presentence investigation report added 16 levels to the base offense level associated with illegal reentry because Mr. Solano-Ramirez had a 1997 California conviction (and 3-year prison sentence) for committing a lewd and lascivious act with a child under the age of 14, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 288(a). The report explained that the 13-year-old female victim in the California conviction had been \u201craped by a man who rent[ed] a room from her uncle.\u201d According to the victim, the perpetrator \u2014 Mr. Solano-Ra-mirez \u2014 had pulled off her pants and \u201cforced his penis into her vagina causing severe pain.\u201d Mr. Solano-Ramirez, when approached by the police, admitted to having sex with the victim and to knowing that she was under the age of 18. The report did not explain where the facts underlying the California conviction came from.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Mr. Solano-Ramirez objected to the factual description in paragraph 24 of the report. He asserted, without any further elaboration, that the facts found in that description did not come from reliable court sources, as the term was defined in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). He also argued that his California conviction was not a crime of violence within the meaning of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) and, therefore, could not support the 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In response, the government pointed out that, according to the charging document in the California case, Mr. Solano-Ramirez had committed a lewd and lascivious act \u201cupon and with the body\u201d of a girl under the age of 14 \u201cwith the intent of arousing, appealing to, and gratifying the lust, passions, and sexual desires\u201d of Mr. Solano-Ramirez and the victim. The government also argued that, under Eleventh Circuit precedent, the California conviction constituted a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Solano-Ramirez again challenged the factual recitation in paragraph 24 of the presentence investigation report, and he argued that the district judge should not consider it. When the district judge asked Mr. Solano-Ramirez\u2019s counsel what evidence he had to \u201crefute those facts,\u201d counsel responded that it was not Mr. Solano-Ramirez\u2019s burden to refute them; instead, he argued, it was the government\u2019s burden to establish them: \u201cThese facts are very prejudicial. But we don\u2019t know where they came from, and the government has to establish that they came from reliable court documents. There\u2019s a long line of cases, both from the Supreme Court and the Eleventh Circuit, that state this fact. And the probation office, to my knowledge, does not have any <em>Shepard </em>documents to substantiate these facts. Moreover, these facts detail arguably a forcible rape. [Mr. Solano-Ra-mirez] was not charged with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">The district judge, in ruling that the California conviction was a crime of violence, said that the 13-year-old victim \u201cwas raped. And if counsel for the defense thinks that sexual abuse of a minor, a 13 year old, is not an act of violence, counsel is not in touch with reality.... So the presentence report is correct in the Court\u2019s mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Based on those comments, Mr. Solano-Ramirez asked the district judge to recuse. Specifically, he stated: \u201cI think there\u2019s an appearance of impartiality [sic] based on this Court\u2019s comments. I would ask that the Court recuse itself at this time and assign this case to another judge.\u201d Mr. Solano-Ramirez also asked for a downward departure, a downward variance, and a 10 to 16 month prison sentence. The government requested a sentence in the middle of the 46 to 57 month advisory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>guidelines range. The district judge denied the motion for recusal without explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The district judge sentenced Mr. Sola-no-Ramirez to a prison term of 46 months, which was the bottom of the advisory guidelines range. The judge did not discuss any of the mitigation arguments presented by Mr. Solano-Ramirez and did not explain why a 46-month sentence was appropriate. Nor did the judge reference, or discuss, the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Mr. Solano-Ra-mirez\u2019s counsel objected to the sentence as procedurally and substantively unreasonable, arguing that the district judge had improperly accorded a presumption of correctness to the advisory guidelines and had \u201cnot given satisfactory focus on the [\u00a7] 3553(a) factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">We review a district judge\u2019s refusal to recuse for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), a judge must recuse if \u201can objective, fully informed lay observer would entertain significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2000). On this record, there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">We turn first to the district judge\u2019s characterization of the California case as having involved a rape. In his written sentencing objections, Mr. Solano-Ramirez did not contest the accuracy of the underlying facts set forth in paragraph 24 of the presentence investigation report. He argued only that those facts did not come from reliable court documents. As a general matter, an objection to a probation officer\u2019s \u201cuse of police reports, as non-<em>Shepard </em>materials, in preparation of the [presentence investigation report]\u201d does not constitute an objection to \u201cthe underlying facts of ... prior convictions as set forth in the court documents referenced in the [report].\u201d <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 833 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">In any event, at sentencing the district judge overruled Mr. Solano-Ramirez\u2019s objections to the facts in the report relating to the California conviction. Whether this ruling was correct or not\u2014Mr. Solano-Ramirez does not challenge it on appeal\u2014 its effect was to leave paragraph 24 of the report (and its description of the criminal act as rape) standing. The district judge, therefore, did not improperly refer to the 13-year-old victim as having been raped. And because the judge had a proper legal basis for describing Mr. Solano-Ramirez\u2019s lewd and lascivious conduct as rape, his use of that description did not provide a basis for an appearance of partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">Next we turn to the district judge\u2019s comment that Mr. Solano-Ramirez\u2019s counsel was \u201cnot in touch with reality\u201d if counsel thought that the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old was not a crime of violence. That comment, while maybe a bit strong, did not require the judge to recuse. After reviewing the sentencing transcript, it appears to us that the judge\u2019s words are his way of recognizing that counsel\u2019s argument lacked merit in light of existing Eleventh Circuit precedent. <em>See United States v. Ortiz-Delgado, </em>451 F.3d 752, 757 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]he plain language of ... CaLPenal Code \u00a7 288[ (a) ] qualifies [the defendant\u2019s previous offense conduct as \u2018sexual abuse of a minor,\u2019 and thus, a crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">Mr. Solano-Ramirez also argues that the district judge committed significant procedural error by failing to ac~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>knowledge that he had considered the arguments in favor of mitigation and by not even mentioning either 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or the sentencing factors that statute contains. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">We review a claim of procedural sentencing error for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Almedina, </em>686 F.3d 1312, 1314 (11th Cir.2012). In relevant part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) requires a judge to state \u201cin open court the reasons for [his] imposition of the particular sentence.\u201d Our precedent, however, does not require district judges to give detailed explanations of each and every mitigation argument made by a defendant or each and every sentencing factor under \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[A]n ac-knowledgement by the district [judge] that [he] has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in [\u00a7] 3553(a) is sufficient....\u201d <em>United States v. Sarras, </em>575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The district judge in this case did not mention any of Mr. Solano-Ramirez\u2019s arguments in support of mitigation or otherwise indicate that he had considered them. Nor did the judge cite to \u00a7 3553(a) or discuss any of the applicable sentencing factors. The district judge said absolutely nothing about why he thought 46 months was the appropriate prison term.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, we simply do not know why the judge chose to impose a 46-month sentence and to reject the parties\u2019 arguments for different sentences. We have previously vacated and remanded where a district judge gave no explanation or reason for the sentence imposed, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1257 (11th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>438 F.3d 1272, 1274 (11th Cir.2006), and the same remedy is called for here.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-13\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-14\">Mr. Solano-Ramirez\u2019s sentence is vacated, and the case is remanded so that the district judge, on the record, can indicate that he has considered the sentencing arguments of the parties and can explain why the imposition of a 46-month sentence is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-8\">. We reject, without further discussion, Mr. Solano-Ramirez\u2019s argument that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>judge\u2019s handling of the sentencing hearing demonstrated partiality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\">. The \"written statement of reasons\u201d referenced in the government's brief is not part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b897-10\">. Given the district judge\u2019s failure to say anything about the propriety of the 46-month sentence, this is not a case like <em>Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 833, where we rejected a claim of procedural error because the district judge, although not discussing the mitigating evidence, had said he had considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Nor is it similar to <em>United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007), where we found no procedural error, despite the district judge\u2019s failure to mention the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, because the record showed that the judge had, in fact, considered those factors.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
