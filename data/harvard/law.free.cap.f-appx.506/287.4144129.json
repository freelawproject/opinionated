The district court determined that Stephens had not paid a $150 monetary sanction imposed in a prior case, and it dismissed Stephens\u2019 mandamus petition because it had been filed in violation of the standing sanction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Stephens raises a number of claims for relief based on his arrest, detention, and prosecution. Nonetheless, he does not dispute the district court\u2019s determination that he has not paid the monetary sanction, nor does he contend that his mandamus petition is not subject to the preclusion order set forth in the prior case. Stephens has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his action for failure to comply with the standing sanction order. <em>See Gelabert v. Lynaugh, </em>894 F.2d 746, 747-48 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
