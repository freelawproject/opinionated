On appeal, Merchant argues that his sentence violates his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">In the district court, Merchant did not object to his sentence on Eighth Amendment grounds; therefore, we review the sentence for plain error only. <em>United States v. McGarity, </em>669 F.3d 1218, 1255 &amp; n. 56 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 374, 378, 381, 459, 551, 184 L.Ed.2d 220, 282, 358 (2012). To prevail under plain error review, a defendant must show that (1) an error occurred, and that the error (2) is plain, (3) affected his substantial rights, and (4) \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Bacon, </em>598 F.3d 772, 777 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cBefore an error is subject to correction under the plain error rule, it must be plain under controlling precedent or in view of the unequivocally clear words of a statute or rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Schmitz, </em>634 F.3d 1247, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments. U.S. Const, amend. VIII. Although the amendment \u201ccontains a narrow proportionality principle that applies to noncapital sentences,\u201d Eighth Amendment challenges rarely succeed outside the capital punishment context because courts \u201caccord substantial deference to Congress, as it possesses broad authority to determine the types and limits of punishments for crimes.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>451 F.3d 1239, 1242-43 (11th Cir.2006). To successfully challenge a non-capital sentence on Eighth Amendment grounds, a defendant must first establish that the sentence is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d to the offense he committed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1243. This threshold proportionality inquiry requires a comparison of \u201cthe gravity of the offense and the severity of the sentence.\u201d <em>Graham v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2022, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010). \u201cIn general, a sentence within the limits imposed by statute is neither excessive nor cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">Merchant argues that his sentence is grossly disproportionate in light of his personal circumstances, namely his lack of a prior criminal history, his age (25 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>old) at the time of the offense, his lack of sophistication and limited life experience, his family support, and expert testimony at the sentencing hearing that he is amenable to treatment and bears a low risk of recidivism. Merchant also asserts that the changing mores of society, as reflected in commentator and judicial criticism of the Sentencing Guidelines for child pornography offenses, require that his sentence be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Merchant has not shown the district court plainly erred in imposing his sentence. Merchant\u2019s 210-month sentence was not grossly disproportionate under the clear wording of a statute or controlling precedent. To the contrary, Merchant\u2019s sentence, at 17.5 years, was well within the statutory limits of 5 to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) (authorizing term of imprisonment of 5 to 20 years for violations of \u00a7 2252A(a) (2) (B)). In fact, the district court sentenced Merchant at the low end of his advisory guidelines range of 210 to 262 months. And Merchant\u2019s offense was extremely grave, as it involved nearly 47,-000 images of child pornography, many of them depicting violence against infants, toddlers, and other young children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>. <em>See McGarity, </em>669 F.3d at 1256 (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to life sentences imposed on members of child pornography ring and reaffirming that \u201cthe sexual abuse of children, and the use of the internet to facilitate that abuse, are serious problems affecting the health and welfare of the nation\u201d). Merchant points to no controlling precedent that plainly shows his sentence to be grossly disproportionate or otherwise cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, Merchant has not met his burden of showing the district court plainly erred in imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-12\">. If a defendant makes a threshold showing of gross disproportionality, then \"the court must then consider the sentences imposed on others convicted in the same jurisdiction and the sentences imposed for commission of the same crime in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1243. If this comparison \"validates [the] initial judgment that the sentence is grossly disproportionate, the sentence is cruel and unusual.\u201d <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2022, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010) (brackets and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b983-6\">. A search of Merchant's computer and external hard drive discovered 3,568 still images and 579 videos depicting the sexual abuse and exploitation of infants, toddlers, and other prepubescent children. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, cmt. n. 4(B)(ii), each video is considered to contain 75 images, yielding a total of 46,993 images.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b983-7\">. In fact, Merchant candidly acknowledges in his brief \u201cthe numerous decisions of this Court rejecting challenges similar to the one [raised] in this brief.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1343-45 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Johnson, </em>451 F.3d at 1242-44. Merchant argues we should \"recede[] from\u201d those earlier cases in light of, among other things, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Graham, </em>130 S.Ct. 2011 (holding Eighth Amendment prohibits imposition of life-without-parole sentence on juvenile offenders who did not commit homicide), and <em>Miller v. Alabama, </em>- U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012) (holding Eighth Amendment prohibits sentences of mandatory life imprisonment without parole for persons under 18 years old at the time of their crimes). Even putting aside the fact that our review is for plain error, the <em>Graham </em>and <em>Miller </em>decisions are clearly inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
