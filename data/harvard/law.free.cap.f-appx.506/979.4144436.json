After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-14\">A grand jury indicted Woods in August 2011 for being a felon in possession of three firearms and multiple rounds of ammunition, in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1). According to the indictment, agents found the firearms and ammunition when they searched Woods\u2019s residence pursuant to a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-15\">There are two warrants at issue here. The first warrant listed Woods\u2019s residence as 186 Southwest 2nd Avenue, an apparent combination of Woods\u2019s postal address, 186 Southwest 1st Court, and the structure\u2019s situs, 150 Southwest 2nd Avenue. When the agent who provided the affidavit to support this warrant noticed the error, he corrected it in the warrant documents and obtained a second, corrected warrant. The agent, however, failed to correct the erroneous address in the probable cause section of his affidavit accompanying the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-16\">In the probable cause section, the agent stated that he had met with a confidential informant regarding marijuana sales at the residence, had personally observed the informant make a controlled buy from a man \u2014 later determined to be Woods \u2014 at the residence, and had received from the informant the contraband acquired from Woods. Further, the agent noted that the informant said Woods advised him to return if he needed more marijuana. The residence detailed in the warrant and affidavit \u2014 a white home with green trim, a brown roof, and a white front door on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>west side of the structure \u2014 matches accurately Woods\u2019s residence at 186 Southwest 1st Court. And the residence was described as having \u201c186\u201d painted in white on the mailbox post, along with \u201c150,\u201d painted in black, which \u201crefer[s] to 150 S.W. 2nd Avenue which is the structure\u2019s situs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Agents executed this second warrant and discovered three loaded firearms at the residence. Before trial, Woods moved to suppress the firearms and ammunition, arguing that the search warrant was unsupported by probable cause because of the error in the affidavit. A magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation (R &amp; R) recommending that the district court deny Woods\u2019s motion. The district court adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R over Woods\u2019s objections, finding that the warrant was supported by probable cause and, in the alternative, that the good faith of the agents who conducted the search precluded exclusion of the evidence. Woods thereafter entered his guilty plea, conditioned on his ability to appeal from the denial of his motion to suppress. This is the appeal from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">A district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of fact and law. <em>United States v. Welch, </em>688 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir.2012). We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. Id. </em>And we construe all facts in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed before the district court. <em>United States v. Boyce, </em>351 F.3d 1102, 1105 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Although the affidavit mentioned the wrong address once, it provided a clear description of the correct address, 186 Southwest 1st Court. Construing these facts in the light most favorable to the government, we see no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination that the affidavit\u2019s singular reference to 186 Southwest 2nd Avenue was a typographical error. And, after resolving this matter, we conclude the affidavit contained sufficient facts to establish probable cause to search Woods\u2019s residence. Probable cause exists when \u201cthere is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 218, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). A search warrant affidavit must state facts sufficient to justify this conclusion. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>297 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2002). Here, the affidavit clearly established that the informant made a controlled buy from Woods at his residence and that Woods offered to sell him more marijuana. These facts supported a conclusion that contraband would probably be found at 186 Southwest 1st Court, and therefore established probable cause to search Woods\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court correctly denied Woods\u2019s motion to suppress because, despite the single typographical error in the affidavit supporting the warrant, the warrant was supported by probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
