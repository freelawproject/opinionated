Because the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-15\">In August 2009, Reed, an inmate at the State Correctional Institution at Roekview, Pennsylvania (\u201cSCI-Rockview\u201d), filed a civil rights complaint against seven officers of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. In the complaint, as amended in January 2010, Reed claimed that Defendants Harpster and Thompson failed to protect him from an attack by his cellmate, Michael LaCava. In particular, Reed claimed that: (1) Harpster and Thompson knew of LaCava\u2019s record of two prior assaults at other prisons; (2) LaCava told Harpster that he intended to \u201clump up\u201d Reed; and (3) LaCava sent a letter to Thompson stating that a \u201cdanger does exist\u201d in placing him in a double cell. Reed further alleged that all defendants participated in a conspiracy to cover-up Harp-ster\u2019s and Thompson\u2019s failure to protect Reed from attack. Harpster served an answer to Reed\u2019s complaint, and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The District Court subsequently dismissed Reed\u2019s conspiracy claim as to all moving defendants, and dismissed Reed\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim as to all moving defendants except Thompson. The District Court then granted summary judgment in favor of Harpster and Thompson on the ground that Reed failed to create a genuine dispute regarding whether the defendants knew of and disregarded an excessive risk to Reed\u2019s safety. Reed timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-17\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We may summarily affirm a judgment of the District Court if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>the appeal does not raise a substantial question. <em>See </em>I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">A. <em>Dismissal of the claims against Defendants Rackovan, Moms, Var-ner, Marsh, Tennis, and Thompson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Our review of a district court\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is plenary. <em>Dique v. N.J. State Police, </em>603 F.3d 181, 188 (3d Cir.2010). To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). The complaint must contain \u201cfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendants are] liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (citing <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">First, as the District Court noted, Reed\u2019s conspiracy claims against defendants Rackovan, Morris, Thompson, Var-ner, Marsh, and Tennis are not' cognizable. In order to sufficiently allege a claim of a civil rights conspiracy, the complaint must specifically set forth: (1) the conduct that violated the plaintiffs rights; (2) the time and the place of the conduct; and (3) the identity of the officials responsible for the conduct. <em>See Oatess v. Sobolevitch, </em>914 F.2d 428, 431 n. 8 (3d Cir.1990) (citing <em>Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., </em>838 F.2d 663, 666 (3d Cir.1988)). Furthermore, the allegations of conspiracy must be grounded firmly in facts; they cannot be conclu-sory nor can they hinge on bare suspicions and foundationless speculation. <em>See Young v. Kann, </em>926 F.2d 1396, 1405 n. 16 (3d Cir.1991) (affirming dismissal of conspiracy claims based upon mere suspicion and speculation). Here, Reed made a foundationless allegation of conspiracy without setting forth any facts regarding the conduct, time, or place which constituted the conspiracy. Therefore, Reed\u2019s conspiracy claim did not satisfy the pleading requirements and was properly dismissed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Second, the District Court correctly dismissed Reed\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim against defendants Rackovan, Morris, Varner, Marsh, and Tennis. \u201cAn individual government defendant in a civil rights action must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongdoing; liability cannot be predicated solely on the operation of respondeat superior.\u201d <em>Evancho v. Fisher, </em>423 F.3d 347, 353 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988)) (internal brackets omitted). We agree with the District Court that Reed failed to put forth any facts suggesting that these defendants participated in the allegedly unconstitutional decision to place Reed in a cell with a dangerous cellmate. They therefore cannot be held liable based only on the fact of their employment at SCI-Rockview.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">B. <em>Grant of summary judgment in favor of Harpster and Thompson</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">Our review of a district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment is plenary. <em>Kreimer v. Bureau of Police, </em>958 F.2d 1242, 1250 (3d Cir.1992). Summary judgment may be granted only where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">To establish an Eighth Amendment claim for failure to protect, a plaintiff must show that: (1) \u201che is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm;\u201d and (2) prison officials operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>with \u201cdeliberate indifference to [his] health or safety.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Deliberate indifference may be proven by showing that \u201cthe official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970. Not only must a prison official be \u201caware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists,\u201d but the official \u201cmust also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the only evidence Reed proffered to show that Thompson was aware of a substantial risk from LaCava is a letter LaCava wrote to Thompson in early July 2008 requesting placement in a single cell. In that letter, LaCava states generally that \u201cdanger does exist\u201d in placing him in a double cell. While this may suggest some risk, LaCava also states that he is \u201cnot a ... predator ... [or] troublemaker ... [, n]or do I have a assaultive history \u2014 I choose to conduct myself with dignity, respect and class at all times.\u201d He also explains that he will not refuse another order to be housed in a double cell. Although LaCava had previously expressed his desire to be housed alone, he had not previously engaged in violence at SCI Rockview, and his prison record of misconduct contains only two prior acts of violence elsewhere \u2014 one in 2001 and the other in 2006, 19 months before his assault on Reed. Reed offered only his belief, and no admissible evidence, to support his claim that Harpster was ever made aware of LaCava\u2019s intent to hurt his cell mate. We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence in the record is insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact that either Thompson or Harpster knew of a substantial risk to Reed\u2019s safety and acted with deliberate indifference to that risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Accordingly, this appeal presents us with no substantial question, and we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3rd Cir. LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">. To the extent the District Court did not dispose of Reed\u2019s conspiracy claim against Harpster, we note that this claim is also con-clusory, and we deem it properly dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
