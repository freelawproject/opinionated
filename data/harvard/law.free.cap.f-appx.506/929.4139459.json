Waters, Jr., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, West Palm Beach, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b952-8\">Johnell Coe, Coleman, FL, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b952-10\">Before CARNES, BARKETT and FAY, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b952-11\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">Johnell Coe, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a sentence reduction, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750. The court denied Coe\u2019s motion because Amendment 750 did not lower his guideline range, as his sentence was based on the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-13\">On appeal, Coe argues that the Supreme Court recognized in <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) authorizes district courts to apply Amendment 750 and the reduced statutory penalties of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372, to those sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. Because Amendment <em>750 </em>and the FSA apply retroactively to him, his applicable statutory maximum was reduced, and as a result, his career offender guideline range was also reduced. Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), Coe argues that the district court should have reduced his sentence, pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which Amendment 750 has since amended, was a relevant part of the analytical framework the court relied upon at his initial sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 568, 184 L.Ed.2d 371 (2012). Section 3582(c)(2) provides that a court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence where the defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1). Any reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission and must be based on a retroactively applicable guideline amendment listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(1) &amp; comment, (backg\u2019d). According to \u00a7 1B1.10, a sentence reduction is unauthorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where it does not have the effect of lowering a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>defendant\u2019s \u201capplicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Before the FSA was signed into law on August 3, 2010, distribution of 5 grams or more of crack cocaine triggered the application of a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years\u2019 imprisonment and a maximum sentence of 40 years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(iii) (2009); <em>see United States v. Gomes, </em>621 F.3d 1343, 1346 (11th Cir.2010). The FSA changed the crack-to-powder-cocaine ratio from 100-to-1 to about 18-to-1. <em>Gomes, </em>621 F.3d at 1346. The FSA also amended the sentencing provisions in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1) by raising from 5 grams to 28 grams the amount of crack cocaine necessary to trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum sentence and 40-year maximum sentence. <em>Id. </em>On June 21, 2012, the Supreme Court held in <em>Dorsey </em>that the FSA\u2019s reduced statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums apply to defendants who committed crack cocaine offenses before August 3, 2010, but were sentenced after the date the FSA went into effect. <em>Dorsey, </em>567 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2326.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, made retroactively applicable by Amendment 759, made permanent an amendment revising the crack cocaine quantity tables listed in \u00a7 2D1.1(e). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Reason for Amend.; U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 748, Reason for Amend.; U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 759 (adding parts A and C of Amendment 750 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">A career offender\u2019s offense level is determined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b), rather than \u00a7 2D1.1. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). We have previously held that a career offender is not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where a retroactive guideline amendment reduces his base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1320. In <em>Lawson, </em>we rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman, </em>he was entitled to a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 750, notwithstanding his sentence being based on the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1319-21. In <em>Freeman, </em>the question before the Supreme Court was whether defendants who entered into Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreements were eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief. 564 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2690. We determined that neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Sotoma-yor\u2019s concurrence in <em>Freeman </em>addressed defendants who were assigned a base offense level under one guideline section, but who were ultimately assigned a total offense level and guideline range under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Thus, <em>Freeman </em>did not overrule our prior holding that a career offender was not entitled to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief where his guideline range was not lowered by a retroactive amendment. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we held that Lawson, a career offender, was not entitled to relief based on Amendment 750 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), as his guideline range based on \u00a7 4B1.1 was not reduced by Amendment 750. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>we affirmed the denial of Berry\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, filed pursuant to Amendment 750, because Amendment 750 had no effect on Berry\u2019s initial guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment, which was based on his status as a career offender, or his guideline sentence of life imprisonment, which applied because of his two prior felony drug convictions. 701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). In addition, we rejected Berry\u2019s argument that he was eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction under the FSA, determining that the FSA was not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but rather a statutory change by Congress. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the FSA could not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction in Berry\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>Even as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>suming that Berry could bring his FSA claim in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we continued, his claim still failed because he was convicted and sentenced in 2002, and, as the other circuits that had addressed the issue had concluded, there was no evidence that Congress intended the FSA to apply to defendants who had been sentenced before the August 3, 2010, date of the FSA\u2019s enactment. <em>Id. Dorsey </em>did not suggest that the FSA\u2019s new statutory penalties should apply to defendants who were sentenced before the FSA\u2019s effective date. <em>See id. </em>at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Because Coe\u2019s guideline sentence was based on the career offender provision in \u00a7 4B1.1, not on the drug quantity tables in \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 750 had no effect on Coe\u2019s guideline sentence. Contrary to Coe\u2019s assertion, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman </em>does not provide that a district court may grant a sentence reduction where a defendant\u2019s guideline range was not lowered by a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321. Furthermore, Coe was ineligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction based on the FSA because the FSA is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission, but instead a statutory change by Congress. <em>See Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. In any event, because Coe was convicted and sentenced prior to the effective date of the FSA, the FSA did not apply to Coe and he could not benefit from the FSA\u2019s lower statutory penalties. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the district court did not have the authority to reduce Coe\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and properly denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
