Because the bankruptcy court committed no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-14\">Elliott filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on August 11, 2011. At the confirmation hearing for Elliott\u2019s bankruptcy plan on November 3, 2011, the bankruptcy court heard testimony from Elliott and denied confirmation, citing numerous misrepresentations in the forms contained in his bankruptcy petition. On November 16, 2011, the bankruptcy court sua sponte entered an order to appear and show cause why the case should not be dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 case under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307. On November 28, 2011, Elliott filed a motion to dismiss his case under \u00a7 1307(b), which the bankruptcy court denied the following day. At the hearing on its order to show cause on January 12, 2012, the bankruptcy court found that Elliott had filed his petition in bad faith and converted his case. Elliott subsequently appealed to the district court, which affirmed. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-15\">\u201cWe apply the same standard of review to the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law as applied by the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings, including its finding of bad faith,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, we review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>deny a motion to dismiss a Chapter 13 case and to convert the case into a Chapter 7 case for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Elliott first briefly argues that our precedent establishing the bad-faith exception to \u00a7 1307(b), <em>Jacobsen v. Moser (In re Jacobsen)</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>does not govern this case. On its face, \u00a7 1307(b) of the Code gives the debtor an unqualified right to dismiss his bankruptcy case at any time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, in <em>Jacobsen, </em>this circuit held that \u201ca bankruptcy court has the discretion to grant a pending motion to convert for cause under \u00a7 1307(c) where the debtor has acted in bad faith or abused the bankruptcy process and requested dismissal under \u00a7 1307(b).\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In so doing, we \u201cdecline[d] to read \u00a7 1307(b) as an \u2018escape hatch\u2019 from which to escape a conversion motion filed under \u00a7 1307(c).\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our holding was a logical extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Massachusetts</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which identified a bad-faith exception in a provision that seemingly created an unqualified right to convert a case from Chapter 7.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-14\">Elliott initially contends that <em>Ja-cobsen </em>does not apply here since no party filed a motion to convert in the bankruptcy court. In making this argument, Elliott fails to recognize that the bankruptcy court on its own motion entered an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed or converted under \u00a7 1307(c). Elliott also asserts that the bankruptcy court was without authority to invoke \u00a7 1307(c) sua sponte. This argument lacks merit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In short, Elliott filed his motion to dismiss only after the bankruptcy court threatened conversion. This case therefore is on all fours with <em>Jacobsen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-15\">Elliott next challenges the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual finding that he acted in bad faith and, by implication, the court\u2019s decision to deny his motion to dismiss and convert his case. In reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of bad faith for clear error, \u201c[o]ur role is not to weigh the evidence ourselves but merely to determine whether the lower court\u2019s account is \u2018plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We will not reverse unless, viewing the record as a whole, we are \u201cleft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cClear error review is \u2018especially rigorous\u2019 when we review a lower court\u2019s assessment of trial testimony, \u2018because the trier of fact has seen and judged the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">After reviewing the record in its entirety, we cannot say that the bankruptcy court\u2019s bad-faith finding was clearly erroneous. In <em>Jacobsen, </em>this court upheld a bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of bad faith when the debtor possessed assets and made transfers that were not disclosed in his schedules and statement of financial affairs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the instant case, Elliott\u2019s testimony in the bankruptcy court revealed that his schedules, statement of financial affairs, and statement of current monthly income contained a large number of similar misrepresentations. In pertinent part, his testimony revealed that these forms (1) misrepresented his own income, (2) misrepresented his marital status, (3) failed to disclose his wife\u2019s income, (4) misrepresented his household size, (5) failed to disclose information regarding his prior business interest, (6) failed to disclose information regarding his current business interest, and (7) failed to disclose that he had an accountant who kept his books and records. Although we are mindful of Elliott\u2019s assertion that these misstatements were innocent mistakes, the bankruptcy court\u2019s finding of bad faith is plausible on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">Given the breadth of Elliott\u2019s misrepresentations, we also hold that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion to dismiss and converting the case to a case under Chapter 7. As Elliott points out, both <em>Mar-rama </em>and <em>Jacobsen </em>suggested that bankruptcy courts may invoke the bad-faith exceptions to \u00a7 706 and \u00a7 1307(b), respectively, only if the debtor\u2019s bad faith is somehow \u201catypical\u201d or \u201cextraordinary.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Elliott\u2019s conduct meets this standard. Indeed, the bankruptcy court found that \u201cthe level of [Elliott\u2019s] deceit here is just virtually unprecedented\u201d and even referred the case to the U.S. Attorney for investigation. Given the evidence before it, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying Elliott\u2019s motion to dismiss and converting his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-2\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1101-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
