He contends that the district court plainly erred when it enhanced his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) based on a finding that his 1999 Texas conviction for delivery of less than one gram of cocaine was a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less. Specifically, he argues that the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) enhancement did not apply because the inclusion of offers to sell in \u00a7 2L1.2\u2019s definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d does not support longer sentences when the prior conviction does not meet the statutory definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B). Fuentes\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Marban-Calderon, </em>631 F.3d 210, 212-13 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 129, 181 L.Ed.2d 50 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Fuentes also contends that the district court plainly erred when it determined that his 1999 Texas conviction for delivery of less than one gram of cocaine qualified as an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Because he did not object to the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 1326(b)(2), we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">As Fuentes contends, his 1999 Texas conviction for delivery of less than one gram of cocaine was not an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and the district court committed error that was clear or obvious when it determined that he was subject to a 20-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment based on that conviction. <em>See United States v. Ibarra-Luna, </em>628 F.3d 712, 715-16 (5th Cir.2010). However, Fuentes has failed to demonstrate that the error affected his substantial rights. His 46-month sentence fell within the properly calculated guidelines range. <em>See Marban-Calderon, </em>631 F.3d at 212-13. The sentence was also below the applicable 10-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(1); Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112(b); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.35(a); <em>United States v. Villegas-Hernandez, </em>468 F.3d 874, 884 (5th Cir.2006) (defining a felony as an offense punishable by more than one year in prison). The record does not indicate that the sentence was influenced by the district court\u2019s incorrect understanding of the statutory maximum sentence or that district court would have been inclined to depart from the 46 to 57-month guidelines range had it known that Fuentes was subject to a 10-year statutory maximum sentence instead of a 20-year statutory maximum sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 369. Therefore, there is no plain error that requires us to vacate Fuentes\u2019s sentence. <em>See id. </em>Consistent with our prior holding in <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>however, Fuentes is entitled to a reformation of the district court\u2019s judgment to reflect the correct offense of conviction and statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>subsection. <em>See id. </em>We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment, but REFORM it to reflect that Fuentes was convicted of illegal reentry after deportation and sentenced under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
