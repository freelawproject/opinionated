Because this appeal does not present a substantial question we will summarily affirm for principally the same reasons as given in the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-23\">In 2006, Smith pleaded guilty to travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct. The United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania sentenced Smith to 120 months in prison and Smith appealed. On February 26, 2008, this Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Smith did not petition the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. Smith is currently imprisoned at Federal Correctional Institute Fort Dix in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-24\">On March 9, 2011, Smith filed a motion to vacate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>In the motion, Smith argued that his trial counsel was ineffective and that he had newly discovered evidence relating to his psychological problems and mental ability. The District Court determined that the motion was untimely because it was filed outside the one-year statute of limitations period, but granted the parties an opportunity to brief whether equitable tolling should be granted. In response, Smith filed a motion for reconsideration that the District Court construed as his brief addressing the timeliness issue. The District Court, after review of Smith\u2019s arguments, dismissed the \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely and declined to issue a certificate of ap-pealability. Smith moved for reconsideration in May 2012, and the District Court, after explaining that Smith essentially reasserted the same arguments as in his previous motion, denied relief in July 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Smith filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus on May 31, 2012, in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In his petition Smith raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and newly discovered evidence relating to his psychological and mental status, similar to those in his \u00a7 2255 motion. The District Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction because Smith failed to show that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 afforded an inadequate or ineffective remedy that would then permit Smith to challenge his conviction and sentence through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Smith appealed and the Clerk alerted the parties that the appeal was being considered for possible summary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). We \u201cexercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of facts.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 173 n. 1 (3d Cir.2005). We may summarily affirm if the appeal presents no substantial question. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">Upon review, we conclude that the District Court properly dismissed Smith\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. Apart from whether Smith\u2019s petition was successive pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a), it is apparent that his claims are not viable under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">A federal prisoner\u2019s challenge to the legality of his conviction and sentence must be raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion, except where the remedy under \u00a7 2255 would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>see In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 249 (3d Cir.1997). This occurs \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent\u201d the petitioner from receiving adequate adjudication of his or her claims. <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). The remedy\u2019s inefficacy, rather than a prisoner\u2019s inability to use it, is determinative. <em>Id. </em>The exception is extremely narrow and applies only in rare circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d at 251-52. The fact that Smith previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied as untimely, and thus faces the strict gatekeeping requirements that apply to second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, does not serve to make \u00a7 2255 inadequate or ineffective. <em>See id. </em>at 251. Moreover, Smith\u2019s assertion that his mental and psychological problems coupled with ineffective assistance of counsel caused him to enter a plea without full understanding of its effects does not present the \u201cunusual circumstance\u201d in which a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See id. </em>(noting that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective where an intervening change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>in substantive law made the crime for which the petitioner was convicted noncriminal).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">In short, Smith did not show that \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d Accordingly, the District Court did not err in dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. For essentially the reasons set forth by the District Court, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Smith\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4: I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
