A magistrate judge directed Fodor to file an amended complaint, instructing him to use the \u201cEmployment Discrimination Complaint Form.\u201d The judge also advised him \u201cthat individual defendants are not amendable to private suit and personal liability\u201d under his claims and informed him that the \u201conly proper defendant is plaintiffs former employer.\u201d Fodor then filed an amended complaint which named DTsernia as the \u201cDefendant Employer\u201d and Eastern Shipbuilding Group as \u201cDefendant\u2019s business.\u201d In its statement of facts section, the complaint also described DTsernia as \u201cpresident owner of Eastern Shipbuilding.\u201d Fodor later filed a discovery request demanding that \u201cDefendant Brian DTser-nia owner Eastern Shipbuilding Group\u201d provide the court with Fodor\u2019s original employment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">DTsernia filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that neither Title VII nor the ADA provides for individual liability against owners of corporations. The district court dismissed Fodor\u2019s amended complaint with prejudice. This is Fodor\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Albra v. Advan, Inc., </em>490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). We have held that individual employees are not subject to liability under either Title VII or the ADA. <em>See Dearth v. Collins, </em>441 F.3d 931, 933 (11th Cir.2006) (Title VII); <em>Albra, </em>490 F.3d at 830 (the ADA). Therefore, Fodor cannot state a claim against DTsernia under either Title VII or the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Fodor\u2019s complaint, however, must be liberally construed because he is a <em>pro se </em>litigant. <em>Albra, </em>490 F.3d at 829; <em>see also S.E.C. v. Elliott, </em>953 F.2d 1560, 1583 (11th Cir.1992) (noting that the court should use \u201ccommon sense\u201d in interpreting <em>pro se </em>pleadings). The \u201cEmployment Discrimination Complaint Form\u201d that Fodor was instructed to fill out includes two blanks in the \u201cFactual Background\u201d section, one for \u201cDefendant Employer\u201d and one for \u201cDefendant\u2019s business.\u201d Fodor named Eastern Shipbuilding Group as \u201cDefendant\u2019s business.\u201d He argued in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report that he believed that he named Eastern Shipbuilding Group as the defendant in that complaint. The district court\u2019s order did not address Fodor\u2019s argument and did not determine whether his complaint, liberally construed, could be read to name Eastern Shipbuilding Group as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">The district court granted the motion to dismiss solely on the basis that Brian DTs-ernia was not a proper defendant. Construing the complaint liberally, however, Fodor named Eastern Shipbuilding Group as a defendant. The district court therefore erred by dismissing Fodor\u2019s entire complaint with prejudice. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment to the extent that it dismissed Fodor\u2019s Title VII and ADA claims against DTsernia, but we reverse the part of the district court\u2019s judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>dismissing Fodor\u2019s Title VII and ADA claims against Eastern Shipbuilding Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">AFFIRMED in part; REVERSED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
