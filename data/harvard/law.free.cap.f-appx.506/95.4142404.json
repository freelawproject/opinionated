Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Because we primarily write for the parties, we need only recite the facts necessary for our discussion. After a disciplinary hearing, Ancrum was found guilty of a violation of Code 113 \u2014 Possession of Any Narcotics Not Prescribed for the Individual by Medical Staff. The Disciplinary Hearing Officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) sanctioned Anc-rum with the loss of forty days of good conduct time; sixty days of disciplinary segregation; loss of visiting privileges for four years followed by four years of restricted visiting; loss of commissary privileges for two years; impound of personal property for two years; and loss of telephone and email privileges for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">After exhausting his administrative remedies, Ancrum filed his \u00a7 2241 petition on July 27, 2011. In his petition, Ancrum claims that the DHO violated his procedural due process rights by not discussing in his report the reliability of confidential inmate witness statements used to find him guilty of the violation. On May 14, 2012, a Magistrate Judge issued a Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d), recommending that Ancrum\u2019s petition be dismissed. On July 16, 2012, the District Court adopted the R <em>&amp; </em>R and dismissed Ancrum\u2019s petition. Specifically, the District Court noted that Ancrum received the minimum due process required when a DHO relies upon testimony from confidential informants. Ancrum then timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a), and \u201cexercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donald v. Johns, </em>402 F.3d 172, 173 n. 1 (3d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Friedland, </em>83 F.3d 1531, 1542 (3d Cir.1996) (\u201cOur review of the district court\u2019s order denying ... relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 is plenary.\u201d). Section 2241 is the appropriate vehicle for constitutional claims when a prison disciplinary proceeding results in the loss of good time credits, <em>Queen v. Miner, </em>530 F.3d 253, 254 n. 2 (3d Cir.2008) (per curiam), and a certificate of appealability is not required to appeal the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, <em>Burkey v. Marberry, </em>556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir.2009). We may summarily affirm on any basis supported by the record. <em>Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">Federal prisoners have a liberty interest in statutory good time credits. <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1); <em>Vega v. United States, </em>493 F.3d 310, 317 n. 4 (3d Cir.2007). Accordingly, when a prisoner\u2019s disciplinary hearing may result in a loss of good time credits, \u201cthe inmate must receive: (1) advance written notice of the disciplinary charges; (2) an opportunity ... to call witnesses and present documentary evidence in his defense; and (3) a written statement by the factfinder of the evidence relied on and the reasons for the disciplinary action.\u201d <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">When a disciplinary decision relies upon statements from confidential informants, minimum due process requires the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-10\">\u201c(1) (T)he record must contain some underlying factual information from which the (tribunal) can reasonably conclude that the informant was credible or his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>information reliable; (2) the record must contain the informant\u2019s statement (written or as reported) in language that is factual rather than conclusionary and must establish by its specificity that the informant spoke with personal knowledge of the matters contained in such statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><em>Helms v. Hewitt, </em>655 F.2d 487, 502 (3d Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Gomes v. Travisono, </em>510 F.2d 537, 540 (1st Cir.1974)), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Hewitt v. Helms, </em>459 U.S. 460, 103 S.Ct. 864, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). \u201cThe record\u201d contains both the evidence presented during the disciplinary hearing and the investigative report. <em>Henderson v. Carlson, </em>812 F.2d 874, 879 (3d Cir.1987). However, \u201ca prison disciplinary committee need not reveal at a disciplinary hearing evidence bearing on the reliability of confidential informants if prison officials believe that such evidence is capable of revealing the identity of the informants and if the evidence is made available to the court for <em>in camera </em>review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 880.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The District Court properly dismissed Ancrum\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. After our <em>in camera </em>review of the record, particularly the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (\u201cBOP\u201d) investigative report, we conclude that the first prong of <em>Helms </em>was met. Corroboration of witness testimony is one indicia of reliability, and three confidential inmate informants presented corroborating information regarding Anerum\u2019s prior heroin sales in prison. <em>See Mendoza v. Miller, </em>779 F.2d 1287, 1293 (7th Cir.1985) (noting that corroborating testimony can establish the reliability of confidential informant testimony).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, the BOP investigative report meets the second prong of <em>Helms. </em>Each confidential informant provided information regarding personal knowledge of Ancrum\u2019s distribution of heroin within USP Canaan. Specifically, the informants described personal purchases of heroin from Ancrum and details regarding Ancrum\u2019s methods of receiving and distributing the heroin. Although we agree with the District Court that a better practice would have been for the DHO to include a finding of reliability in his decision, we are confident that Ancrum received the minimum due process required under <em>Helms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">Nevertheless, Ancrum argues that he is entitled to relief because the Magistrate Judge explicitly stated that the DHO had not complied with 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.8(f)(6). 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.8(f)(6) states that the \u201cDHO may consider evidence provided by a confidential informant (Cl) that the DHO finds reliable.\u201d BOP Program Statement 5270.08 states that when a DHO bases a disciplinary decision on information gathered from confidential informants, the \u201cDHO shall document, ordinarily in the hearing report, the finding as to the reliability of each confidential informant relied on and the factual basis for that finding.\u201d While the BOP is required to follow its own regulations, <em>see Wilson v. U.S. Parole Com\u2019n, </em>193 F.3d 195, 200 (3d Cir.1999), such error is harmless because our analysis above assures us that Ancrum received the minimum due process required under <em>Helms </em>for using <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>information gathered from confidential informants, <em>see Elkin v. Fauver, </em>969 F.2d 48, 53 (3d Cir.1992) (noting that harmless error analysis applies to cases concerning prison disciplinary proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">For the foregoing reasons, no substantial question is presented and we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">. <em>Mendoza </em>noted that the reliability of confidential informants can also be established by:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">(1) the oath of the investigating officer as to the truth of his report containing confidential information and his appearance before the disciplinary committee ...; (3) a statement on the record by the chairman of the disciplinary committee that he had firsthand knowledge of the sources of information and considered them reliable on the basis of their past record of credibility ...; or (4) <em>in camera </em>review of material documenting the investigator\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the confidential informant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">779 F.2d at 1293 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
