Alonzo, </em>485 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding the application of the presumption of reasonableness to sentences within a properly calculated Guidelines range). Furthermore, Verdugo concedes that his failure to object to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in the district court results in plain error review. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">This court has rejected Verdugo\u2019s arguments that sentences determined under section 2L1.2 of the Guidelines are unreasonable because section 2L1.2 is not empirically grounded and because prior convictions may count toward both offense-level and criminal-history-category ealcula-tions. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). With regard to Verdugo\u2019s contention that the district court failed to account sufficiently for his particular circumstances in its 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, he brought these circumstances to the attention of the district court, and this court recognizes that \u201cthe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a) with respect to a particular defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Whether we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Verdugo has shown no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
