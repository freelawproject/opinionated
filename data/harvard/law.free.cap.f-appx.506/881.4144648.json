Further, Oshunrinde argues his Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer was not a crime involving moral turpitude per 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). This exhaustion requirement divests our Court of jurisdiction to review a claim that was not presented to the BIA, even when the BIA addressed the underlying issue <em>sua sponte. See Amayu-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Oshunrinde failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to the IJ\u2019s denials of his adjustment of status application, his waiver of inadmissibility application, his request for voluntary departure, and his motion for a continuance. Oshun-rinde\u2019s counseled brief to the BIA focused solely on whether his Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer was a crime involving moral turpitude and stated there were no other issues properly before the BIA. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to entertain these claims for relief and thereby grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition with respect to these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-14\">Oshunrinde contends his conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer was not a crime involving moral turpitude per 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae. Oshunrinde notes that under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, aliens convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude are inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-15\">The IJ determined Oshunrinde\u2019s Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer was a crime involving moral turpitude under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae. Although Oshunrinde disputed the IJ\u2019s decision with respect to this issue in his brief to the BIA, the BIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>did not address whether Oshunrinde\u2019s Florida conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude, nor did it summarily affirm the IJ\u2019s decision. The BIA only determined Oshunrinde was removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(C)(i) for having failed to maintain his nonimmigrant status.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">When the BIA has not made findings of fact or has not applied the law to those facts, the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201cappellate courts should remand to allow the [BIA] to make such determinations in the first instance.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1236 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). This allows the agency to \u201cbring its expertise to bear upon the matter,\u201d to \u201cevaluate the evidence,\u201d and to \u201cmake an initial determination,\u201d which, \u201cthrough informed discussion and analysis, [can] help a court later determine whether its decision exceeds the leeway that the law provides.\u201d <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 355-56, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Here, the BIA must apply its expertise to clarify whether its failure to decide whether Oshunrinde was removable for having committed a crime involving moral turpitude will have any material, practical, or legal impact on his future ability to reenter the United States. Because the BIA did not decide whether Oshunrinde\u2019s Florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer was a crime involving moral turpitude, we remand the case so that the BIA can address that issue, if indeed there is a sound reason to reach the issue on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART; GOVERNMENT\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS GRANTED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-10\">. We previously granted in part the Government's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction to the extent Oshunrinde challenged his removability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(l)(C)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
