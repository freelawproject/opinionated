He was deemed a career offender and sentenced to 210 months in prison, above the advisory maximum of 188 months. The court characterized the sentence as a variance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or a departure based on \u00a7 4A1.3 of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-24\">Fobbs first contends that his Texas conviction for delivery of a controlled substance does not support his career offender enhancement because is not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as defined by the Guidelines. Although the. Texas offense may not be a controlled substance offense in some cases because it penalizes an offer to sell, Fobbs\u2019s indictment charged that he constructively transferred a controlled substance. Constructive transfer requires a greater showing of culpability than offering to sell. <em>See Stewart v. State, </em>718 S.W.2d 286, 288 (Tex.Crim.App.1986). Accordingly, constructive transfer is within the relevant definition of a controlled substance of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>fense. <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>255 Fed. Appx. 849, 851 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">In addition, Fobbs contends that his pri- or Texas offense of robbery by threats was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d because it does not have \u201cas an element the use or threatened use of physical force.\u201d A conviction under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 29.02(a)(2), which includes robbery by threats, is the enumerated offense of robbery under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Santiesteban-Hernandez, </em>469 F.3d 376, 378-81 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see United States v. Flores-Vasquez, </em>641 F.3d 667, 671 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2011). We therefore need not consider whether the offense presents a risk of physical injury or has force as an element. <em>See United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 317-18 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We review for plain error Fobbs\u2019s assertions that the district court considered improper factors in choosing his sentence. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Fobbs\u2019s unscored convictions and prior lenient sentences were proper grounds for his sentence above the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347-48 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>358 F.3d 315, 328-29 (5th Cir.2004); \u00a7 3553(a)(1) &amp; (2). Similarly, Fobbs does not show that the court\u2019s mention of his total number of adult convictions in the Statement of Reasons for the sentence was an impermissible double-counting of the convictions used to establish career offender status. <em>See United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that double-counting is prohibited only if expressly forbidden).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The district court did not commit any error by considering two Texas offenses for which Fobbs entered pleas in bar. By entering pleas in bar under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 12.45, Fobbs admitted his guilt of the offenses, even though he was not adjudged guilty. <em>See Hilburn v. State, </em>946 S.W.2d 885, 886 (Tex.App.1997). The admitted conduct was properly considered by the district court. <em>See United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 807 (5th Cir.2008); \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Fobbs argues that the 210-month sentence was too long. We defer to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify the extent of the upward variance. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Fobbs\u2019s arguments amount to a mere disagreement with the district court and do not warrant reversal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
