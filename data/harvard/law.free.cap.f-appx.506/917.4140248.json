Briefly stated, Liner argues that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, (2) the district court erred in failing to impose a sanction for an alleged discovery violation by the government, and (3) the imposition of a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment violates the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-21\">Sufficient evidence allowed the jury reasonably to infer that Liner used a facility \u2014 phone and internet \u2014 of interstate commerce and took a substantial step (including meeting with an intermediary and paying $100) toward the commission of the offense: no sex act was required. There was no discovery violation by the government: the pertinent information was not a criminal record and was not intended to be used by the government at trial; the district court did not abuse its discretion on sanctions. The ten-year mandatory minimum sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment: sexual abuse of children is a serious societal problem. For background, see <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1343-45 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
