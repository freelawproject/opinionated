He argues that the admission, during his state court trial, of statements given by a co-conspirator to a confidential informant years after the completion of the conspiracy violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. He argues that his co-conspirator\u2019s statements introduced at his trial in 1995 violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause because they were testimonial in the light of recent Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-13\">The Sixth Amendment protects a criminal defendant\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him. U.S. Const, amend. VI. The Supreme Court explained in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), that the Sixth Amendment prohibits the introduction of out-of-court <em>testimonial </em>statements unless the declarant is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declar-ant. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. The <em>Crawford </em>opinion cited <em>Bourja-ily </em>as an example of a case where non-testimonial statements were properly admitted. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 124 S.Ct. at 1368. In <em>Bourjaily, </em>the Supreme Court determined that a co-conspirator\u2019s unwitting statements to an undercover agent were admissible at trial even though the defendant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the co-conspirator. <em>Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 181-84, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2782-83, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">In <em>United States v. Underwood, </em>446 F.3d 1340 (11th Cir.2006), we wrote that a statement is testimonial if it was made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. <em>Id. </em>at 1347. Finding that a declarant made statements to a confidential informant without the reasonable belief \u201cthat his statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u201d we concluded that the statements by the co-conspirator to the confidential informant were not testimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 1347-1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">Applying <em>Crawford </em>and conducting a <em>de novo </em>review,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we reach the same conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>sion as the district court. The pertinent statements in this case \u2014 whether or not they met Georgia\u2019s hearsay exception\u2014 were not testimonial. Accordingly, they were admissible under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b974-11\"> The standard of review (that is, whether deference should be given to the pertinent state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>decision) to be applied in this case might be debatable. So, we use a <em>de novo </em>standard to give Petitioner \u2014 for discussion sake \u2014 his best position. A court can reject a petition using <em>de novo </em>review because any such claim must also fail under deferential review. <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 2265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010); <em>Allen v. Sec'y, Fla. Dep't of Corr., </em>611 F.3d 740, 753 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
