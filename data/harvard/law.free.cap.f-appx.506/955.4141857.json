On appeal, Sihwail argues that: (1) the district court procedurally erred in applying the grouping rules of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4 to determine a combined offense level for his three counts of bank robbery, imposing 115-month within-guidelines sentences for each count, and then also ordering that one of the sentences be served consecutively to the other two sentences; and (2) the 230-month total sentence, which is double the high end of the guideline range of 92 to 115 months, is substantively unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">We review factual findings for clear error, and review application of the Sentene-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>ing Guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. McGuinness, </em>451 F.3d 1302, 1304 (11th Cir.2006). We review the imposition of consecutive terms of imprisonment for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Covington, </em>565 F.3d 1336, 1346 (11th Cir.2009). We review the ultimate sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we typically perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[W]e will not second guess the weight (or lack thereof) that the [district court] accorded to a given factor ... as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation, alteration and emphasis omitted), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2962, 180 L.Ed.2d 245 (2011). We will \u201cvacate the sentence if, but only if, we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">A district court is not required \u201cto state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). An acknowledgment that the court considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is adequate. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">When reviewing a sentence outside the guidelines range, we may take into account the degree of variance from the guidelines range, but extraordinary circumstances are not required to justify a sentence outside the guidelines range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. 586. However, the district court should explain why the variance is appropriate in a particular case and the \u201cjustification for the variance must be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1186-87 (quotation omitted). We \u201cmay not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines is unreasonable and must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1187 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">First, we find no merit to Sihwail\u2019s claim that the district court procedurally erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>in imposing his sentence. The Sentencing Guidelines set forth a procedure for determining the offense level when a defendant is charged with multiple counts in the grouping rules of Chapter 3. U.S.S.G. Ch.3, Pt.D, intro, comment. As described in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.1, when a defendant has been convicted of more than one count, the court: (1) groups the counts into \u201cGroups of Closely Related Counts (\u2018Groups\u2019)\u201d by applying \u00a7 3D1.2; (2) determines the offense level applicable to each Group by applying \u00a7 3D1.3; and (3) applies \u00a7 3D1.4 to determine the combined offense level applicable to all Groups. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Dl.l(a). Section 3D1.2 provides that, for the purpose of determining the applicable sentence of a defendant convicted of more than one count, \u201c[a]ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single Group.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2. Section 3D1.4 provides a procedure for determining the combined offense level by (1) counting the Group with the highest offense level as one Unit, (2) either disregarding, counting as one Unit, or counting as a one half Unit all the other Groups, depending on how their offense levels compare to the Group with the highest offense level; and then (3) increasing the highest offense level a designated amount based on the total number of units. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4(a)-(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The Sentencing Reform Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-5\">If multiple terms of imprisonment are imposed on a defendant at the same time, ... the terms may run concurrently or consecutively.... Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively. Multiple terms of imprisonment imposed at different times run consecutively unless the court orders that the terms are to run concurrently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). Under \u00a7 3584(b), a district court may impose a consecutive sentence \u201cprovided that it first considers the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Covington, </em>565 F.3d at 1346-47; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b). Once the court has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, \u201cthe only limitation on running sentences consecutively is that the resulting total sentence must be reasonable,\u201d and the defendant bears the burden of showing that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>Covington, </em>565 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">In this case, Sihwail has not demonstrated that the district court erred in applying the grouping rules to his convictions, or that it abused its discretion in ordering that one of the terms of imprisonment be served consecutively. For starters, Sihwail does not argue that the court erred in its grouping calculations under \u00a7 3D1.4. Rather, he argues that the court could not apply the grouping rules and also order that a sentence be served consecutively. However, he points to no statute or Guidelines provision, nor any case law to support this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">As the record shows, the court properly calculated the combined offense level applicable to all the groups, each consisting of one of the bank robberies for which Sihwail was convicted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.1, 3D1.4. Once the court made those calculations, it had the discretion to order that the sentences imposed run concurrently or consecutively. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a). The record reflects that the court expressly said that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as required by \u00a7 3584(b) prior to imposing a consecutive sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(b). Thus, as long as the sentence imposed was reasonable, as discussed below, Sihwail cannot show that the court abused its discretion. <em>See Covington, </em>565 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Indeed, we are also unpersuaded that Sihwail\u2019s sentence is unreasonable. First, as we\u2019ve noted, the district court expressly said that it had considered and weighed the \u00a7 3558(a) sentencing factors. The record shows that the court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, as well as Sihwail\u2019s history and characteristics, which included a total of five armed bank robberies among other prior theft and burglary convictions. Further, the district court expressly considered Sihwail\u2019s \u201cpattern\u201d of robbery offenses, determined that a \u201clong term of incarceration\u201d was necessary to address his conduct and protect the public, and determined that the guideline range was \u201cinsufficient\u201d to meet these goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">Thus, although the court considered and adopted the guidelines range as advisory, the record reflects that the court sufficiently explained why the variance was appropriate \u2014 specifically, the court expressed concerns for Sihwail\u2019s criminal history and his recidivism for committing armed bank robberies. Based on this record, Sihwail has failed to show that a sentence above the guidelines range but below the statutory maximum sentence of 20 years was an unreasonable response by the court to Sihwail\u2019s history. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (providing a maximum punishment of 20 years\u2019 incarceration for a defendant convicted of bank robbery under \u00a7 2113(a)). Accordingly, we affirm Sih-wail\u2019s 230-month sentence as substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b981-6\">MARTIN, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
