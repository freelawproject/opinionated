Decubas and Federico M. Ferm\u00edn, challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions for conspiracy to distribute prescription drugs wholesale without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331 (t), 333(b)(1)(D), and 353(e)(2)(A). In addition, Ferm\u00edn argues that his sentence for conspiracy violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the court failed to include \u201cknowingly\u201d in the jury instructions for the substantive offense. Finally, Decubas argues that her conspiracy conviction should have been treated as a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-10\">We conclude, first, that the prosecution\u2019s evidence was sufficient to support both appellants\u2019 convictions; second, that the district court\u2019s failure to include \u201cknowingly\u201d in the substantive offense\u2019s jury instructions was not plain error; and finally, that the district court did not err by treating Decubas\u2019s conviction as a felony. The convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ADHb\">In April 2002, Florida drug agents raided the warehouses of Jemco Medical International, Inc. (Jemco), a Broward County business licensed by the state of Florida to distribute prescription drugs wholesale. Jose Castillo, who was charged alongside Decubas and Ferm\u00edn, was Jemco\u2019s owner and operator. Decubas and Ferm\u00edn worked in managerial positions under Castillo. Inside one of Jemco\u2019s warehouses, agents found three offices \u2014 two with computers, and one with boxes of pharmaceuticals, lighter fluid, sponges,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> outserts,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and handwritten lists of pharmaceuticals. In an adjoining, non-air-conditioned<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> space, agents found hundreds of bottles of medicine valued at approximately $3.5 million.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Several bottles were marked with a handwritten \u201cM,\u201d which indicated that Florida\u2019s Medicaid program had paid for the drugs. Jemco did not have a license to store prescription drugs in that specific warehouse, and Castillo could not provide the agents with any paperwork showing the drugs\u2019 purchase. Jemco subsequently lost its license to distribute wholesale prescription drugs, and closed its doors. Ferm\u00edn and Decubas were aware that Jemco had been raided by drug agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>Within a few weeks, Castillo opened Kirby Health Care Distributors (Kirby), and Meridian Health Care Distributors (Meridian) at an office in Weston, Florida. Decu-bas was the nominal owner of Meridian, but both she and Ferm\u00edn apparently worked under Castillo\u2019s supervision. Despite being the undisputed boss, Castillo made sure that his now-tainted name did not appear on the corporate records of either Kirby or Meridian. Gloria Gutierrez, a former Jemco receptionist who followed Castillo to the Kirby/Meridian office, testified that Ferm\u00edn and Decubas made it explicitly clear to the entire workforce that Castillo was not supposed to be in the Weston office, and that under no circumstance was his involvement in the office to be disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"A4E\">Kirby and Meridian were in the business of soliciting orders for medicine from pharmacies. When Kirby or Meridian made a sale, the order would be transmitted to Pharmacy Distributors Group (PDG), a Castillo-run company in Boerne, Texas. PDG, a licensed pharmacy distributor, fulfilled the Kirby/Meridian sales by shipping the drugs from Boerne to the pharmacies. PDG\u2019s inventory of drugs arrived with an invoice either inside the box, or faxed from Meridian/Kirby. The invoices often indicated that the drugs had been purchased from Island Pharmaceuticals, a sham Puerto Rican distributor. The boxes of drugs arrived with a return address for Swift Freight Services (Swift Freight), a purportedly Tennessean company incorporated by Jesus Romero, a south Floridian who is married to Castillo\u2019s niece. Ferm\u00edn and Decubas had offered Romero a monthly payment of $800 for the use of his name on Swift Freight\u2019s books. After Romero agreed, Ferm\u00edn opened a Pak Mailbox for Swift Freight in Tennessee, using a Florida address to do so. Both Ferm\u00edn and Decubas wrote checks to Romero for the use of his name, with the money coming from Castillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">The net effect of Castillo\u2019s new scheme was that drugs shipped from south Florida to Texas appeared to have come from Tennessee. PDG then shipped the drugs to pharmacies nationwide, which in turn made payments to PDG. PDG distributed $13 million in pharmacy payments to ten sham companies by check, all of which were cashed at two check-cashing stores in Miami. Ferm\u00edn and Decubas signed several of PDG\u2019s checks to the sham companies. In other words, it was business as usual for Castillo, albeit with a decidedly more byzantine paper trail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">In September 2004, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) subpoenaed PDG\u2019s records to ascertain its suppliers and customers. PDG provided the FDA with a list of suppliers and copies of invoices. The \u201csupplier\u201d owners unanimously testified that they had never sold drugs to PDG, and that the invoices were fake. During a raid at the Kirby/Meridian office, FDA agents found copies of the fake invoices on Fermin\u2019s computer. And, in keeping with Jemco\u2019s protocol, the Kirby/Meridian office was well-stocked with \u201cM\u201d-marked bottles, bottles with lighter-fluid residue, and bottles with faded lot numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">During the FDA\u2019s raid of the Kirby/Meridian office, Decubas stated that there were no drugs at the office whatsoever, only medical and surgical supplies. She stated that Kirby/Meridian was not involved in the pharmaceutical business. Decubas also told an FDA agent that she was not sure how documents relating to pharmaceutical sales and invoices had gotten into her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">Ferm\u00edn and Decubas were charged with multiple counts, among them conspiracy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>distribute prescription drugs wholesale without a license, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 338(b)(1)(D), 353(e)(2)(A), and 331 (t) (Count V); and the unlicensed wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(b)(1)(D), 353(e)(2)(A), 331(t), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Counts VI-VIII). The jury found Ferm\u00edn and Decubas guilty of conspiracy to distribute drugs without a license. With regard to Counts VI-VIII, Decubas was found not guilty, and the jury failed to reach a verdict for Ferm\u00edn. Both parties moved for an acquittal of their conspiracy convictions, which the district court denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Av_\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for acquittal based on sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Schier, </em>438 F.3d 1104, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). The jury\u2019s verdict <em>\u201cmust </em>be sustained if there is substantial evidence to support it.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Siegelman, </em>640 F.3d 1159, 1164-65 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (emphasis added) (citing <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 469, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2711, 183 L.Ed.2d 84 (2012). Put another way, we will only reverse a verdict if the record demonstrates a lack of evidence from which a jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>405 F.3d 1260, 1269 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The Supreme Court has warned the circuit courts that \u201cappellate reversal on grounds of insufficient evidence ... will be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>Burks v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 17, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2150, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">To prove that Ferm\u00edn and Decubas participated in a conspiracy, the prosecution needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, \u201ceven if only by circumstantial evidence, that a conspiracy existed\u201d and that Ferm\u00edn and Decubas \u201cknowingly and voluntarily joined the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>405 F.3d at 1269. The prosecution need not prove that a defendant \u201cknew all of the detail or participated in every aspect of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270. Instead, the prosecution must prove that the defendants \u201cknew the essential nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">We have consistently held that, owing to the crime\u2019s predominantly mental composition, a defendant\u2019s conscious participation in the scheme may be proven by circumstantial evidence. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>389 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.2004)). And while not controlling, \u201cpresence and association are material and probative factors that a jury may consider in reaching its verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Lluesma, </em>45 F.3d 408, 410 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The essential nature of this conspiracy was for Ferm\u00edn and Decubas \u201cto unlawfully enrich themselves by distributing prescription drugs wholesale from the State of Florida to places outside the State of Florida, without being licensed by the State of Florida.\u201d Thus, the central question of this appeal is whether the prosecution\u2019s circumstantial evidence was so deficient that a jury could not have inferred that Ferm\u00edn and Decubas knew that Castillo employed them to distribute prescription drugs from Florida without a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">We begin with the circumstantial evidence that was mutual to Ferm\u00edn and Decubas: (1) both Ferm\u00edn and Decubas were aware the Florida drug agents had raided Jemco; (2) both continued to work for Castillo at Kirby/Meridian shortly after Jemco\u2019s closing; (3) both told Kirby/Meridian employees not to disclose Castillo\u2019s involvement in Kirby/Meridian; and finally, (4) both paid Romero to incorporate Swift Freight in Tennessee, which allowed Castillo to ship prescription drugs to Texas from Florida with a Tennessee return address. Evidence at trial also showed that Ferm\u00edn had fake invoices on his Kirby/Meridian computer, that Decubas told FDA agents that Kirby/Meridian only sold medical and surgical supplies, and that Decubas acted bewildered by the pharmaceutical sales and invoices in her office.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">In order to have knowledge of the conspiracy\u2019s essential nature, Ferm\u00edn and De-cubas had to know that Castillo was shipping prescription drugs out of Florida without a license. Based upon the foregoing evidence, we conclude that a jury could infer such knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury could reasonably infer that Ferm\u00edn and Decubas knew that Castillo\u2019s license had been revoked following the Jemco raid. This inference is bolstered by the fact that Ferm\u00edn and Decu-bas actively concealed Castillo\u2019s involvement at Kirby/Meridian. Finally, the jury could infer from Swift Freight\u2019s incorporation, the fake invoices on Fermin\u2019s computer, and Decubas\u2019s unconvincing explanation of the pharmaceutical documents in her office that Ferm\u00edn and Decubas were aware that Castillo was shipping prescription drugs from Florida. Put succinctly, the jury could reasonably conclude that Ferm\u00edn and Decubas knowingly participated in acts \u2014 such as paying off Romero to incorporate Swift Freight \u2014 that would further the conspiracy\u2019s purpose, i.e., to sell without a license prescription drugs. We find readily distinguishable the cases cited by Ferm\u00edn and Decubas, beginning with <em>Ingram v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 672, 79 S.Ct. 1314, 3 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-9\">In <em>Ingram, </em>the Supreme Court found the prosecution\u2019s evidence for conspiracy to evade taxes insufficient with regard to two lottery employees who allegedly helped to keep the lottery secret from authorities. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 79 S.Ct. at 1320. The employees themselves had not conspired to evade taxes; instead, it was the owners of the lottery who had done so. The employees\u2019 actions were almost certainly explained by the fact that the lottery was illegal under state law, and evidence that they \u201cmight have wanted the taxes to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>be evaded if they had known of them, and that they engaged in conduct which could have been in furtherance of a plan to evade the taxes if they had known of them, [was] not evidence that they did know of them.\u201d <em>Id. Ingram </em>stands for the proposition that \u201ccharges of conspiracy are not to be made out by piling inference upon inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, unlike <em>Ingram, </em>the jury did not have to make enormous inferential steps, but instead inferential tiptoes. Fermin and Decubas were associated with Castillo for years, during Jemco\u2019s raid, after Jemco shuttered, and throughout their stints at Kirby/Meridian, all the while telling Kirby/Meridian employees to keep Castillo\u2019s involvement in the dark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">Fermin\u2019s citation to <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>749 F.2d 1541 (11th Cir.1985), is similarly unconvincing. In <em>Kelly, </em>we found that insufficient evidence supported the defendant\u2019s conviction for drug smuggling. <em>Id. </em>at 1548. In that case, we held that the defendant\u2019s inspection of a drug-smuggling boat\u2019s seaworthiness, along with his presence at a meeting of co-conspirators, was insufficient to demonstrate knowledge. <em>Id. </em>It was unreasonable for the jury to infer that the defendant knew the boat would be used for drug smuggling merely by his inspection of the boat and his acquaintance with the co-conspirators. <em>Id. </em>at 1548-49. Were it the case now that the prosecution had presented only \u201cfacially innocent act[s]\u201d by Fermin and Decubas, we would be inclined to agree with Fer-min. <em>United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1558 (11th Cir.1994). However, Fermin had fake invoices on his computer, and Decubas misrepresented the truth to FDA agents, neither of which in our view is a \u201cfacially innocent act\u201d like a boat inspection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Finally, Decubas points to our decision in <em>United States v. Lluesma, </em>45 F.3d 408 (11th Cir.1995). In <em>Lluesma, </em>Cruz and Lluesma challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions for conspiracy to export stolen construction vehicles. <em>Id. </em>at 409. We rejected Llues-ma\u2019s sufficiency challenge because the government\u2019s circumstantial evidence \u2014 such as a co-conspirator\u2019s \u25a0 testimony about Lluesma\u2019s state of mind \u2014 sufficiently supported the jury\u2019s determination that Llues-ma knew that the vehicles were destined for export. <em>Id. </em>at 410. Lluesma had also been observed riding around the area in a stolen car with a \u201cpiece of bumper sticker covering] a punched out rear door lock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. Contrarily, we reversed Cruz\u2019s conviction because the prosecution\u2019s circumstantial evidence demonstrated that Cruz, an unemployed person, merely performed the occasional odd job for the co-conspirators. <em>Id. </em>at 411. Cruz\u2019s \u201codd jobs\u201d included removing the roof of a soon-to-be-exported John Deere tractor and placing a container onto a trailer. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">We find it obvious that Fermin\u2019s and Decubas\u2019s roles in the conspiracy are patently unlike Cruz\u2019s in <em>Lluesma. </em>Fermin and Decubas had been Castillo\u2019s managers for years, soliciting sales for PDG and engineering a sham Tennessee corporation to mask the drugs\u2019 true origin. They certainly did more than the occasional odd job. Fermin and Decubas are right to suggest that presence alone may not establish knowledge unless \u201cit would be unreasonable for anyone other than a knowledgeable participant to be present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410. But Fermin and Decubas were not \u201cmerely\u201d present at Kirby/Meridian. To reiterate, fake invoices were found on Fer-min\u2019s computer, and Decubas told the FDA agents that Kirby/Meridian was not engaged in the pharmaceutical business. Moreover, both conspirators concealed Castillo\u2019s involvement. Substantial evidence, independent of their presence, supported the jury\u2019s conclusion that Fermin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>and Decubas had knowledge of the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">Having dispensed with Fermin and De-cubas\u2019s sufficiency argument, we turn to the remaining two issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">B. Fermin\u2019s Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">Even though Fermin was convicted of conspiracy, he argues that his conviction must be reversed because of an error in a jury instruction for a different count: the substantive offense. Fermin argues that' because the jury instructions for the underlying offense \u2014 unlicensed wholesale distribution of drugs \u2014 did not contain the word \u201cknowingly,\u201d he was prejudiced. Under <em>Apprendi, </em>\u201cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Because Fermin did not object to the jury instructions at trial, the instructions are reviewed for plain error. <em>Montgomery v. Noga, </em>168 F.3d 1282, 1294 (11th Cir.1999). The error must have been a plainly incorrect statement of law, and it must have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Prather, </em>205 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">We first note that the jury instructions for Fermin\u2019s conspiracy conviction stated: \u201cCount 5 charges that the Defendants knowingly and willfully conspired to distribute prescription drugs wholesale without a license.\u201d The jury was further instructed that the prosecution needed to prove that Fermin and Decubas \u201cknew the unlawful purpose of the plan and willfully joined in it.\u201d Although the substantive offense\u2019s instructions did not contain the word \u201cknowingly,\u201d we can hardly say that <em>that </em>omission engineered a miscarriage of justice when Fermin was convicted of a separate crime, with instructions that adequately explained the requisite <em>mens rea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-8\">C. Decubas\u2019s Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Decubas argues that her conviction should be treated as a misdemeanor because the jury instructions for the conspiracy count did not include an element of fraudulent intent. Without this element, she argues, her sentence violates <em>Appren-di. See </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Because Decubas did not object to the jury instructions at trial, we review them for plain error. <em>See Noga, </em>168 F.3d at 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">Decubas appears to have misconstrued the statutes forming the underlying offenses of her conspiracy conviction. The prosecution alleged that Decubas conspired to violate 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 331(t), 333(b)(1)(D), and 353(e)(2)(A). Section 331 provides an extensive list of prohibited acts; one of those acts, listed in \u00a7 331(t), is the wholesale distribution of drugs without a license in violation of \u00a7 353(e)(2)(A). Section 333(b)(1)(D) states that violators of \u00a7 353(e)(2)(A) \u201cshall be imprisoned for not more than 10 years or fined not more than $250,000, or both.\u201d The phrase \u201cfraudulent intent\u201d is found nowhere in the three statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">Decubas cites <em>United States v. Bradshaw, </em>840 F.2d 871 (11th Cir.1988), where the defendant had been convicted under the general penalty provisions of \u00a7 333(a), which make all \u00a7 331 violations misdemeanors unless they are committed \u201cwith the intent to defraud.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 333(a)(2). That argument might hold water if Decubas had been indicted for conspiring to violate \u00a7 333(a), but she was indicted under \u00a7 333(b), which states: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding </em>[\u00a7 333(a) ], any person who violates section 331(t) of this title by ... knowingly distributing drugs in violation of section 353(e)(2)(A) ... shall be imprisoned for not more than 10 years or fined not more than $250,000, or both.\u201d \u00a7 331(b)(1)(D). The jury instructions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>Decubas\u2019s and Fermin\u2019s conspiracy convictions, as noted above, more than adequately explained the <em>mens rea </em>required for their conspiracy convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">The prosecution\u2019s evidence was more than sufficient to support the appellants\u2019 convictions. In addition, the jury was correctly instructed on the <em>mens rea </em>necessary to convict both appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1009-11\">.

Some commentators have pointed out a possible inconsistency in our circuit\u2019s conspiracy jurisprudence regarding sufficiency challenges. <em>See </em>Julia N. Sarnoff, <em>Federal Criminal Conspiracy, </em>48 Am.Crim. L.Rev. 663, 672-73 (2011). The inconsistency is this: after the government proves the existence of a conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt, must the government prove that the defendant\u2019s connection to the conspiracy was \"slight\u201d or \"substantial\u201d? <em>Compare United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, n. 49 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that this circuit occasionally applies an erroneous \"slight evidence\u201d standard instead of a \"substantial evidence\u201d standard), <em>with Garcia, </em>405 F.3d at 1270 (\u201cOnce the existence of a conspiracy is established, only slight evidence is necessary to connect a particular defendant to the conspiracy.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). We need not resolve this issue today, because we conclude that there is at least substantial evidence connecting Ferm\u00edn and Decubas to the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"A-p\">As an aside, it is probably a distinction without a difference. Regardless of whether the connection is \"slight\u201d or \"substantial,\u201d the evidence will be sufficient so long as the trier of fact <em>could </em>\u2014 among competing alternative conclusions \u2014 find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Baker, </em>432 F.3d at 1231-32; <em>Garcia, </em>405 F.3d at 1269 (\"We must affirm the appellants\u2019 convictions <em>unless, under no reasonable construction of the evidence, </em>could the jury have found the appellants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
