For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">On June 3, 2011, Officer Keith Jensen of the Houston Police Department (\u201cHPD\u201d) observed an unoccupied truck parked within 100 feet of an intersection and blocking a lane of traffic. Officer Jensen parked his patrol car behind the truck and began to run a computer check on the license plate number when Villa approached him and informed him that he owned the truck. Officer Jensen asked Villa if he had any identification, and Villa produced a driver\u2019s license. Although a computer search revealed that the license was suspended, Officer Jensen elected not to issue a citation and instead asked Villa to move his truck into the adjacent parking lot and warned him not to continue driving while his license was suspended. As Officer Jensen was finishing his paperwork, he saw Villa drive away. Officer Jensen then pulled over Villa\u2019s truck and arrested Villa for driving with a suspended license. A search of Villa\u2019s INS file later revealed that Villa had previously been deported for entering the country illegally and was present in the country illegally at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">Villa was charged by indictment with illegal reentry, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Before trial, he moved to suppress evidence that he was in the United States illegally. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied his motion. Villa was found guilty of illegal reentry after a bench trial, and was sentenced to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">Villa appeals his conviction on the basis that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. He contends that evidence of his identity and illegal presence in the United States should have been suppressed because Officer Jensen lacked probable cause to believe that Villa was parked illegally. All of the evidence underlying Villa\u2019s illegal reentry conviction, his argument goes, was obtained by exploitation of the initial illegal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">We agree with the district court that evidence of Villa\u2019s identity and illegal presence in the United States was not subject to suppression under the exclusionary rule. First, the initial encounter between Villa and Officer Jensen was consensual, and thus did not require reasonable suspicion or probable cause. It is undisputed that Villa initiated the encounter, handed over his identification upon request, and left of his own accord. We have held that similar encounters did not constitute Fourth Amendment seizures. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Encarnacion-Galvez, </em>964 F.2d 402, 405-10 (5th Cir.1992). Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the encounter was not consensual, Officer Jensen had reasonable suspicion that Villa illegally parked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>his vehicle. Officer Jensen testified at the evidentiary hearing that Villa\u2019s car was \u201cparked within a hundred feet of an intersection blocking the moving lane of traffic\u201d and that it was located in \u201ca no-parking zone.\u201d This testimony, which we view in the light most favorable to the government, <em>United States v. Aguirre, </em>664 F.3d 606, 610 (5th Cir.2011), supports the district court\u2019s finding that Officer Jensen\u2019s suspicion was reasonable. Third, after Officer Jensen conducted the license search and saw Villa drive by him, he had probable cause to arrest Villa for driving with a suspended license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-22\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b313-23\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-19\">. We note separately that even if Villa could show that the stop and seizure were illegal, his identity and illegal presence would likely not be suppressible on that basis. <em>See United States v. Roque-Villanueva, </em>175 F.3d 345, 346 (5th Cir.1999) (referencing <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
