On appeal, Atkins argues the evidence was inconsistent and insufficient to convict him. After review, we affirm Atkins\u2019 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>We review the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo. United States v. Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d 1282, 1299 (11th Cir.2009). In determining whether sufficient evidence exists, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, and ask whether a reasonable fact finder could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe evidence need not be inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis except guilt, and the jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Poole, </em>878 F.2d 1389, 1391 (11th Cir.1989). Credibility determinations are the province of the jury, and we assume the jury resolved those determinations in a manner that supports its verdict. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>473 F.3d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.2006). When a criminal defendant chooses to testify on his own behalf, and there is corroborative evidence of guilt, his statements, if disbelieved by the jury, may be considered as substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>53 F.3d 312, 314-15 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">To obtain a robbery conviction, the Government must prove the defendant knowingly acquired someone else\u2019s property against the victim\u2019s will by using actual or threatened force or violence or causing the victim to fear harm, and such actions obstructed, delayed, or affected interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. To sustain a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), the Government must present sufficient evidence that the defendant carried or used a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence. To convict a defendant under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the Government must show the defendant knowingly possessed ammunition and \u201cwas previously convicted of an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year,\u201d and the ammunition \u201cwas in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Palma, </em>511 F.3d 1311, 1315 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">There was sufficient evidence to support Atkins\u2019 convictions. Co-defendant Arthur Williams testified that he, Atkins, and Darrell Wilkins robbed an armored car driver. Atkins carried a gun, which he pointed at the driver as Williams and the driver were struggling. Williams stated that, after the driver saw Atkins\u2019 gun, the driver ceased struggling, and dropped a bag containing cash and checks into their vehicle. In conjunction with evidence that many of the stolen checks would have been processed out of state, Williams\u2019 testimony established that Atkins committed robbery. Williams\u2019 testimony also established that Atkins carried and used a firearm during the robbery, a crime of violence. Although Atkins testified he was not involved, the jury was entitled to believe Williams and disbelieve Atkins. <em>See Thompson, </em>473 F.3d at 1142; <em>Brown, </em>53 F.3d at 314-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">The evidence presented at trial was also sufficient to show Atkins committed the crime of being a felon in possession of ammunition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no dispute that officers found ammunition inside Atkins\u2019 truck when he was arrested; the only disputed issue was whether Atkins knew the ammunition was inside his truck. Williams testified that during the robbery, Atkins carried a .45 caliber Glock. The ammunition found inside Atkins\u2019 truck was for a .45 caliber Glock. A reasonable juror could have inferred that Atkins would have known about ammunition designed for use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>in a gun that he carried during a robbery a little more than a week earlier. Although Atkins testified he did not know about the ammunition, because there was corroborating evidence of guilt, the jury was entitled to conclude otherwise. <em>See Brown, </em>58 F.3d at 814-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-6\">. The parties stipulated that Atkins was a felon and that the ammunition had moved in interstate commerce.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
