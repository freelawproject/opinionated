He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his second motion for a reduction of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the retroactive application of Amendment 750 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-25\">Lewis argues that he is eligible for a sentence reduction because the offense of which he pleaded guilty involved crack cocaine. Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence if he was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o).\u201d \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Part A of Amendment 750 altered the base offense levels for cocaine base in the drug quantity tables of \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) and is retroactive. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, Supp. to Appendix C-Vol. III, </em>Amendment 750, at 391-98; 416-421 (Amendment 759).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The district court accurately noted that Lewis\u2019s base offense level was calculated based solely on the amount of powder cocaine attributable to him for sentencing purposes. His sentencing guidelines range therefore was not affected by retroactive application of Amendment 750, and the district court did not err by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion on that basis. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We caution Lewis that filing repetitive or frivolous requests for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction, or appeals from the denial of such requests, will invite the imposition of sanctions. To avoid sanctions, Lewis is further cautioned to review any pending appeals to ensure that they do not raise arguments that are repetitive or frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
