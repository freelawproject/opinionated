After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">In 2005, Crumpton pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine (Count 1) and marijuana (Count 2), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and using and carrying several firearms in furtherance of a drug-trafficking offense (Count 3), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Based on a total offense level of 28 and a criminal history category I, Crumpton had a guideline range of 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment (with a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for Count 1), plus a statutory mandatory minimum consecutive sentence of 5 years for Count 3. The district court sentenced Crumpton to 78 months on Count 1, to run concurrently with a 60-month sentence on Count 2. And the court imposed the 60-month statutory minimum consecutive sentence for Count 3, for a total of 138 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Crumpton appealed, and this court affirmed his conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 2008, Crumpton filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to reduce his sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines which changed Crumpton\u2019s guideline range for Count 1 to 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court granted Crumpton\u2019s motion and resen-tenced him to a total of 123 months\u2019 imprisonment, or 63 months on Count 1 and 60 months on Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-16\">Then, in 2011, Crumpton filed a second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, asking the district court to further reduce his sentence based on Amendment 750 which revised the crack-cocaine quantity tables to comply with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2372. This time, the district court denied Crumpton\u2019s motion based on his \u201cextensive disciplinary record while in custody,\u201d taking \u201cinto account the policy statement set forth at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), to the extent they are applicable.\u201d This is Crumpton\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-17\">A district court is permitted, but not required, to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Brown, </em>104 F.3d 1254, 1255 (11th Cir.1997). We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision not to do so. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005). When deciding whether a reduction is appropriate, the court must first determine the sentence it would have imposed given the amended guideline range and holding all other original guideline findings constant. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Then, the court \u201cmust consider the sentencing factors listed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>\u00a7 3553(a), as well as public safety considerations, and may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, in evaluating whether a reduction in the defendant\u2019s sentence is warranted and the extent of any such reduction.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>557 F.3d 1254, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). The district court is not required to make specific findings to support its decision not to reduce a sentence so long as it clearly considers the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sets forth adequate reasons for its decision. <em>Brawn, </em>104 F.3d at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">We conclude that Crumpton has failed to establish that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to reduce sentence. Crumpton contends, without support, that his custodial disciplinary violations were insufficient to justify denying a sentence reduction. We do not agree. Application Note 1(B) to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 states that a district court \u201cmay consider post-sentencing conduct of the defendant\u201d in determining whether and to what extent a sentence reduction is warranted. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(B) (2011); <em>Williams, </em>557 F.3d at 1256 (permitting a district court to consider post-sentencing conduct in determining whether a reduction is warranted). The district court expressly cited this provision when emphasizing Crump-ton\u2019s extensive custodial disciplinary record. Further, the district court stated that it considered the applicable factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in declining to reduce Crump-ton\u2019s sentence. Crumpton has not demonstrated to the contrary, and therefore has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b976-11\">. <em>United States v.
