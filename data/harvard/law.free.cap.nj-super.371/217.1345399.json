We affirm both.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">J.S.W. was initially committed on October 2, 2001, after a final hearing. He appealed but then moved for a limited remand to permit the trial court to reconsider its decision in light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>In re Commitment of W.Z., </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>109, 801 A.2d 205 (2002). The motion was granted. On remand, the trial court determined that the State met the clear and convincing standard of proof articulated in <em>W.Z. </em>and, without taking further testimony, reiterated its earlier decision in a revised judgment entered on September 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The limited remand and first review were both heard on September 24, 2002. An order continuing appellant\u2019s commitment was entered on that date, and he appealed the revised judgment and the continued commitment order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appeals were consolidated and he now argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\n<em>POINT ONE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">THE PRIOR DETERMINATION THAT J.S.W.

Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Brower, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293, 297, 391 A.2d 923 (App.Div.1978). The issue presented in the later action must be identical to the issue decided in the earlier action. <em>Hernandez v. Region Nine Housing Corp., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>645, 659, 684 A.2d 1385 (1996). The party seeking to assert the doctrine must establish that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">(1) the issue to be precluded is identical to the issue decided in the prior proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior proceeding; (3) the court in the prior proceeding issued a final judgment on the merits; (4) the determination of the issue was essential to the prior judgment; and (5) the party against whom the doctrine is asserted was a party to or in privity with a party to the earlier proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\"><em>[Selective Ins. Co. v. McAllister, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 173-74, 742 A.2d 1007 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>188, 752 A.2d 1290 (2000) (quoting <em>In re Estate of Dawson, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>1, 20, 641 A.2d 1026 (1994)) (citations omitted.)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">We reject appellant\u2019s argument on the grounds that the issues presented in the 1996 ADTC evaluation were substantially differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ent from those in the civil commitment proceeding; there was no litigation or final determination on the merits of the ADTC report; and the substance of the ADTC report actually supports appellant\u2019s initial and continued commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The 1996 ADTC evaluation was done for purposes of sentencing under the Sex Offender Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3, and the civil commitment was pursuant to the SVPA. Each of the statutes employs different definitions and has different criteria for their application. Under the sentencing provision, a sex offender whose \u201cconduct was characterized by a pattern of repetitive, compulsive behavior <em>and ... </em>the offender is amenable to sex offender treatment <em>and </em>is willing to participate in such treatment\u201d may be sentenced to the ADTC after evaluation and recommendation by the Department of Corrections. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3b (emphasis added). The SVPA, on the other hand, provides for the civil commitment of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">a person who has been convicted, adjudicated delinquent or found not guilty by reason of insanity for commission of a sexually violent offense, or has been charged with a sexually violent offense but found to be incompetent to stand trial, <em>and </em>suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for control, care and treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.26 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">For sentencing purposes, a defendant must acknowledge his sexually offensive conduct in order to be amenable to treatment <em>and </em>must accept his need for treatment <em>and </em>must be willing to participate in treatment. For civil commitment purposes, a person convicted of a sexually violent offense must be found to suffer \u201cfrom a mental abnormality or personality disorder\u201d that puts him at risk to commit further acts of sexual violence if not confined. Admissions, amenability to treatment or \u201csexual compulsion\u201d are not required for civil commitment under the SVPA. <em>W.Z. supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 129, 801 A.2d 205. Rather, \u201c[t]he focus of the SVPA is on the subject\u2019s current mental condition and the present danger to the public.\u201d <em>In re Commitment of P.C., </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>569, 582, 794 A.2d 211 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>An ADTC evaluation done for purposes of sentencing a sex offender is not typically litigated or adjudicated. While a defendant is entitled to a hearing to challenge an ADTC recommendation that he be sentenced under the Sex Offender Act (Act), <em>State v. Howard, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>113, 121-128, 539 A.2d 1203 (1988), the State has no basis for challenging a report that finds a defendant ineligible for sentencing under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The substance of the 1996 ADTC evaluation is significant in light of the civil commitment proceedings. The ADTC report highlighted the very same factors that led to appellant\u2019s commitment, that is, his inability to acknowledge that his behavior was criminal, his belief that he did not need treatment and his refusal to accept treatment. The ADTC report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">This case presents diagnostic difficulties. Although it is clear that [J.S.W.\u2019s] criminal behavior has been repetitive, less clear is the degree to which it can properly be termed compulsive.... He is a self-centered, narcissistic individual who is quite willing to exploit others for his own gratification....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">It does not appear that he is compelled by strong inner urges to engage in coercive sexual behavior. Rather, [J.S.W.] is a man who wants what he wants when he wants it.... Whatever sexual pathology may be present in [J.S.W.], it pales in comparison to the antisocial aspects of his personality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">After concluding that J.S.W. was not eligible for sentencing under the Sex Offender Act, the ADTC report cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">[I]t must be emphasized that he is quite likely to commit future acts of aggression of both a sexual and non-sexual nature. Unfortunately, he has little interest in psychotherapy and is unlikely to be a fiill and open participant in such a process.... [T]he prognosis is guarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">In reviewing the Sex Offender Act and the SVPA, it becomes obvious that the issues in sentencing a sex offender are significantly different from the issues in civilly committing a sexually violent predator. In addition, there was no litigation or adjudication on the merits of the ADTC report, but the very factors that rendered appellant ineligible for sentencing under the Sex Offender Act remain and support his initial and continued commitment under the SVPA. Collateral estoppel is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">J.S.W. next argues that the trial court erroneously relied on hearsay \u2014 specifically two presentence reports and ADTC evaluations \u2014 contained in exhibits and expert testimony in reaching its decision. Our review of the record does not support this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">We have previously held that hearsay typically relied upon by expert witnesses to assist in reaching a diagnosis is admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703. <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.H.M., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>599, 612, 845 A.2d 139 (App.Div.2003), <em>certif. denied, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>312, 845 A.2d 137 (2004); <em>In re Civil Commitment of A.X.D., </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 201-02, 851 A.2d 37 (App.Div.2004). We have held further that a trial judge may use hearsay reports \u201cas background in evaluating the opinions of the ... experts, who testified that they considered these reports in reaching their own diagnoses.\u201d <em>A.X.D., supra, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 202, 851 A.2d 37 (App.Div.2004). We are satisfied that the trial judge used the reports in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">We are equally unpersuaded by J.S.W.\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in reconsidering the case under the <em>W.Z. </em>standard without additional expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">On remand, the trial judge indicated that she reviewed the transcript and exhibits from the final hearing and was satisfied that \u201cthe record establishes by clear and convincing proof all of the criteria currently required.\u201d She then recited the specific evidence to support the factual findings and concluded that J.S.W. \u201chas little or no control of his sex behavior.... There\u2019s a difference between compulsion and not having volitional control. And that was explained by the psychiatrist in the record.\u201d Although the judge did not repeat the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony, she was \u201cclearly convinced that [J.S.W.] has great difficulty controlling his sex behavior,\u201d and \u201cthat it is highly likely that he will re-offend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Nothing in the remand order or in <em>W.Z. </em>required additional expert testimony. We are satisfied that the trial court properly reviewed the record of the initial hearing in light of the <em>W.Z. </em>standard and that no further expert testimony was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Finally, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s argument that the State failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is a sexually violent predator. To establish that a person is a sexually violent predator in need of civil commitment, the State must clearly and convincingly demonstrate that a person (1) has been convicted, adjudicated delinquent, found not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial for a specified sexually violent offense <em>and </em>(2) \u201csuffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for control, care and treatment.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4\u201427.26; <em>W.Z., supra, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>at 127, 801 A.2d 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">There is no dispute that the first element has been met. Counsel for appellant acknowledged that J.S.W. had been twice convicted of sexual <em>offenses </em>and that, <em>from </em>1989 until his current incarceration, \u201che led a substantially non-law abiding life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">At the initial hearing, Charles Gnassi, M.D., testified that appellant suffered from paraphilia, anti-social and narcissistic personality disorders that affected his emotional, cognitive or volitional capacity in a way that predisposed him to commit acts of sexual violence. Gnassi\u2019s diagnosis was based on his examination of J.S.W., the offense history and facts in the record. Donna LoBiondo, Ph.D., also testified at the initial hearing and similarly diagnosed appellant as suffering from paraphilia NOS and antisocial personality disorder. She, too, based her diagnosis on her examination of J.S.W. and the facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">At the second hearing, Stanley R. Kern, M.D., testified that a year after Gnassi\u2019s and LoBiondo\u2019s diagnoses, he found J.S.W. still to be suffering from paraphilia NOS, anti-social and narcissistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>personality disorders. He, too, recited appellant\u2019s history of sexual offenses. In addition, he had the benefit of J.S.W.\u2019s response to treatment during the past year at the STU. He acknowledged that J.S.W.\u2019s attendance at therapy sessions was \u201cexcellent\u201d but noted that \u201che talks about [things that] do not apply to him.... And he avoids dealing with his own issues, particularly victimizing women....sexual expression, drug dealing and criminal lifestyle, and negative feelings toward women.\u201d Kern noted further that J.S.W. did not admit to two violent rapes, but blamed both of his convictions on the victims, claiming one wanted more drugs from him and the other initially agreed to have sex and then cried rape. Kern testified that until appellant admits that his conduct was violent and criminal, he will \u201cnever be able to control his impulses.\u201d The psychiatrist further indicated that appellant still exhibits no insight into his behavior and no remorse for the crimes. He concluded, as did the two experts the year before, that appellant continued to be at risk to commit acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for control, care and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">We have carefully considered the record in light of the arguments of counsel and the applicable law, and we are satisfied that the State has met its burden of proving clearly and convincingly that J.S.W. is a sexually violent predator in need of initial and continued commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-18\"> On the facts presented here, we will consider both the initial commitment and the review, notwithstanding footnote 1 in <em>I/M/O the Commitment of J.J.F., </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>486, 499, fn. 1, 839 A.2d 922 (App.Div.2004) in which we indicated the appeal of an initial judgment of commitment may be moot upon appeal of the review hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
