We conclude that the testimony of the experts on behalf of the State at the initial commitment hearing, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.29, relied to an unacceptable extent upon hearsay opinions and findings by other experts that E.S.T. did not have the opportunity to challenge, resulting in a commitment process that was fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">The facts underlying E.S.T.\u2019s commitment are not pleasant, as is commonly the case with SVPA committees. The crimes that led to E.S.T.\u2019s present commitment all took place in the summer of 1985. On May 26, 1985, E.S.T., who was then twenty-three years old, entered a home and, at knife point, raped a young woman after first forcing her' to perform oral sex on him. On July 25, 1985, E.S.T. entered another home and, again at knifepoint, forced a young woman to perform an oral sex act on him. On July 28, 1985, once again armed with a knife, he entered a home and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>sexually groped a woman, but fled before performing any further sexual act as a result of her screams and fighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">When subsequently questioned by the police, E.S.T. admitted his involvement in each of those crimes, as well as his participation in robberies on July 18 and July 27,1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">On July 29, 1986, pursuant to a negotiated agreement, E.S.T. pled guilty to sexual assault and attempted sexual assault charges arising from the May 26 and July 28, 1985 incidents, and to second-degree robbery stemming from the July 27, 1985 incident. The plea agreement called for various consecutive and concurrent sentences aggregating thirty years with fifteen years of parole ineligibility. E.S.T. was sentenced on that same date in accordance with the negotiated plea. E.S.T.\u2019s sentence did not commit him to the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (ADTC) for sex offender treatment, and there is no indication that the mandatory evaluation was ever made. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-1 to -8; <em>R. </em>3:21-3. In any event, even if there was such a referral, E.S.T. was not committed to the ADTC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record does not reflect any appeal of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">There is no clear evidence that E.S.T. received or was offered any sex offender treatment during his time in State Prison, although he did participate in \u201canger management and behavior modification modules.\u201d E.S.T. served about seventeen years in prison before the State filed its SVPA commitment petition on June 4, 2002. The petition noted that he was scheduled to \u201cmax out\u201d on his sentence \u201con or about June 12,2002.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">E.S.T.\u2019s criminal record prior to the 1985 incidents revealed a burglary and larceny conviction in June 1982 with a thirty-day suspended sentence and two years probation; a municipal court theft, criminal mischief, resisting arrest and simple assault conviction on February 22, 1982, with a sentence of fifteen days in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>county jail, together with a charge of contempt of court with a three-day county jail sentence on the same date; and finally, a May 28,1985 arrest for simple assault, which was never adjudicated due to his failure to appear (perhaps because of the pending sex crimes charges). The June 1982 conviction resulted in a September 1983 violation of probation and an indeterminate term at Yardville, from which he was paroled on June 12, 1984, only a year before his 1985 crimes. Indeed, it appears that he was on parole when he committed the 1985 crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In prison, E.S.T. had a July 8, 1992 adjudication of an attempt to commit an unknown infraction, with a sanction of detention and loss of recreational privileges, and a September 1, 1992 adjudication of refusing to obey for which his sanction was a suspended loss of recreational privileges. On August 13, 1997, he was found guilty of possession of drugs and narcotic paraphernalia, with a sanction of detention, recreational segregation, loss of commutation time and urine monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">As noted, the State filed its SVPA petition on June 4, 2002. Supporting the petition were two clinical certificates. The first, by Herbert Kaldany, D.O., a psychiatrist employed by CFG Correctional Medical Services, indicated that he interviewed E.S.T. for forty minutes on June 3, 2002, and reviewed his prison classification record, which included mental health and medical records. He noted that an ADTC report was \u201cnot included.\u201d (As we have noted, there apparently was no ADTC evaluation). Dr. Kaldany stated that E.S.T. had been referred for sex offender treatment \u201cby various sources from 1988 to 2000.\u201d However, the basis for that observation was not set forth. At the interview, E.S.T. denied committing the offenses in question, claiming that the victims concocted their charges, apparently at the instigation of the Camden Police because of racial bias. Dr. Kaldany took account of several psychological risk assessment test results that placed E.S.T. in the \u201cmoderate to high risk relapse rate.\u201d The primary final diagnosis was \u201cParaphilia<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> NOS [not otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>specified] nonconsent type, Polysubstance abuse,\u201d with a secondary diagnosis of \u201cPersonality [disorder] NOS Antisocial traits most prominent.\u201d The doctor checked off the box indicating that defendant qualified for SVPA commitment because he suffers from a \u201cmental abnormality (as defined by the Act) or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined to a secure facility for control, care and treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The second certificate supporting the commitment petition was by Benjamin L. Libertore, M.D., a psychiatrist with the Center for Family Guidance/CMS. Dr. Libertore examined E.S.T. on June 3, 2002, for an hour just preceding Dr. Kaldany\u2019s interview. He also reviewed E.S.T.\u2019s records, including \u201cpsychological evaluations.\u201d He stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">[E.S.T.] has received no sex offender specific therapy, substance abuse treatment, or psychiatric treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">Treatment for sex offender and substance abuse recommended by parole board 12/00. In addition there were various recommendations for group counseling and substance abuse treatment by classification committees and others. [E.S.T.] did not pursue these.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">As he had with Kaldany, E.S.T. claimed that his convictions resulted from an elaborate conspiracy involving the prosecutors and victims. He demonstrated, according to Libertore, \u201cdistorted thinking and denial.\u201d Libertore also noted his test scores demonstrating a high (on one test) and moderate (on another test) recidivism risk. His primary diagnosis was also \u201cParaphilia NOS non consenting.\u201d He considered that E.S.T. met the criteria for SVPA commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">We turn now to the hearing of September 13,2002, that resulted in the judgment under review. The State presented two wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>nesses. Dr. Pogas Voskanian, a psychiatrist in a private consulting practice, testified that he interviewed E.S.T. for fifteen to twenty minutes on the day of the hearing. An earlier attempt to interview him had been frustrated by E.S.T.\u2019s indication that he wanted to speak with his attorney. E.S.T. maintained his innocence of the crimes, categorically denying that he committed any of them. In reaching his opinions, Dr. Voskanian relied on his \u201creview of records\u201d generally, but specifically on the evaluations by Drs. Kaldany and Libertore. His opinion, he stated, coincided with that of the \u201cdoctors who previously examined\u201d E.S.T. His primary diagnosis of Paraphilia was based on the \u201cdeviant manner of committing sexual offenses, meaning rape, violating somebody.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">If you combine disregard for others\u2019 rights, as well as your \u2014 your desire of having sex with somebody else or violate somebody else or commit a crime or satisfy your need in whatever means, combined with having no remorse or feelings of guilt, and disregard for others\u2019 rights; it\u2019s going to make [it] a lot easier and the \u2014 there\u2019s going to be a lot less prohibition for that individual to go ahead and commit the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">E.S.T.\u2019s complete denial of the crimes indicated that \u201cit\u2019s going to take time ... for him to develop some insight into the problems ... to accept treatment and that indicates that we are at the very beginning stages of beginning the process of some recovery.\u201d He concluded that E.S.T.\u2019s risk of reoffense is \u201chigh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">On cross-examination, Dr. Voskanian made clear that he based his diagnosis of Paraphilia \u201cupon other individuals\u2019 evaluations.\u201d Indeed, in his report, which was incorporated into his testimony, the doctor set out the key portions of the two clinical certificates and, as in his testimony, stated that these evaluations played <em>a </em>significant part in his diagnoses.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">The State\u2019s second witness was Dr. Robert S. Carlson, a psychologist employed at the STU. He interviewed E.S.T. for about one hour and reviewed correctional records from the state prison facility. He related that E.S.T. had participated in several \u201cpsychometric evaluations\u201d that showed him to be in the \u201cmildly mentally retarded range.\u201d Significantly, in his report and testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>mony, Dr. Carlson relied upon two actuarial instruments used for risk assessment, <em>see In re Commitment of R.S. </em>339 <em>N.J.Super. </em>507, 517, 773 A.2d 72 (App.Div.2001), <em>aff'd, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>134, 801 A.2d 219 (2002), which had been administered to E.S.T. by Gregg Gambone, Ph.D. on December 29, 2001, a date on which Dr. Gambone interviewed E.S.T. as well. A copy of Dr. Gambone\u2019s report was also placed in evidence. Carlson\u2019s review of the tests showed that E.S.T. obtained a score of eight on the MnSOST-R, which placed him at a high-risk category for sexual reoffense. Gambone\u2019s report stated the test result as representing a 70% chance of recidivism.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the Static 99, he received a score of four, suggesting that he belongs to a group that is at medium-high risk for sexual reoffense. Gambone referred to this as equating to a 45% chance of recidivism.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While these actuarial instruments are unique in that they \u201chave been designed specifically for ... and with the intention of predicting recidivism,\u201d they are \u201cevaluated within the context of the overall evaluation.\u201d His conclusion that E.S.T. posed a \u201csignificant risk\u201d of reoffense was based on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcQ\">an overall pattern of impulsiveness, of lack of control, which he has manifested when in the community setting. And ... it\u2019s just not necessarily only sexual behaviors that \u2014 that he has had difficulty with, but there is some criminal versatility that he has demonstrated over time. I don\u2019t \u2014 even though I did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>score the Hare PCLR, I don\u2019t believe that he would probably meet the diagnostic threshold of \u2014 of psychopathy. But, certainly, there are traits that \u2014 that one could infer from, again, a careful review of the behavioral history.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Dr. Carlson felt that E.S.T.\u2019s offense denial made it unlikely for him to engage in any meaningful treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The judge found, based on the history of the offenses and the opinions of the experts, that E.S.T. is a sexually violent predator, predisposed to commit sexually violent acts. \u201cHe has great difficulty controlling his sexual behavior.\u201d She went on to find that \u201c[b]ecause of his denials, he cannot be treated. He cannot develop any insight into his problems. And, therefore, he cannot stop. He is exactly the same as he was when he was first taken into custody during that summer [of 1985].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">On appeal, E.S.T. raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\n<em>POINT ONE</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\"><em>THE COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR IN RELYING ON HEARSAY CONTAINED IN EXHIBITS AND THE TESTIMONY OF EXPERT WITNESSES </em>IN REACHING ITS DECISION.

The state failed to prove the \u201cTemporal Context\u201d requirement of W.Z.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-19\">E.S.T.\u2019s hearsay objection was not raised before the hearing judge, requiring that we consider it under the plain error standard. <em>R. </em>2:10-2. In this case, given the magnitude of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>interests at stake, <em>see Vitek v. Jones, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>480, 491, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1254, 1263, 63 L.Ed.2d 552, 564 (1980) (noting that involuntary commitment to a mental hospital is \u201ca massive curtailment of liberty\u201d), we conclude, for the reasons which follow, that E.S.T.\u2019s commitment based on expert medical testimony that was to a large measure based on hearsay in the form of opinions of other experts who did not testify, was error, and that such error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">There is no doubt that the opinions of both the psychiatrist, Dr. Voskanian, and the psychologist, Dr. Carlson, were based substantially on the opinions of Drs. Liberatore and Kaldany who had authored the clinical certificates. In addition, they relied on the risk assessments conducted by Dr. Gambone. While both witnesses testified that these were the types of information frequently relied upon in making evaluations such as these, thereby arguably complying with <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, such facial compliance is not dispositive. Indeed, we question whether there was real compliance with <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703 or whether the rule was just given lip service. Dr. Voskanian responded affirmatively to a question that asked whether \u201cmembers of [his] profession will frequently rely upon [such types of source information] in doing such evaluations?\u201d Similarly, Dr. Carlson testified, by way of an affirmative answer, that \u201cthese [are the] type[s] of source information that members of your profession will rely upon [such types of source information] in doing such evaluations.\u201d The evidence rule requires that the facts or data relied upon must be \u201cof a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.\u201d In <em>Ryan v. K.D.I. Sylvan Pools, Inc., </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>276, 289, 579 A.2d 1241 (1990), the Court held, with reference to identical language contained in Rule 703\u2019s predecessor rule, <em>Evidence Rule </em>56(2), that the trial court is required to \u201cmake an inquiry into and a finding on whether experts in the given field rely on certain information. If such reliance be found, then it is presumed to be reasonable.\u201d This has been referred to as the \u201cliberal approach\u201d to the rule. <em>McCormick on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 15 at 74 (5th ed.1999). In so doing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>Court rejected those federal cases that also required the trial court to determine whether the expert\u2019s reliance on the out-of-court information was reasonable. <em>Ryan, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 287-89, 579 A.2d 1241.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">The focus should be on what the experts in fact rely on, not on whether the court thinks they should so rely. Requiring the trial court to make a finding on whether experts in the field actually rely on certain information satisfies the intent of the new language. Allowing the court to overrule that presumption of reliability will result in the exclusion of evidence only under unusual or extreme circumstances, thus satisfying the \u201cspirit\u201d of the former <em>Rule.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 289, 579 A.2d 1241].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">It is beyond question that medical experts rely upon the opinions of prior <em>treating </em>physicians. However, here, neither Kaldany nor Libertore treated E.S.T. Both had simply performed forensic evaluations, just as Voskanian and Carlson themselves had done. Albeit in the context of a criminal trial, in <em>United States v. Tran Trong Cuong, </em>18 F.3d 1132, 1143-44 (4th Cir.1994), similar testimony by an expert, bolstering his own opinion by stating that it was \u201cessentially the same\u201d as that of a non-testifying expert, was deemed inadmissible under identical Federal Rule of Evidence 703. The court\u2019s ruling had two parts. First, it held that it was improper for the testifying expert to bolster his opinion by stating that another doctor, who was not called to testify, agreed with him. There was also no finding that this type of evidence was the \u201ctype reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1143. Even if such a foundation had been laid, it was improper to state \u201cthat the two medical opinions were essentially the same.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>This is, we suggest, what occurred at E.S.T.\u2019s hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The Fourth Circuit also advanced a second ground upon which the testimony was inadmissible. The expert\u2019s report to which the testifying expert referred was itself prepared at the request of the prosecutor and thereby was a forensic opinion. The court concluded that \u201c[rjeports specifically prepared for purposes of litigation are not, by definition, \u2018of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field.\u2019 Even though an expert may base his opinion on underlying information, it does not follow that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>otherwise inadmissible information may come into evidence just because it has been used by the expert in reaching his opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1143-44. The testimony of the expert in court as to the opinion of the out-of-court expert was used to convince the trier of fact of the \u201caccuracy and reliability of [the testifying expert\u2019s] opinions,\u201d and also to place before the trier of fact the non-testifying expert\u2019s opinion without subjecting him to cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 1144. \u201cThis is unfair to the defendant as it denies his fundamental right to cross-examination and is an improper use of expert testimony.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Exactly the same may be said of what took place in the case under review. To repeat, this is not a case where the experts who testified relied upon experts who treated the patient, <em>see e.g., United States v. Lawson, </em>653 <em>F.2d </em>299, 301-03 (7th Cir.1981), <em>cert, denied, </em>454 <em>US. </em>1150, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1017, 71 L.Ed.2d 305 (1982), but where the non-testifying experts simply rendered a forensic opinion based on records and a brief interview with E.S.T. We agree with the court in <em>Cuong </em>that this type of reliance, even in the context of this non-criminal SVPA proceeding, does not fit within the parameters of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the testifying doctors here merely acted as a \u201cconduit\u201d for the out-of-court opinions, <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 15, at 76 n. 17, since they did offer their own opinions based, at least in part, on a review of records and an interview, however brief, with E.S.T. Thus, despite our conclusion as to the violation of <em>N.J.R.E. </em>703, further analysis is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">As we view it, the infirmity lies in the greatly reduced, if not entirely absent, opportunity for effective cross-examination, a right specifically guaranteed by the SVPA, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.31, when the experts produced in court and available for cross-examination rely heavily upon the opinions of experts who are not produced. While the experts here did not rely on sources of unknown reliability, as was the case with the committing physician in <em>In re J.B., </em>295 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 78, 684 A.2d 925 (App.Div.1996), we share similar concerns: that the trier of fact, even an experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>enced judge, may not be able to fairly evaluate the basis of the in-court opinions that rely upon out-of-court opinions effectively shielded not just from meaningful cross-examination, but from any cross-examination. As the Court observed in <em>In re C.A., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>71, 95, 679 A.2d 1153 (1996), cross-examination is generally a prerequisite to admissibility of statements, subject, of course, to the rule permitting the introduction of hearsay where \u201c \u2018circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness exist,\u2019 \u201d (quoting 2 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 253 at 130 (4th ed.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In <em>C.A., </em>the Court emphasized the need for reliability in the admission of hearsay evidence as an essential component of \u201cprocedural due process and fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 95, 679 A.2d 1153. As the Court noted, \u201c \u2018relaxed standards for admissibility are not to be equated with automatic admissibility.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>611, 623, 477 A.2d 308 (1984)). We need not cite the many cases that have acknowledged Wig-more\u2019s seminal observation that cross-examination is \u201cbeyond any doubt the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d 5 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 1367 (3rd ed.1940).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In the course of an opinion dealing with the need for pre-commitment notice of an SVPA probable cause hearing, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.28, for individuals already confined to a state facility, Judge Carchman, albeit in dictum, took note of the fact that at the final commitment hearing, \u201cthe alleged SVP will have a timely opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>challenge the commitment, including, at that time, <em>the right to cross-examine and test the credibility of the certifications that have occasioned the commitment in the first instance.\u201d In re Commitment of M.G., </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 384, 751 A.2d 1101 (App.Div.2000)(emphasis supplied). We agree with that observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">As a matter of fundamental fairness, we conclude that the State should be required to produce at the initial SVPA commitment hearing the physicians who signed the clinical certificates supporting the commitment petition, if they are available and if any expert testifying in court intends to rely on the opinions contained in those certificates in rendering an opinion that the individual is subject to commitment under the SVPA. It does not comport with fundamental fairness to have the opinions of the non-testifying experts bootstrapped into evidence through the testimony of the testifying experts without an opportunity for cross-examination of the underlying opinions. The same considerations apply to Dr. Gambone, who performed the critical actuarial assessments relied upon by the testifying experts. It is significant that in an \u201cordinary\u201d civil commitment, which is also initiated by the submission of two clinical certificates, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4-27.10b, at the final commitment hearing there must be testimony by a \u201cpsychiatrist <em>on the patient\u2019s treatment team </em>who has conducted a personal examination of the patient as close to the court hearing date as possible, but in no event more than five calendar days prior to the court hearing.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:27.13b (emphasis supplied). While the witnesses at E.S.T.\u2019s hearing both \u201cexamined\u201d him within the appropriate time frame, neither one had treated E.S.T. Indeed, it does not appear that E.S.T. received any treatment in the three months between his initial commitment and the final hearing. Thus, the testifying experts were not even in a position to review treatment records, as was the case in the review hearings at issue in <em>In re Civil Commitment of A.X.D., </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>198, 851 A.2d 37 (App.Div.2004). Of course, in <em>A.X.D., </em>we dealt with the admissibility as business records under <em>N.J.R.E. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>808 of treatment team reports containing hearsay. While we found the admission of the records to be harmless under the circumstances, we agreed with the committee \u201cthat it would have been improper for the trial judge to have considered for their truth any complex diagnoses that may have been contained in these reports, to the extent those diagnoses were contested.\u201d <em>A.X.D., supra, </em>at 202, 851 A.2d 37. To the extent that the requirements we impose may prove onerous to the State, such concerns \u201cmust yield to the Constitution and due process requirements.\u201d <em>In re M.G., supra, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 385, 751 A.2d 1101; <em>see also In re Commitment of Raymond S., </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>428, 431, 623 A.2d 249 (App.Div.l993)(\u201cInvoluntary commitment to a mental hospital is state action which deprives the committee of important liberty interests and, as such, triggers significant due process requirements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Here, E.S.T. complains of the admission of hearsay in the form of the pre-sentence reports and other investigative materials, as well as the expert opinion hearsay included within the expert opinion testimony. With respect to the former, we rejected a similar challenge in <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.H.M., </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>599, 611-14, 845 A.2d 139 (App.Div.2003), <em>certif. denied, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>312, 845 A.2d 137 (2004). We follow that decision. <em>See also </em>A.X.D., <em>supra, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 201-02, 851 A.2d 37. However, upon remand, the trial judge must take pains to consider such hearsay material not as substantive evidence but only as a basis for the expert\u2019s opinion. <em>J.H.M., supra, </em>367 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 613, 845 A.2d 139; <em>A.X.D., supra, </em>370 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 202, 851 A.2d 37. The record in this case leaves us in some doubt as to whether the judge viewed the evidence in that light. However, <em>J.H.M. </em>did not deal with the other issue here concerning the use of hearsay in the form of prior expert opinions, such as those of Drs. Libertore, Kaldany and Gambone. It is that material which results in our reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Although the trial judge placed heavy emphasis upon E.S.T.\u2019s denial of the offenses, which basically rendered him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>untreatable, finding those denials incredible, there is no doubt that the judge relied upon the expert opinions of Voskanian and Carlson. Indeed, we do not see how her findings could be sustained without expert opinion as to E.S.T.\u2019s risk of reoffense. Otherwise the commitment would be improperly based on E.S.T.\u2019s convictions alone.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, it cannot possibly be said that the error we have identified was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In light of our disposition, we need not address E.S.T.\u2019s argument that the State failed to prove that he was a sexually violent predator. We only note that Dr. Voskanian\u2019s opinion came perilously close to saying that E.S.T. should be committed because he committed rapes, which in itself the doctor considered a \u201cdeviant manner of committing sexual offenses.\u201d He went further and opined that it was E.S.T.\u2019s \u201cdisregard for others\u2019 rights,\u201d as evidenced by the multiple rapes that made him likely to reoffend. We recognize that this was not the entirety of Voskanian\u2019s opinion, but it bears emphasis because the fact of the criminal offenses that make E.S.T. eligible for SVPA commitment cannot alone establish the risk of reoffense that permits SVPA commitment. Since the matter will have to be reconsidered, the judge will have the opportunity to consider our observations and clarify the basis for the doctor\u2019s opinion. We wish to make clear that at the new commitment hearing the judge may certainly take into account, and if deemed appropriate accord substantial weight to, E.S.T.\u2019s denial of the offenses in the face of his guilty plea and allocution. On remand, the court should also clarify whether and when E.S.T. was offered sex offender treatment in prison. If such treatment was offered and declined, the court may also consider that fact in its evaluation of the risk that E.S.T. will reoffend.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Finally, we note that, unlike some other SVPA committees, E.S.T. did not raise an <em>ex post facto </em>challenge to his commitment. <em>See Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 662 A.2d 367 (1995); <em>State v. Bellamy, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>127, 835 A.2d 1231 (2003). On remand, E.S.T. is free to raise the argument that his commitment is punitive in light of the fact that he spent seventeen years in the penal system without treatment for what the State <em>now </em>apparently contends is a treatable condition. Can it be said, under such circumstances, that anyone holds out a realistic possibility that E.S.T. is now amenable to treatment for a mental condition for which he received no treatment in the years when it might have done him some good, i.e., closer to the time of the offenses? While the record is not entirely clear, it does not appear that sexual offender treatment was suggested to or required of E.S.T. before, perhaps, his December 2000 parole hearing, which we take to have been his first chance for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">In <em>Kansas v. Hendricks, </em>521 <em>U.S. </em>346, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997), a closely divided Supreme Court held that there was no impediment, at least under the federal Constitution, to a state \u201ccivilly detaining those for whom no treatment is available, but who nevertheless pose a danger to others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 366, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2084, 138 L.Ed.2d at 517. In his critical concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy observed that \u201c[i]f the object or purpose of the Kansas law had been to provide treatment but the treatment provisions were adopted as a sham or mere pretext, there would have been an indication of the forbidden purpose to punish,\u201d the hallmark of an ex post facto law. <em>Id. </em>at 371, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2087, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 521. However, Justice Kennedy found that the Kansas law, with its various protections, including yearly review, fell within the tradition of permitting confinement of persons who \u201cby reason of a mental disease or mental abnormality, constitute a real, continuing, and serious danger to society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2087, 138 L.Ed.2d at 521. In that regard, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>he noted that the mental abnormality that led to Hendricks\u2019 confinement, pedophilia, \u201cis at least described in the DSM-IV. American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 524-525, 527-528 (4th ed.1994).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">Notwithstanding its civil attributes, the practical effect of the Kansas law may be to impose confinement for life. At this stage of medical knowledge, although future treatments cannot be predicted, psychiatrists or other professionals engaged in treating pedophilia may be reluctant to find measurable success in treatment even after a long period and may be unable to predict that no serious danger will come from release of the detainee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">The point, however, is not how long Hendricks and others like him should serve a criminal sentence. With his criminal record, after all, a life term may well have been the only sentence appropriate to protect society and vindicate the wrong. The concern instead is whether it is the criminal system or the civil system that should make the decision in the first place. If the civil system is used simply to impose punishment after the State makes an improvident plea bargain on the criminal side, then it is not performing its proper function. These concerns persist whether the civil confinement statute is put on the books before or after the offense. We should bear in mind that while incapacitation is a goal common to both the criminal and civil systems of confinement, retribution and general deterrence are reserved for the criminal system alone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">On the record before us, the Kansas civil statute conforms to our precedents. If, however, civil confinement were to become a mechanism for retribution or general deterrence, or if it were shown that mental abnormality is too imprecise a category to offer a solid basis for concluding that civil detention is justified, our precedents would not suffice to validate it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">[Id. at 372-73,117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2087,138 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>at 521-22 (Kennedy, J., concurring) J.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-u\">Four dissenting Justices agreed with the Kansas Supreme Court that Hendricks\u2019 confinement was not justified, finding inadequate evidence that Kansas intended the committees to receive treatment. Among the reasons supporting such a view was that the Kansas Act, like ours, only seeks civil confinement after the offender has served his or her criminal sentence, leading Justice Breyer to pose the rhetorical question, \u201cBut why, one might ask, does the Act not commit and require treatment of sex offenders sooner, say soon after they begin to serve their sentences?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 385, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2093-94, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 530 (Breyer, J., dissenting). It is, he went on, \u201cdifficult to see why rational legislators ... would write the Act in this way \u2014 providing treatment years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>after the criminal act that indicated its necessity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2094, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 530. Based primarily upon a conclusion that Kansas had not provided for treatment of persons committed under its Act, like Hendricks, the dissenters concluded that the Act imposed punishment and therefore violated the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 382-96, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2092-98, 138 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 528-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Since the matter has not been briefed and the present record is in any event inadequate, we express no view on whether E.S.T. can establish that his commitment is in reality punitive. This is not to say that individuals like E.S.T. who commit terrible crimes should go free, but simply to suggest that the solution may lie in an honest use of criminal sentencing to achieve an appropriate period of confinement rather than use \u2014 or abuse \u2014 of the civil commitment statute to remedy the situation. The problem also suggests that treatment for sex offenders not committed to the ADTC be mandatory even while serving a state prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Reversed and remanded for a new commitment hearing consistent with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-10\"> We have just held that even a finding by the ADTC that a defendant is not eligible for sex offender sentencing does not preclude a later civil commitment of that defendant under the SVPA. <em>In re Civil Commitment of J.S.W., </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>217, 852 <em>A.2d </em>1107 (App.Div.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-6\"> Paraphilia is variously defined as \"[a]ny group of psychosexual disorders characterized by sexual fantasies, feelings, or activities involving a nonhuman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>object, a nonconsenting partner such as a child, or pain or humiliation of oneself or one's partner.

Washington, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>-, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Although technically civil, an SVPA commitment hearing, with its very real threat of lengthy incarceration, is almost pseudo-criminal in nature and should provide as much procedural protection to the committee as the circumstances permit. As the dissenters said in <em>Commonwealth v.
