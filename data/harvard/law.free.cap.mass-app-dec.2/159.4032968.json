(Rowe, J., and Briggs, J.)</author>\n<p id=\"AjcG\">\u2014 This action was begun by trustee writ. The plaintiff is resident in Brookline, Norfolk County, the defendant in Cambridge, Middlesex County, and the trustee in New Bedford, Bristol County, and in the Judicial District of the court in which the action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the action, denying the jurisdiction of the court, because \u201cit appears from the officer\u2019s return in said writ and the description of the defendant in said writ, that the action has not been brought in the court within whose judicial district one of the parties lives or has his usual place of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">The \u201cplaintiff requested the court to rule that under General Laws,'c. 246, \u00a7 4, the court had jurisdiction of the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">The court \u201crefused the plaintiff\u2019s request and dismissed the action,\" and reported the case to this division to determine the correctness of the ruling. The ruling was error, as was the allowance of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">A trustee named in a writ is a party to the action. Reynolds v. <em>Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Ry. et al, </em>224 Mass. 233. An action in which a trustee is made a party must be brought in the county in which he dwells or has a usual place of business. Gen. Laws, c. 246, \u00a7 3; c. 223, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">The defendant has neither argued nor filed a brief. We think he could find no authority to support his motion. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>is nothing in the report to apprise us of the reason the court allowed the motion, and refused the plaintiff\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-2\">The plaintiff\u2019s brief indicates that the court held that a trustee is not a \u201cparty,\u201d and, in as much as the action must be brought in a judicial district in which one of the \u201cparties\u201d lives, the court had.no jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\">The statutes in question fix the venue of the action. The first error would seem to <em>be in </em>holding that <em>the </em>trustee was not a party. The second is that the action could be brought in another county than that in which the trustee dwells or has a usual place of business. It must be brought in such a county. It must also be brought in a judicial district in. which a party lives. The trustee is one of the parties to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In the instant case the trustee was the only party to the action living in Bristol County. The action was brought in the judicial district in which he lives. It was properly brought. The Venue was correct, and the court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">We know of no decisions to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The order is, rulings reversed; plaintiff\u2019s request allowed; motion dismissed; case to stand for trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
