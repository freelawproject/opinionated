The rules of the District Courts contemplate that the basis of a report \"to the Appellate Division shall be requests for rulings and not motions. <em>Holton </em>v. <em>American Pastry Products Corp. </em>274 Mass. 268. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Homer\u2019s Inc. </em>295 Mass. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-2\">We have examined the report, however, and can add that there was evidence before the trial court to support its findings. At most the motions could be construed only as raising this question. We find no error, and the entry in each case will be, Report dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
