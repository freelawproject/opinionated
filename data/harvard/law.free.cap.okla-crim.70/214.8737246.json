He was unmarried, and had a cabin located near the city limits, which was his home. On the 25th day of November, 1937, which was Thanksgiving Day, he attended a football game in Kingfisher, in company with a young lady. While in attendance at the game he had two drinks. This was about the middle of the afternoon. After the game he proceeded to his camp cottage. On the way he was asked by friends to come to their home and have sandwiches that evening. He, Avith two of his friends, and the young lady, remained at his cottage until about 7 p. m., when he started in his automobile with the intention of seeing a friend on the way. The other parties had left his cabin and he was driving alone. He went by a drugstore, which was on Main street, and on U. S. Highway No. 81, for the purpose of securing a package of cigarettes. He honked and was waited on while sitting in his car. He immediately drove south on Highway No. 81 for two' blocks, and turned west on Highway No. 33 for two blocks, and turned south. When he turned south he saw the lights of a car that seemed to be following him. He stopped his car and honked, thinking that someone in the car desired to see him, and that they would drive up alongside. They did not do so, and he started his car, and had gone about 100 feet when he heard a signal and stopped, and a member of the Highway Patrol approached him and asked him, \u201cWhat kind of liquor had he been drinking\u201d, and whether he had any liquor in his car. Defendant was ordered out of his car, and his person and his car were searched by the two members of the Highway Patrol, but no intoxicating liquor of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>kind was found, either on the person of defendant or in his car. One of the patrolmen got in his car, and drove with him to the jail, and he was placed therein. The charge filed in this case was the outgrowth of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The evidence of the two patrolmen was that they had become patrolmen in June, 1937, and were stationed at Kingfisher. That they had gone on duty about 6 p. m., and had been informed by a policeman of Kingfisher that some one had told them that defendant had left the ball game intoxicated, and for them to locate him and pick him up. That they saw the chief of police, Mr. Ahern, and he informed them that defendant was sitting in his car in front of the Jones Drug Store. That they saw defendant there, but did not arrest him, as they stated, because they had no' right to do so, as he had done nothing to violate the law. However, when he started in his car as above outlined they followed him. They followed him, and came to' the conclusion that his car had weaved from one side of the street to the other, and they stopped him and arrested him under the circumstances above outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">They further testified that in their opinion he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of his arrest; that he staggered and talked like one that was under the influence of liquor, and they considered it unsafe for him to drive a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">When defendant was placed in jail he requested that a doctor, whom he knew, be called to see him. This request was not granted, but a member of the Highway Patrol, who- had arrested him, called another doctor, whom they had been directed to call in cases of this character.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">This doctor testified that he saw defendant and smelled liquor on his breath, and that in his opinion he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. That defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>talking and acting like a man who was under tbe influence of liquor, and that be was of tbe opinion that be was. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Tbe jailer, who saw defendant, testified to about tbe same state of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Tbe defendant, testifying in bis own bebalf, admitted taking two drinks about tbe middle of tbe afternoon. He denied that be bad taken any other liquor, and denied that be was under tbe influence of intoxicating liquor. He testified that be bad never before been arrested or convicted of any crime. He also testified that bis car did not weave in any way, and that tbe only cause for going out olf its natural course was that he lighted a cigarette which be bad bought at tbe drugstore. He also testified that be at no time drove over 15 or 20 miles an hour, and tbe highway patrolmen corroborated this statement. He at no time violated any highway or traffic law.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">The young lady who accompanied him to tbe football gave testified as a witness for defendant. She was with him until about 7 p. m., just before be was arrested, when she left and accompanied her mother to a Thanksgiving dinner at her grandfather\u2019s. She testified that defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor when be drove from tbe football game, and when she left him about 7 p. m. That the only drinking she saw was when be took the two drinks between \u201chalves\u201d at tbe football game.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Tbe above statement fairly states tbe evidence as shown by tbe record and without going into too' much detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">It is contended by defendant that under tbe above facts tbe defendant was wrongfully convicted:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>First. That the evidence was procured in violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, and upon an improper and unlawful search and seizure of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">Second. By reason o!f certain improper and incompetent questions of the county attorney, and the introduction of certain incompetent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Third. That the verdict of the jury, the judgment and sentence of the court was excessive, and was given and imposed as the result of passion and prejudice on the part of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">These assignments of error may well be considered together.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">During the trial of this case, and while defendant was on the witness stand, he was asked by the county attorney, \u201cIf he had ever been warned\u201d by an officer. Counsel for defendant objected to this question, and his objection was overruled. The county attorney again asked the defendant it he had ever been warned by an officer, to which defendant replied, \u201cWarned about what?\u201d The county attorney said, \u201cAbout some possible violation\u201d. At this juncture the trial court said: \u201cI don\u2019t think you better proceed any further with that.\u201d The county attorney then asked the witness, \u201cAnd you testified you have never been convicted of a crime?\u201d The defendant replied he had so testified, and then the county attorney asked, \u201cI will ask you if after you were arrested, you didn\u2019t go down to the justice of the peace court, in the preliminary examination and plead guilty?\u201d This question was highly improper and incompetent. It was objected to- by counsel for defendant, and after a hearing at the judge\u2019s bench, and out of the hearing of the jury, the objection was sustained by the court, and counsel for defendant made a motion to grant defendant a mistrial. This motion was overruled, and at the request of counsel the court instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>ted the jury that the question propounded by the county attorney with reference to proceedings had on arraignment in the justice court was withdrawn from their consideration, and that they were directed not to consider the same or permit it to enter into their deliberations. Under ordinary circumstances the sustaining of the objection to the above question, and directing the jury not to consider same, would be sufficient reason for a refusal to reverse the judgment of the court and jury. We have so held. Haithcock v. State, 63 Okla. Cr. 276, 74 P. 2d 641; Hooper v. State, 7 Okla. Cr. 43, 121 P. 1087; Coleman v. State, 6 Okla. Cr. 252, 253, 118 P. 594; Ray v. State, 35 Okla. Cr. 322, 250 P. 438. But in construing this proposition it occurs to us that the question should be viewed in the light and circumstances of each individual case. In a case where the evidence was convincing and certain it might not constitute error; in a case where the evidence was not only conflicting but doubtful, this question might have a great influence with the jury when asked in their presence. It is provided by section 2961, Okla. St. 1931, O. S. A., title 22, \u00a7 517, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\">\u201cThe court may, at any time before judgment, upon a plea of guilty, permit it to' be withdrawn, and a plea of not guilty substituted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Under this statute there is no question but that a defendant has the right to withdraw any plea of guilty he may have entered and enter a plea of not guilty prior to Ms trial. In construing this statute this court has held that when the plea of guilty is withdrawn and a plea of not guilty entered, it is error to permit proof at the trial of the prior entering of the plea of guilty, where it was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In the case of Heath v. State, 23 Okla. Cr. 382, 214 P. 1091, 1093, in an opinion by Judge Doyle, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201cUpon a plea of guilty, no trial upon tbe question of tbe defendant\u2019s guilt can be bad. His plea stands in tbe place of tbe verdict of a jury finding bim guilty, and for this reason we think that a withdrawn plea of guilty, for wbicb, by authority of law and of tbe court, a plea off not guilty is substituted, would not be admissible in evidence against tbe defendant as a confession nor as an admission against interest. In our opinion the rule supported by reason and authority is that a withdrawn plea of guilty, for wbicb a plea of not guilty is substituted by authority of court, is not admissible in evidence against tbe defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">In tbe above case tbe plea of guilty was entered in tbe minutes of tbe court clerk\u2019s office. Here it was at the preliminary examination. Tbe only difference in tbe Heath Case and tbe case at bar is that tbe trial court permitted tbe evidence to go bo tbe jury, and here tbe court sustained an objection to' tbe same and directed the jury not to consider tbe same. There is some conflict off authority \u00a1on tbe proposition of the admission of evidence of this character, but tbe great weight of authority and tbe reason wbicb we deem best is, that such evidence is not admissible. In those cases supporting tbe minority rule there has generally been a strong dissenting opinion. It is \u00a1our desire to call attention to a few of those cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In tbe case of Kercheval v. United States, 274 U. S. 220, 47 S. Ct. 582, 583, 71 L. Ed. 1009, this question was presented to tbe Supreme Court of tbe United States. Justice Butler delivered tbe opinion of tbe court, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">\u201cOther decisions support tbe petitioner\u2019s contention that a plea of guilty withdrawn by leave off court is not admissible on the trial of tbe issue arising on tbe substituted plea of not guilty. Heim v. United States, 47 App. D. C. 485, L. R. A. 1918E, 87; State v. Meyers, 99 Mo. 107, 119, 12 S. W. 516; People v. Ryan, 82 Cal. 617, 28 P. 121; Heath v. State [23 Okla. Cr. 382], 214 P. 1091. And see White v. State, 51 Ga. [285] 286, 289 [290]; Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>v. State, 40 Fla. 474, 478, 24 So. 537 [11 Am. Crim. Rep. 253]. We think that contention is sound. A plea of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extrajudicial confession; it is itself a conviction. Like a verdict off a jury it is conclusive. More is not required; the court has nothing to do' but give judgment and sentence. Out of just consideration for persons accused of crime, courts are careful that a plea of guilty shall not be accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences. When one so pleads he may be held bound. United States v. Bayaud (C. C.) 23 F. 721. But, on timely application, the court will vacate a plea of guilty shown to have been unfairly obtained or given through ignorance, fear or inadvertence. Such an application does not involve any question of guilt or innocence. Com. v. Crapo, 212 Mass. 209, 98 N. E. 702. The court in exercise of its discretion will permit one accused to substitute a plea of not guilty and have a trial if for any reason the granting of the privilege seems fair and just. Swang v. State, 2 Cold. (Tenn.) 212, 88 Am. Dec. 593; State v. Maresca, 85 Conn. 509, 83 A. 635; State v. Nicholas, 46 Mont. 470, 472, 128 P. 543; State v. Stephens, 71 Mo. 535; People v. McCrary, 41 Cal. 458, 461; State v. Coston, 113 La. 717, 720, 37 So. 619; Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Procedure, \u00a7 747.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\">\u201cThe effect of the court\u2019s order permitting the withdrawal was to adjudge that the plea of guilty be held for naught. Its subsequent use as evidence against petitioner was in direct conflict with that determination. When the plea was annulled it ceased to be evidence. By permitting it to be given weight the court reinstated it pro tanto. Heim v. United States, supra, 493 [47 App. D. C.]. The conflict was not avoided by the court\u2019s charge. Giving to the withdrawn plea any weight is in principle quite as inconsistent with the prior order as it would be to' hold the plea conclusive. Under the charge, if the plea was found not improperly obtained, the jury was required to give it weight unless petitioner was shown to be innocent. And, if admissible at all, such plea inevitably must be so' considered. As a practical matter, it could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>received as evidence without putting petitioner in a dilemma utterly inconsistent with the determination of the court awarding him a trial. Its introduction may have turned the scale against him. \u2018The withdrawal of a plea of guilty is a poor privilege, if, notwithstanding its withdrawal, it may be used in evidence under the plea of not guilty. White v. State, supra, 289 [290 (51 Ga.)]. It is beside the mark to say, as observed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, that petitioner knew better than any one whether or not he was guilty and that under the evidence a plea of guilty was a reasonable thing. These suggestions might bear upon the weight o!f admissible evidence but they have no relation to the admissibility of a withdrawn plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-3\">\u201cCourts frequently permit pleas of guilty to be withdrawn and pleas of not guilty to be substituted. We have cited all the decisions, state and federal, which have come to our attention, that pass on the question here presented. The small number indicates that in this country it has not been customary to use withdrawn pleas as evidence of guilt. Counsel have cited no case, and we have found none, in which the question has been considered in English courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\">\u201cWe think the weight of reason is against the introduction in evidence of a plea of guilty withdrawn on order of court granting leave and permitting the substitution olf a plea of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cJudgment reversed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Since this decision has been rendered it has been followed by almost all of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In the case of State v. Hook, 174 Minn. 590, 219 N. W. 926, 927, it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-8\">\u201cIn State v. Anderson, 173 Minn. 293, 217 N. W. 351, it was held error to introduce a plea of guilty which had been set aside, following the recent case of Kercheval v. United States, 274 U. S. 220, 47 S. Ct. 582, 71 L. Ed. 1009. The rule that a plea of guilty cannot be introduced in evidence against the accused after it has been withdrawn by permission of the court is well supported. See State v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Meyers, 99 Mo. 107, 119, 12 S. W. 516; People v. Ryan, 82 Cal. 617, 23 P. 121; Heath v. State, 23 Okla. Cr. 382, 214 P. 1091; Heim v. United States, 47 App. D. C. 485 [L. R. A. 1918E, 87]. Permitting the state to make such inquiries as were made in this case is a substantial evasion olf the doctrine of the Supreme Courtq of the United States announced in the Kercheval Case, which was the basis of our decision in the Anderson Case. There are a few cases to the contrary, but they are in the minority, and are out of harmony with the d-octrine deliberately adopted in the Anderson Case. The plea, sentence, and judgment, using the language of the court in the Kercheval Case, were set at naught by the order vacating them, and their subsequent use was in conflict with the order. We are unable to separate the statement made by the defendant to the presiding judge from the rest of the vacated judicial proceeding. It should not have been used against the defendant; and it can be said that no one familiar with courtrooms could believe that the jury did not understand that a plea of guilty had been entered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">The iSixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Pharr v. United States, 48 F. 2d 767, 770, announces the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-5\">\u201cError is assigned to the conduct of counsel for the government in interrogating appellant about a plea of nolo contendere that he had entered to the indictment but had withdrawn. Counsel first asked appellant if he had not entered a plea of guilt. Appellant answered: Won say that I pleaded guilty/ to- which counsel replied: \u2018Yes, you entered the same plea that Mr. Beauchamp did.\u2019 Appellant then said, \u2018I certainly have never pleaded guilty/ whereupon counsel replied: \u2018You pleaded nolo contendere, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Appellant then stated he understood that was a denial of guilt, to which counsel replied, as if he were surprised or questioned the veracity of appellant: \u2018You understood that the plea of nolo contendere was a denial of guilt?\u2019 To this appellant answered: \u2018A denial of guilt.\u2019 Without having, objected to the questions, counsel for appellant at this point intervened and requested the court to withdraw the jury and enter an order of mistrial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>This motion was overruled alter tbe court bad instructed tbe jury to disregard tbe questions and answers. For all practical purposes, tbe plea of nolo contendere is one of guilt. United States v. Norris, 281 U. S. 619, 50 S. Ct. 424, 74 L. Ed. 1076. To bave permitted tbe government to prove that appellant bad entered sucb a plea and withdrawn it would have been reversible error. Kercheval v. United States, 274 U. S. 220, 47 S. Ct. 582, 71 L. Ed. 1009. Although tbe questions and answers referred to were not objected to, tbe motion to discharge tbe jury was made in time to raise tbe question of error. Tbe effect of tbe examination was to bring home to tbe jury tbe equivalent of a confession of guilt. Whether a reversal is required depends on whether sucb a fixed impression was made on the minds of tbe jury as to&gt; influence its verdict. Standing alone without further interpretative reference, it might bave been that tbe questions would not bave been prejudicial ; but both counsel for the government and the court elsewhere in tbe trial treated the plea of nolo contendere as one of guilt. Proof of Beauchamp\u2019s plea bad been made, and tbe court, in charging tbe jury that it could not convict appellant of aiding and abetting unless it found that Beauchamp, tbe principal, bad violated tbe law, stated: \u2018Presumptively Beauchamp did violate tbe law, for tbe record in this case shows that in this very case be entered a plea of guilty, or nolo contendere, and was sentenced by this court.\u2019 Moreover, counsel for tbe government, in bis concluding argument, stated that Beauchamp, \u2018indicted with\u2019 appellant, bad \u2018entered a plea * * * and served his sentence.\u2019 These statements served to emphasize the improper conduct of counsel, and in sucb circumstances we cannot think that tbe admonition of tbe court had the effect of removing the harmful impression made by tbe inadmissible facts. Because of this misconduct on tbe part of counsel, tbe judgment must be reversed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Under tbe above authorities and tbe decisions therein cited, there can be no question that this question was improper. The only question is, Was tbe error harmless in view of tbe fact that the court sustained an objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>to tbe question and directed the jury not to consider the same? In the case of People v. Wells, 100 Cal. 459, 34 P. 1078, 1079, the court had under consideration this identical question, and there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-4\">\u201cThis was an entirely unfair way to try the case; and the mischief was not averted because the court properly sustained the objection, \u2014 though we think it should have warned counsel against the course which he was taking,\u2014 and instructed the jury specially on the subject. The wrong and the harm was in the asking of the question. Of course, in trials of criminal cases, questions as to the admissibility of evidence will frequently arise about which lawyers and judges may fairly differ in opinion; and in such cases defendants must be satisfied when courts sustain their objections. But where the prosecuting attorney asks a defendant questions which he knows, and every judge and lawyer knows, to be wholly inadmissible and wrong, and where the questions are asked without the expectation of answers, and where the clear purpose is to prejudice the jury against the defendant in a vital matter by the mere asking of the questions, then a judgment against the defendant will be reversed, although objections to the questions were sustained, unless it appears that the questions could not have influenced the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In the cases above cited this question has arisen in most cases, where the court has permitted the withdrawal of the plea of guilty after it was entered in the trial court. We have examined a number of cases which have held that evidence was admissible where the plea was entered in a justice or preliminary court, on the grounds that the plea Avas a confession. Other cases have held otherwise. This argument does not appeal to us. Taking into1 consideration the fact that our statute here involved has designated a violation thereof as a felony, St. 1931, \u00a7 10324, 47 Okla. St. Ann. \u00a7 93, many of the citizens of this state, at the time of their arrest thereunder, and even at the time of their arraignment, are not aware of the fact that they are being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>charged with a felony and the consequences that may arise therefrom. They often do' not procure counsel to advise them of their rights, but enter a plea of guilty upon the assumption that this is the easier way to get' rid of their arrest without publicity. When they become informed of the seriousness of the charge, they often request a change of their plea of guilty to a plea of not guilty, requiring the state to give them a trial upon the merits of the case as they have a right to do. It seems to us that under these facts and circumstances, to permit to be introduced in evidence a plea of guilty at the preliminary examination would not only be prejudicial, but would be unreasonable. And as stated in the Wells Case, supra, \u201cThe wrong and the harm was in the asking of the question.\u201d When applied to all the facts in the case at bar, and from the verdict rendered by the jury, there cannot be much doubt that the asking of this question had its effect upon the jury. And while not deciding that in every case where a question to which an objection is sustained by the trial court and the jury is instructed not to consider the same in its deliberations, is cause for reversing the case, yet, under all the facts and circumstances in this case, we have come to the conclusion that a reversal would be in the interest of justice, rather than a modification of this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\">In the brief filed by the state it is stated: \u201cWe admit that under the decisions of this court it was improper for the county attorney to ask such question\u201d, but contends that the evidence conclusively established the guilt of defendant and that he, therefore, suffered no injury by the asking of the question. It is contended that the entire record should be examined to' see if any material injury to the defendant appears, \u201cand unless such injury appears, the error will not be grounds for reversal\u201d. This is ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>actly wbat we have done, and come to the conclusion that it is best that the judgment and sentence be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\">We might further state that it is our judgment that it would probably have been better had the officers approached this defendant when they first saw him parked in his automobile in front of the Jones Drug Store on Highway No. 81, and at that time ascertained if the information they had obtained from the police officer was true. The chief of police, who was standing just across the street, could and should have accompanied them, and if they came to the conclusion that defendant was intoxicated to that extent, as they testified, he could have been charged with the crime of drunkenness in a public place, and could have been punished to the extent that justice would have been done. This, to our mind, would have been the better procedure, than to wait until he started his car and followed him and then charged him with the commission of a felony. He could have then been charged by the regularly constituted and elected officers of Kingfisher county, who are elected and must answer to- the people of that city and county. However, these officers are to' be commended in their effort to enforce the law Avithout fear or favor. This was soon after their appointment, and they were no doubt doing their duty as they saw fit.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Having come to' the conclusions as above stated it is unnecessary to pass upon the question presented by counsel to the violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right as to whether or not he was unlawfully arrested. By a reversal of this case justice can be administered as the facts justify.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We have examined the conduct of the trial of this case, and the instructions of the trial court, and will state that these instructions were in proper form and protected the rights of the defendant in every way. The term \u201cunder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the infuence olf intoxicating liquor\u201d was properly defined and defendant was given every right under the law to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">The judgment of the district court of Kingfisher county is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b242-5\">DOYLE, P.
