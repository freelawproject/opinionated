Schulz, was arrested and charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>crime of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. He had no prior arrest record and no citations for traffic violations for the past seven years. From the record it is evident that he had no familiarity with the criminal justice system. Five days after his arrest the defendant was arraigned. At said arraignment the following plea colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-3\">THE COURT: Okay, Mr. Schulz, you\u2019re charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. How do you plead?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-4\">MR. SCHULZ: Guilty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">THE COURT: Have you got a reading?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">MR.

SCHULZ: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-16\">THE COURT: You understand that the maximum penalty is six months in jail, five hundred dollar fine. Do you understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-17\">MR.

You\u2019re not suspended effective today. When you come back in eight weeks, then I take your license. You\u2019re free to drive now until you complete the program in eight weeks. Whether you complete it or not, I take your license. I give you in exchange a work permit and you are then under suspension for the next six months for driving under the influence, but you will be able to drive for emergency purposes and work purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">You will also be on six months non-reporting probation. You don\u2019t do anything. There\u2019s nothing you have to do \u2014 report to a probation officer or pay a fee or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">If you are arrested and convicted of a misdemeanor or felony within the six months, we\u2019ll bring you back, have a short hearing, if found guilty, put you in jail for the first six months.

SCHULZ: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-11\">THE COURT: Have a seat over here, Mr. Schulz.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">The Defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea of guilty on the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">1. The court failed to advise the defendant that he is entitled to be represented by an attorney and if he is unable to afford one he will be provided with the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">2. He was not advised that the state has the burden of proving the defendant to be guilty of the charge, to the exclusion of every reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">3. Failure to inform the defendant that he may confront and cross examine the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">4. That he had a right to subpoena witnesses in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">5. He was not advised of his right against self incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-18\">Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure 3.172, effective July 1, 1977, contains the procedure to be followed before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-19\">Except in the case of a defendant tried in absentia for a misdemeanor, the trial judge should, when determining voluntariness, place the defendant under oath and shall address the defendant personally and determine that he understands the following: (1) The nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law; and (2) If the defendant is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>represented by an attorney, that he has the right to be represented by an attorney at every stage of the proceeding against him and, if necessary, one will be appointed to represent him; and (3) That he has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that plea if it has already been made, and that he has the right to be tried by a jury and at that trial he has the right to the assistance of counsel, the right to compel attendance of witnesses on his behalf, the right to confront and cross examine witnesses against him, and the right not to be compelled to incriminate himself; (4) That if he pleads guilty or nolo contendere without express reservation of right to appeal, he gives up his right to appeal, he gives up his right to appeal all matters relating to the judgment, including the issue of guilt or innocence, but he does not impair his right to review by appropriate collateral attack; (5) That if he pleads guilty or is adjudged guilty after a plea of nolo contendere there will not be a further trial of any kind, so that by pleading guilty or nolo contendere he waives the right to trial; and (6) That if he pleads guilty or nolo contendere, the trial judge may ask him questions about the offense to which he has pleaded, and if he answers these questions under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel, his answers may later be used against him in a prosecution for prejury; and (7) The complete terms of any plea agreement, including specifically all obligations the defendant will incur as a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">The record clearly reveals an absence of substantial compliance with Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure 3.172. Appellants motion to withdraw plea of guilty made by the defendant should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
