And finally, which portions of the appeal hearing were relied upon to justify his dismissal of the Appellant, as distinguished from the recommended reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">This action of the Court is taken pursuant to Rule 9.600 of The Florida Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
