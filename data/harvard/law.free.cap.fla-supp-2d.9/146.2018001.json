He appeals the conviction on the ground that he did not enter a knowing and voluntary plea. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>The entire transcript of testimony at the arraignment is reprinted below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-4\">THE COURT: Giovann Linzalone? How are you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">THE WITNESS: Okay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-6\">THE COURT: How do you wish to plead today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">THE WITNESS: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the first time I have been here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">THE COURT: Well, it\u2019s the first time for most of the people that are in here today. You are charged with driving under the influence. What was his reading?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">MR. CATALONA: .14</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-10\">THE COURT: Do you wish to plead guilty or not guilty? You have a right to plead not guilty; you have a right to a trial you have a right to an attorney. We will not furnish one for you, that is, we won\u2019t pay for one but you can get one and have one, if you like.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-11\">THE WITNESS: If I plead guilty, I have to pay the fine right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-12\">THE COURT: Most of it, some of it, a large portion of it. How much do you have with you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-13\">THE WITNESS: Well, not enough. Would it be better if I went to Countermeasure school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-14\">MR. CATALONA: I\u2019d like to point out Judge, that it would be best for him. Judge Simms will more than likely be here the next time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-15\">THE COURT: It\u2019s going to cost you ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">MR. CATALANO: If you come to trial and Judge Simms is here, Judge Simms standard policy is, she adjudicates right then and there, and if you\u2019ve got the school finished, at that time, she will offer you a permit \u2014 that is, at the time of your adjudication. If not, you will have no license to drive home. So that\u2019s something to keep in mind, the difference between Judges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">THE COURT: Well, they can tell the difference between Judge Simms and me. She doesn\u2019t have a white beard. Well, sir, what do you want to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-18\">THE WITNESS: Well, I need a Work Permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-19\">THE COURT: So?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-20\">THE WITNESS: If I plead guilty now ... .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>THE COURT: I\u2019ll take your plea now, but I won\u2019t adjudicate you now, if that\u2019s what you want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">MR. CATALANO: So, you\u2019re going to come back with the school finished\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">THE COURT: Complete the school for sentencing, get there tomorrow and get it done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">MR. CATALANO: Just go have a seat over there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">THE COURT: Continued to the Defendant for sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ass\">(Thereupon, the proceedings were concluded.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">There are no words uttered by the Appellant which constitute the entering of a guilty plea. Nor do we find, as the State urges, that a form which contains a checked box next to the word \u201cguilty\u201d is a legally sufficient substitute for a clearly articulated plea of guilty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Finding no evidence of the entry of a guilty plea, we need not reach the question of whether the trial court complied with the procedure mandated by Rule 3.172 of the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">Reversed and remanded to the trial Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-13\"> Furthermore, there is no evidence indicating how, when or by whom the box was checked.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
