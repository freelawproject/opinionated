FRIEDMAN, District Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b41-24\">At this late stage, defendants have moved for leave t\u00f3 late file a declaration from Dr. B. Kelly Eakin of Laurits R. Christensen Associates, Inc. Dr. Eakin purportedly was the \u201clead investigator and author\u201d of certain portions of a study (the \u201cChristensen Study\u201d) commissioned by the Surface Transportation Board that was published in November 2009. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Reply Ex. 115 (filed May 28, 2014) [Dkt. No. 711-24]. Plaintiffs\u2019 experts have cited that study as support for. their use of a constant fuel coefficient in their regression models, which defendants\u2019 expert disputes. Plaintiffs oppose defendants\u2019 motion. After careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and the relevant legal authorities, the Court denies leave to late file the declaration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">As an initial matter, defendants\u2019 contention that expert discovery is open, and thus that Rule 16(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is not controlling, is incorr\u00e9ct. Expert discovery in this case is closed. On remand from the D.C. Circuit, this Court reopened expert discovery for the limited purpose of supplemental briefing and expert reports, which closed on July 21, 2014 with the filing of defendants\u2019 supplemental sur-reply. <em>See </em>October 31, 2013 Stipulation and Order [Dkt. No. 694]. And on November 26, 2014, the Court granted plaintiffs limited leave to file a supplemental expert report in light of revelations regarding the credibility of plaintiffs\u2019 original expert. November 26/2014 Opinion and' Order [Dkt. No. 756]. Defendants similarly were granted leave to file a supplemental expert report in response. <em>Id. </em>The Court did not, however, reopen expert discovery for all purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The scheduling order in this case \u25a0 \u201cmay be modified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d Fed R. Civ. \u25a0 Pro. 16(b). \u201c[R]eopening discovery ... [therefore] require[s] a showing of good cause.\u201d <em>Watt v. All Clear Business Solutions, LLC, </em>840 F.Supp.2d 324, 326 (D.D.C.2012) (quoting <em>U.S. ex rel. Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment Ctrs. of Am., </em>576 F.Supp.2d 128, 133 (D.D.C.2008)). Courts generally consider six factors when determining whether to reopen discovery: \u201c(1) whether trial is imminent; (2) whether the request is opposed; (3) whether the non-moving party would be prejudiced; (4) whether the moving party was diligent in obtaining discovery within the guidelines established by the court; (5) the foreseeability of the need for additional discovery in light of the time allotted by the district court; and (6) the likelihood that the discovery will lead to relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Childers v. Slater, </em>197 F.R.D. 185, 188 (D.D.C.2000)). \u201c[Wjhether to ... reopen discovery is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Childers v. Slater, </em>197 F.R.D. at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Although one factor weighs in favor of defendants\u2014the class certification hearing is not imminent, let alone trial\u2014the remaining five do not. Plaintiffs\u2019 expert first cited the Christensen Study in May 2014 in his supplemental expert report in support of plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental reply. <em>See </em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Supplemental Reply Ex. A, Supplemental Reply Expert Report of Gordon Rausser, Ph.d (filed May 28, 2014) [Dkt. No. 711-1]. Because plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental reply \u201ccontain[ed] new economic analyses and opinions,\u201d defendants sought and were granted leave to file a sur-reply and \u00e1 \"further supplemental expert report. See July 1, 2014 Order [Dkt. No. 717]. And defendants\u2019 expert\u2019s sur-reply report devoted numerous pages to responding to plaintiffs\u2019 expert\u2019s, use of the Christensen Study. <em>See </em>Defendants\u2019 Sur-Reply Ex. 1, Sur-Reply Declaration of Joseph ,P. Kalt, Ph.D at 6-13, 20 (filed July 21, 2014) [Dkt. No. 720-1]. As defendants have failed to offer any explanation for the delay in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>mitting Dr. Eakin\u2019s declaration regarding the study, defendants have not demonstrated that they were diligent in pursuing discovery within the established deadlines or that the need for Dr. Eakin\u2019s declaration was not foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The Court also is persuaded that Dr. Eakin\u2019s declaration, at this late stage, would unfairly prejudice plaintiffs and necessitate even further additional discovery. Dr. Eakin was but one of many authors of the Christiansen Study. Dr. Eakin\u2019s declaration thus would require a new round of discovery to allow plaintiffs to determine the extent of Dr. Eakin\u2019s role and the opinions of the other authors. And lastly, the Court is unconvinced that Dr. Eakin\u2019s declaration would be particularly relevant or helpful. As defendants have stated, \u201c[t]he Christensen Study is what it is\u201d and it should stand for itself. Mot. at 12. Defendants therefore have failed to demonstrate good cause to permit the reopening of expert discovery to late file Dr. Eakin\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">ORDERED that defendants\u2019 motion for leave to late file testimony from Dr. B. Kelly Eakin [Dkt. No. 769] is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">.
