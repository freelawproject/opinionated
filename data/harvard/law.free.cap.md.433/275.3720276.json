Alston, was arrested and subsequently charged with multiple counts of possession of a regulated firearm by a person with a prior conviction,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>count of wearing and carrying a handgun, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 36B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petitioner was tried, by jury, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. During the trial, the petitioner and the State stipulated that the petitioner had previously been convicted of a crime, distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>prohibited his possession of a regulated firearm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the jury was asked to decide only whether the petitioner possessed a firearm, not to determine the nature of, or the circumstances surrounding, the petitioner\u2019s previous conviction, <em>ie., </em>whether it was violent. The jury returned a verdict convicting the petitioner of the handgun offense and two counts of possession of a regulated firearm by a person with a prior conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the petitioner argued that the penalty provision of Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 5-622 of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCL\u201d), rather than Article 27, \u00a7 449(e), was the applicable provision. The trial court rejected that argument. Instead, on August 13, 2003, the trial court sentenced the petitioner as follows: for one of the possession counts, to the enhanced sentence prescribed by Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.) Article 27, \u00a7 449(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>five years without the possibility of parole; for the other possession count, pursuant to \u00a7 445(d)(1)(iii),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a consecutive two year sentence; and, for wearing and carrying a handgun, two years concurrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The petitioner\u2019s timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals resulted in the vacation, as duplicitous, of the conviction and sentence for possession of a regulated firearm by a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor. <em>Alston v. State, </em>159 Md.App. 253, 274, 858 A.2d 1100, 1112 (2004). On the other hand, the intermediate appellate court rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument that he erroneously had been sentenced pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 449(e). The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cThe appellant maintains that, because he could have been convicted under [Criminal Law Article] section 5-622 for the same conduct for which he was convicted under section 445(d)(1)(ii) of Article 27, and a conviction under [Criminal Law Article] section 5-622 would have carried a prison sentence of no more than five years, without a non-eligibility for suspension or parole requirement, under the \u2018rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>lenity,\u2019 he could not be sentenced to the mandatory minimum five years without suspension or non-eligibility for parole under section 449(e).\u201d Rather, his sentence could be no more than that authorized under [Criminal Law Article] section 5-622. \u201cThe rule of lenity is a principle of statutory construction providing, in its most general application, that, in cases of ambiguity, doubts shall be resolved in favor of criminal defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>Id., </em>159 Md.App. at 270-71, 858 A.2d at 1110 (citations omitted). Concluding that neither statute was ambiguous and that there was no ambiguity as between the provisions, it explained that \u201cthe rule of lenity is not triggered. The State had discretion to prosecute the appellant under the provision carrying the stiffer penalty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>159 Md.App. at 273, 858 A.2d at 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The petitioner, aggrieved by the remaining conviction and, especially, the enhanced sentence, filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, asking us to address and decide two issues: (1) whether the petitioner, who had a prior non-violent felony conviction,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> was wrongly subjected to an enhanced penalty under Article 27, \u00a7 449(e); and (2) whether the rule of lenity required that the petitioner be sentenced in accordance with Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 5-622(c), rather than pursuant to \u00a7 449(e) or its successor, Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 5-133(c)(2) of the Public Safety Article (\u201cPS\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>granted the petitioner\u2019s petition. <em>Alston v. State, </em>390 Md. 500, 889 A.2d 418 (2006). We shall answer only the first question and in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Our answer is predicated on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Stanley v. State, </em>390 Md. 175, 887 A.2d 1078 (2005). In that case, we held that \u00a7 449(e) is clear and unambiguous, and that its plain meaning requires that the predicate prior conviction be for a crime that is both violent and felonious. <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 183-84, 887 A.2d at 1082-83. Accordingly, we shall vacate the petitioner\u2019s sentence for possession of a regulated firearm and remand the matter for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The first question with which we are presented is whether a person with a prior nonviolent felony conviction may be sentenced to the enhanced sentence prescribed by Article 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u00a7 449(e). This is the question left open by Price <em>v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 384 n. 4, 835 A.2d 1221, 1225 n. 4 (2003): \u201cwhether \u00a7 449(e)\u2019s mandatory sentencing imperative requires a conviction under both \u00a7 445(d)(1)(f) and (ii), as the plain language indicates.\u201d The issue in Price was whether daytime housebreaking, a felony, was a crime of violence under \u00a7 441(e). 378 Md. at 384, 835 A.2d at 1224. In answering the question presented, the Court addressed and determined the structure of section 449(e), observing, in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cSection 449 (e), by its plain structure, is divided into two requirements. The first requirement is that the defendant have a previous conviction of a crime that falls within \u00a7 441(e). The second requirement is that the defendant have a current conviction under \u00a7 445(d)(1)(i) and (ii).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_l\"><em>Id. </em>Despite having flagged the issue and, as we have seen, concluded that the language defining the second requirement was unambiguous, <em>id., </em>378 Md. at 384 n. 4, 835 A.2d at 1225 n. 4, the Court declined to address whether there had been compliance with the second requirement of section 449(e), the issue not having been raised. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">This open question was answered in <em>Stanley, </em>390 Md. at 182, 887 A.2d at 1082. In doing so, we proceeded from the premise that this Court unanimously had considered and adopted in <em>Price </em>\u2014 the issue on which we granted \u201ccert\u201d was \u201cwhether legislative history, pre- and post-enactment, may trump the plain and clear and unambiguous language of a statute\u201d \u2014 that section 449(e) is clear and unambiguous. <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 182, 887 A.2d at 1082. In <em>Stanley, </em>the petitioner had received an enhanced sentence under \u00a7 449(e) on the basis of the petitioner\u2019s conviction for second-degree assault, a crime of violence, but not a felony. <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 177, 887 A.2d at 1079. We construed the penalty provision, Article 27, \u00a7 449(e), and determined that it was clear and unambiguous, requiring, to be subject to the enhanced penalty it prescribes, that a person \u201cbe \u2018in illegal possession of a firearm as defined in \u00a7 445(d)(i) and (ii),\u2019 and been convicted previously of a crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441(e) or been convicted of certain enumerated drug offenses.\u201d <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 183, 887 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>A.2d at 1082 (citing <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 384, 835 A.2d at 1224 (determining whether daytime housebreaking was a crime of violence under \u00a7 441(e))).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">On that basis, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cThe definition of the illegal possession targeted for purposes of this statute ... consists of two elements and is stated in the conjunctive. Consequently, both elements must be met; it is not sufficient if only one is present. That means, since the definition includes a crime of violence and \u2018any violation classified as a felony in this State/ that a conviction of both, not just one, must be established. Thus, it is not enough that the person be convicted of a crime of violence under \u00a7 441(e). On the contrary, unless the illegal possession of the firearm is established by proof of a \u2018violation classified as a felony/ the establishment of the crime of violence under \u00a7 441(e) could not trigger the enhanced punishment. Were it otherwise, we would not give the entire statute effect and, in fact, we would be rendering the conjunction, \u2018and/ superfluous. Moreover, we would be adding a word, \u2018or/ to the statute that the General Assembly did not. It is a well settled canon of statutory construction that we should, when interpreting a statute, give effect to all of the language and avoid a construction that renders any portion superfluous. <em>Design Kitchen and Baths v. Lagos, 388 </em>Md. 718, 729, 882 A.2d 817, 823-24 (2005); <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1114 (2005); <em>Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 59, 702 A.2d 699, 719 (1997). We have also recognized that \u2018Where the words of a statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning/ the Court will give effect to the statute as the language is written. <em>Moore v. Miley, </em>372 Md. 663, 677, 814 A.2d 557, 566 (2003).\u201d <em>See Moore, </em>388 Md. 446, 453, 879 A.2d 1111, 1114 (\u2018if the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute, we give effect to the statute as it is written\u2019). Just as a court may not render statutory language surplusage, it may neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. <em>Price, </em>378 Md. at 387, 835 A.2d at 1226 (2003).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2k\"><em>Id., 390 </em>Md. at 183-84, 887 A.2d at 1082-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The clarity and unambiguity of the statute also trumped, we further held, the State\u2019s claim that the Court\u2019s construction was illogical and irrational. <em>Id., </em>390 Md. at 184, 887 A.2d at 1083. We pointed out: \u201cEven if it may be, to us, illogical and irrational, there is no basis for the Court to refuse to give effect to the clear direction of the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Subsequent to <em>Stanley, </em>therefore, while a defendant previously convicted of a felony that was not also a crime of violence was properly charged pursuant to \u00a7 445(d), that defendant was not subject to sentencing pursuant to \u00a7 449(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In this case, the prosecution proved only that the petitioner had a prior conviction for a felony; it failed to prove the petitioner also had a prior conviction for a crime of violence. Accordingly, in light of our ruling in <em>Stanley v. State, </em>the petitioner\u2019s sentence should be vacated, and the case remanded for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The State agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The second question the petitioner asks us to resolve is whether, pursuant to the rale of lenity, the petitioner was required to be sentenced pursuant to CL \u00a7 5-622, one of the two statutes punishing the conduct for which he was sentenced, because it prescribed a more lenient sentence than that mandated by the statute under which he was sentenced or its successor. Before answering that question, we must, as a threshold matter, address an issue raised by the State, whether, because it is moot as to the petitioner, the Court should consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The Maryland law of mootness is well settled. We have opined often that \u201c[a] question is [rendered] moot if, at the time it is before the court, there is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any effective remedy which the court can provide.\u201d <em>Attorney General v. Anne Arundel County School Bus Contractors Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>286 Md. 324, 327, 407 A.2d 749, 752 (1979). <em>See also In re Joseph </em>N., 407 Md. 278, 301, 965 A.2d 59 (2009); <em>Cottman v.

While there is no constitutional impediment to an appellate court \u201cexpressing its views on the merits of a case which becomes moot during appellate proceedings,\u201d <em>State v. Peterson, </em>315 Md. 73, 82, 553 A.2d 672, 677 (1989) (citing <em>Reyes v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>281 Md. 279, 380 A.2d 12 (1977)), \u201c[o]rdinarily, courts will not decide moot or abstract questions, or render advisory opinions.\u201d <em>Creveling v. Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. Co., </em>376 Md. 72, 83 n. 3, 828 A.2d 229, 236 n. 3 (2003); <em>Anne Arundel County School Bus Contractors Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>286 Md. at 327, 407 A.2d at 752; <em>State v. Ficker, </em>266 Md. 500, 506-07, 295 A.2d 231, 235 (1972). On the rare occasions when the court exercises the authority to decide moot cases, <em>see In re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 680, 516 A.2d 976, 979 (1986), it does so because \u201cthere is an imperative and manifest urgency to establish a rule of future conduct in matters of important public concern <em>...,\u201d Anne Arundel County School Bus Contractors Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>286 Md. at 328, 407 A.2d at 752; <em>see also Cottman, </em>395 Md. at 745, 912 A.2d at 629; <em>Robinson v.

Roth, </em>398 Md. 137, 143-44, 919 A.2d 1217, 1221 (2007) (quoting <em>Coburn, </em>342 Md. at 250, 674 A.2d at 954).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The State is correct, insofar as the petitioner is concerned, that this case is moot. The petitioner does not disagree. Indeed he concedes that he \u201chas served his entire five year sentence and has been mandatorily released.\u201d For that reason, citing the well settled mootness doctrine, the State urges us not to decide the petitioner\u2019s second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The petitioner sees it differently. He argues that, although moot, as its existence will have no direct impact on him, \u201cthe issue of disparate penalties for the possession of a regulated firearm by a person previously convicted of a drug-related felony is still alive after this Court\u2019s <em>Stanley </em>decision....\u201d As we have seen, \u00a7\u00a7 445(d) and 449(e) have been replaced by CL \u00a7 5-133(e), pursuant to which the possession of a regulated firearm by one previously convicted of a drug-related felony is punished by the enhanced penalty previously prescribed in \u00a7 449(e). This is in contrast to \u00a7 5-622, which continues to carry a five year maximum sentence and fine. Thus, a defendant sentenced for a violation of CL \u00a7 5-133(a)(2) necessarily will receive a harsher sentence than if he or she had been sentenced for a violation of \u00a7 5-622, which proscribes the identical conduct. What to make of this disparity in penalties and how to resolve it are, the petitioner posits, \u201cmatters of important public concern that, if decided, will establish a rule for future conduct.\u201d Roth, <em>supra, </em>and, therefore, \u201cmerit an expression of our views for the guidance of courts and litigants in the future.\u201d <em>In re Special Investigation No. 281, </em>299 Md. at 190, 473 A.2d at 5. <em>See Robinson, </em>317 Md. at 375-76, 564 A.2d at 397; <em>Ficker, </em>266 Md. at 507, 295 A.2d at 235 (\u201can appeal, even though moot, will not be dismissed where the urgency of establishing a rule of future conduct in matters of important public concern is both imperative and manifest.\u201d); <em>Lloyd, </em>206 Md. at 43, 111 A.2d at 381-382. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>As the State sees it, the issue raised by this second question relates to the prosecution function and the exercise of discretion by the prosecutor. Thus, the State argues that the decision to prosecute identical conduct \u2014 identical in substance and classification \u2014 under a statutory provision that carries a harsher penalty than another statutory provision, that could, and does, encompass such conduct, falls exclusively within the purview of prosecutorial discretion. A prosecutor, the State adds, does not need the court\u2019s approval to make that determination. It relies on <em>Murphy v. Yates, </em>276 Md. 475, 495, 348 A.2d 837, 848 (1975) (characterizing the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s discretion to prosecute or not to prosecute as a \u201cmost awesome discretionary power\u201d); <em>Purohit v. State, </em>99 Md.App. 566, 577, 638 A.2d 1206, 1207 (1994), <em>cert denied </em>335 Md. 698, 646 A.2d 364 (1994) (\u201cIt is well settled that a State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s power to institute a criminal prosecution is replete with broad discretion\u201d); and <em>Gray v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 343, 358, 380 A.2d 1071, 1081 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>282 Md. 732 (1978) (noting the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cright, without court approval, to determine what evidence he would present as well as the form in which it was to be presented\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The State also relies on <em>U.S. v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although conceding that it is not binding authority for this Court, it finds it \u201chighly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>instructive\u201d and urges its application by analogy. That case involved two overlapping provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and presented for decision whether, where both proscribe the same conduct, receipt of firearms by convicted felons, but each authorizes different maximum penalties, \u201ca defendant convicted of the offense carrying the greater penalty may be sentenced only under the more lenient provision when his conduct violates both statutes.\u201d <em>Id., </em>442 U.S. at 115-16, 99 S.Ct. at 2200, 60 L.Ed.2d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The defendant was charged with, and tried under, the provision of the Act, whose sentencing provision mandated the greater sentence, and he was sentenced accordingly. <em>Id., </em>442 U.S. at 116, 99 S.Ct. at 2200, 60 L.Ed.2d at 759-60. The appellate court affirmed the conviction, but, noting that the substantive elements of the provision carrying the lesser penalty were identical and relying on, inter alia, the rule of lenity, ordered that his sentence be reduced and capped at the lower maximum. <em>Id., </em>442 U.S. at 116-18, 99 S.Ct. at 2200-01, 60 L.Ed.2d at 760-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The Supreme Court reversed.

He reasons that, since the conduct proscribed by both statutes and which the jury found the petitioner guilty of committing is the same, the only question left is what is the proper sentence to be imposed. Proceeding from that premise, the petitioner submits that it is not at all clear as to how he should be sentenced and, more to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>the point, pursuant to which of the two applicable statutes. That is so, he points out, because neither statute references the other, and each simply prescribes a penalty. He therefore argues that, where a defendant is convicted of an act that may be punished under more than one statute, each prescribing a different penalty, and it is unclear as to how they interrelate and, thus, the one pursuant to which sentence should be imposed, that defendant must be sentenced pursuant to the statute that carries the lesser penalty. The petitioner finds support for that argument in the rule of lenity, as interpreted and applied by this State\u2019s courts, <em>Waye, </em>231 Md. 510, 191 A.2d 428, and fundamental fairness, which dictates the notice criminal statutes are required to give with regard to what conduct is criminal and the penalty for engaging in such conduct. To the petitioner, consequently, it is of significant importance that there is ambiguity as to which statute applies and that there is a need for defendants to know not only what conduct is criminal, but also the specific penalty for that specific criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We agree with the petitioner, this case presents a sentencing, rather than prosecutorial discretion,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> issue. To the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>tent that sentencing is implicated, also implicated is statutory construction and, because it is a canon of construction, the rule of lenity.

We, therefore, hold that under such circumstances the prosecution may, as heretofore, be brought under either section. However, we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>believe that the Legislature intended to create such an anomalous and incongruous situation as to limit the penalty, when a worthless check and property valued at less than $100 are involved, to $50 and eighteen months\u2019 confinement when the prosecution is under \u00a7 142, but to permit a much higher and more severe penalty under identical facts simply because someone decides to bring the prosecution under \u00a7 140. We, therefore (without considering possible constitutional aspects that a contrary ruling might produce), hold that the amendment of \u00a7 142 in 1955 amended, or modified, \u00a7 140 to the extent that when there is a conviction under \u00a7 140 for the giving of a worthless check and the property obtained is valued at less than $100, the maximum penalty that may be imposed is a fine of $50 and eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment. Compare Chapter 616 of the Acts of 1961, Section 109(18).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><em>Waye, </em>231 Md. at 516, 191 A.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">To be sure, in holding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was limited to the lesser penalty, the Court did not expressly rely on the rule of lenity, or even mention it, focusing instead on the construction rule that repeals by implication are disfavored. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, we believe that <em>Waye </em>is consistent with, if not, in reality, an application of, the rule of lenity. Because, as we have seen, repeal by implication is disfavored, it is well settled \u201cthat a repeal by implication does not occur unless the language of the later statute plainly shows that the legislature intended to repeal the earlier statute,\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>327 Md. 32, 39, 607 A.2d 552, 555 (1992) (citing <em>Montgomery County v. Bigelow, </em>196 Md. 413, 423, 77 A.2d 164, 167-68 (1950)); <em>Pressman v. Elgin, </em>187 Md. 446, 450, 50 A.2d 560, 563 (1947), which generally requires some express reference to the earlier statute. <em>Gannon &amp; Son v. Emerson, </em>291 Md. 443, 455, 435 A.2d 449, 455 (1981) (quoting <em>Kirkwood v. Provident Savings Bank, </em>205 Md. 48, 55, 106 A.2d 103, 107 (1954)); <em>Thomas v. State, </em>173 Md. 676, 681, 197 A. 296, 299 (1938). There, in amending the statute to reduce the penalty for worthless checks under $100, the Legislature did not refer to the other statute and there was nothing in the language of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>the amendment that plainly shows that the Legislature intended to repeal that earlier statute to the extent of that amendment. Nor was there any indication given in the amendment as to how the two statutes were to interrelate. These omissions undoubtedly were the basis for the belief the Court expressed as to the Legislature\u2019s intent. They are no less relevant to, and available to support, a lenity analysis. In any event, as the petitioner urges, at the very least, <em>Waye </em>\u201cshows this Court\u2019s disinclination toward disparate punishments for the same offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The State distinguishes <em>Waye </em>and urges that we follow the analysis of the Supreme Court in <em>Batchelder. </em>With respect to the former, it believes it significant that, in this case, the subject firearm statutes are in different articles of the Code, while in <em>Waye, </em>the statutes were in the same section, if not a part of a single statutory scheme. The State also believes that the enactment of \u00a7 5-133\u2019s predecessor as a part of the Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000 and its purpose of providing harsher sentences for certain persons, including convicted felons, with serious prior offenses, who possess handguns and other regulated firearms further distinguishes <em>Waye </em>and justifies the result in this case. With regard to <em>Batchelder, </em>of course the State stresses the charging aspect, but, in addition, urges the overall logic of the decision, including that it rejected the applicability of the rule of lenity to a fact pattern much like the one <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">We are not persuaded. First, we agree that \u00a7 449(e), predecessor to Public Safety \u00a7 5-133, as a part of the Responsible Gun Safety Act of 2000, was enacted \u201cto make a harsher penalty available in cases where persons with serious prior offenses possessed handguns and other regulated firearms.\u201d Acknowledging this to be so does not explain the different, more lenient penalty prescribed by Criminal Law \u00a7 5-622, or more to the point, reconcile the legislative intent underlying its enactment. Second, we do not understand the <em>Waye </em>analysis to apply only when statutes that are a part of a single statutory scheme provide for different penalties. Nowhere in the opinion is that mentioned as a factor, never mind a critical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>one, in the decision. Nor is such a consideration evident from the Court\u2019s analysis. In fact just the opposite is the case. What this Court determined to be relevant to the decision in that case were reflected in the questions it posed as necessary to be answered and the answers themselves: that there are two statutes, without clear legislative intent, providing for different penalties, one substantially more lenient than the other, for identical conduct. As we read <em>Waye, </em>when those circumstances co-exist, wherever in the Code the \u201cconflicting\u201d penalty statutes may be placed, those statutes must be read together and harmonized. <em>See Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 693-94, 861 A.2d 727, 733 (2004) (construing statutes \u201cincongruous[ly] codif[ied]\u201d and commenting on the \u201cinterpretive difficulties such arrangements of the Code may cause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">As we have seen, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 60 L.Ed.2d 755, refused to apply the rule of lenity in a case in which there was a partial redundancy and a discernable disparity in the penalties prescribed by two statutes, concluding that there was, in that case, \u201cno ambiguity to resolve.\u201d <em>Id., </em>442 U.S. at 121, 99 S.Ct. at 2203, 60 L.Ed.2d at 763. The Court noted, in that regard, the absence of anything in the language, structure, or legislative history of the Omnibus Act to suggest that Congress intended to give the defendant the benefit of the lesser penalty, that the statutes operated independently of each other, <em>id., </em>442 U.S. at 118, 99 S.Ct. at 2201, 60 L.Ed.2d at 761, and that Congress conveyed its purpose clearly. <em>Id., </em>442 U.S. at 122, 99 S.Ct. at 2203, 60 L.Ed.2d at 763. Thus, the Court considered each statute separately and independently. That is inconsistent with our approach, which is to consider them together when the interplay between them is the issue. <em>Gardner, </em>344 Md. at 649, 689 A.2d at 613. Moreover, the <em>Batchelder </em>analysis is at odds with the analytical approach taken by this Court in <em>Waye </em>as a matter of State non constitutional law. That approach, in turn, is similar to the approach of the Supreme Court of the State of Colorado as reflected in <em>Colorado v. Estrada, </em>198 Colo. 188, 601 P.2d 619 (1979). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>court declined to follow <em>Batchelder </em>on state law grounds, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-5\">\u201cWe are not persuaded by the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning on this issue and expressly decline to apply it to our own State Constitution\u2019s due process equal protection guarantee. ...

Clements, </em>241 Kan. 77, 734 P.2d 1096, 1100 (1987), in which, explaining the rationale of its decision to reject the Batchelder due process and equal protection rationale, the Supreme Court of Kansas stated: \u201c[T]he decision as to which penalty to seek cannot be a matter of prosecutorial whimsy in charging.\u201d) We reject the Batchelder analysis insofar as it relates to sentencing.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that where two statutes punish the same conduct, but impose different penalties, the defendant is convicted pursuant to the one carrying the more severe penalty and the Legislature\u2019s intent with regard to how the statutes are to be applied and operate together is unclear, the rule of lenity applies and, as a result, the defendant must be sentenced pursuant to the statute carrying the more lenient penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

That is not so clear. The petitioner\u2019s cert petition argued that the conduct that formed the basis for his conviction was punishable by two statutes, one more harshly than the other and, therefore, the rule of lenity required that he be sentenced in accordance with the one prescribing the more lenient sentence. Section 449(f) was not one of those statutes. While clearly a disparity would still exist, albeit between the characterization of the offense, rather than the severity of the sentence, once it was determined that \u00a7 449(e) did not apply, that is not the disparity or the statute even that was raised in the petition as the basis for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b308-9\">.

He must be trusted with broad official discretion to institute and prosecute criminal causes, <em>subject generally to judicial control. </em>184 Md. 86, 90, 40 A.2d 319, 321 (1944) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b321-7\">.

Did the Legislature intend to limit the penalty under the above circumstances if the prosecution be brought under \u00a7 142, but permit the higher penalty (up to ten years, and contrary to the above quoted provisions of \u00a7 142), if, under identical facts, the prosecution be brought under \u00a7 140?\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-9\"><em>Waye v.

There is no inconsistency between <em>Waye </em>and <em>Batchelder </em>so far as charging is concerned. In <em>Waye, </em>as in <em>Batchelder, </em>we rejected the argument that the existence of disparate sentencing provisions impacted the prosecution function, requiring that the defendant be prosecuted pursuant to the statute prescribing the more lenient sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>RAKER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHO\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">I join in Part A only of this opinion.
