Specifically, the United States Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) has determined that an individual is not qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that individual currently suffers from certain cardiovascular diseases. The State of Maryland followed the lead of the federal government and adopted the same standard for bus operators employed by the Maryland Transit Administration (\u201cMTA\u201d). We are tasked with determining whether MTA violated the ADA by firing Anthony Zei, a bus operator who failed to meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Under the collective bargaining agreement between the MTA and Zei\u2019s labor union \u2014 the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1300 \u2014 every bus driver must obtain a medical certification verifying that he is physically fit to operate a bus. This certification must be renewed every two years. If the Union disagrees with the findings of the medical certification, the Union may select a doctor of its choice to perform a second evaluation. If the original doctor and the Union\u2019s doctor cannot reach a consensus on the certification of the driver, then both doctors will \u201cjointly select a third doctor to review the case\u201d and this third doctor\u2019s \u201cdecision shall be final and binding on both parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Zei began his employment as a bus driver for the MTA in 1991. By all accounts, Zei was \u201ca very good bus driver.\u201d On December 3, 2004, Zei underwent a \u201cworkability evaluation\u201d performed by Dr. Hench for the purpose of obtaining his necessary medical certification to operate a bus. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>evaluation, Dr. Hench discovered that Zei had previously been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, and that Zei had \u201cbeen symptomatic over the past year with shortness of breath and fatigue.\u201d Dr. Hench reported that Zei\u2019s cardiomyopathy disqualified him from the position of bus driver \u201cbased upon the Medical Guidelines of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ... because of his increased risk of sudden death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In January 2005, Zei consulted his own cardiologist, Dr. Gottlieb, who had been treating him since 2003. Dr. Gottlieb instructed Zei to undergo a radiology study. Based upon the results of that study, Dr. Gottlieb concluded that Zei did not have \u201csymptomatic heart failure\u201d and that \u201cZei has medical clearance to return to work with no restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Dr. Gottlieb and Dr. Hench could not come to an agreement, however, and the two doctors agreed to refer the case to a third doctor \u2014 Dr. Hartenbaum \u2014 whose determination would become final. Dr. Hartenbaum \u201cdetermined that Zei was not qualified to drive under the \u2018medical criteria\u2019 set forth in the Cardiovascular Guidelines.\u201d As a result, on September 1, 2005, the MTA discharged Zei from its employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">In December 2005, Zei brought this action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging that the MTA had violated his rights under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 504\u2014commonly known as the Rehabilitation Act. The case went to trial, and a jury found the MTA guilty of discrimination and awarded Zei $200,000. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed, holding that Zei\u2019s failure to satisfy the federally-created qualification standard for drivers of commercial motor vehicles rendered him unqualified for the position of MTA bus driver as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">On September 21, 2012, this Court granted a writ of certiorari, <em>Zei v. Maryland Transit Administration, </em>428 Md. 543, 52 A.3d 978 (2012), to answer the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">Did the Court of Special Appeals err by holding that Zei\u2019s inability, because of a heart condition, to meet the DOT standards (which the MTA applies voluntarily rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>under compulsion of federal law), render him unqualified <em>as a matter of law </em>for an MTA bus operator position?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We shall hold that the MTA\u2019s use of the federal regulation was a properly imposed \u201cqualification standard\u201d under the ADA, and therefore, Zei cannot succeed on his ADA claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In 1990, Congress passed the ADA \u201cto provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1) (2006). In relevant part, the Act provided that \u201c[n]o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to ... discharge of employees, ... and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12112(a), <em>amended by </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (Supp. II 2008). \u201cTo establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) that [he] is disabled within the meaning of the ADA; (2) that [he] is qualified with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) that [he] was discriminated against because of [his] disability.\u201d <em>Tate v. Farmland Indus., Inc., </em>268 F.3d 989, 992 (10th Cir.2001) (alterations in original) (citation and quotation marks omitted). At issue in this appeal, is the second prong\u2014 whether Zei was a qualified individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The ADA defined a \u201cqualified individual\u201d as \u201can individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>position that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8), <em>amended by </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (Supp. II 2008). To determine whether an individual is qualified for the position, the ADA allows an employer to impose \u201cqualification standards ... that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability,\u201d so long as the standards are \u201cshown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation. ...\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12113(a); <em>see also Albertson\u2019s, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, </em>527 U.S. 555, 568, 119 S.Ct. 2162, 2170, 144 L.Ed.2d 518 (1999). Thus, if an individual fails to meet a properly imposed qualification standard, then that individual is not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d for purposes of the ADA and cannot maintain a discrimination claim. <em>Tate, </em>268 F.3d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In this case, the MTA applied a federally-created job qualification standard contained in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (\u201cFMCSRs\u201d), which set forth the physical qualifications for drivers of commercial motor vehicles. Specifically, the FMCSRs contain a regulation governing the qualification of drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease, stating: \u201cA person is physically qualified to drive a commercial motor vehicle if that person ... [h]as no current clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, thrombosis, or any other cardiovascular disease of a variety known to be accompanied by syncope, dyspnea, collapse, or congestive cardiac failure.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4); <em>see also </em>35 Fed.Reg. 6458, 6463 (Apr. 22, 1970) (as amended by 35 Fed.Reg. 17418, 17420 (Nov. 13, 1970)). It is this qualification standard which the MTA applied, and Zei failed to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">In examining whether the MTA properly applied this qualification standard, we must resolve how the federally-created qualification standard of drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease interacts with the ADA, which allows employers to use qualification standards only if they are \u201cshown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12113(a). This inquiry, therefore, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>three-fold. First, are the requirements of 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4) \u201cjob-related\u201d and of \u201cbusiness necessity?\u201d Second, does the exemption of state governments from complying with the FMCSRs, found in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.3(f)(2), but followed by the State\u2019s voluntary adoption of the same standard, change the answer to the first question? Third, could the MTA have adopted a reasonable accommodation?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\n<em>FMCSRs as \u201cJob-Related\u201d and \u201cBusiness Necessity\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Fundamentally, the parties disagree over whether the ADA\u2019s requirements of being \u201cjob-related\u201d and of \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d must be shown in an individualized assessment of Zei, or whether Zei\u2019s heart condition, per se, renders him unqualified. Central to this debate are two additional regulations: (1) 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.15(e) \u2014 enacted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \u2014 which provides a complete defense to an ADA claim: \u201cIt may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under [the ADA] that a challenged action is required or necessitated by another Federal law or regulation;\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.3(f)(2) \u2014 enacted by the Federal Highway Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d) \u2014 which exempts state transportation agencies from complying with the FMCSRs: \u201cthe [FMCSRs] do not apply to ... Transportation performed by the Federal government, a State, or any political subdivision of a State, or an agency established under a compact between States that has been approved by the Congress of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Zei acknowledges that, in light of the defense in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.15(e), if the FMCSRs apply to the State, then the MTA will have a full defense against any discrimination action under the ADA as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Albertson\u2019s, </em>527 U.S. at 570, 119 S.Ct. at 2171 (holding that an employer has not violated the ADA if they have an \u201cunconditional obligation to follow the [FMCSRs]\u201d). Yet, Zei argues, the FMCSRs do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>apply in this case because the State is not required by federal law to follow them, but rather voluntarily adopted the standards found in the regulations. Zei contends that the complete defense found in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.15(e) was created \u201csolely on the need to relieve employers of the burden of complying with conflicting federal laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">To support this assertion, Zei relies on the legislative history of the ADA which reflects congressional recognition \u201cthat a person with a disability applying for or currently holding a job subject to [FMCSRs] must be able to satisfy any physical qualification standard that is job related and consistent with business necessity in order to be considered a qualified individual with a disability under title I of this legislation.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 57 (1990), <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 339. Nevertheless, Zei argues, Congress questioned whether the FMCSRs were consistent with the ADA and therefore instructed that \u201cthe Secretary of Transportation will undertake a thorough review of [the FMCSRs] to ascertain whether the standards conform with current knowledge about the capabilities of persons with disabilities\u201d and to \u201cmake any necessary changes within the two year period to bring such regulations into compliance with the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, Zei concludes: \u201cAn employer who has voluntarily adopted the DOT Standards does not face the conflicting federal obligations which serve as the sole justification for deeming the DOT Standards a complete defense in the mandatory-adoption scenario.... Congress certainly did not envision that courts would \u2018limit application of the ADA as a matter of law\u2019 when there was no need to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">In Zei\u2019s opinion, when an employer voluntarily adopts the regulations, the FMCSRs \u201care merely a factor for a jury to consider in determining whether an ADA violation has occurred.\u201d <em>See Bates v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>511 F.3d 974 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Cleary v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>313 F.Supp.2d 930 (E.D.Wis.2004); <em>Millage v. City of Sioux City, </em>258 F.Supp.2d 976 (N.D.Iowa 2003); <em>Tinjum v. Atl. Richfield Co., </em>109 Wash.App. 203, 34 P.3d 855 (2001). Therefore, argues Zei, MTA is required to conduct an individualized assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>to determine whether the FMCSRs are \u201cjob-related\u201d and of \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d as applied to Zei. <em>See Atkins v. Salazar, </em>677 F.3d 667, 683 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">To the contrary, MTA argues that the FMCSRs constitute qualification standards that as a matter of law satisfy the \u201cjob-related\u201d and \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d requirements of the ADA. <em>See Tate, </em>268 F.3d 989; <em>Bay v. Cassens Transp. Co., </em>212 F.3d 969 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Prado v. Cont\u2019l Air Transp. Co., </em>982 F.Supp. 1304 (N.D.Ill.1997); <em>Campbell v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>918 F.Supp. 912 (D.Md.1996). MTA argues that these cases treat the \u201cfailure to satisfy the DOT safety regulations as a disqualification from employment as a matter of law,\u201d and therefore, \u201cZei is ... mistaken in arguing that MTA was required to conduct an \u2018individualized assessment\u2019 to determine whether ... he could \u2018safely perform the duties\u2019 of an MTA bus driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Furthermore, relying on the history and purpose of the FMCSRs, MTA argues that it is irrelevant whether it was required by law to follow the regulations or whether it voluntarily adopted them. According to the MTA, the exemption of state governments from following the FMCSRs contained in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.3(f)(2) was based solely on federalism concerns \u2014 about the division of responsibilities between the federal and state governments \u2014 not a desire to relieve the states of safely conducting their transportation operations. Thus, MTA argues, the \u201creliance on federalism concerns in creating the state exemption, and encouragement of states to adopt the safety regulations, demonstrates that DOT did not intend to differentiate between vehicles operated by public and private motor carriers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">To resolve this debate, and determine whether the FMCSRs satisfy the \u201cjob-related\u201d and \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d requirements of the ADA as a matter of law, we will trace the development of the cardiovascular disease qualification standard contained in the FMCSRs and the legislative history of the ADA. Then, we will also examine the development of the state government exemption from the FMCSRs and Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>gress\u2019s subsequent legislative enactments to determine whether MTA\u2019s alleged \u201cvoluntary\u201d adoption of the FMCSRs affects our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\n<em>Legislative History of the ADA and Cardiovascular Disease Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The FMCSR setting forth the qualification of drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease \u2014 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4)\u2014 was originally enacted in 1970. At that time, the FHA deemed it necessary to completely revise the \u201cqualifications of drivers of commercial motor vehicles engaged in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 34 Fed.Reg. 9080, 9080 (June 7, 1969). Explaining its purpose in making the revision, the FHA explained that \u201c[ajceident experience in recent years has demonstrated that ... the good health of drivers are increasingly important factors in accident prevention[, and therefore, it is] necessary that criteria for determining whether individuals are qualified to drive commercial motor vehicles be upgraded.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 9081. Thus, the FHA sought to \u201csubstantially tighten the existing regulations by including guidelines for evaluation of persons in high-risk medical categories.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>In creating these guidelines for \u201chigh-risk medical categories,\u201d the FHA for the first time established qualifications for drivers of commercial motor vehicles who suffer from cardiovascular disease. Specifically, the revised FMCSRs provided that a driver is not qualified if he has a \u201ccurrent clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary insufficiency, thrombosis, or any other cardiovascular disease of a variety known to be accompanied by syncope, dyspnea, collapse, or congestive cardiac failure.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4); <em>see also </em>35 Fed.Reg. at 6463 (as amended by 35 Fed.Reg. at 17420).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">When Congress subsequently enacted the ADA, it was well aware of the FMCSRs and its potential to disqualify individuals with disabilities. Yet, Congress did not abolish the FMCSRs. Instead, evident from examining the legislative history of the ADA, Congress viewed the FMCSRs as qualification standards that would satisfy the \u201cjob-related\u201d and \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d requirements of the ADA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">With respect to covered entities subject to rules promulgated by the Department of Transportation regarding physical qualifications for drivers of certain classifications of motor vehicles, it is the Committee\u2019s intent that a person with a disability applying for or currently holding a job subject to these standards must be able to satisfy any physical qualification standard that is job related and consistent with business necessity in order to be considered a qualified individual with a disability under title I of this legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">In light of this legislation, the Committee expects that within two years from the date of enactment (the effective date of title I of this legislation), the Secretary of Transportation will undertake a thorough review of these regulations to ascertain whether the standards conform with current knowledge about the capabilities of persons with disabilities and currently available technological aids and devices and whether such regulations are valid under this Act. The Committee expects that the agency will make any necessary changes within the two year period to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>such regulations into compliance with the law. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 57 (1990), <em>reprinted in </em>1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 339. Indeed, because Congress fully understood that the FMCSRs would continue to exist as qualification standards under the ADA, Congress specifically instructed the Secretary of Transportation to perform a complete review of the FMCSRs and \u201cbring such regulations into compliance with the law.\u201d In other words, to resolve any potential conflict between the requirements of a qualification standard under the ADA and the existing FMCSRs, Congress required the Secretary of Transportation to make sure that all existing FMCSRs were \u201cjob-related\u201d and of \u201cbusiness necessity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">By 1992, the FHA had completed an entire review of the FMCSRs \u201cto identify and eliminate any unnecessary regulatory burdens.\u201d 57 Fed.Reg. 37392, 37392 (Aug. 18, 1992). The FHA did not stop there. Taking a step further, the FHA determined it was necessary \u201cto reconsider the underlying basis for all safety rules and to identify a performance-oriented regulatory structure that would enhance safety while minimizing the burdens placed on industry.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This review was \u201ca comprehensive multi-year effort to re-create a body of safety rules and regulations that are (1) understandable, (2) enforceable, (3) capable of being implemented by industry, and above all, (4) consistent with highway safety.\u201d 59 Fed.Reg. 1366, 1366 (Jan. 10, 1994). The review focused on \u201cthe basic question[ ] of ... what is essential to improve motor carrier safety\u201d and sought to \u201celiminate requirements not needed to carry out the regulatory program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1367. In this process, the FHA specifically \u201creviewed the regulations in part 391\u201d and decided to retain the cardiovascular disease qualification standard in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Our examination of the development of the FMCSRs and the ADA, tells us that both Congress and the Department of Transportation view the qualification standard of drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease as \u201cjob-related\u201d and of \u201cbusiness necessity.\u201d As we learned, the regulation was created out of a recognition that \u201cthe good health of drivers\u201d was an important factor in reducing the number of accidents and that the FMCSRs needed to be \u201csubstantially tightened],\u201d specifically regarding drivers \u201cin high-risk medical categories.\u201d 34 Fed.Reg. at 9081. The legislative history divulges that Congress was aware of this qualification standard when adopting the ADA and specifically instructed the Secretary of Transportation to review the regulation for its compliance with the requirements of the ADA \u2014 i.e. for being \u201cjob-related\u201d and of \u201cbusiness necessity.\u201d The Secretary of Transportation performed such a review, \u201celiminatpmg all] requirements not needed to carry out the regulatory program,\u201d and decided to retain the cardiovascular disease standard. 59 Fed.Reg. at 1367. Based on this careful, multi-step, review of the regulations by the DOT, we hold as a matter of law that 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4) satisfies the \u201cjob-related\u201d and \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d requirements of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\n<em>The Exemption of State-Run Transportation from the FMCSRs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The question becomes then, whether MTA\u2019s alleged \u201cvoluntary\u201d adoption of the FMCSRs changes this holding. In this regard, Zei cites 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.3(f)(2), which exempts state transportation from complying with the FMCSRs. Therefore, we will examine the creation of this exemption and any relevant subsequent acts of Congress to determine wh\u00e9ther Congress sought to exempt states from the safety concerns of the FMCSRs, including the qualification of drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">After the cardiovascular disease standard was enacted, Congress continued to focus on improving the safety of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>mercial motor vehicles and the qualifications of the drivers.

Congress found that (1) \u201cit is in the public interest to enhance commercial motor vehicle safety and thereby to reduce highway fatalities, injuries, and property damage;\u201d (2) \u201cuniform commercial motor vehicle safety measures ... would reduce the number of fatalities and injuries;\u201d and (3) \u201cinterested State governments can provide valuable assistance to the Federal Government in assuring that commercial motor vehicle operations are conducted safely and healthfully.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 203(1)-(4), 98 Stat. at 2832 (codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31131) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">To that end, Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations to ensure that \u201cthe physical condition of operators of commercial motor vehicles is adequate to enable them to operate such vehicles safely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 206(a)(3), 98 Stat. at 2834 (codified as amended at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31136).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under this command, the Secretary proposed to add a new section of general applicability \u2014 Section 390.3 \u2014 to \u201cassist the general public and the motor carrier industry in determining when, and in which circumstances, the FMCSRfs] apply.\u201d 52 Fed.Reg. 26278, 26282 (July 13, 1987). Under the proposed rule-making of this new section, the FHA decided to exempt motor vehicles operated by the federal and state governments from the requirements of the FMCSRs. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the FHA stated that, \u201c[i]t is expected that governmental entities will comply with the FMCSR[s] to the greatest extent possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>ble,\u201d and that \u201cthe [FHA] has encouraged their compliance with the FMCSR[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The FHA then sought comment on this proposed exemption, as well as, \u201cwhat additional steps the [FHA] might take to foster compliance with the regulations by governments.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Under the final rule, the FHA retained the exemption for state governments, but reiterated its desire that states comply with the FMCSRs regardless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">Motor vehicles operated by agencies of the Federal or the various State governments and/or their political subdivisions, in furtherance of their governmental or civic duties, have been administratively exempted from the safety regulations. However, the [FHA] has encouraged their compliance with the FMCSRs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">53 Fed.Reg. 18042, 18049 (May 19, 1988). The FHA explained that its decision to exempt state governments was driven largely by a Presidential Executive Order detailing \u201cFederalism\u201d concerns: \u201cThe purpose of the Executive Order is to restore the division of governmental responsibilities between the national government and the states. Federal action limiting the policy-making discretion of the states should be taken only where constitutional authority for the action is clear and certain____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). The FHA stated that it decided to exempt state governments \u201c[i]n light of these [federalism] considerations\u201d and that \u201c[t]his action is consistent with the Executive Order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, in reiterating its desire that state governments follow these regulations, the FHA explained that if the transportation of state governments fell below an acceptable level of safety, the FELA would step in and regulate it: \u201cThe [FHA] will periodically review the safety performance of these operations. If it appears that these operations, or a segment of them, pose an unacceptable risk to public safety, the [FHA] will propose appropriate, necessary safety measures to improve these operations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">Congress then created a state grant program called the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program. The goal of the program \u201cis to ensure that the Secretary [of Transportation], <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>States, local government agencies, and other political jurisdictions work in partnership to establish programs to improve motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31102(b)(1). The program seeks to accomplish this goal by having state governments \u201cadopt[ ] and enforc[e] effective motor carrier, commercial motor vehicle, and driver safety regulations and practices consistent with Federal requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 31102(b)(1)(C). Providing a financial incentive to the states, the program specifically conditions the granting of funds on twenty-five requirements that must be met by the state government-one of which is \u201cadopting and enforcing State safety laws and regulations that are compatible with the FMCSRs (49 CFR parts 390-397).\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 350.201(a). In other words, although 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 390.3(f)(2) exempts state governments from complying with the FMCSRs, if a State wishes to receive federal grant money under the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program, the State must comply with the FMCSRs by adopting \u201ccompatible\u201d state regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Maryland did just that. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1977, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 25\u2014111 (f)(2)(ii) of the Transportation Article (\u201cAny rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this subsection shall ... [duplicate or be consistent with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations contained in 49 C.F.R., Parts 390 through 399); COMAR 11.17.03.01 (requiring drivers of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>interstate and intrastate commercial motor vehicles to\u201d \u201cmeet the physical qualifications of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations contained in 49 CFR 390-392\u201d); 11.21.01.02 (\u201cThe federal motor carrier safety regulations contained in 49 CFR 40, 382, 383, 387, 390-393, 395-399, and 1572, as amended, are incorporated by reference.... \u201d). The Motor Vehicle Administration, in explaining why it adopted the FMCSRs at the direction of the General Assembly, stated: \u201cThis will improve public safety and integrate Maryland intrastate motor carrier safety regulations with those promulgated by the Federal Highway Administration for interstate operations.\u201d 21 Md.Reg. 1411, 1411 (Aug. 5, 1994). The Motor Vehicle Administration continued: \u201cthis action will bring State and local government commercial motor vehicle operators under the requirements of these regulations, and achieve compatibility with certain other federal motor carrier safety regulations.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Reviewing the development of the state government exemption and subsequent grant program reveals a clear federal policy to induce states to adopt and apply the FMCSRs in setting qualification standards for its drivers of commercial motor vehicles. Although the FHA originally exempted state governments from the FMCSRs out of federalism concerns, the Supreme Court has long \u201cheld that a perceived Tenth Amendment limitation on congressional regulation of state affairs [does] not concomitantly limit the range of conditions legitimately placed on federal grants.\u201d <em>South Dakota v. Dole, </em>483 U.S. 203, 210, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 2797, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987). In other words, Congress\u2019s power to condition federal grant money allows it to achieve indirectly objectives which it may not have been able to accomplish through direct regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">That is precisely what happened in this case. Congress sought to ensure that state governments would follow the FMCSRs, and created a grant program that conditioned the receiving of federal money on the State explicitly adopting 49 C.F.R. parts 390-397 \u2014 which includes the qualification standard of drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 350.201(a). Maryland followed the wishes of Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>gress and adopted state laws incorporating the FMCSRs and applying them to state-run transportation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, Congress \u2014 well aware that 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4) satisfies the \u201cjob-related\u201d and \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d requirements of the ADA but that the states were exempt from requiring such a qualification standard \u2014 created direct financial incentives for states to act in accordance with 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">When the grant program is taken in combination with the FHA\u2019s repeated desire \u201cthat governmental entities will comply with the FMCSR[s],\u201d and that it \u201chas encouraged their compliance with the FMCSR[s],\u201d 52 Fed.Reg. at 26282, we see a clear federal policy that state governments, although exempted, should adopt and implement the qualification standards of the FMCSRs. Under such circumstances, we hold, as a matter of law, that 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4) satisfies the \u201cjob-related\u201d and \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d requirements of the ADA, and that Maryland may adopt, and the MTA may rightfully apply, this qualification standard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<em>Reasonable Accommodation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The only remaining inquiry to determine whether the MTA may properly apply this qualification standard is wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>er \u201cperformance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12113. In arguing that a reasonable accommodation could have been made in this case, Zei explains that one definition for a reasonable accommodation includes an \u201cappropriate adjustment or modifications of ... policies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(9)(B). In other words, Zei asserts \u201cthat MTA could have reasonably accommodated Zei by modifying its policy relating to DOT Standards and adopting a[n] alternative, less discriminatory criterion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Relying on <em>Myers v. Hose, </em>50 F.3d 278 (4th Cir.1995), the MTA responds that Zei\u2019s \u201cundeniable medical condition precludes a finding that he is able to perform the essential functions of operating an MTA bus with or without reasonable accommodation.\u201d In <em>Myers, </em>the Fourth Circuit held that a bus driver for Frederick County who suffered from chronic heart disease could not satisfy the essential functions of a bus driver which \u201cis to operate his motor vehicle in a timely, responsible fashion ... in a way that does not threaten the safety of his passengers or of other motorists.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282. The Fourth Circuit reasoned that no reasonable accommodation could be made because \u201cthe County cannot reasonably be expected to alter the ... specifications of [the bus driver\u2019s] particular post.\u201d 50 F.3d at 282 n. 2. The Fourth Circuit explained: \u201cSuch standard types of accommodation would be ineffectual in remedying the basic disparities between [the bus driver\u2019s] medical condition and the legitimate physical criteria for employment as a bus driver. The sole change in circumstances that would enable [the bus driver] to operate public vehicles safely would be a reversal of his medical condition.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">We agree with the MTA. The ADA requires only reasonable accommodations, not unreasonable ones. <em>Id. </em>at 283. As we have reviewed, Congress, the DOT, Maryland\u2019s General Assembly, and Maryland\u2019s Motor Vehicle Administration view the FMCSRs as essential to the safety of our highways and crucial in reducing the number of accidents involving commer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>cial motor vehicles.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The regulations governing the physical qualifications of drivers are both \u201cjob-related\u201d and of \u201cbusiness necessity.\u201d We agree with the Fourth Circuit, therefore, that it would not be reasonable to force the MTA to lower its standards regarding minimal qualifications for commercial motor vehicle drivers. <em>Id. </em>at 282 n. 2. Such an accommodation would do nothing to remedy the deficiency between Zei\u2019s medical condition and the MTA\u2019s legitimate standards to qualify for employment as a bus driver. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">We hold, that as a matter of law, the MTA\u2019s use of the federally-created qualification standard in 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 391.41(b)(4) governing drivers suffering from cardiovascular disease satisfied the ADA\u2019s requirements of being \u201cjob-related\u201d and of \u201cbusiness necessity,\u201d and that \u201cperformance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12113. Because Zei failed to meet this properly imposed qualification standard, he is not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d under the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<author id=\"b297-8\">MARY ELLEN BARBERA, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The Court, having considered the motion for reconsideration and the answer filed thereto, in the above captioned case, it is this 16th day of August, 2013</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ORDERED, by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, that page one, paragraph one of the opinion filed on May 20, 2013 shall be modified to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">In this case, we are asked to determine whether the Maryland Transit Administration (\u201cMTA\u201d) complied with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) when it adopted and applied a federally-created safety regulation governing the physical qualifications of drivers of commercial motor vehicles.

The FMCSRs were initially enacted in 1937, in response to the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. 57 Fed.Reg. 37392, 37392 (Aug. 18, 1992). At that time, the regulations were under the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 59 Fed.Reg. 1366, 1366 (Jan. 10, 1994).
