O\u2019Leary, Respondent, was admitted to the Bar of this Court on December 12, 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 21, 2012, the Attorney Grievance Commission, acting through Bar Counsel (\u201cBar Counsel\u201d), pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-751(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a \u201cPetition For Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against O\u2019Leary, charging numerous violations of the Maryland Law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>yers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, including Rules 1.7(a)(2) (Conflict of Interest: General Rule),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.8(i) (Conflict of Interest: Current Clients: Specific Rules),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1.16(a)(1) (Declining or Terminating Representation),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 4.2(a) (Communication with Person Represented by Counsel),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The factual bases of these charges arose out of O\u2019Leary\u2019s representation of Wayne Joseph Cosgrove in <em>Cosgrove v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Cosgrove, </em>a divorce and child custody action initiated by his wife, Diana Cosgrove. Bar Counsel alleged that O\u2019Leary entered into a romantic relationship with Mr. Cosgrove, repeatedly communicated with Ms. Cosgrove about the subject matter of the case without the consent of her counsel, David Nowak, and repeatedly misrepresented to Mr. Nowak that she did not represent Mr. Cosgrove. The Petition also alleged that O\u2019Leary, during the course of Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, knowingly made false statements to Bar Counsel and knowingly failed to respond to lawful requests for information. In an Order dated May 23, 2012, this Court referred the matter to Judge Sherrie R. Bailey of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County for a hearing, pursuant to Rule 16-757.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">On June 6, 2012, O\u2019Leary was personally served with the Petition, as well as Bar Counsel\u2019s Request for Admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Facts and Genuineness of Documents and attached exhibits, First Set of Interrogatories, and First Request for Production of Documents. O\u2019Leary did not respond, and Judge Bailey entered an Order of Default on July 13, 2012; a hearing was scheduled for August 20, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">On August 7, 2012, O\u2019Leary filed an Answer to the Petition, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Default and a Request for Postponement. Bar Counsel did not oppose O\u2019Leary\u2019s request to postpone the hearing, which was granted by Judge Bailey; the hearing was rescheduled for September 27, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">On August 30, 2012, Bar Counsel filed a Motion for Sanctions pursuant to Rules 2-432 and 2-433,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> claiming that O\u2019Leary had failed to respond to interrogatories, requests for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>admissions and request for documents. Bar Counsel also filed a supplement, on September 13, 2012, after O\u2019Leary failed to appear for her deposition on September 11, 2012; O\u2019Leary did not respond. Judge Bailey granted Bar Counsel\u2019s Motion for Sanctions and ordered that each of Bar Counsel\u2019s Requests for Admission of Fact be deemed admitted, each document attached to Bar Counsel\u2019s First Request for Admission of Fact and Genuineness of Documents be deemed genuine and that O\u2019Leary be precluded at trial from presenting any documents, calling any witnesses, presenting any testimony or evidence contradictory to Bar Counsel\u2019s Requests for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents, or testifying on her own behalf, except in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">After the hearing, Judge Bailey issued written Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. She found that O\u2019Leary began a romantic, then intimate relationship with Mr. Cosgrove while she represented him in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove, </em>a divorce case, and that the two of them moved in together and contributed child support payments to Diana Cosgrove. The findings also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>recognized that O\u2019Leary repeatedly acknowledged to opposing counsel, Mr. Nowak, that due to her personal relationship with Mr. Cosgrove, her employer, Mark W. Howes, would be representing Mr. Cosgrove. Judge Bailey further found that O\u2019Leary personally communicated with Ms. Cosgrove about the case while Ms. Cosgrove was represented by Mr. Nowak, who never consented to O\u2019Leary\u2019s communications with his client. It was not until Ms. Cosgrove obtained a temporary peace order against O\u2019Leary, in July of 2011, that Mr. Nowak learned of O\u2019Leary\u2019s communications with his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Judge Bailey further found that O\u2019Leary never terminated her representation of Mr. Cosgrove. The hearing judge found that O\u2019Leary was fired by Mr. Howes in May of 2011 and was directed to strike his name and his firm\u2019s name from <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove, </em>which O\u2019Leary did not do. O\u2019Leary continued to engage in settlement negotiations with Mr. Nowak on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove and signed the resulting Consent Order as \u201cAttorney for the Defendant,\u201d Mr. Cosgrove, in June of 2011. Judge Bailey also found that O\u2019Leary repeatedly misrepresented, during Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation, that she signed the Consent Order because Mr. Howes was unavailable and that she failed to respond to three valid requests for information. Judge Bailey concluded that O\u2019Leary\u2019s conduct violated, by clear and convincing evidence, Rules 1.7(a), 1.8(i), 1.16(a), 4.2(a), 8.1(a) and (b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) and that O\u2019Leary failed to prove any facts in mitigation by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Bailey\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-5\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW[</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>12</em>\n</footnotemark>\n<em>]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQJ\">PROCEDURAL HISTORY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-6\">This attorney disciplinary matter was transmitted to this Court by the Court of Appeals by Order dated May 28, 2012 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. On June 6, 2012, the Respondent was personally served with the Order of the Court of Appeals dated May 23, 2012, the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Summons of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County dated May 31, 2012, Petitioner\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories, Petitioner\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents and Electronically Stored Information and Property and Petitioner\u2019s First Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents and attached Exhibits. In its Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d): 1.7 (conflict of interest); 1.8 (conflict of interest); 1.16(a); 4.2 (communication with person represented by counsel); 8.1(a) and (b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters); and 8.4(a), (c) and (d) (misconduct).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-4\">An Affidavit of Service and Notice of Service of Discovery Materials were filed by Petitioner on June 13, 2012. On July 3, 2012, no Answer having been filed, Petitioner filed a Motion for Order of Default. The Motion for Order of Default was granted by Order dated July 13, 2012 and a hearing was scheduled for August 20, 2012. A Notice of Default was sent by the Court to Respondent on July 16, 2012. On August 7, 2012, Respondent filed an Answer to the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Motion to Vacate Order of Default and Request for Postponement of the August 20, 2012 hearing. On or about August 13, 2012, Respondent filed Respondent\u2019s Second Request for Postponement of Grievance Hearing Set for August 20, 2012. Petitioner did not file an opposition to the Motion to Vacate Order of Default or either request for postponement. By Order dated August 14, 2012, Respondent\u2019s request for postponement was granted and the hearing was re-set for two days beginning September 27, 2012. By Order dated September 5, 2012, the Order of Default was vacated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">On August 30, 2012, Petitioner filed a Motion for Sanctions pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-432 and 2-433 based on Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to Petitioner\u2019s Interrogate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>ries, Requests for Documents and Requests for Admissions. Petitioner filed a Motion to Shorten Time to Respond to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions pursuant to Maryland Rule 1-204. By Order dated September 5, 2012, the Court granted Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Shorten Time to Respond to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions and directed Respondent to file any written response to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions by Tuesday, September 11, 2012 at 4:30 p.m. On September 13, 2012, Petitioner filed a Supplement to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions based on Respondent\u2019s failure to appear at her deposition scheduled for September 11, 2012. Respondent did not file a written response or opposition to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions or Supplement thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-4\">By Order dated September 24, 2012, the Court granted Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions and ordered as follows: (1) that each of Petitioner\u2019s Requests for Admission of Fact is deemed admitted pursuant to Maryland Rule 2\u2014424(b); (2) that each document attached to Petitioner\u2019s First Request for Admission of Fact and Genuineness of Documents is deemed genuine; (3) that the Respondent be, and hereby is, precluded from calling any witnesses at trial; (4) that the Respondent be, and hereby is, precluded from presenting any documents at trial; (5) that the Respondent be, and hereby is, precluded from presenting any evidence or testimony which contradicts the facts established by Petitioner\u2019s First Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents; and (6) that the Respondent be, and hereby is, precluded from testifying to any matter other than any alleged mitigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">On September 27, 2012, the Parties appeared for the evidentiary hearing. The Court heard, as a preliminary matter, Respondent\u2019s oral Motion for Reconsideration of Order of Court dated September 24, 2012. After consideration of the argument of Respondent and Petitioner\u2019s attorney, medical records proffered by Respondent and email communication proffered by Petitioner and the record, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Court denied Respondent\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration of Order of Court dated September 24, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-4\">The evidentiary hearing was conducted on September 27, 2012, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">The Petitioner in this matter has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, the averments of the petition. The Respondent has the burden of proving an affirmative defense or a matter of mitigation or extenuation by a preponderance of the evidence. Maryland Rule 16-757(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">PETITIONER\u2019S ALLEGATIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">The Petitioner charges that the Respondent engaged in professional misconduct as defined by Maryland Rule 16-701(i). All allegations of misconduct stem from Respondent\u2019s conflicted representation of Mr. Cosgrove, as well as Respondent\u2019s communication with Ms. Cosgrove, a person represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">\n<em>Representation of Mr. Cosgrove</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">Petitioner alleges that in August 2010, Mr. Cosgrove and Respondent began an attorney-client relationship. On November 16, 2010, Respondent entered her appearance and the appearance of her employer, The Law Offices of Mark W. Howes, LLC, on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove. Respondent filed an Answer on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove, to Ms. Cos-grove\u2019s pending Complaint for Child Support as well as Motion to Vacate Order of Default. In November of 2010, Respondent became romantically involved with Mr. Cos-grove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">In January, 2011, Respondent began sharing financial obligations with Mr. Cosgrove and thus, had a proprietary interest in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove </em>where she shared Mr. Cosgrove\u2019s child support obligations. In March 2011, Ms. Cosgrove retained David Nowak, Esquire to represent her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove. </em>On March 18, 2011, Respondent misrepresented to Mr. Nowak that Mark W. Howes, Esquire would be handling the case and on March 25, 2011, Mr. Nowak and Respondent appeared at a scheduling conference and signed the Master\u2019s Settlement Conference Checklist as attorneys for their respective clients. On April 29, 2011, Respondent prepared and filed \u201cWorksheet A\u2014 Child Support Obligation\u201d on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove. Then in May, 2011, Respondent was fired from Mr. Howes\u2019 firm and she took the Cosgrove case file with her, but agreed to strike his and his firm\u2019s name from all of her cases including <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">On May 6, 2011, Respondent faxed Mr. Nowak information on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove. On June 2, 2011, Respondent signed a Consent Order as \u201cAttorney for Defendant,\u201d and shortly after the Order was entered, Respondent, on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove, began to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the Order with Ms. Cosgrove. On July 26, 2011, after learning that Respondent had not filed a motion to strike his appearance, Mr. Howes filed a Motion to Withdraw Appearance of Defendant\u2019s Counsel which was granted on September 6, 2011. A copy of the Order striking Mr. Howes\u2019 appearance was sent to Respondent but she continued to prepare motions and pleadings on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove which Mr. Cosgrove signed, <em>pro se.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">\n<em>Communication with Ms. Cosgrove</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">On July 15, 2011, Ms. Cosgrove filed a Petition for Peace Order against Respondent in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County. A Temporary Peace Order was granted. A Final Peace Order hearing was scheduled for July 22, 2011. Allegedly, on that day, Respondent admitted to Mr. Nowak while standing outside the courtroom that she had been in contact with his client, Ms. Cosgrove regarding the litigation pending in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove. </em>The Peace Order was dismissed by Ms. Cosgrove in exchange for Respondent agreeing to cease representation of Mr. Cos-grove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>\n<em>Bar Counsel Investigation</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">Petitioner alleges that during the investigation of Respondent\u2019s conduct, Respondent knowingly made false statements of material fact to Bar Counsel and knowingly failed to respond to lawful requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">FINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 12, 2001. Respondent was temporarily suspended from the practice of law on March 15, 2012 for non-payment of her assessment to the Client Protection Fund.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">The Cosgrove Matter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-8\">On April 23, 2010, Diana Cosgrove, <em>pro se, </em>filed a Complaint for Child Support in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County against her husband, Wayne Cosgrove <em>(Cosgrove v. Cosgrove </em>Case No. 03C10004967). In August 2010, Respondent and Mr. Cosgrove began an attorney-client relationship. Prior to the attorney-client relationship, Mr. Cos-grove, Ms. Cosgrove, and Respondent were known to one another and acquainted socially. Additionally, they attended events with mutual friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">Sometime in September, 2010, Respondent drafted a proposed settlement agreement which was presented by Respondent and Mr. Cosgrove to Ms. Cosgrove for approval. A default was entered by the court against Mr. Cosgrove on October 20, 2010. On November 16, 2010, Respondent entered her appearance and the appearance of her then-employer, The Law Offices of Mark W. Howes, LLC, on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove. On November 16, 2010, Respondent filed an Answer to Complaint for Child Support and Motion to Vacate Order of Default on behalf of Mr. Cos-grove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">In November 2010, Respondent became romantically involved with Mr. Cosgrove. On or about January 1, 2011, Mr. Cosgrove moved into Respondent\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>In March 2011, Ms. Cosgrove retained David Nowak, Esquire, to represent her in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove. </em>As of March 18, 2011 Respondent knew that Ms. Cosgrove was represented by Mr. Nowak. Respondent and Mr. Nowak discussed prior to the scheduling conference, the fact that Respondent may be called as a witness in the Cosgrove matter. On March 18, 2011, Respondent told Mr. Nowak that Mr. Howes would be handling the case. Respondent assured Mr. Nowak that she was only appearing at the scheduling conference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\">On March 25, 2011, Respondent appeared at the scheduling conference on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove. At the scheduling conference, Mr. Nowak entered his appearance on behalf of Ms. Cosgrove. At the scheduling conference Respondent signed the Master\u2019s Settlement Conference Checklist as attorney for Mr. Cosgrove and Mr. Nowak signed as attorney for Ms. Cosgrove. The Master\u2019s Settlement Conference Checklist clearly indicated that the Cos-grove matter was contested as to physical and legal custody of the minor children, visitation and child support. At the scheduling conference, Respondent again acknowledged to Mr. Nowak that she was a potential witness and stated that Mr. Howes would be handling the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">On April 12, 2011, Mr. Nowak filed an Amended Complaint for Limited Divorce, Child Custody, Child Support and Other Relief and served written discovery on Mr. Howes. The Amended Petition clearly established that all issues, including legal and physical custody, visitation, child support, ownership of personal property, value of marital property, expenses of health insurance and attorney\u2019s fees were disputed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">Although Respondent stated to Mr. Nowak that she would not be handling the Cosgrove matter due to her conflict, Respondent continued to represent Mr. Cosgrove. On April 29, 2011, Respondent prepared and filed \u201cWorksheet A \u2014 Child Support Obligation\u201d on behalf of Mr. Cos-grove. On May 6, 2011, Respondent faxed Mr. Nowak information on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In May, 2011, Respondent was fired by Mr. Howes. After Respondent was fired by Mr. Howes, Respondent took the Cosgrove ease with her from Mr. Howes\u2019 office. At the conclusion of her employment at The Law Offices of Mark W. Howes, LLC, Respondent was instructed to strike Mr. Howes\u2019 and his firm\u2019s name from all of her cases including <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove. </em>Respondent verbally agreed to strike Mr. Howes\u2019 and his firm\u2019s appearance from all of her cases including <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">Respondent never moved to strike the appearance of either Mr. Howes or The Law Offices of Mark W. Howes, LLC as counsel for Mr. Cosgrove. Respondent misrepresented to Mr. Nowak that, following May 2011, Mr. Howes was still involved in the Cosgrove matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">Following March 18, 2011, when Respondent first became aware that Ms. Cosgrove was represented by counsel, Respondent continued to communicate directly with Ms. Cos-grove about the subject of the representation. Respondent discussed with Ms. Cosgrove the visitation schedule. While Respondent was representing Mr. Cosgrove, hundreds of text messages were sent by her from her phone number, 410-418-8678, to Ms. Cosgrove. Because Respondent also provided frequent daycare for the Cosgrove children, many of these messages related to their care. However, on May 28, 2011, Respondent sent Ms. Cosgrove a text message stating \u201cThe reason you qualify for child support is the daycare you pay. Your attorney needs to explain this to you.\u201d On June 1, 2011, Respondent sent Ms. Cosgrove a text message stating \u201cCall mr nowak asap he needs u to sign the consent order this afternoon\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">Respondent never sought authorization from Mr. Nowak to contact his client, Ms. Cosgrove, about <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove. </em>Mr. Nowak was unaware that Respondent was communicating with his client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">A pendente lite hearing was scheduled in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove, </em>for June 2, 2011. Between March 21, 2011 and June 2, 2011, Respondent and Mr. Nowak engaged in settlement discussions on behalf of the Cosgroves. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>negotiations Respondent had with Mr. Nowak, as well as directly with Ms. Cosgrove resulted in a Consent Order, drafted by Respondent, which was signed by all parties on June 2, 2011. Respondent signed the Consent Order as \u201cAttorney for Defendant\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">The Consent Order resolved all outstanding issues between the Cosgroves including, physical and legal custody of the minor children, a detailed visitation schedule, child support, expenses for the children\u2019s child care and extracurricular activities, division of marital property, alimony, division of marital debts and attorney\u2019s fees. The Consent Order provided that Mr. Cosgrove would file a divorce petition based on a one-year voluntary separation in January 2012. On June 2, 2011, at the time the Consent Order was entered, Respondent had a proprietary interest in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove </em>because she and Mr. Cosgrove shared expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">Shortly after the Consent Order was entered, Respondent, on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove, began to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the Order directly with Ms. Cos-grove. Specifically, Respondent attempted to renegotiate the amount of child support Mr. Cosgrove was required to pay to Ms. Cosgrove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">On July 11, 2011, Respondent sent a text message to Ms. Cosgrove stating: \u201cJoe [Mr. Cosgrove] is filing for full custody and asking that u see kids every other weekend. Talk to ur lawyer ... no judge will give u every weekend off. And if u get full custody we will only have them every other weekend. So either way we won\u2019t have them every weekend.\u201d On July 13, 2011, Ms. Cosgrove sent Respondent a text message stating \u201cLeave me alone!!\u201d to which Respondent replied \u201cLeave Joe [Mr. Cosgrove] alone\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">On July 15, 2011, Ms. Cosgrove filed a Petition for Peace Order against Respondent in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore County (Case No. 0804SP051902011). A Temporary Peace Order was granted to Ms. Cosgrove against Respondent on July 15, 2011. A Final Peace Order hearing was scheduled for July 22, 2011. Ms. Cosgrove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>retained Mr. Nowak to represent her at the Final Peace Order hearing. After being retained in the peace order matter, Mr. Nowak learned, for the first time, that Respondent had been in communication with Ms. Cosgrove during the course of the negotiation of the Consent Order, specifically that 136 text messages had been sent from Respondent\u2019s phone to Ms. Cosgrove May 9, 2011 through June 8, 2011. On July 22, while standing in the hallway outside the courtroom, Respondent admitted to Mr. Nowak that she had been in contact with his client, Ms. Cosgrove, regarding the litigation pending in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove. </em>Ms. Cos-grove ultimately agreed to dismiss the Peace Order in exchange for Respondent agreeing to cease representation of Mr. Cosgrove in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove </em>and Respondent agreeing not to contact Ms. Cosgrove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">On July 25, 2011, Mr. Nowak filed Plaintiffs Motion to Disqualify Gina O\u2019Leary as Counsel and Request for a Hearing in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove. </em>Respondent did not file an opposition or response to Plaintiffs Motion to Disqualify Gina O\u2019Leary as Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">On July 26, 2011, after learning that Respondent had not filed a motion to strike his appearance, Mr. Howes filed a Motion to Withdraw Appearance of Defendant\u2019s Counsel. On September 6, 2011, the Court granted Mr. Howes\u2019 Motion and struck the appearance of Mark W. Howes and the Law Offices of Mark W. Howes, LLC as counsel for Mr. Cosgrove. A copy of the Order striking Mr. Howes\u2019 appearance was mailed to Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">Following Mr. Howes\u2019 appearance being stricken, Respondent continued to prepare motions and pleadings on behalf of Mr. Cosgrove which Mr. Cosgrove then signed, <em>pro se. </em>On September 21, 2011, Mr. Cosgrove appeared at a contempt hearing regarding his failure to pay child support. Respondent appeared at the hearing, and although she did not sit at counsel table or otherwise identify herself as Mr. Cosgrove\u2019s attorney, she addressed the court and requested a postponement on Mr. Cosgrove\u2019s behalf. At the time of the show cause hearing, Respondent had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for Mr. Cosgrove and was still his attorney of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\">Bar Counsel Investigation of the Cosgrove Matter</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">By letter dated October 7, 2011, Respondent stated to Bar Counsel \"... because if the case was contested, I wanted no involvement and my boss would handle it. My boss, Mark Howes, began signing the pleadings from that point forward and agreed to be lead counsel on the case.\u201d The statement to Bar Counsel was false as Mr. Howes never agreed to be lead counsel on the case. By letter dated October 25, 2011, Bar Counsel requested Respondent provide information to substantiate her statement within ten (10) days. Additionally, Bar Counsel requested Respondent provide copies of all text messages between Respondent\u2019s phone and Ms. Cosgrove, copies of all email messages between Respondent and Ms. Cosgrove and copies of any other correspondence between Respondent and Ms. Cos-grove from April 23, 2010 through the date of the letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">In a letter dated October 11, 2011, Respondent stated to Bar Counsel, \u201cThe parties both signed an order and it was faxed to Master Gilbert so the parties would not have to appear that day. I signed the consent order merely out of convenience because Mr. Howes was in Annapolis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">As of November 9, 2011, the requested information had not been received and Bar Counsel sent a follow-up letter requesting the information be provided within seven (7) days. On December 2, 2011, no response having been received to either the October 25 or November 9, 2011 letter, Bar Counsel again requested a response.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">On November 16, 2011, Respondent appeared at the Attorney Grievance Commission and an interview was conducted by William Ramsey, Investigator for the Attorney Grievance Commission. Respondent stated to Mr. Ramsey that she signed the Consent Order on June 2, 2011 only because Mr. Howes was unavailable. Respondent did not inform Mr. Ramsey that, at the time she signed the Consent Order as Attorney for Mr. Cosgrove, she was no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>employed by Mr. Howes. Mr. Howes had not planned to appear at the pendente lite hearing schedule for June 2, 2011 because he believed that his appearance had been struck. Similarly, Mr. Howes had no expectation that he would be consulted in the negotiation of the Consent Order following Respondent\u2019s termination in May 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\">In a letter dated December 9, 2011, Respondent stated to Bar Counsel, \u201cThe parties both signed the order and it was faxed to Master Gilbert so the parties did not have to appear that day. I have signed the consent order merely out of convenience because Mr. Howes was in Annapolis. However, his appearance was still on record at that time. Mr. Howes\u2019 appearance was not struck until September 14, 2011.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">In its Amended Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, Petitioner alleged that Respondent violated the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d): 1.7 (conflict of interest); 1.8 (conflict of interest); 1.16(a); 4.2 (communication with person represented by counsel); 8.1(a) and (b) (bar admission and disciplinary matters); 8.4(a), (c) and (d) (misconduct). For the reasons stated below, this Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated each of these rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">MRPC 1.7. Conflict of Interest: General Rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">MRPC 1.7(a) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-9\">\u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists if: ... (2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">The Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.7(a) by representing Mr. Cos-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>grove when she had a personal interest in the Cosgrove matter. Beginning in November 2010, when Respondent\u2019s relationship became intimate, Respondent had a personal interest in the matter. Beginning in January 2011, when Mr. Cosgrove moved in to Respondent\u2019s home, Respondent had a personal interest in the visitation and custody arrangement between the Cosgroves. Additionally, Respondent had a personal interest in the amount, if any, that Mr. Cosgrove would be required to pay in child support as discussed in reference to MRPC 1.8. The Court finds that Respondent knew that she had a conflict in the Cosgrove matter and that she may reasonably have been called as a witness on a variety of contested matters including child support, visitation and custody of the Cosgroves\u2019 minor children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\">Rule 1.8. Conflict of Interest: Current Clients: Specific Rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">MRPC 1.8(i) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">\u201cA lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client, except that the lawyer may: (1) acquire a lien authorized by law to secure the lawyer\u2019s fee or expenses; and (2) subject to Rule 1.5, contract with a client for a reasonable contingent fee in a civil case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-7\">The Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.8(i) by representing Mr. Cos-grove where she had a proprietary interest in the outcome of his matter. Respondent and Mr. Cosgrove shared all household expenses including payment of child support. Respondent had a proprietary interest in the amount of child support Mr. Cosgrove was required to pay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">Rule 1.16. Declining or Terminating Representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-9\">MRPC Rule 1.16(a) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-10\">\u201cExcept as stated in paragraph (c), a lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>shall withdraw from the representation of a client if: (1) the representation will result in violation of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">The Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 1.16(a) when she failed to withdraw from the representation immediately following her romantic involvement with Mr. Cosgrove in November 2010.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">Rule 4.2. Communication with Person Represented by Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">MRPC 4.2(a) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">\u201cExcept as provided in paragraph (c), in representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a person who the lawyer knows is represented in the matter by another lawyer unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law or court order to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-9\">The Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 4.2(a), by having multiple communications with Ms. Cosgrove after March 18, 2011 when Ms. Cosgrove retained counsel. The Court finds that the substance of, at least some of, the communications was directly related to disputed issues in the Cosgrove matter. Specifically, Respondent had communications with Ms. Cos-grove related to visitation and custody of the Cosgroves\u2019 minor children and child support payments and obligations. Respondent never requested nor received permission from Mr. Nowak to discuss the Cosgrove matter directly with Ms. Cosgrove, nor was she authorized by law or court order to communicate directly with Ms. Cosgrove.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-10\">Rule 8.1. Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-11\">MRPC 8.1 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-12\">\u201cAn applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not: (a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or (b) fail to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-4\">The Court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MRPC 8.1 by making false statements to Bar Counsel regarding the circumstances surrounding the signing of the Consent Order on June 2, 2011. The Court finds that Respondent knowingly misled Bar Counsel to believe that the only reason she signed the Consent Order was Mr. Howes\u2019 unavailability. The Court finds the Respondent repeated this misrepresentation to Bar Counsel on three separate occasions, in her letters of October 11, 2011 and November 19, 2011 and in her interview with Mr. Ramsey on November 16, 2011. Additionally, the Court finds the Respondent made a false statement of material fact to Bar Counsel in her letter dated October 7, 2011 which stated that Mr. Howes was handling the Cosgrove matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-5\">The Court finds that Respondent violated MRPC 8.1(b) by failing to timely respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-6\">Rule 8.4. Misconduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-7\">MRPC 8.4(a) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-8\">\u201c[VJiolate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-9\">The Court, having concluded that Respondent violated several of the Rules of Professional Conduct including MRPC 1.7, 1.8, 1.16, 4.2, and 8.1, concludes that Respondent has also committed misconduct in violation of Rule 8.4(a). <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Foltz, </em>411 Md. 359, 411, 983 A.2d 434, 465 (2009) (internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>MRPC 8.4(c) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d The Court finds that Respondent\u2019s representations to Mr. Nowak regarding her role in the representation of Mr. Cosgrove were dishonest. The Court finds that Respondent acknowledged the conflict that existed in her representation of Mr. Cosgrove as early as her first communication with Mr. Nowak and purposefully misrepresented to Mr. Nowak that the conflict would be resolved by Mr. Howes\u2019 representation of Mr. Cosgrove. Additionally, the Court finds that Respondent\u2019s failure to disclose to Mr. Nowak that she was no longer employed by Mr. Howes at the time the Consent Order was executed was inherently deceitful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-4\">The Court finds, that the same facts that support a conclusion that Respondent violated MRPC 8.1 support a conclusion that Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(c). The Court finds Respondent\u2019s misrepresentations to Bar Counsel during the course of its investigation were made in an attempt to deceive Bar Counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">MRPC 8.4(d) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d The Court finds that the Respondent\u2019s conduct in the representation of Mr. Cosgrove as it relates to Mr. Howes, Mr. Nowak, Ms. Cosgrove and the Court, was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of MRPC 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-6\">MITIGATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">Respondent has not met her burden to prove that there were mitigating factors or any affirmative defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">CONCLUSION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">This Court finds that the facts elicited during the trial of this matter establish by clear and convincing evidence a violation of Rules 1.7; 1.8; 1.16(a); 4.2; 8.1(a) and (b); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>8.4(a), (c) and (d) (misconduct). 8.4(a) through (d) as stated above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u201cThis Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Chapman, </em>430 Md. 238, 273, 60 A.3d 25, 46 (2013), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Seltzer, </em>424 Md. 94, 112, 34 A.3d 498, 509 (2011). \u201cWe accept the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact as prima facie correct unless shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Rand, </em>429 Md. 674, 712, 57 A.3d 976, 998 (2012), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance v. Stern, </em>419 Md. 525, 556, 19 A.3d 904, 925 (2011). We conduct an independent, de novo review of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, pursuant to Rule 16-759(b)(1).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Bar Counsel has filed no substantive exceptions to Judge Bailey\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. O\u2019Leary did file exceptions, in which she challenges the discovery sanctions imposed by Judge Bailey against her, several findings of fact, including the determination that she did not prove mitigation, and all of the conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">O\u2019Leary challenges the sanctions imposed by Judge Bailey for O\u2019Leary\u2019s failure to respond to discovery requests and to appear at her deposition. She argues that given \u201cthe significance of the matter, namely [her] ability to practice law,\u201d O\u2019Leary should have been permitted to fully participate in the evidentiary hearing, by introducing her own evidence and calling her own witnesses. O\u2019Leary did, however, cross-examine every witness, testify as to mitigation and call Mr. Cos-grove as a witness in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">We recognize that the hearing judge \u201cis entrusted with the role of administering the discovery rules and, as such, is vested with broad discretion in imposing sanctions when a party fails to comply with the rules.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number><em>Kreamer, </em>404 Md. 282, 342, 946 A.2d 500, 535 (2008). Utilizing this standard, we have chosen not to disturb sanctions for the failure to respond to discovery requests. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. James, </em>385 Md. 637, 870 A.2d 229 (2005), an attorney filed late, unresponsive answers to Bar Counsel\u2019s interrogatories, request for admissions of facts and genuineness of documents, and request for production of documents. After Bar Counsel filed a motion for sanctions, which was granted by the Circuit Court Judge, the sanctions \u201cforeclosed the Respondent from putting on any evidence that was requested in the Petitioner\u2019s Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents,\u201d and, \u201c[a]s a result, Petitioner\u2019s Requests for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents were admitted.\u201d 385 Md. at 647, 870 A.2d at 235. We approved the sanctions as \u201cproportionate to the discovery abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 661, 870 A.2d at 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">In another case involving sanctions, albeit not in the attorney grievance area, <em>Rodriguez v. Clarke, </em>400 Md. 39, 926 A.2d 736 (2007), the plaintiffs failed to make available for deposition their expert witnesses, who were necessary to prove a prima facie case and we approved of the imposition of a sanction based upon the \u201ccontinuous failure to cooperate with [the defendants\u2019] repeated requests for dates of depositions of their experts, especially out-of-state witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 926 A.2d at 753. The Circuit Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to preclude the plaintiffs from presenting expert testimony at trial and, thereafter, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and we affirmed, concluding that the sanctions were warranted based upon the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with discovery, which \u201cevidenced a complete lack of good faith in providing access to the discoverable information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">O\u2019Leary repeatedly failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s discovery requests, initially by not answering the interrogatories, request for production of documents, and request for admissions of fact and genuineness of documents. After an order of default was entered against her, O\u2019Leary filed a motion to vacate the order of default, claiming that she was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>not aware of the discovery deadlines and that she needed time to prepare her defense and collect documents. When the default order was vacated and the evidentiary hearing was rescheduled, O\u2019Leary never responded to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for documents, admissions of facts and genuineness of documents, and she failed to appear for her deposition. The sanctions imposed by Judge Bailey were certainly proportionate to O\u2019Leary\u2019s failures to respond to discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">O\u2019Leary now seeks to do that from which she has been prohibited by sanctions. Before us, she contends that she has evidence that is contradictory to her admissions or not in the record, which show that several of Judge Bailey\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous. O\u2019Leary, however, cannot avoid the sanctions imposed by the hearing judge by trying to do an \u201cend run.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 800 A.2d 782 (2002), an attorney failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s interrogatories, requests for admissions of fact and genuineness of documents, and request for production of documents. After Bar Counsel moved for sanctions, the circuit court judge entered an order directing that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents be admitted, that the responsive pleading filed by Respondent be stricken, that Respondent be prohibited from introducing at trial any evidence to oppose the claims of [Bar Counsel] as set forth in the Petition for Disciplinary Action, and that judgment by default be entered against the Respondent and in favor of [Bar Counsel] finding that the Rules of Professional Conduct have been violated as alleged in the Petition for Disciplinary Action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">369 Md. at 466, 800 A.2d at 784. We concluded that the failure to file timely responses to the discovery requests, in order to \u201cstonewall Bar Counsel\u2019s efforts to gain discovery,\u201d meant that we \u201cconsider this case on the present state of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>record and the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the hearing judge____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 800 A.2d at 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Similarly, <em>Attorney Grievance v. McLaughlin, </em>372 Md. 467, 813 A.2d 1145 (2002) involved an attorney who failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s request for admissions of fact. After Bar Counsel asked for sanctions, the hearing judge ordered that the admissions of fact be deemed admitted, upon which he relied in rendering his Findings of Fact. Before us, the attorney sought a new evidentiary hearing to contradict the hearing judge\u2019s findings, specifically that the attorney had charged significant fees for work he had not done. We denied the attorney\u2019s request, concluding that the attorney had \u201cexhausted his entitlement to further judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 813 A.2d at 1161. The sanctions imposed were not an abuse of Judge Bailey\u2019s discretion, so before us, O\u2019Leary cannot challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the findings of fact by advocating for the consideration of evidence that is contradictory to her admissions or not in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The sanctions did not prevent O\u2019Leary from testifying as to mitigation and, thus, we may consider her exception to Judge Bailey\u2019s finding that she failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, any mitigation. With respect to mitigating factors, we consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Absence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-8\"><em>Attorney Grievance v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 326, 44 A.3d 344, 361 (2012). O\u2019Leary contends that she suffered from insomnia, migraines and a miscarriage during the course of her representation of Mr. Cosgrove, without establishing any nex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>us to her misconduct. She also asserts that Judge Bailey-should have considered her current decline in health, financial situation due to unemployment, anxiety problems and inability to secure independent counsel for the evidentiary hearing in September of 2012, as mitigation. While an illness or a traumatic event may serve as a mitigating factor in determining sanctions, they may do so only when there is some nexus to the misconduct. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Zimmerman, </em>428 Md. 119, 146 n. 13, 50 A.3d 1205, 1221 n. 13 (2012), citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. West, </em>378 Md. 395, 418, 836 A.2d 588, 601 (2003) and <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Breschi, </em>340 Md. 590, 605, 667 A.2d 659, 666-67 (1995); <em>see also Attorney Grievance v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 414, 773 A.2d 463, 484-85 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">O\u2019Leary also excepts to the fact that Judge Bailey did not find that there was an absence of \u201ctestimony that Mr. Cosgrove, the actual client, was in anyway [sic] harmed.\u201d O\u2019Leary obviously misconstrues her burden with respect to mitigation, in this regard. It was her burden to prove mitigation, rather than rely on a presumption that the absence of evidence should be construed in her favor. We overrule the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\u201cAs to the conclusions of law of a judge, to whom we have assigned hearing duties in an attorney grievance case, our consideration is essentially <em>de novo, </em>even where default orders and judgments have been entered at the hearing level.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 49, 785 A.2d 1260, 1267-68 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">O\u2019Leary excepts to the conclusion that she violated Rule 1.7(a)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest exists if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">(2) there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">Judge Bailey determined that O\u2019Leary knew she had a conflict of interest in violation of Rule 1.7(a), because her intimate relationship with her client, Mr. Cosgrove, provided her with a personal interest in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove </em>that materially limited her representation. Judge Bailey also determined that O\u2019Leary \u201cmay reasonably have been called as a witness on a variety of contested matters including child support, visitation and custody of the Cosgroves\u2019 minor children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">In her exception, O\u2019Leary does not dispute that she had a personal interest and familiarity with the Cosgrove matter. Rather, she asserts, without citation to any authority, that a conflict of interest under Rule 1.7(a)(2) cannot arise unless litigation ensues and the attorney, having a personal interest in the matter, is called also as a witness. Bar Counsel disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">A lawyer\u2019s intimate relationship with a client may constitute a violation of Rule 1.7. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Culver, </em>381 Md. 241, 849 A.2d 423 (2004), we considered whether nonconsensual sexual relations with a client, during the course of representation in \u201cthis domestic relations case, involving child custody, alimony, distribution of marital property, and divorce grounds,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 266 n. 11, 849 A.2d at 438 n. 11, constituted a personal conflict of interest under Rule 1.7(b), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests, unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">(2) the client consents after consultation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Culver was an attorney who engaged in sexual conduct with his client, while representing her in a divorce and child custody dispute. He acknowledged that the sexual conduct posed a personal conflict of interest but defended that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>sexual relations were consensual, and therefore the client acceded to his continued legal representation after their sexual relationship began.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">We rejected Culver\u2019s argument regarding consent and went further in our discussion of Culver\u2019s violation of Rule 1.7(b). We concluded, for purposes of determining a violation of Rule 1.7(b), that consent was not dispositive as to the effect of an intimate relationship between an attorney and client, in the context of a disputed divorce and child custody action. 381 Md. at 266 n. 11, 849 A.2d at 438 n. 11. We found guidance in the commentary to Rule 1.7, which provided that a sexual relationship with a client is an \u201cimpermissible conflict between the interests of the client and those of the attorney\u201d if the sexual relationship poses a material limitation on the representation and the attorney\u2019s belief otherwise is unreasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">A sexual relationship with a client, whether or not in violation of criminal law, will create an impermissible conflict between the interests of the client and those of the lawyer if (1) the representation of the client would be materially limited by the sexual relationship and (2) it is unreasonable for the lawyer to believe otherwise. Under those circumstances, client consent after consultation is ineffective. See also Rule 8.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">381 Md. at 269, 849 A.2d at 440. We relied on the fact that intimate relations with a client during the pendency of a divorce action may serve as grounds for adultery, under Section 7-103 of the Family Law Article, Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2003 Supp.),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to enable the spouse to seek an immediate, absolute divorce, <em>id. </em>at 274, 849 A.2d at 443 (\u201cWhen divorce is in issue, the lawyer who engages in sexual intercourse with the client may be supplying the client\u2019s spouse with grounds for an immediate divorce and may inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>fere with any possibility of a reconciliation.\u201d), and may be a factor for consideration in determining child custody. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 849 A.2d at 443 (\u201cwhereas the fact of adultery may be a relevant consideration in child custody awards, no presumption of unfitness on the part of the adulterous parent arises from it; rather it should be weighed, along with all other pertinent factors, only insofar as it affects the child\u2019s welfare,\u201d quoting <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>328 Md. 507, 516, 615 A.2d 1190, 1194 (1992)). With these considerations, we concluded that \u201cin a domestic relations matter, when the grounds for divorce, child custody, alimony, or the distribution of marital assets are at issue, the attorney knows or should know that a sexual relationship with the client has the potential to jeopardize the client\u2019s case. In such circumstances, an attorney who engages in sexual relations with the client violates Rule 1.7(b).\u201d <em>Culver, </em>381 Md. at 275, 849 A.2d at 443.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">Our analysis in <em>Culver </em>regarding whether a conflict of interest, now under Rule 1.7(a)(2),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> exists in a divorce matter when the attorney had an intimate relationship with the client was not dependent on whether Culver was called as a witness. We overrule O\u2019Leary\u2019s exception. O\u2019Leary\u2019s conflict of interest, by engaging in sexual relations with Mr. Cosgrove during the course of his contested divorce action is evident from the record, including Mr. Nowak\u2019s testimony that O\u2019Leary \u201chad admitted to the relationship with Mr. Cosgrove, that she had gotten pregnant\u201d and that she \u201cstated that my client [Diana Cosgrove] had killed her unborn child.\u201d She violated Rule 1.7(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">O\u2019Leary\u2019s conduct also violated Rule 1.8(i), which provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall not acquire a proprietary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client....\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Judge Bailey found that O\u2019Leary participated financially in paying the child support obligations of Mr. Cosgrove, while she negotiated the amount of child support that he was to pay Diana Cosgrove. Judge Bailey further found that O\u2019Leary told Ms. Cosgrove that the amount of child support Ms. Cosgrove would be able to receive was related to payment of daycare services, stating to Ms. Cosgrove, while O\u2019Leary was providing care, at times, for the Cosgrove children: \u201cThe reason you qualify for child support is the daycare you pay.\u201d O\u2019Leary, thus, interjected her personal participation in caring for the children as a factor to advocate for a reduction of Ms. Cosgrove\u2019s child support, in which O\u2019Leary had a financial interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The prohibition against a lawyer acquiring a proprietary interest in his or her client\u2019s action is \u201cdesigned to avoid giving the lawyer too great an interest in the representation,\u201d Comment 16 to Rule 1.8, because a lawyer\u2019s economic interest in the outcome of the client\u2019s case can erode the lawyer\u2019s independent judgment. <em>See Computer Dynamics, Inc. v.

So either way we won\u2019t have them every weekend.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">At no time did O\u2019Leary obtain, or seek to obtain, Mr. Nowak\u2019s permission when she sent these text messages to Ms. Cos-grove. These communications went to the very heart of the divorce case, and O\u2019Leary\u2019s advocacy regarding child support, custody and visitation in her communication with Ms. Cosgrove, in the absence of Mr. Nowak, violated Rule 4.2(a). <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Kent, </em>337 Md. 361, 377, 653 A.2d 909, 918 (1995), quoting <em>In re McCaffrey, </em>275 Or. 23, 549 P.2d 666, 668 (1976) (explaining that a purpose of the prohibition on contacting represented persons is to prevent \u201ca person from being deprived of the advice of retained counsel by bypassing retained counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">With respect to Rule 8.1(a), which prohibits a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter from \u201cknowingly mak[ing] a false statement of material fact,\u201d Judge Bailey found that O\u2019Leary knowingly made a false statement of material fact to Bar Counsel when she stated that Mr. Howes was Mr. Cosgrove\u2019s attorney. Judge Bailey further found that O\u2019Leary misled Bar Counsel by stating that she signed the Consent Order because Mr. Howes was unavailable, in letters and during a meeting with Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator. O\u2019Leary clearly violated Rule 8.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Rule 8.1(b) prohibits a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter from \u201cknowingly fail[ing] to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority.\u201d On multiple occasions, O\u2019Leary failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information and documents during Bar Counsel\u2019s initial investigation. In October of 2011, Bar Counsel requested O\u2019Leary provide, within ten days, copies of all text messages, email messages and further correspondence that she and Ms. Cosgrove exchanged between April of 2010 and October of 2011, as well as information to substantiate her statement that Mr. Howes was Mr. Cosgrove\u2019s attorney. O\u2019Leary did not answer and, in November of 2011, Bar Counsel again requested that the information be provided in seven days, to which she did not respond. Her failure to timely respond to the October and November requests for information violated Rule 8.1(b). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 323, 44 A.3d 344, 359 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">Given O\u2019Leary\u2019s multiple rule violations, she also violated Rule 8.4(a), which provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cviolate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Rule 8.4(c) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d Judge Bailey determined, and we agree, that O\u2019Leary\u2019s lies about Mr. Howes\u2019s role in the representation of Mr. Cosgrove and her continued representation in spite of her personal conflicts, some of which inured to her financial benefit, were dishonest. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Penn, </em>431 Md. 320, 65 A.3d 125 (2013), we determined that Brien Michael Penn violated Rule 8.4(c) when he concealed from his employer, a title insurance company, his self-dealing. Penn, acting on behalf of the company, retained and paid himself, as outside counsel, to perform legal work for the company, as well as assigned the company\u2019s interest in security deeds to himself. To hide his conduct from his employer, Penn created as a guise a Delaware-incorporated law firm. This concealment, we concluded, constituted \u201cintentional, dishonest conduct\u201d and violated Rule 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>O\u2019Leary similarly created the ruse that Mr. Howes was Mr. Cosgrove\u2019s attorney, in order to shield her continued involvement in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove </em>from scrutiny. Her dishonesty concerning Mr. Howes, to both Mr. Nowak as well as Bar Counsel, therefore, violated Rule 8.4(c). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Harris, </em>403 Md. 142, 164, 939 A.2d 732, 745 (2008) (\u201cWe have said that Rules 8.1(a) and 8.4(c) are violated when an attorney acts dishonestly and deceitfully by knowingly making false statements to Bar Counsel.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Rule 8.4(d) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d \u201c[Pjublic confidence in the legal profession is a critical facet to the proper administration of justice and conduct that negatively impacts on the public\u2019s image or the perception of the courts or the legal profession violates Rule 8.4(d).\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Whitehead, </em>405 Md. 240, 260, 950 A.2d 798, 810 (2008). O\u2019Leary\u2019s unauthorized contact with Ms. Cosgrove regarding child support, child custody and other matters of the case without the consent of Ms. Cosgrove\u2019s attorney and O\u2019Leary\u2019s repeated lies to both Mr. Nowak and Bar Counsel about Mr. Howes erode the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession; we conclude that she violated Rule 8.4(d). <em>See also Attorney Grievance v. Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 362-63, 40 A.3d 1039, 1049-50 (2012) (concluding that attorney violated Rule 8.4(d) by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information during the initial investigation). In summary, we conclude that Judge Bailey\u2019s findings of fact were supported by clear and convincing evidence and that O\u2019Leary violated Rules 1.7(a)(2), 1.8(i), 1.16(a), 4.2(a), 8.1(a) and (b) and 8.4(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">We now turn to determining the appropriate sanction.

Although O\u2019Leary acknowledged to Mr. Nowak that her intimate relationship with her client constituted a conflict of interest, she continuously misrepresented that she would terminate her representation, all while communicating with Ms. Cosgrove regarding the terms of child support and custody, without Mr. Nowak\u2019s consent. She fabricated Mr. Howes\u2019s role in <em>Cosgrove v. Cosgrove </em>to Mr. Nowak and Bar Counsel. O\u2019Leary committed multiple ethical violations to achieve the common goal of securing for Mr. Cosgrove, and herself in part, a favorable settlement. O\u2019Leary\u2019s repeated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>actions constituted a pattern of misconduct, under factor (c), as well as multiple offenses, under factor (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">O\u2019Leary\u2019s failure to respond to repeated requests for documents implicates factor (e), and her false statements to Bar Counsel clearly implicate factor (f). <em>Attorney Grievance v.

Culver, </em>381 Md. 241, 274, 849 A.2d 423, 443 (2004). Thus, I <em>agree </em>with the Majority that Respondent should be disciplined for doing so, and join in most other respects with the Majority opinion. But, respectfully, I submit that the Majority is mistaken in accepting Bar Counsel\u2019s invitation to broaden the scope of Rule 1.8(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Rule 1.8(1) provides that a \u201clawyer shall not acquire a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation the lawyer is conducting for a client.\u201d The Majority finds this Rule applicable to O\u2019Leary on grounds that she \u201cparticipated financially in paying the child support obligations of Mr. Cosgrove, while she negotiated the amount of child support that he was to pay Diana Cosgrove.\u201d Maj. Op. at 36, 69 A.3d at 1141. I disagree that her action in representing Mr. Cosgrove, while living with him and sharing expenses, constituted a violation of Rule 1.8(i), and believe this holding has broad implications for practicing attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Both Maryland and the American Bar Association explain the history and purpose of Rule 1.8(i) as follows: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct 1.8 cmt. 16 (emphasis added); American Bar Association, <em>A Legislative History: The Development of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, 1982-2005, </em>217 (2006) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Paragraph (i) states the traditional general rule that lawyers are prohibited from acquiring a proprietary interest in litigation----[This] general rule has its basis in common law champerty and maintenance and is designed to avoid giving the lawyer too great an interest in the representation. In addition, when the lawyer acquires an ownership interest in the subject of the representation, it will be more difficult for a client to discharge the lawyer if the client so desires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The concept of champerty originated in medieval England. Its initial purpose was to stop unscrupulous nobles and royal officials from lending their names to bolster the credibility of doubtful and fraudulent claims in return for a share of the property recovered. <em>See Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>340 S.C. 367, 532 S.E.2d 269, 273 (2000); <em>see also </em>R.D. Cox, <em>Champerty as We Know It, </em>13 Memphis State U.L.Rev. 139 (1983); Max Radin, <em>Maintenance by Champerty, </em>24 Cal.L.Rev. 48 (1935); Percy H. Winfield, <em>The History of Maintenance and Champerty </em>35 Law Q. Rev. 50 (1919). As times changed, the doctrine evolved away from lords and nobles, but retained its core focus on preventing strangers to litigation from obtaining a financial stake in a case. The legal ency<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>clopedia Corpus Juris, for example, provides a helpful overview of the topic:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\">At common law, champerty is defined to be a bargain by the terms of which a person having otherwise no interest in the subject matter of an action undertakes to carry on the suit at his or her own expense, or to aid in so doing, in consideration of receiving, in the event of success, some part of the land, property, or money recovered or deriving some benefit therefrom. Champerty is an officious intermeddling in a suit by a stranger, by maintaining or assisting either party with money or otherwise to prosecute or defend it, and dividing the proceeds obtained in the suit between the party and the stranger. Champerty also has been defined as a bargain between a stranger and a party to a lawsuit by which the stranger pursues the party\u2019s claim in consideration of receiving part of any judgment proceeds. An agreement is said to be \u201cchampertous\u201d when a person without an interest in another\u2019s lawsuit undertakes to carry it on at his or her own expense, in whole or in part, in consideration of receiving, in the event of success, a part of the proceeds of the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">14 C.J.S. Champerty and Maintenance \u00a7 1 (2006) (footnotes omitted). This text goes on to explain the limits of the doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-6\">It is necessary that the interference in the litigation is clearly officious and for the purpose of stirring up strife and continuing litigation. Officious intermeddling, as a necessary element of champerty, is offering unnecessary and unwanted advice or services or being meddlesome in a highhanded or overbearing way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-7\">A contract which contains an undertaking to defray the expenses of litigation for consideration other than proceeds of the litigation is not champerty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-8\">The prohibition against champerty is designed to cure malicious \u201cstirring up\u201d of litigation that would not otherwise have occurred. The activity of champerty is repugnant to public policy against profiteering and speculating in litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>tion and is grounds for denying the aid of the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Nevertheless, the doctrine of champerty is strictly limited. <em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted). In the same vein, a Pennsylvania court explained: \u201cThe activity of champerty has long been considered repugnant to public policy against profiteering and speculating in litigation and grounds for denying the aid of the court.\u201d <em>Clark v. Cambria Cnty. Bd. of Assessment Appeals, </em>747 A.2d 1242, 1245-46 (Pa.Commw.Ct.2000) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Clearly, then, the notions underlying champerty and maintenance focus on the person\u2019s acquisition of a specific interest in the litigation at hand. The history talks of \u201cstirring up litigation\u201d and \u201cspeculating in litigation.\u201d It is this type of speculation, then, where a lawyer obtains a financial interest in a case for the clear purpose of making money, that violates Rule 1.8(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In this regard, defending a child-support claim by a client\u2019s estranged spouse cannot fairly be described as \u201cinstigating\u201d or \u201cspeculating\u201d in litigation. The informal sharing of income and expenses between a romantic couple in the payment of child support is not equivalent to champerty because the living arrangement is not focused on, or motivated by, the litigation. Instead, the arrangement has different and broader general purposes relating to everyday life and how a couple decides to pay for their expenses. To the extent, therefore, that O\u2019Leary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u201cacquired an interest\u201d in Mr. Cosgrove\u2019s defense of his spouse\u2019s child support claim, it was only incidental to their mutual pursuit of an intimate living arrangement. It certainly was not an attempt by O\u2019Leary to instigate or speculate in dubious litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">To hold otherwise, as the Majority does, has broad implications for routine conduct that lawyers regularly engage in on behalf of family members and romantic partners. For example, if a lawyer\u2019s ailing father were to move in with him, and share income and expenses during some litigation against the father\u2019s health insurance company, which the lawyer was handling, he would \u201cacquire an interest\u201d in the litigation, presumably in violation of Rule 1.8(i). The same would be true if a lawyer were representing her brother in litigation, and she and her brother began living together, sharing expenses (including those of litigation) and income. A lawyer who was handling litigation for an adult child could also run afoul of Rule 1.8(i) if the child moved in with the lawyer, sharing expenses, during the litigation. Even without living with the client, if a lawyer were to be representing her father\u2019s company in litigation, and during that litigation, her father gave one-third of the company\u2019s stock to her, under the Majority opinion, she would be violating Rule 1.8 if she continued the representation because she \u201cacquire[d] a proprietary interest in the cause of action or subject matter of litigation!,.]\u201d In my view, there is no reason for this Court to be disciplining a lawyer for innocuous conduct of this type, that is, I submit, not uncommon among ethical private practitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">To justify its holding, the Majority cites, as significant, the fact that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">O\u2019Leary told Ms. Cosgrove that the amount of child support Ms. Cosgrove would be able to receive was related to payment of daycare services, stating to Ms. Cosgrove, while O\u2019Leary was providing care, at times, for the Cosgrove children: \u201cThe reason you qualify for child support is the daycare you pay.\u201d O\u2019Leary, thus, interjected her personal participation in caring for the children as a factor to advo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>cate for a reduction of Ms. Cosgrove\u2019s child support, in which O\u2019Leary had a financial interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Maj. Op. at 36, 69 A.3d at 1141. I wholeheartedly agree that Respondent should not have spoken to Ms. Cosgrove about the litigation because the latter was represented by opposing counsel, and Rule 4.2(a) prohibits such communication. <em>See </em>Rule 4.2(a) (set forth in Majority Opinion at FN 6).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Yet, the statement Respondent made does not invoke Rule 1.8(i) nor does it justify the Majority\u2019s comparison to the lawyer\u2019s conduct in <em>Computer Dynamics, Inc. v. Merrill, </em>252 B.R. 50 (E.D.Va.1997). In the latter case, the lawyer gave his client a hold harmless guarantee against liability for a pleading submitted by the lawyer, Merrill, in which he alleged, in a bankruptcy Chapter 11 proceeding, that the debtor-in-possession had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">committed acts of corporate malfeasance which demonstrate that he had been \u201cransacking\u201d the company and, <em>inter alia, </em>paid lavish personal expenses while refusing to pay employee withholding taxes and employee health insurance premiums. Merrill based those allegations on information imparted by former employees, who at trial did not support the allegations made of gross mismanagement by Starer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHe\"><em>Id. </em>at 59. The bankruptcy court concluded that the lawyer had \u201cassumed a personal interest in the litigation beyond the realm of propriety and lost all objectivity in the pursuit of the Motion and the Amended Motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">O\u2019Leary\u2019s statement that payment of daycare expenses could affect Ms. Cosgrove\u2019s entitlement to child support, in comparison, may well have been accurate, and was certainly not slanderous, or inflammatory, like Merrill\u2019s statements. In truth, amounts paid for daycare are a factor in determining the amount of child support. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1999, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 12\u2014204(g)(1) of the Family Law Article (\u201c[AJctual child care expenses incurred on behalf of a child due to employment or job search of either parent shall be added to the basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>obligation and shall be divided between the parents.... \u201d); <em>see also Lacy v. Arvin, </em>140 Md.App. 412, 431-33, 780 A.2d 1180, 1191-92 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Nor is O\u2019Leary\u2019s conduct comparable to that in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Harris, </em>371 Md. 510, 810 A.2d 457 (2002), also cited by the majority. The respondent\u2019s conduct in <em>Harris, </em>purchasing a client\u2019s home during a foreclosure sale while representing him in a bankruptcy action, was directly adverse to the client\u2019s interests in that the lawyer assumed control and ownership of the client\u2019s home. Nothing similar occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In sum, I agree with the Majority\u2019s decision with respect to the violations except its holding that Respondent violated Rule 1.8(i), a holding that has broad implications for practicing lawyers. For her violations of the charged rules other than Rule 1.8(i), I would impose an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Chief Judge BELL has authorized me to state he joins in this Opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-5\">.

Additionally, \u2018[t]he activity of champerty has long been considered repugnant to public policy against profiteering and speculating in litigation and grounds for denying the aid of the court.'
